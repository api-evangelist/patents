{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/639,139, filed on Dec. 16, 2009, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/139,090, filed Dec. 19, 2008, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The present invention relates to systems and methods for managing and offering services to networked devices.","The use of applications, commonly referred to as \u201capps,\u201d has become prevalent over the past few years. To meet this demand, several entities have developed services to enable users of mobile devices to download apps to such devices. For example, Apple, Inc. of Cupertino, Calif. offers an interface to permit apps to be uploaded from app developers and for users to search, select and possibly purchase apps for download to Apple devices. As part of this process, the company offers a software development kit (SDK) to developers for guidance on creating these apps, and the apps must be approved by Apple before being made available to users. In addition, Apple shares with the app developers the revenue that is generated by the downloads. Other companies, such as Google, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. and Research In Motion, Ltd., of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, also offer interfaces for developers to create and upload apps and for users to retrieve such software.","Thus, there are multiple companies that offer this service, and it is expected that the number of them doing so will increase. While this recent development has established a new platform for the delivery of software to a wide variety of mobile devices, general oversight of this process is lacking. This aspect can be particularly troublesome in an enterprise setting. For example, a company may be leery of allowing employees to access and download apps from these services onto its work devices because the employer has no control over the process. A similar concern exists in a personal or family environment because a parent will not have any control over his\/her child's activities in this area. In fact, supervisory authorities, like employers and parents, have very little control over mobile devices that are distributed to their subordinates.","As described herein, telephony and digital media services may be provided to a plurality of locations, such as to a plurality of homes and offices, though the deployment of telephony and digital media services devices to the locations, wherein each device is configured to function as a voice, data and media information center. A services platform in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention enables entities to deploy, manage optimize and monitor a network of such devices in a turnkey fashion.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the services platform is implemented on one or more computers and includes at least a device monitoring subsystem, a device management subsystem and a user interface. The device monitoring subsystem and the device management subsystem are each communicatively connected to a plurality of devices that provide telephony and digital media services to one or more end users. The device monitoring subsystem is operable to monitor each of the plurality of devices. The device management subsystem is operable to manage each of the plurality of devices. The user interface is communicatively connected to the services platform and is operable to provide access to functionality of at least one of the subsystems.","A managed services platform is also described herein. The platform can include a device management service (DMS) server in which the DMS server acts as a gateway for communications with one or more computing devices and the computing devices are associated with a first entity. The platform can also include an application service (AS) server in which the AS server is communicatively coupled with the DMS server. When a first computing device contacts the DMS server, the DMS server can be operable to provide a bundle to the first computing device. Providing a bundle can mean direct transmission of content to the first device, indirect transmission of content by directing a source to transmit such content to the first device, through messaging the first device to obtain or retrieve content from a source or any combination of these alternatives. In one arrangement, the bundle can contain content that at least includes one or more configuration messages and an application set that contains one or more predefined applications. The content of the bundle is determined at least in part by, for example, the first entity. In another arrangement, the first computing device can include a display, and the configuration messages can cause the display to present graphical user interface (GIU) elements that are associated with the first entity.","As an example, the application set can include a default application set that contains one or more default applications. The default application set can be selected from an application repository that is associated with the first entity. As another example, the application set can include a custom application set that includes one or more custom applications, which can also be from an application repository that is associated with the first entity.","The content of the bundle provided to the first computing device can be based on an identification associated with the first computing device. As an example, the identification associated with the first computing device can be a unique identifier assigned to the first computing device. In addition, the configuration commands or the application set can be provided to the first computing device according to the identification associated with the first computing device. In one arrangement, the identification associated with the first computing device can be related to a performance function of a first intended user of the first computing device such that the configuration commands or the application set that are provided to the first computing device are related to the performance function of the first intended user.","The DMS server can be further operable to provide a second bundle to a second computing device. This second bundle can contain content that at least includes one or more configuration messages and an application set that contains at least predefined applications. The content of the second bundle provided to the second computing device, like the first computing device, can be based on an identification associated with the second computing device such that the configuration messages or the application set are provided to the second computing device according to the identification associated with the second computing device. Also similar to the first computing device, the identification associated with the second computing device can be related to a performance function of a second intended user of the second computing device such that the configuration messages or the application set that are provided to the second computing device are related to the performance function of the second intended user. The performance function of the second intended user may be different from the performance function of an intended user of the first computing device. If so, the content of the bundle provided to the second computing device may be different from the content of the bundle provided to the first computing device.","The DMS server can be further operable to provide a default set of applications and a custom set of applications for both the first computing device and the second computing device. As an example, the default set of applications can be the same for both the first computing device and the second computing device. In contrast, the custom set of applications for the first computing device may be different from the custom set of applications for the second computing device, particularly if the performance functions of the users of such devices are different. The first intended user and the second intended user may be both associated with the first entity, although not necessarily so.","The first computing device can include a DMS client, and the first computing device can contact the DMS server through a consolidated polling technique, although communications between these components are not limited to such an arrangement. In any event, the bundle may be provided to the first computing device through a series of message exchanges using the consolidated polling technique.","In one particular arrangement but without limitation, the DMS server and the AS server can be hosted by a second entity that is distinct from the first entity. The second entity may be a managing entity that is responsible for preparing and providing the bundles according to input from the first entity.","In response to the receipt of the bundle, the first computing device can be provided with access to an application repository that is assigned to and associated with the first entity. The first device can also be provided with access to one or more other application repositories, which may be associated with the first entity or other entities, i.e., second entity, third entity, etc.","The content of the bundle provided to the first computing device can be based on an identification associated with the first computing device, and the DMS server can be further operable to provide a second bundle to the computing device based on the identification associated with the first computing device. For example, a first user and a second user can be both assigned to the first computing device, and the first computing device can provide an identification for both the first user and the second user of the first computing device. The content of the bundle can be arranged for the first user, and the content of the second bundle can be arranged for the second user. As an example, the first user and the second user can both be associated with the first entity.","A method of managing services for a first client is also described herein. The method can include the steps of receiving an activation notice in which the activation notice is from a first computing device that is associated with the first client and in response to the receipt of the activation notice, providing a bundle to the first computing device. The method can also include the steps of maintaining an application repository that is associated with the first client and presenting the application repository to the first computing device based on an identification of the first computing device.","In one embodiment, the bundle can contain content that at least includes one or more configuration messages and an application set that contains one or more predefined applications. The application set can include a default application set or a custom application set, and the default application set can contain one or more default applications from the application repository. In contrast, the custom application set can contain one or more custom applications from the application repository. In another embodiment, the first computing device can include a display, and the configuration messages are arranged to cause the display to present graphical user interface (GUI) elements that are associated with the first client.","As an example, providing the bundle to the first computing device further includes providing the bundle to the first computing device based on the identification of the first computing device. The identification of the first computing device can be related to, for example, a performance function of a first intended user of the first computing device. Thus, providing the bundle to the first computing device further includes providing the bundle to the first computing device such that the content of the bundle is related to the performance function of the first intended user. The bundle provided to the first computing device can include a first default application set or a first custom application set. The first default application set or the first custom application set can be based on the performance function of the first intended user.","The method can further include the step of receiving a second activation notice in which the second activation notice is from a second computing device that is associated with the first client. In response to the receipt of the second activation notice, a second bundle can be provided to the second computing device. The options for providing a second bundle to a second computing device can be similar to that described above in relation to the first computing device. The method can also include the step of presenting the application repository to the second computing device based on an identification of the second computing device.","As an example, providing the second bundle to the second computing device can further include providing the second bundle to the second computing device based on the identification of the second computing device. The identification of the second computing device can be related to a performance function of a second intended user of the second computing device. Moreover, providing the second bundle to the second computing device can further include providing the second bundle to the second computing device such that the content of the second bundle is related to the performance function of the second intended user. The content of the second bundle for the second computing device may be different from the content of the bundle for the first computing device if the performance function of the second intended user is different from the performance function of the first intended user.","In one embodiment, the second bundle provided to the second computing device can include a second default application set or a second custom application set, and the second default application set or the second custom application set can be based on the performance function of the second intended user. The default application set for the second computing device can be the same as the first default application set for the first computing device. Additionally, the second custom application set for the second computing device may be different from the first custom application set if the performance function of the second intended user is different from the performance function of the first intended user. The first intended user and the second intended user may be both associated with the first client, although not necessarily so.","Providing the bundle to the first computing device at least partly comprises providing the bundle to the first computing device through, for example, a series of messages exchanges using a consolidated polling technique. It is understood, however, that other communication methods can be used.","The activation notice can be received by a DMS server and the application repository is maintained by an AS server. The DMS server and the AS server can be hosted by an entity that is different from the first client. As an example, the entity that hosts the DMS server and the AS server can provide the bundle as a service for the first client in which the first client provides input to the entity for the bundle.","The method can also include the step of receiving a second activation notice from the first computing device. In response to the receipt of the second activation notice, a second bundle can be provided to the first computing device. It can be determined that a first user and a second user are both assigned to the first computing device. As such, the bundle can be sent to the first computing device for the first user, and the second bundle can be sent to the second computing device for the second user. The first user can have a first performance function, and the second user can have a second performance function. In one arrangement, the content of the bundle can be related to the first performance function of the first user and the content of the second bundle can be related to the second performance function of the second user. The content of the bundle may be different from the content of the second bundle if the first performance function of the first user is different from the second performance function on the second user. As an example, the first user and the second user may be both associated with the first client, although not necessarily so.","Another managed services platform is described herein. The platform can have a DMS server in which the DMS server is a gateway for communications with one or more computing devices. The computing devices may be associated with a first client. This platform can also include an AS server that is communicatively coupled with the DMS server. When one of the computing devices is activated, the DMS server can be operable to flash the activated first computing device to cause the first computing device to incorporate, for example, a GUI layout that is associated with the first client. The AS server is also operable to maintain an application repository that includes at least applications that are associated with and at least partially determined by the first client. The activated first computing device can be provided with access to these applications.","A second computing device may be activated, and the second computing device can be associated with a second client. The DMS server can be operable to flash the activated second computing device to cause the second computing device to incorporate a GUI layout that is associated with the second client. Further, the AS server can be operable to maintain an application repository that includes at least applications that are associated with and at least partially determined by the second client. The activated second computing device is provided with access to the applications.","In one arrangement, in addition to the first managed services platform, a second managed services platform is described herein. The second platform can include a second DMS server in which the second DMS server can be a gateway for communications with one or more second computing devices and the second computing devices are associated with a second client. The second platform can also include a second AS server that is communicatively coupled with the second DMS server. When one of the second computing devices is activated, the second DMS server can be operable to flash the activated second computing device to cause the second computing device to incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) layout that is associated with the second client. The second AS server can be operable to maintain a second application repository that includes at least applications that are associated with and at least partially determined by the second client. The activated second computing device can be provided with access to the applications of the second application repository. There can be any suitable number of managed services platforms for servicing any suitable number of portable computing devices. The first managed services platform or the second managed services platform can be hosted by, for example, a managing entity that is distinct from the first client and the second client.","A method of managing services is described herein. The method can include the step of receiving a first activation notice from a first computing device that is associated with a first client. In response to the receipt of the first activation notice, one or more configuration messages can be transmitted, and these messages can be arranged to cause the first computing device to incorporate a GUI layout that is associated with the first client. The method can also include the step of maintaining an application repository that includes at least applications that are associated with and at least partially determined by the first client. The activated first computing device is provided with access to the applications. A second activation notice can be received from a second computing device that is associated with a second client. In response to the receipt of the second activation notice, one or more configuration messages can be transmitted, and the messages can be arranged to cause the second computing device to incorporate a GUI layout that is associated with the second client. The method can also include the step of maintaining another application repository that includes at least applications that are associated with and at least partially determined by the second client. The activated second computing device can be provided with access to the applications.","A computer program product is also described herein. The computer program product can include a computer readable storage medium having stored thereon computer readable program code. When executed by a system including a processor and a memory, the computer readable program code can cause the system to receive an activation notice in which the activation notice is from a first computing device that is associated with the first client. In response to the receipt of the activation notice, the code can cause the system to further provide a bundle to the first computing device and maintain an application repository that is associated with the first client. The code can further cause the system to present the application repository to the first computing device based on an identification of the first computing device.","A portable computing device is also described herein. The device can include a display that is configured to display GUI elements that are associated with a client and a transceiver that is configured to communicate with a managed services platform. The device can also include a processor that is communicatively coupled to both the display and the transceiver. The processor is operable to instruct the transceiver to transmit an activation notice to the managed services platform and in response to the activation notice, receive from the managed services platform a first bundle that is associated with the client and that is arranged to cause the display to display GUI elements that are associated with the client. The first bundle can include predefined applications in which the content of the first bundle can be determined at least in part by the client.","In this context, receiving a first bundle from the managed services platform can refer to several different alternatives. For example, content of the bundle can be directly received from the managed services platform or indirectly from another component under the direction or assistance of the managed services platform. As another example, the managed services platform can direct the portable computing device to retrieve or obtain content from a source. Content of the bundle can also be delivered to the portable computing device in accordance with any combination of these alternatives or other suitable techniques. In one embodiment, the predefined applications can be selected from an application repository that is associated with the client, although not necessarily so.","The activation notice can include an identification that is unique to the portable computing device. At least some of the content of the first bundle can be based on the identification of the portable computing device. In one arrangement, the identification of the portable computing device can be related to a performance function of an intended user of the portable computing device such that at least some of the content of the first bundle is related to the performance function. In another arrangement, responsive to the receipt of the first bundle, the portable computing device can be configured to gain access to an application repository that is associated with the client.","The processor can be further operable to switch between a first account associated with a first user and a second account associated with a second user. Here, the first bundle can be assigned to the first account, and the processor can be further operable to, in response to a second activation notice associated with the second account, receive a second bundle assigned to the second account. The content of the first bundle assigned to the first account can be related to a first performance function, and the content of the second bundle is related to a second performance function. As an example, the first user and the second user may be both associated with the client.","In one arrangement, the portable computing device can be configured to communicate with the managed services platform through the use of a consolidated polling technique. It is understood however, that other techniques may be employed to effect such a communication.","A method of operating a portable computing device is also described herein. The method can include the steps of transmitting an activation notice to a managed services platform and in response to the activation notice, receiving from the managed services platform a first bundle that is associated with a client. In response to the receipt of the first bundle, GUI elements that are associated with a client can be displayed. The first bundle includes predefined applications, and the content of the first bundle is determined at least in part by the client. As an option, the predefined applications of the first bundle can be from an application repository that is associated with the client.","Transmitting an activation notice to the managed services platform can further include transmitting an identification that is unique to the portable computing device. In addition, at least some of the content of the first bundle can be based on the identification of the portable computing device. In one particular arrangement, the identification of the portable computing device can be related to a performance function of an intended user of the portable computing device such that at least some of the content of the first bundle is related to the performance function. Responsive to the receipt of the first bundle, access to an application repository that is associated with the client can be gained or permitted.","The method can further include the step of switching between a first account associated with a first user and a second account associated with a second user in which the first bundle can be assigned to the first account. In response to a second activation notice associated with the second account, a second bundle can be received in which the second bundle can be assigned to the second account. The content of the first bundle assigned to the first account can be related to a first performance function, and the content of the second bundle can be related to a second performance function. As an example but without limitation, the first user and the second user can be both associated with the client.","In one arrangement, communications with the managed services platform can be conducted through a consolidated polling technique. It is understood, however, that other suitable techniques for communications with the platform are within contemplation here.","Another method of operating a portable computing device is described herein. This method can include the steps of receiving the portable computing device based on an assigned performance function and transmitting an activation notice from the portable computing device to a managed services platform. For example, a company may assign the computing device to one of its employees who has a particular job function, and the employee may then cause an activation notice to be transmitted from the computing device. The method can also include the step of receiving\u2014from the managed services platform\u2014a first bundle that can be associated with a client (e.g., the employee) and that can be related to the assigned performance function. In response to the receipt of the first bundle, GUI elements that are associated with the client can be displayed. As an example, the client may assign the performance function. In addition, the first bundle may include predefined applications, and the content of the first bundle can be determined at least in part by the client based on the performance function.","A computer program product is also described herein. The computer program product can be a computer readable storage medium having stored thereon computer readable program code. When executed by a system including a processor and a memory, the computer readable program code can cause the system to transmit an activation notice to a managed services platform and in response to the activation notice, receive from the managed services platform a first bundle that is associated with a client. In response to the receipt of the first bundle, the program code can also cause the system to display GUI elements that are associated with a client. The first bundle may include predefined applications, and the content of the first bundle can be determined at least in part by the client.","A system for approving applications is also described herein. The system can include a first computing device that can be configured to present a first interface to permit application developers to submit applications for approval for selective publication in a first application repository associated with a first client and a second application repository associated with a second client. The system can also include a second computing device that can be communicatively coupled to the first computing device. The second computing device can be configured to present a second interface to permit the approval of submitted applications for the selective publication in the first application repository and the second application repository. If a submitted application is approved, the second computing device can be configured to notify the first computing device that the submitted application has been approved.","The first computing device can be further configured to enable the upload of applications prior to being submitted for approval. In addition, the first computing device can be further configured to present an uploaded application and information associated with the uploaded application. As an example, the information includes one or more of the following items: an application name; a language type; a category; a version; a rating; a licensing model; or a transaction price. The first computing device can be further configured to enable the selection of the information prior to the uploaded application being submitted for approval. In one arrangement, the first computing device can be further configured to push the uploaded application to or pull the uploaded application from a testing device.","The second computing device can be further configured to enable a user to permit the rejection of a submitted application. In addition, the second computing can be further configured to notify the first computing device when the submitted application has been rejected.","The first computing device can be further configured to present one or more of the submitted applications. In one arrangement, the submitted applications can be assigned a status indicator at the first computing device that provides information as to the stage of review for approval for a submitted application. For example, once an application is submitted for approval, the status indicator can indicate the submitted application as being in a pending state. As another example, once a submitted application is approved for publication, the status indicator can indicate the approved application as being in an approved state. In yet another example, once an approved application is published in either the first application repository or the second application repository, the status indicator can indicate the published application as being in a published state. Conversely, if a submitted application is rejected for approval for publication, the status indicator may indicate the submitted application as being rejected. In addition, if an application has been upgraded, the status indicator may indicate the application as being upgraded. The upgraded application can be a submitted application, a published application or a rejected application.","The first computing device can be further configured to provide performance data relating to a submitted application once the application is published in the first application repository or the second application repository. In addition, the first computing device can be further configured to provide cumulative performance data relating to a plurality of published applications in the first application repository or the second application repository. As an option, the first computing device can be further configured to selectively isolate performance data relating to submitted applications such that access to such performance data is restricted. This can prevent sensitive data from being seen by unauthorized individuals, for example.","The second computing device, in one arrangement, can be further configured to receive the submitted application, and the second interface can enable the selection of an approval indicator or a rejection indicator. If the submitted application is approved, the second computing device may notify the first computing device of the approval of the submitted application upon the selection of the approval indicator. The second computing device can be further configured to notify the first computing device of the rejection of a submitted application upon the selection of the rejection indicator. As another option, the second computing device can be further configured to provide the first computing device with rejection information when notifying the first computing device of the rejection of the submitted application.","The second computing device can be further configured to present the submitted application and to provide information associated with the submitted application. The following items are examples of such information: an application name; a language type; a category; a version; a rating; a licensing model; or a transaction price.","In one arrangement, the second computing device can be further configured to push the submitted application to or pull the submitted application from a testing device. The second computing device can be further configured to notify a third computing device that the submitted application has been approved. The third computing device can be configured to notify operators of the first application repository and the second application repository of the approval of the submitted application.","A method for approving applications is also described herein. The method can include the step of presenting a first interface to permit application developers to submit applications for approval for selective publication in a first application repository associated with a first client and a second application repository associated with a second client. The method can also include the steps of presenting a second interface to permit the approval of submitted applications for the selective publication in the first application repository and the second application repository. If a submitted application is approved, the application developer can be notified that the submitted application has been approved.","The method can further include the steps of enabling the upload of applications prior to being submitted for approval and presenting an uploaded application and information associated with the uploaded application.

The method can also include the step of enabling the selection of the information prior to the uploaded application being submitted for approval.","One or more of the applications can be tested. As such, the method can include the steps of pushing the uploaded application to a testing device or pulling the uploaded application from a testing device.","In another arrangement, the method can include the steps of enabling a user to permit the rejection of a submitted application and notifying the application developer that the submitted application has been rejected. The method can also include the steps of presenting one or more of the submitted applications and assigning a status indicator to the presented submitted applications. In particular, the status indicator can provide information as to the stage of review for approval for a submitted application. For example, once an application is submitted for approval, assigning a status indicator can include assigning a status indicator to the submitted application that indicates that the application is in a pending state. As another example, once a submitted application is approved for publication, assigning a status indicator can include assigning a status indicator to the approved application that indicates that the application is in an approved state. In yet another example, once an approved application is published in either the first application repository or the second application repository, assigning a status indicator can include assigning a status indicator to the published application that indicates that the application is in a published state.","There are several other examples to consider. Specifically, if a submitted application is rejected for approval for publication, assigning a status indicator can include assigning a status indicator that indicates that the submitted application is in a rejected state. If an application has been upgraded, assigning a status indicator can include assigning a status indicator that indicates that the application is upgraded. The upgraded application can be a submitted application, a published application or a rejected application.","The method can also include the step of providing performance data relating to a submitted application once the application is published in the first application repository or the second application repository.

As an example, the submitted application may be approved, and a notification of the approval of the submitted application can be provided upon the selection of the approval indicator. As another example, a notification of the rejection of a submitted application can be provided upon the selection of the rejection indicator. Providing a notification of the rejection of the submitted application can include providing rejection information when providing notification of the rejection of the submitted application.

In an implementation in which the devices and handsets are VoIP devices, the adapter unit may allow a user to define a numbering plan (e.g., 4-digit extensions) and assign numbers to the devices. If DECT is used for communication with the devices, then single-digit identifiers may instead be used due to limitations associated with that protocol. The adapter unit may also be configured to allow a user to assign an owner to a device, wherein the association of an owner with a device may cause other items of information to be associated with the device.

The embedded processor is preferably one that has been designed for use in portable and low-power applications, such as Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs). The system controller hub comprises a chipset that handles peripheral input\/output (I\/O) and performs memory and power management functions for the embedded processor. In one embodiment, the embedded processor comprises a 1.1 Gigahertz (GHz) Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 processor designed and sold by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., and the system controller hub comprises the Intel\u00ae System Controller Hub US15W Chipset, also designed and sold by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., although this is only one example; other processors can be implemented into the architecture .","As shown in , hardware architecture  includes volatile system memory in the form of SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory) . In one embodiment, the embedded processor supports an integral 64-bit-wide 4-Gigabits (Gbits) of DDR2 (Double Data Rate 2) SDRAM clocked at 533 Megahertz (MHz). In such an embodiment, SDRAM  may comprise four 512 Megabit (Mbit) DDR2 SDRAM 667 MHz integrated circuits (ICs) directly mounted onto a motherboard along with embedded processor and system controller hub . The capacity may be increased from 512 Megabytes (MB) to 1 gigabyte (GB) by populating the board with four 1 Gbit ICs instead. However, these are only examples, and other DDR2 SDRAM configurations, other types of SDRAM, or other types of volatile memory may be used.","Hardware architecture  also includes non-volatile memory in the form of a managed NAND flash memory , although other forms of non-volatile memory may be used. In one embodiment, managed NAND flash memory  comprises a 512 MB or 1 GB MMC NAND flash memory that is mounted on a motherboard along with embedded processor and system controller hub . The use of an MMC NAND flash memory avoids the inclusion in device  of spinning media storage devices, such as hard disk drives or optical drives. The use of an MMC NAND flash memory also means that it is not necessary to employ wear-leveling and error correction when using a file system such as YAFFS2 and that an EXT3 file system can be used instead.","Hardware architecture  further includes a chip  for storing the system BIOS. In one embodiment, chip  comprises an 8 Mbit NOR flash memory that is connected to the system controller hub via a Low Pin Count (LPC) bus, although this is only an example.","Power management functions are performed in hardware architecture  by a power management chip . In one embodiment, power management chip  comprises an Intel\u00ae Mobile Voltage Positioning chip designed and sold by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. that is connected to embedded processor and system controller hub  via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (IC) bus. Power management chip  is used to sequence power to embedded processor and system controller hub . As a secondary function, a subset of a plurality of general purpose input\/output (GPIO) connections of power management chip  are used to connect to a Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interface of a DECT processor  (to be described below). This enables updating of the firmware of DECT processor  in a manner that minimizes the likelihood that the firmware will be left in an unrecoverable state.","Hardware architecture  also includes a DECT processor . In one embodiment, DECT processor  comprises a DECT base station processor that supports up to five handsets. In an implementation in which DECT processor  has no explicit hardware reset input, a GPIO connection from the embedded processor may be used to reset the device by turning its power supply off and then on again.","A Universal Serial Bus (USB) is used to transfer audio (e.g., up to four channels of audio) in each direction between DECT processor  and the system controller hub. DECT processor  may be configured to act as the bus master and drive the USB bus. In an implementation in which the maximum speed of the USB bus is 4.096 MHz, DECT processor  may drive the USB bus with a bit clock rate of 2.048 MHz.","In one embodiment, universal asynchronous receivers\/transmitters (UARTS) on the system controller hub and DECT processor  implement a 115200 baud channel that is used to transfer control and data packets between the two. Packets on this link are encapsulated using Serial Line IP (SLIP) (as documented in Request for Comments: 1055, published by the Internet Engineering Task Force, June 1988). Layered on top of this is a cordless telephone application programming interface (CTAPI) protocol. The CTAPI protocol comprises request, response and event message types. These message types all have a common header and, optionally, some data. Responses and events are asynchronous; each request is tagged with a sufficiently unique identifier that is copied into a header of the corresponding response. The identifier is used to match responses with their originating requests.","To perform an API operation (e.g., obtain firmware version number, go off-hook, update handset name, etc.), a main application running on the embedded processor sends a request message to DECT processor  or to one of handsets  via DECT processor . The message recipient performs the requested actions and returns a response. Additionally, a spontaneous action such as a handset going off-hook or propagating a name or address book update can generate an event message to be sent from DECT processor  to the embedded processor.","In one embodiment, DECT processor  is configured to execute acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) software. In accordance with such an embodiment, a microphone and speakers  internal to device  are connected directly to DECT processor  whenever speakerphone functionality of device  is in use.

In such an embodiment, audio codec  connects to embedded processor and system controller hub  via an HDA bus.","A stereo jack may be provided on device  for connecting headphones or an external amplifier and speakers to audio codec . In one embodiment, when a plug is inserted into this jack, the internal speakers are automatically disconnected and their amplifier is powered down. The state of this jack may be determined by software.","As described above in reference to , device  includes an LCD display . As shown in , LCD display  connects to embedded processor and system controller hub  via a low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) connection over twisted pair copper cables. In one example implementation, LCD display  comprises a thin film transistor (TFT) LCD display that has a 7 inch (17.8 centimeter (cm)) wide screen and supports 24-bit color. LCD display  may provide an active viewing area of 152.4 millimeters (mm)\u00d791.4 mm, support a pixel format of 800\u00d7480 pixels, and have a pixel pitch of 0.1805 (H)\u00d701.905 (V). LCD display  may further provide a 15:9 aspect ratio, a display mode that is normally white, LED backlighting, and a brightness of approximately 350 candelas per square meter (cd\/m).","In an embodiment, LCD display  may be used in both a transmissive mode and a reflective mode. In accordance with such an embodiment, a color display may be used when in the transmissive mode and a very low-power monochrome display may be used when in the reflective mode. In further accordance with such an embodiment, the LCD backlight for the transmissive mode may be provided by white light emitting diodes (LEDs). In particular, multiple LEDs may be connected in series into three chains in order to equalize their brightness. These chains may then be powered in parallel. LEDs from all three chains may be interleaved to minimize the impact of a single chain burning out. In one implementation, up to 60 milliamps (mA) of current at 25.6 Volts (V) is provided to drive the backlight. Two signals may be used to control the backlight operation. The first signal enables\/disables the backlight and the second signal is pulse-width modulated to generate a voltage that varies the brightness of the backlight.","As also described above in reference to , a touch panel is integrated with LCD display  to provide a user interface to device . The touch panel includes an integrated programmable system on chip (PSOC) controller  that is connected to embedded processor and system controller hub  via a USB bus.","In one embodiment, the touch panel comprises a 7 inch capacitive touch panel having a glass surface. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), capacitive touch panels are highly responsive to the touch of a finger, but do not respond to other types of touches. Consequently, the use of such a panel reduces the chance of false touches from jewelry, clothing or other contaminants. Furthermore, it is expected that such a glass capacitive touch panel will be more durable and last longer than other types of touch panels such as resistive touch panels. A glass capacitive touch panel will also have less of an impact on screen brightness as compared to resistive touch panels.","Hardware architecture  further includes an internal Wi-Fi controller  for supporting wireless networking. Wi-Fi controller  is connected to embedded processor and system controller hub  via a USB interface. In one embodiment, Wi-Fi controller  comprises an 802.11b\/g controller.

Where an application provides digital media services, such services may be provided using functionality and\/or data stored locally with respect to device  as well as using remotely-located functionality and\/or data, such as functionality and\/or data obtained over a WAN such as the Internet. For example, provision of a digital media service may entail invoking a Web service via the Internet.","As shown in , these applications may include a status\/monitoring application , an application (app) manager , a VoIP telephone , a local or network calendar , a YouTube\u2122 application , a traffic monitoring application , a news application , an alarm clock , and other applications .","Other applications  may include for example, a calculator, a local or network address book, a media player, an Internet radio\/video application, a weather application, a comics application, a to-do list application, a world clocks application, a countdown timer (e.g., days until Christmas), a games application (e.g., solitaire, Soduko, Tetris, etc.), a Web browser, an e-mail application, a city guide application, a wireless cameras application, a home monitoring application, a home control application (e.g. lights, audio\/video (A\/V) system, HVAC, UPnP), a Flickr\u2122 photos application, a Google\u2122 talk application, a map application, a directory services\/yellow pages application, an EPG (TV Guide) application, a word of the day application, a joke of the day application, a quotations application, a dictionary application, a movie times application, a delivery services application, an RSS reader, a stock ticker, or a social networking application, such as a Ning\u2122 or Facebook\u2122 application. Various features associated with certain ones of these applications will be described in more detail herein.","The use of Flash\u00ae applications to implement the various GUI screens of device  provides distinct advantages over using more traditional programming languages such as C or C++. For example, development of GUI screens using Flash\u00ae is simpler and easier as compared to programming bit maps in C code. Furthermore, because Flash\u00ae files are small, a complex GUI screen may be rendered smoothly and at very high speeds. Also the use of Flash\u00ae applications provides a distinct separation between the implementation of a GUI screen and the underlying functionality, such that the GUI screen may be constructed, revised or upgraded without affecting underlying programs.","II.D.1 Systems Software",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0427","num":"0426"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","110","1300","1302","1304","1306","1308","1310"]},"BIOS  defines a software interface between the operating system and the platform firmware and hardware of device . BIOS  is stored in non-volatile memory that is connected to a system controller hub within device  and is executed automatically at system startup. In one embodiment, BIOS  is stored in an 8 Mbit NOR flash memory that is connected to the system controller hub via an LPC bus.","In one implementation, BIOS  comprises a software interface defined in accordance with the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specification. As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), EFI comprises an improved replacement of the legacy BIOS used by all IBM PC-compatible computers. EFI has a modular structure that provides a set of modular interfaces that replace the traditional BIOS interfaces. EFI dramatically shortens boot times and improves the reliability of the boot architecture while providing full legacy support.","In an embodiment, BIOS  may also be thought of as encompassing a video BIOS. The video BIOS provides a set of video-related functions that are used by programs to access video hardware within device . The video BIOS may comprise for example an Intel\u00ae Embedded Graphics Driver (IEGD) video BIOS, developed and sold by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., although this is only an example.","In one embodiment of the present invention, BIOS  outputs a splash screen to the display of device  during system startup. In a further embodiment, system hardware allows a video feed to be overlaid upon the splash screen prior to initialization of a graphic sub-system. In such an embodiment, the video feed functionality may be used to overlay a visual progress indicator upon the splash screen during system startup. The visual progress indicator may comprise a status bar, text, or some other visual indicator of the progress of the loading of BIOS  and booting of the operating system. This visual progress indicator can advantageously be used both by developers during manufacturing and end-users after deployment to monitor device performance. Such a visual progress indicator can be displayed even in an instance where initialization of the graphic sub-system has failed.","Boot loader  comprises a program that is launched by BIOS  during system startup and that is configured to load operating system  of device . As noted above, in one embodiment, operating system  comprises a Linux-based operating system, such as an Ubuntu\u00ae MID Edition operating system based on Linux kernel release 2.6.24, that has been optimized through custom configuration for a small size and rapid startup.","Boot loader  and the files that comprise operating system  are each stored within a file system  implemented using non-volatile storage. In one embodiment, the non-volatile storage comprises a managed NAND flash memory that is connected to a system controller hub within device .","In one implementation, file system  comprises two distinct file systems: a Virtual File Allocation Table (VFAT) file system that is used to store boot loader  and an EXT3 file system that is used to store operating system files and application files. A VFAT file system may be required for storing boot loader  in an implementation in which BIOS  comprises an EFI BIOS that can only read files from a VFAT file system.","In order to ensure system operability, in a further embodiment, a fail-safe version of the operating system kernel is stored in the VFAT file system while another updateable version of the operating system kernel is stored in the EXT3 file system. The fail-safe version of the operating system and boot loader  are not updateable (or are only updateable in a highly restricted manner), thereby providing a means for starting up the system even when the updateable version of the operating system kernel is corrupted (e.g., due to a failed update). In such a case, the fail-safe version of the operating system can be booted from the VFAT file system and can load its file system from VFAT into volatile memory (e.g., SDRAM) and run out of the volatile memory. This allows for files in the EXT3 file system to be repaired without fear of overwriting the kernel. This approach also allows for diagnostic testing and the establishment of a network connection to a known server to download the latest stable version of the system firmware (operating system and applications).","In one embodiment, boot loader  selects the fail-safe kernel instead of the updateable kernel image based on a flag stored in non-volatile storage, which as noted above may comprise a managed NAND flash memory. This flag may be set to select the fail-safe kernel by a process monitor daemon when the process monitor daemon determines that the operating system has been in an unresponsive state for a period of time that equals or exceeds a predetermined period of time. The flag may also be set to select the fail-safe kernel when the system first boots and may be reset to select the updateable kernel upon successful startup of the operating system and process monitor daemon. If the system fails to boot, then a subsequent attempt to boot will force the fail-safe kernel image to boot.","In an embodiment in which the non-volatile memory comprises a managed NAND flash memory, certain features may be implemented to ensure that the EXT3 file system is written to as seldom as possible in order to extend the useful life of the managed NAND flash memory. These features may include, for example, configuring applications that access the EXT3 file system to ensure that such applications do not frequently write files to the file system and configuring the length of a journaling interval of the EXT3 file system so that the lifetime of the managed NAND flash memory will extend beyond the expected lifetime of device . Another feature that may be used to extend the life of the managed NAND flash memory comprises turning off a feature of the EXT3 file system that records the last access time of a file. These features are provided by way of example, and other features not described here may be used to extend the life of the managed NAND flash memory.","System files  comprise shared libraries that contain code and data that may be used to provide services to independent programs running in the context of operating system . In an embodiment, the number of system files  maintained on the system is kept to a minimum to conserve system resources. Such files may be stored in an EXT3 file system as described above and updated or added to as needed to support system and application programs.","In one implementation, BIOS , boot loader , operating system  and system files  are all updateable. As noted above, restrictions may be placed on updating boot loader  and a fail-safe version of operating system  that reside in a VFAT filing system in order to ensure that those software modules do not become corrupted. Safe updates of BIOS  may be achieved by maintaining separate version of BIOS  within the same non-volatile memory, such that a first version of BIOS  can be updated while a second version of BIOS  may be maintained in case the update of the first version of BIOS  fails, thereby resulting in the corruption of the first version.","II.D.2 Application Framework","As will be described in more detail in this section, the software architecture of device  provides a framework that supports a variety of applications, including applications that delivery telephony and digital media services to an end user. To ensure that device  may be deployed by a variety of different service providers (e.g., telecommunications companies, multi system operators, Internet Service Providers, or the like), the application framework supports multiple GUI themes and languages, proprietary protocols, and incremental deployment of applications. The application framework also provides an infrastructure within which a variety of different applications can operate and co-exist without any preconceived notion of what those applications may be. For example, although device  may support VoIP telephony, device  may nevertheless be deployed without a VoIP telephony application.","The application framework also provides a modular approach for deploying applications such that a common set of application can be deployed for different service providers. Application deployment models supported by the framework include subscription models in which a user of device  determines at runtime which applications are to be installed as well as a model in which a static set of applications are deployed that are updated monolithically. Because multiple applications may be deployed, each of which may generate asynchronous events, the application framework also provides a method for synchronizing applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0442","num":"0441"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 12","FIG. 14","FIG. 12"],"b":["1400","110","1400","1402","1208","1402","1402","1406","1230","1406","1406"]},"As shown in , class modules  may include an application manager class module , an internationalization class module , a status\/monitoring class module , a VoIP class module , a YouTube\u2122 class module , as well as other class modules.

In one embodiment, the list contains sets of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that identify an icon movie and application movie corresponding to each application. Application manager  can then display each application icon accordingly via the GUI provided by touch-panel display of device . When a user selects an icon, application manager  invokes the corresponding application URL.

Watermark layer  is optional and is reserved for a branding statement that is viewable via transparent application layers. Above that, theme layer  serves as a container in which theme movie  is loaded. Splash screen layer  is visible during initialization time. Once theme movie  has been loaded, splash screen layer  becomes transparent. Splash screen layer  may contain minimal graphical assets.","One purpose of theme movie  is to provide a vehicle by which a service provider deploying device  can customize the look and feel of the GUI of device . Theme movie  consists of four layers as illustrated in : an icon layer , an application layer , a status bar layer  and a screen saver layer . Icon layer  is used to present small graphic representations of the various applications that are available on device . Each icon presented within icon layer  itself comprises a movie. Application layer  is reserved for the application movies that are executed by application player . Within this layer, multiple applications can be stacked. When a user selects an icon, the corresponding application is launched by pushing it onto the application layer stack, hiding icon layer . When the application stack is emptied, icon layer  becomes visible again. Status bar layer  is used to display common information such as titles, navigational buttons and date\/time. Screen saver layer  may optionally be overlaid on the other three layers when device  has been active for some period of time. The conditions under which screen saver layer  is displayed and the content of the layer may be configurable by a user.","The foregoing application framework further provides common components for alerts, keyboards, a movie player, options, and a photo viewer. Applications may interact with these components via ActionScript listener objects.","II.D.2.a Application Interaction","With continued reference to , when a user launches an application, the application is granted focus and is thus presented in application layer  hiding the lower icon layer . Thus, when an application is running, icon movies continue to run in icon layer  although they are hidden. In one implementation of application framework , a user must exit an active application in order to execute another application. This approach may be deemed suitable for a majority of use cases. However, there are certain scenarios that may require a different approach. For example, consider the case in which an asynchronous network event arrives at a class module , but the Flash\u00ae movie corresponding to the class module is not active.","As a specific example, assume that a YouTube\u2122 application is active at the time an incoming telephone call arrives at VoIP class module . Desired behavior may be that the YouTube\u2122 application would be paused, a VoIP telephone application would be instantiated on the GUI foreground, and a user would be allowed to answer or ignore the telephone call. If the user chose to answer the call, then the telephone application would remain active. However, if the user chose to ignore the call, then the telephone application would be dismissed and the YouTube application would regain focus and automatically resume.","To implement this behavior, an embodiment of the invention espouses a solution that allows a class module  to surface an asynchronous event during a period when its corresponding application movie is not active. In accordance with this embodiment, each icon movie associated with an application is required to register an event listener with its corresponding class module. When an asynchronous event is raised by the class module, the corresponding icon movie is notified directly. Subsequently, the icon movie requests that application manager  launch the application represented by the icon movie\u2014for example, the icon movie may request that application manager  launch a specified application URL. Prior to executing the URL, a function of the currently-active application is called (which may be denoted \u201con FocusOut\u201d) to allow the currently-active application to take action (e.g., pausing a movie). Next, application manager  launches the URL and the corresponding application (\u201cthe event application\u201d) is displayed in the foreground. During initialization, the trigger event is passed to the event application as a means to communicate context. When the event application is eventually dismissed, a function associated with the underlying inactive application (which may be denoted \u201con FocusIn\u201d) is called to allow that application to take further action (e.g., resume playback of a movie).","The foregoing process will now be described in reference to a specific example process  illustrated in . As shown in , the process begins at step  when a phone class module  notifies a corresponding phone icon movie  of an asynchronous event\u2014namely, an incoming telephone call. As discussed above, phone icon movie  previously registered an event listener with phone class module  that makes such notification possible.","At step , responsive to being notified of the event, phone icon movie  requests that application manager  launch the appropriate application for handling the event, which in this case is an incoming call application . Requesting that application manager  launch incoming call application  may comprise requesting that application manager  launch a specified URL associated with incoming call application .","Prior to launching incoming call application , application manager  places a function call to a currently-active YouTube\u2122 application  as shown at step . This function call is denoted \u201con FocusOut\u201d in . Placement of this function call allows YouTube\u2122 application  to take some action in advance of launching of incoming call application . This action may comprise, for example, pausing playback of a movie or some other action.","At step , after placing the on FocusOut function call, application manager  launches incoming call application  (for example, by launching a specified URL associated with the application) and passes the incoming call event to application  for appropriate handling. At this point, the interface for incoming call application  is overlaid on top of YouTube\u2122 application interface in application layer  of theme movie . This is depicted in , which shows incoming call application  and YouTube\u2122 application  executing at different Z orders within application layer . The call application  interface may allow the user to perform a variety of actions, including answering the incoming call or ignoring the incoming call. Answering the call may cause yet another application to be launched to perform necessary functions or the necessary functions may be handled exclusively by incoming call application  depending upon the implementation.","In process , it is assumed that the user chooses to ignore the call through some form of interaction with a GUI of incoming call application  or through inaction. In this case, the fact that the call was ignored  is reported from incoming call application  to phone class module  as shown at step . After the call has been ignored, incoming call application  is dismissed either automatically or through some user action. The dismissal of the application is reported to application manager  as shown at step  at which point application manager  removes incoming call application  from application layer .","At step , after incoming call application  has been dismissed, application manager  places a function call to currently inactive YouTube\u2122 application  as shown at step . This function call is denoted \u201con FocusIn\u201d in . Placement of this function call allows YouTube\u2122 application  to take some action responsive to the dismissal of incoming call application . This action may comprise, for example, resuming playback of a movie or some other action.","It is noted that an application can leverage multiple class modules. For example, if an address book application required support for click-to-dial, e-mail and SMS, it could leverage VoIP, e-mail and SMS class modules. This example introduces an interesting issue. If a user activated a click-to-dial function from the address book, an out-bound call would be initiated from the VoIP class module. The user would need to operate the phone. Given the event listening feature discussed above, the event associated with placing a call would surface accordingly, resulting in the phone application being launched in the foreground. The address book application need only have knowledge of the APIs exposed by the VoIP module. The application framework implements the rest.","II.D.2.b Application Watchdog Timers","In one embodiment of the present invention, software watchdog timers are used to monitor application liveliness.  provides a diagram illustrating such an approach. As shown in , after an application process  has been launched, application process  sends a registration message  to register itself with a process monitor daemon . After registration, application process  periodically sends messages  to process monitor daemon  to prove that it is still operating. Upon receipt of each message , process monitor daemon  resets a watchdog timer. If process monitor daemon  fails to receive a message from application process  after a period of time that is greater than or equal to the maximum value of the watchdog timer, denoted silent period  in , process monitor daemon  assumes that application process  is unresponsive, terminates application process , and then restarts it as denoted by reference numeral  in .","Application restart behavior may be configurable on a per-application basis. In one embodiment, one can define the maximum number of restarts per time before an application is considered to be in a state of perennial failure and the action to take in that case. Actions may include uninstalling the application (running an uninstall script that is associated with the application) or rebooting the entire system. The user may be presented with an on-screen dialog in either case. Also, in certain implementations, such actions will not be undertaken while a telephone call is in progress.","Process monitor daemon  may also be configured to monitor the operating condition of the operating system of device  using a watchdog timer in a like manner to that described above in reference to . If the watchdog timer expires before the operating system sends a reporting message to process monitor daemon , then process monitor daemon  forces a reboot of the operating system.","II.D.2.c Application Portability","Different service providers may wish to deploy the same application. However, each service provider may want the application to reflect its own graphical theme. To simplify the porting effort, an embodiment of the invention implements each application as two movies. An example of this is depicted in , which shows an application  that comprises a first movie  that comprises the business logic of the application and a second movie  that comprises the graphical assets of the application. This approach advantageously allows an application to be ported by simply replacing theme movie , removing most of the risks of regression.","II.D.2.d Internationalization of Applications","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, multiple language support is achieved by enabling applications to query application manager  for text translation. The active language can be defined on a user or device basis. When application manager  launches an application, it will pass a unique application identifier, which may be referred to as a global unique identifier (GUID), to the application using an application programming interface (API). This API may be denoted the \u201cstartApplication\u201d API. Subsequently, the launched application passes the GUID, an identifier of the text to be translated, and optionally the language to translate to. If the language parameter is not provided, application manager  uses a system default language (e.g., English). Application manager  returns the corresponding text in the selected language from a language XML file associated with the application. The functions for querying for and obtaining text translation may be included within internationalization class module  in .","II.D.2.e Activity Logging and Device Heartbeating","An embodiment of the present invention provides the ability to log application usage, system configuration and system health to a remote server. At the application level, each application notifies status\/monitoring class module  of page transitions and other events, such as placing a phone call, clicking a button, or entering a search term. The amount of detail reported may vary from application to application. Application manager  also contacts status\/monitoring class module  to report application launch and exit events. In an embodiment, application launch occurs when a user activates an application icon and application exit occurs when a user returns back to the icon screen.","As represented by , status\/monitoring class module  accumulates the reported event information in event logs and periodically sends the logs to a configured remote logging server . In one embodiment, status\/monitoring class module  will attempt to send this data every five minutes by default. If logging server  is not reachable, status\/monitoring class module  will append new events to the log and then will attempt to send the data again. The number of events that may be added to a log may be limited to some predefined number. Events may be marked with timestamps indicative of the time at which each event occurred. In one embodiment, the timestamps are stored as relative offsets so as not to rely on the time of day setting on each specific device .

This is critical to prevent a network of end users from having a negative experience.","Device configuration information may include but is not limited to GUI configuration, brand information, applications, or the like.","The ability to provision the network of devices is a critical component, especially when telephony is involved. Depending upon the implementation, this may involve integration with an existing telephony infrastructure. An embodiment of the present invention provides a \u201cfaceless\u201d Web service that enables customers to populate a device configuration database. Device management subsystem  then communicates those parameters to devices in network . An embodiment of the invention also provides a provisioning application to administrators so as to support provisioning of small trials as a sales tool.","II.G.1.a Updates","A firmware image for a particular deployment may comprise a boot loader, kernel, file system, a branded framework application, and optionally DECT firmware for both a device and associated handsets. In one embodiment, these images are provided from device management subsystem  to end user devices via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Device management subsystem  may include an import mechanism that maps the firmware images to particular device product line. Once a firmware image has been imported, an administrator may then explicitly instruct that the image be deployed to a specific group of devices on network . This could equate to single device or tens of thousands. As devices complete the upgrade process, they will register the firmware update with device monitoring subsystem .","In an embodiment, device management subsystem  provides a unique deployment process for each of four categories of firmware updates: (1) new device initial start-up; (2) new application; (3) software version updates; and (4) fixes.","The process for new device initial start-up occurs automatically and no scheduling is required. Between the time of manufacture to end user activation, software upgrades may have occurred. Upon initial start-up, a set-up wizard executing on a device  automatically \u201cchecks in\u201d with device management sub-system  to pull down the latest version of the code.","The deployment of new applications is scheduled by a telecommunications carrier or other entity that administers network  and pushed. Such applications may be communicated to end users via proactive promotion, and deployment may include post-delivery notification.","Software version updates may be dependent upon expansion of a feature set or technology progression (e.g., a new version of a video codec). Such updates may not be urgent in nature any may not produce a visible difference to an end user. In an embodiment, such updates are communicated from device management subsystem  to a device using a non-intrusive awareness notification, such as a simple update in a settings screen of the device.","Fixes may be required as determined via support teams. Fixes may be global or individual in nature. Depending upon the severity and impact to the user, it may be desirable for the implementation of such fixes to be as \u201cinvisible\u201d to an end user as possible. Different types of fixes include scheduled global fixes, immediate global fixes and individual fixes","Scheduled global fixes may be planned and pushed from device management subsystem  to devices on network . Such fixes may be non-interruptive in nature.","In the event a global fix must be immediately deployed (e.g., the severity of the problem is high), device management subsystem  may cause a device to display an interruptive, non-dismissable dialog box with messaging that an important download is in progress and apologizing for any inconvenience.","Support representatives may be required to update an individual device to implement a fix. This may occur, for example, when a support representative is troubleshooting with an end user. To facilitate this, device management subsystem  is configured to allow a release to be pushed to a device on demand. Also, devices may be configured to automatically check for the latest firmware upon re-boot. In this case, a support representative may request that an end user reboot his\/her device. Devices may also provide an automatic update tool as part of a device settings application and may be directed to utilize the tool by a support representative to pull the latest update.","In an embodiment, device management subsystem  is configured to minimize device interruption and required end-user activity while keeping end users appropriately notified. To this end, device management subsystem  may be configured to perform one or more of the following functions: (1) confirm prior to download that a target device is currently inactive; (2) not disrupt any customer-initiated activity in progress; (3) wait for a target device to return to an idle state before deployment; (4) display to the user a notification message such as \u201cupdate in progress, please wait\u201d; (5) cause a device \u201cversion number\u201d to be updated on a settings screen of a device when all updates have been deployed; (6) after delivery of a new application update, deliver a notification message to the user (such as \u201cCongratulations, you have new features to enjoy from . . . \u201d) that can be deleted or saved by the user.","Device management subsystem  may also be configured to obtain necessary end user permissions prior to delivery of new applications or firmware updates. For example, a global permission may be obtained via a general notification during new device initial start-up. Alternatively or additionally, individual permissions may be obtained for each download. For example, device management subsystem  may be configured to display a message on a device requesting permission to deliver a firmware update and provide an interface by which an end user can provide a yes or no decision. Device management system  will take the appropriate action based on the end user decision.","Device management subsystem  may deploy a firmware update automatically in certain instances. For example, this may occur at new device initial start-up as mentioned above. In an embodiment, logic that automatically checks for the most recent software version is embedded in a set-up wizard that is executed by a device during initial start-up. This ensures that each new end user has the latest approved software and application set in the event devices have been shelved for periods of time prior to purchase\/deployment.","A firmware update may also be automatically triggered in the event that a periodic check function implemented by device monitoring subsystem  (described below) determines that a device does not have the latest firmware code.","An automatic firmware update may also be triggered upon device re-boot in an embodiment in which devices are configured to automatically check for the latest firmware upon re-boot.","Ideally, service providers will deploy firmware updates when devices are least likely to be in use (e.g., 1 A.M.-4 A.M.). Accordingly, in one implementation, device management subsystem  allows an approved firmware update to be deployed immediately (upon command execution) or at a future set time via pre-programming","II.G.1.b Provisioning","Preferably, every application is responsible for implementing its own provisioning solution. To simplify field trials of a telephony application and customer deployments, an embodiment of the invention implements this support as part of the solution. A provision database exposes a Web service that enables a customer's existing telephony infrastructure to populate a device's telephony parameters. A change in configuration triggers notification of the device. The device will in turn retrieve the latest configurations via Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This does not suggest that a physical file needs to be created on the file system of the provisioning server. Again, the device contacts device monitoring subsystem  to log the event.","II.G.1.c Administration","The Web-based user interface provided on computer  provides administrative functions required for device management. In an embodiment, it allows assignment of view, approval and update authorization and implements a hierarchy for various levels of access. Example access levels may include: (1) view only (for tier 1 support representatives; the platform may be able to manage potentially hundreds or thousands of view access grants); (2) view and individual device deployment (for tier 2 support representatives, allowing them to proactively push the latest software version to an individual device at a time); (3) view and global device deployment (for managers that have access and authority to push a global or group targeted update); (4) view and release approval; (5) product managers (required to approve any new application global updates prior to such updates being made available for deployment); (6) technical managers (required to approve any software upgrades or fixes prior to such upgrades\/fixes being made available for deployment); and (7) system administration (employees with access to assign and manage the above access).","II.G.1.d Web-Based Interface","In an embodiment, the Web-based interface implemented on computer  is uncluttered and simple by design. It easily accommodates a change of look and feel (e.g., logo and brand color palette) so that it may be tailored for individual service providers.

Such device searching may permit devices to be searched for based on MAC ID, customer name, billing telephone number, zip code, etc.","Main sections of the user interface may include administration, device monitoring (as will be described in more detail below) and device management. In an embodiment, the device management interface allows for selection, approvals, push and monitoring of all upgrades. It may further include firmware history that provides a reference guide to version control. The firmware history may indicate when an update occurred, what was updated, why it was updated, who approved the update, and when the most recent update occurred. The device management interface may further include the ability to manage (view, create, add, change, delete) assigned groups of devices. The user interface may further include an \u201cabout device upgrades\u201d section that comprises a central source for device management policies, procedures and frequently asked questions (FAQs).

These functions may be important in providing customer support. Device monitoring subsystem  also provides a reporting interface that allows near real time data to be presented to accurately understand device state, health and performance. Such reports may be provided for an individual device or for large groups of devices to provide global, visual views for executive management reporting.","By allowing a network of devices (such as network ) to be surveyed, device monitoring subsystem  allows administrators as well as customer support representatives to determine what firmware a device is executing, the health of that device, as well as the frequency and the manner in which the device is used. Such information may be used for individual device insight and action as well as to monitor and report on devices on an aggregated basis.","II.G.2.a Customer Support","In an embodiment, device monitoring subsystem  is configured to report the following information about a device: connection state, if in active or fail-safe mode, current firmware version, information on when historical updates were applied and frequency of usage (daily, weekly, etc.). This information may be made available to customer support representatives so that they can take appropriate action in the event of a customer issue.","II.G.2.b Reporting","In an embodiment, device monitoring subsystem  is configured to allow an administrator to query near real time statistics of deployed device and applications. For example, an administrator may determine what percentage of all registered devices is actively connected. The aggregate number may be used as a metric of overall performance and also as an important tool for customer retention teams. For example, such data can provide such teams with the ability to proactively contact those customers that have purchased and registered a device but for some reason are not currently connected. Additionally, device monitoring subsystem  may be queried to identify any devices not currently using the most current firmware version and to initiate an investigation as to why such devices are not accepting pushed updates.","II.G.2.c Administration","In one implementation, the Web-based user interface to device monitoring subsystem  provides administrative functions necessary for device monitoring.

The query may specify, for example, a name of a business, a category of businesses, or one or more search keywords. The query may also include geographic information, such as city, state or zip code in order to obtain location-specific results. Based on the query, the IP-based directory will return one or more results in the form of business names, addresses and telephone numbers. IP-based directory  may comprise a directory provided by any of a wide variety of IP-based directory service providers.","As shown in , a directory services application  executing on device  may also obtain directory services information in real-time from multiple IP-based directories, such as directories , and .

The query may be formulated in the manner described above in regard to . Aggregator  then receives query results A, query results B and query results C from IP-based directories , and , respectively, and aggregates the results for delivery to directory services application . Aggregating directory information in this fashion may be beneficial in that it may provide an end user with access to more comprehensive directory information. Certain IP-based directories may also provide certain types of information that other IP-based directories don't. Furthermore, if a first IP-based directory is currently being built, a second IP-based directory may also be used as a fallback directory in case the first IP-based directory is not capable of delivering adequate results.","In either of the scenarios depicted in , query results may be ordered for presentation to an end user.

For example, a payment may be due each time premium placement directory information is displayed or each time a phone call is placed that is attributable to a premium placement entry. The latter payment method is easily implemented because directory services application  is capable of attributing the placement of a call to a particular business entry and can be configured to instantaneously report such information.","A directory services application in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may also permit a user to click on or otherwise activate a directory entry to access additional information or functionality associated with a particular business. Additional information may be in the form of graphic, audio (e.g., voice) and\/or video content that is displayed or played back by device . Additional functionality may be in the form of an application interface that allows an end user to place an order or otherwise acquire products or services from the business (e.g., an interface that allows a user to place an order for pizza from a restaurant). A business may pay a fee in order to have such information or functionality associated with its entry and\/or may pay a separate fee each time such information or functionality is accessed or used.","Information aggregated from multiple devices  can be used to generate valuable reports regarding what types of products and services end users are looking for and which businesses have actually been contacted using the click-to-dial feature. A directory services application or other application operating on device  may also solicit ratings or rankings information from end users about businesses that they have called via device . Such information may advantageously be used to answer community-based queries such as \u201cWhat electrician do most people in my neighborhood call?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the favorite pizza place in my area?\u201d","One implementation of the present invention that uses click-to-dial reporting to provide community-based popularity information will now be described in reference to .

Dialed calls database  may maintain such information for each of a plurality of geographic locations.","When an end user solicits directory information from directory services application , directory services application  sends a query to an aggregator . Aggregator  distributes the query to multiple directories , which may include both a premium placement directory  and a standard IP-based directory  as discussed above, and obtains corresponding results in the form of business names, addresses and telephone numbers. Such results may be limited to a particular geographic area. Aggregator  then queries dialed calls database  with the returned telephone numbers to determine the popularity of each business based on click-to-call volume. Aggregator  then returns the results along with the popularity information returned from dialed calls database  to directory services application . Directory services application  then presents the results to the end user. For example, directory services application Y may present all results sorted from most popular to least popular. As another example, directory services application  may present premium placement results followed by ordinary results, wherein the premium placement results and the ordinary results are each sorted by popularity. Still other sorting approaches may be used.","In the foregoing example of , the popularity of a business is determined based on reported click-to-call volume alone. In additional embodiments, end user feedback such as end user rating or ranking information may additionally or alternatively be solicited via device  and used to determine the popularity of a business. Directory services application  may also be configured to display end user comments about particular businesses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0690","num":"0689"},"figref":"FIG. 80","b":["8000","8002","8004","8006","8008"]},"Preferences logic  allows an end user to \u201ctag\u201d an entry for a business that is listed in the application interface of directory services application . The method by which an entry is tagged may vary depending upon the implementation. Once an entry has been tagged it will subsequently be presented at the top of the list for the relevant business category. Thus, for example, if an end user tags a particular movie theater, that movie theater will appear at the top of the list the next time the movie theater category is selected. If multiple businesses within the same category have been tagged, a sorting algorithm may be used to determine the order in which the tagged businesses appear. For example, a most-recently-used sorting algorithm may be used. Preferences logic  thus allows a user to easily access directory information for a preferred business without having to actually create, maintain or find contact information for the business.","Contacts integration logic  is configured to allow an end user to add contact information associated with a business identified in the application interface of directory services application  to an address book maintained by a contacts application resident on device .","Ratings logic  is configured to permit a user to submit ratings information about a particular business identified in the application interface of directory service application . Such ratings information can then be aggregated by a service provider and used by directory services application  to display community-based ratings for businesses, or to sort business entries by ratings.","Favorites integration logic  is configured to enable a user to add a business identified in the application interface of directory services application  to a favorites list that may be maintained by directory services application  or a separate application resident on device . Activating an entry in the favorites list will invoke a speed-dial feature that will cause the business to be called.","One implementation of a click-to-call user interface flow in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to ,  and . As shown in , the flow begins with the presentation of a GUI screen  associated with a directory services application to an end user. GUI screen  includes a list of business categories  and a plurality of entries  corresponding to a selected category within category list .","In an embodiment, category list  represents a sub-category within a hierarchical list of business categories. Thus, for example, category list  may represent the category of \u201cpizza restaurants\u201d which itself is a sub-category of the category \u201crestaurants.\u201d In one implementation, the directory services application associated with GUI screen  allows a user to navigate among a hierarchical list of business categories and sub-categories in order to find a desired list of businesses.","In one embodiment, category list  represents a \u201cquick access\u201d list of categories that are deemed most useful to a user. The quick access list may be automatically compiled based on historical information relating to which categories are most often accessed by an end user. Alternatively or additionally, the quick access list may be manually compiled based on express designation of categories by the end user. The use of a quick access list helps ensure that end users are not presented with categories that they do not often use. Category list  may also represent categories that have most recently been accessed by an end user.","Depending upon the implementation, category list  may be sorted alphabetically, by frequency of use, or based on some other sorting algorithm. For manageability, category list  may be limited to some maximum number of entries. End users may be given the option to delete a category from category list .","In a further embodiment, category list  may represent the results of a category search executed by an end user via another GUI screen of the directory services application.","Once an end user has activated one of entries  shown in GUI screen , a GUI screen  depicted in  will be displayed. GUI screen  provides additional information  about the selected business. Such information may include an image , audio and\/or video content , and text . Such information also includes a telephone number .","The information presented in GUI screen  may be provided from the business itself or from some third party information provider, such as a third party IP-based directory service. The information may be provided in a very simple format or may be provided in an elaborate format, using animation, streaming audio\/video content, or the like.","Upon activation of telephone number  by an end user, a GUI screen  depicted in  will be displayed. As shown in , GUI screen  includes a dial button , a contacts button , a favorites button , a bookmark button , a comment button  and a cancel button .","When an end user presses dial button , the click-to-dial functionality of the directory services application will be invoked and a telephone call will be placed from device  to the selected business. As noted above, the placement of the call via this interface may be reported to an external entity for tracking business popularity or other statistics.","When an end user activates contacts button , information about the selected business will be imported into an address book maintained by a contacts application resident on device . Depending upon the implementation, this process may involve launching an interactive dialog in which the end user must engage.","When an end user activates favorites button , the selected business will be tagged such that it will subsequently be presented at the top of the list for the relevant business category. Thus, for example, if an end user activates favorites button  for a particular movie theater, that movie theater will appear at the top of the list the next time the movie theater category is selected. If multiple businesses within the same category have been selected as favorites, a sorting algorithm may be used to determine the order in which the businesses appear.","When an end user activates bookmark button , the selected business will be saved to a \u201cbookmarked\u201d business category for easy access during subsequent use of the directory services application.","When an end user activates comment button , the user is presented with an interface by which the end user can submit feedback about the selected business. Depending upon the implementation, such feedback may be submitted in the form of a rating (e.g., a certain number of stars out of 5 stars, a \u201cthumbs up\u201d or \u201cthumbs down\u201d, etc.) and\/or as text comments. Such feedback can then be aggregated by a service provider and then used by the directory services application to display community-based ratings or comments for businesses or to sort business entries by ratings.","When an end user activates cancel button , the end user terminates the transaction and may be returned, for example, to GUI screen .","It should be noted that depending upon the implementation, either or both of GUI screens  and  need not be used. For example, activating an entry within GUI screen  may automatically place a phone call to the selected business. Also, activating phone number  within GUI screen  may automatically place a phone call to the selected business.","Click-to-call records generated by a directory services application in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may be used to generate a variety of valuable business reports. Such reports may provide a volume of calls per time period, busy hours, a number of entries viewed without calls\/skips, a number of hang-ups or unanswered calls or a number of favorite registrations for a particular business.","III. Example Computer System","Embodiments of the present invention described herein, including systems, methods\/processes, and\/or apparatuses, may be implemented using one or more processor-based computer systems, such as computer system  shown in . As shown in , computer system  includes a processing unit  that includes one or more processors or processor cores. Processor unit  is connected to a communication infrastructure , which may comprise, for example, a bus or a network.","Computer system  also includes a main memory , preferably random access memory (RAM), and may also include a secondary memory . Secondary memory  may include, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive . Removable storage drive  may comprise a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disk drive, a tape backup, or the like. Removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well-known manner. Removable storage unit  may comprise a floppy disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, or the like, which is read by and written to by removable storage drive . As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s), removable storage unit  includes a computer-readable storage medium having stored therein computer software and\/or data.","In alternative implementations, secondary memory  may include other similar means for allowing computer programs or other instructions to be loaded into computer system . Such means may include, for example, a removable storage unit  and an interface . Examples of such means may include a memory stick and an industry standard interface (such as a universal serial bus (USB) interface) suitable for interfacing with the memory stick, a memory card and associated card reader, a removable memory chip (such as an EPROM or PROM) and associated socket, a program cartridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game devices), and other removable storage units  and interfaces  that allow software and data to be transferred from removable storage unit  to computer system .","Computer system  may further include a display  for presenting user-viewable content rendered by processing unit  and\/or optional display interface hardware (not shown in ) as well as one or more input\/output (I\/O) devices  for receiving input from or producing output to a user. Exemplary input devices include a keyboard, mouse, keypad, touch screen, or the like. Exemplary output devices include audio devices such as speakers. Display  may also be considered an output device.","Computer system  may also include a communication interface . Communication interface  allows software and data to be transferred between computer system  and external devices. Examples of communication interface  may include a modem, a network interface (such as an Ethernet card), a communications port, a PCMCIA slot and card, or the like. Software and data transferred via communication interface  are in the form of signals which may be electronic, electromagnetic, optical, or other signals capable of being received by communication interface . These signals are provided to communication interface  via a communication path . Communications path  carries signals and may be implemented using wired communication media such as a phone line, coaxial cable or fiber optic cable, as well as wireless communication media such as radio frequency (RF) or infrared communication channels.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccomputer program medium\u201d and \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d are used to generally refer to media such as removable storage unit , removable storage unit  and a hard disk installed in hard disk drive . Computer program medium and computer readable medium can also refer to memories, such as main memory  and secondary memory , which can be semiconductor devices (e.g., DRAMs, etc.). These computer program products are means for providing software to computer system .","Computer programs (also called computer control logic, programming logic, or logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or secondary memory . Computer programs may also be received via communication interface . Such computer programs, when executed, enable computer system  to implement features of the present invention as discussed herein. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system . Where the invention is implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer system  using removable storage drive , interface , or communication interface .","The invention is also directed to computer program products comprising software stored on any computer readable medium. Such software, when executed in one or more data processing devices, causes a data processing device(s) to operate as described herein. Embodiments of the present invention employ any computer readable medium, known now or in the future. Examples of computer readable mediums include, but are not limited to, primary storage devices (e.g., any type of random access memory) and secondary storage devices (e.g., hard drives, floppy disks, CD ROMS, zip disks, tapes, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, MEMs, nanotechnology-based storage device, etc.).","IV. Managed Services Platform","As noted previously, several companies offer services where a user can search for and download applications to his mobile device. Currently, however, there is no oversight of such a process, and an enterprise may be averse to permitting employees to freely download applications from such services onto company mobile devices. The description contained herein presents several arrangements that address this concern and that present a secure environment for the retrieval and installation of applications on protected enterprise mobile devices or portable units whose access is or should be restricted in some manner.","To achieve this objective, a managed services platform is presented in which the platform includes a DMS server and an AS server. The DMS server can act as a gateway for communications with one or more computing devices, and the computing devices can be associated with a first entity. The AS server can be communicatively coupled with the DMS server. When a first computing device contacts the DMS server, the DMS server can be operable to provide a bundle to the first computing device. As an example, the bundle contains content that at least includes one or more configuration messages and an application set that contains one or more predefined applications. In another arrangement, the content of the bundle can be determined at least in part by the first entity.","The arrangement described above can permit safe and secure delivery of content to a portable computing device, as the downloaded material can be from a known and authorized source. In addition, steps can be taken to ensure that the content that is delivered is authorized to be delivered to a particular mobile device. Embodiments that have been described above and those that will be presented below can be used to provide such a system.","Referring to , an example of a system  that includes a managed services platform  is shown. The managed services platform  can communicate with a network , which can be comprised of any suitable number and type of interconnected communications infrastructure operating in accordance with any suitable type and number of protocols and standards. As an example, the network  can be accessed through a conventional Internet connection, whether wired or wireless. In one arrangement, the platform  can include a device management service (DMS) server  and an application service (AS) server , and the DMS server  and the AS server  can be communicatively coupled to one another such that bi-directional communication exchange between these two components can occur.","The managed services platform  can be configured to communicate with one or more portable computing devices . The DMS server  can serve as a gateway for communications with one or more of the devices  such that the DMS server  is responsible for exchanging messages and data with the devices  or for directing or otherwise overseeing the exchange of messages and data between the devices  and other suitable components. The term \u201cDMS server\u201d is defined as a component or a group of components that enable bi-directional communication with at least a portable computing device such that messages, updates, settings or other data can be delivered to such a device.","In one arrangement, the DMS server  can be a computer that includes a processor (not shown), memory (not shown), a computer-readable storage medium (not shown), a network adapter (not shown), and other components known to those skilled in the art. A DMS client interface  can be stored on the computer-readable storage medium, or stored to a data storage device that is communicatively linked to the DMS server . The DMS client interface  can interface with the portable computing devices . For example, the DMS client interface  can include a message publisher interface (not shown) that communicates DMS commands to the portable computing devices  and that facilitates a communication service that employs a consolidated polling technique to conduct message exchange. This communication service, referred to as a heartbeat service, provides a common message transport bus where individual applications running on a managed device can subscribe to receive messages.","A portable computing device  can be any device that subscribes to or is configured to subscribe to the managed services platform  and that may be communicatively linked to the DMS server  to receive one or more commands from the DMS client interface . As an example, a portable computing device  is a tablet, a laptop computer, a smart phone or a communications device that is embedded within another component, such as a vehicle or an appliance. In one arrangement, a portable computing device  can include a DMS client  and a DMS agent  instantiated thereon. The DMS client  and DMS agent  can be implemented as computer-readable program code that, when executed by a processor, implements the various processes described herein. A portable computing device  can also include one or more displays , one or more transceivers  and one or more processors . The transceivers  can enable the device  to communicate with the DMS server , the AS server  and any other component via any suitable wired or wireless connection.","The term \u201cDMS client\u201d is defined as client-side software instantiated on a portable computing device that establishes a communication link with a DMS server and, among other things, receives DMS commands from the DMS server. In addition, the term \u201cDMS agent\u201d is defined as client-side software that is instantiated on a portable computing device that implements the DMS commands received from the DMS server. The DMS agent  can be implemented on the devices  as a component of the DMS client  or on the devices  as a separate component with which the DMS client  communicates.","In one embodiment, the DMS commands can be communicated to a portable computing device  in response to the DMS server  receiving a solicitation or heartbeat from the device . In this regard, the command can be requested by the DMS client  via the heartbeat, as opposed to being pushed by the DMS server  to the device .","In illustration, the heartbeat service of the portable computing device  can periodically communicate a heartbeat to the DMS server  to indicate that the device  is turned on or active and available to receive DMS commands, which may be available from the DMS server . As used herein, the term \u201cheartbeat\u201d is defined as a message communicated from a portable computing device to a DMS server that indicates the availability of the portable computing device to receive DMS commands or messages. A portable computing device  can be configured to communicate the heartbeat intervals defined by seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, a certain event, etc. Such intervals can be static, user configurable, or configurable via the update process.","When a heartbeat is received from a portable computing device , the DMS server  can communicate a heartbeat response. If no commands are presently available, the heartbeat response can indicate such to the device . If one or more commands are available for the device , the heartbeat response can indicate that one or more commands will be communicated to the device . For example, the heartbeat response can indicate that the DMS command will be communicated to a device  in response to a next heartbeat, or at a particular time. In this regard, the heartbeat and heartbeat response can include data that facilitates coordination between the DMS server  and the device  for delivery of the commands. After the commands have been executed, a next heartbeat generated by the portable computing device  can indicate to the DMS server  the status of the update, the status of the device  or any other relevant data. As will be explained below, this transport mechanism can permit the delivery of various types of data to the portable computing devices . It is understood, however, that the system  is not limited to this particular transport mechanism, as other suitable techniques for establishing and maintaining communications in the system  may be used.","The AS server  can be a computer that includes a processor (not shown), memory (not shown), a computer-readable storage medium (not shown), a network adapter (not shown), and other components known to those skilled in the art. An AS client interface  can be stored on the computer-readable storage medium, or stored to a data storage device that is communicatively linked to the AS server . The AS client interface  can interface with the portable computing devices . The AS server  can also host one or more application repositories , which can offer one or more applications for download to the portable computing devices . An \u201capplication repository\u201d is defined as a medium for storing one or more applications for download to a computing device. An \u201capplication\u201d is defined as software that when installed on a machine enables a user to perform one or more specified tasks. As will be explained below, the application repository  can offer applications to the devices  on an individual, global or group basis, a process in which several applications are grouped together for download to a device . A suitable entity can add applications to, modify applications in or remove applications from the application repositories .","Similar to the DMS arrangement described above, a portable computing device  can include an AS client , which can be implemented as computer-readable program code that, when executed by a processor, implement the various processes described herein. The term \u201cAS client\u201d is defined as client-side software instantiated on a portable computing device that establishes a communication link with an AS server and enables the device or facilitates its ability to receive application downloads.","In one arrangement, one or more of the portable computing devices  can be associated with a first entity, while one or more other portable computing devices can be associated with a second entity. For example, the first entity or second entity may be an enterprise, such as a private business or a government agency, a family or some other group linked by one or more common factors. The phrase \u201cassociated with an entity\u201d is defined as a relationship between a first entity and a component, service, employee, agent or other entity such that the first entity maintains at least some control over that component, service, employee, agent or other entity. For example, a portable computing device  can be assigned to a first entity such that information relevant to the operation of the first entity is presented on the device  and employees or agents of the first entity can operate the device  on behalf of the first entity.","As an example, all or a portion of the managed services platform  can be hosted by an entity that is distinct from the first and second entities. Such an arrangement can alleviate from the first and second entities the burden of hosting these systems. For example, if the first entity is a private business, the private business may contract with another business to host the managed services platform. Of course, the first entity may wish to host all or a portion of the managed services platform  itself. In addition, different entities may also host portions of the managed services platform . In particular, a first hosting entity may manage the DMS server , while a second hosting entity may be responsible for the AS server .","Virtually any number of portable computing devices  can be assigned to the managed services platform , and these devices  can be associated with any suitable number of entities. In addition, a portable computing device  can be configured to communicate with several managed services platforms . For example, a first platform  may serve as a primary platform, while a second platform  may operate as a secondary platform. In particular, a portable computing device  may communicate with a primary platform  during normal operation but may communicate with a secondary platform  if the primary platform  malfunctions. Moreover, the device  may initially communicate with the secondary platform  upon activation and then can receive instructions to switch to the primary platform . The use of a secondary platform  can also permit additional messages, such as updates or corrective actions, to be sent to the device , if necessary. The secondary platform  can also be used to ensure security by directing the portable computing device  only to an authorized primary platform  such as, for example, when a device  is first activated or following an update.","As explained earlier, multiple portable computing devices  that are associated with numerous entities are contemplated in this arrangement. In addition, a user who is associated with the first entity may be assigned a portable computing device  that is associated with the first entity. For example, a private business may purchase or lease a portable computing device  and can assign the device  to one of its employees. If desired, the private business can also assign a single device  to multiple employees in which each of the employees can be assigned log-in credentials to access\/operate the single device . Additional examples of this principle will be presented below.","The arrangement described above can enable the selective download of applications, settings and other data to be sent to one or more portable computing devices . Such information can be provided to a device  on an individual basis, a group basis or a broadcast basis. Multiple examples of this process and other supporting structures will be presented below. A description will be presented here in which a device  is ready for an initial activation.","In this example, a first entity, which may be a private business, wishes to assign a portable computing device  to a person who is associated with the first entity. This person may be, for example, an employee, agent or contractor of the business. As such, this person may have a performance function that is related to or associated with the business. The term \u201cperformance function\u201d is defined as one or more tasks assigned to a person to be conducted on behalf of the assigning party. As an example, a performance function can be the duties assigned to an employee or an agent of the business.","The portable computing device  that is assigned to the person associated with the first entity can have an identification that enables the device  to be uniquely identified from other computing devices . In addition, this identification can be used to identify a particular user of a device , especially if that person is the only user assigned to the device . Of course, multiple users may be assigned to a single device , if so desired. As an example, the unique identifier for a device  can be a media access control (MAC) address, although other elements can be used for such a task. If the portable computing device  supports multiple users, then the identification can also include information that enables the users of the device  to be distinguished from one another. For example, a user name or other moniker can be included with a MAC address to identify the device  and which user of the device  is currently active or currently wishes to receive\/transmit\/exchange data.","When the user activates the assigned portable computing device , the device  can contact the managed services platform , such as by generating and sending an activation notice to the DMS server . The device  can send the activation notice when the device  is first activated or even during subsequent power up cycles, and this notice can be conducted in accordance with the heartbeat process previously described or some other suitable process. The term \u201cactivation notice\u201d is defined as a notice that is intended to inform a component or a group of components that the element that sent the notice is ready to receive data from the component or group of components. In receipt of the activation notice, the DMS server  can use the unique identifier(s) to identify the device  and, if necessary, the user of the device . Additionally, the DMS server  may be operable to provide a bundle to the device , and the contents of the bundle can provision the device  in accordance with one or more predetermined arrangements. The phrase \u201coperable to provide a bundle to a computing device\u201d is defined as directly transmitting content to a computing device, indirectly transmitting content to a computing device by directing a component to effect the transmission of content to the computing device or by directing or assisting the portable computing device to seek the delivery of content from a component.","In one arrangement, the content of the bundle can be determined at least in part by the first entity or client to which the portable computing device  is associated. In particular, the content of the bundle can at least include one or more configuration messages and an application set that contains one or more predefined applications. As an example, the managed services platform  can provide the bundle to the device  through a series of message exchanges in accordance with a consolidated polling technique (i.e., the heartbeat process).","Several definitions of some the terms listed above will now be presented. The term \u201cbundle\u201d is defined as one or more messages or transmissions that include content that is intended for a particular computing device or group of computing devices or one or more directives that cause a computing device or a group of computing devices to retrieve content from one or more sources. The term \u201ccontent\u201d is defined as data, settings or parameters that when received by a computing device, cause the computing device to perform an action that corresponds to the received data, settings or parameters. A \u201cconfiguration message\u201d is defined as one or more messages or transmissions that are designed to cause a computing device to select or adjust one or more operational settings of the computing device.","Turning to the configuration messages, the DMS server , once it has been contacted by the device , can forward one or more of them to the device . As an example, a configuration message can include virtual privacy network (VPN) settings, wireless communication settings (such as Wi-Fi settings), location service settings, security certificates, firmware packages or download control settings. Specifically, location service settings can be settings that enable, for example, a managing entity to monitor the whereabouts of the device , and security certificates can be employed for securing communications to and from the device , such as Internet Protocol (IP) communications. As another example, firmware packages can include one or more firmware releases that include programming\/code to effect or facilitate operational adjustments or settings in one or more components of the portable computing device , as will be explained below. Control settings, for example, can be used to permit a managing entity or other external party to send messages to or make adjustments to the device .","In addition to the configuration messages, the bundle can include one or more applications, such as application sets that include one or more predefined applications. For example, the managed services platform  can take steps to cause the delivery of applications to the portable computing device  or to direct the device  to one or more different components that make such applications available for download. In one arrangement, the DMS server  can be operable to provide applications to the device  by directly transmitting such data to the device . Alternatively, the DMS server  can direct the AS server  to transmit the applications to the device  or can direct the device  to contact the AS server  to retrieve the applications. The device  can also receive applications via any combination of these options listed here.","As noted above, the AS server  can host one or more application repositories , which can offer multiple applications for download to any number of portable computing devices . In one arrangement, the application set that is to be sent to a particular computing device  can include a default application set that includes one or more default applications. In addition to or in lieu of the default application set, the application set can include a custom application set that includes one or more custom applications. A default application set can include applications (i.e., default applications) that have been approved to be installed on all the devices  of a particular group or all devices associated with an entity. In contrast, a custom application set can include applications (i.e., custom applications) that are geared towards a particular characteristic associated with a device  or a user of the device .","As an example, the content of the bundle provided to a portable computing device  can be based on the identification associated with the device . As such, the configuration messages and\/or the applications can be provided to the device  according to the identification associated with the device . In one embodiment, the identification associated with the device  can be related to a performance function of an intended user of the device  such that the configuration messages or the applications that are provided to the device  are related to the performance function of the intended user.","For example, a first entity, such as a corporation, may distribute a portable computing device  to an individual, like an employee. This employee can have a performance function, such as generating sales of the company's products or services. Because this worker is involved in sales, the bundle to be delivered to his device  can be tailored to that function. That is, the configuration message(s) and the applications that are to be provided to the employee's device  can be related to the employee's job function, which is in sales. For example, because this employee may be using public Wi-Fi networks, a configuration message sent to the device  may require the device  to only communicate over a VPN. As another example, because the employee may travel frequently, a configuration message for the device  may direct the enablement of a location service on the device . In addition, the configuration message may include firmware and other code designed expressly for this employee's sales job.","In one arrangement, the receipt of the configuration messages can cause visible changes to the portable computing device . For example, a firmware package that is delivered to the device  may cause the display  of the device  to present certain GUI elements. In one particular arrangement but without limitation, the GUI elements that are displayed can be associated with the first entity that distributed the device  to the user. The first entity can cause the device  to be flashed such that, for example, a company logo or other mark can appear on the display, along with other predetermined visual elements, like a background or other various skins and\/or themes. This process can be conducted with other devices  that are associated with a second entity such that these devices  can be provisioned to have a look and feel associated with the second entity.","As previously noted, as part of the bundle for each employee, a default set of applications can be provided to the device  as each employee activates his\/her device  or at any other suitable time(s). For example, these default applications can be applications that are relevant to each employee's association with the corporation, such as an application for sharing work contacts, an application that presents written articles about the company's industry or an application that is useful for remembering important personal information related to business contacts. Default applications can also be made available for retrieval by a group of devices , such as from an application repository, at any other suitable time. These default applications can simply be made available to the devices  or can be pushed to the devices  when the default applications become available.","As also referenced earlier, if desired, a custom set of applications can be prepared and provided to employees who are part of a specific group or who meet certain requirements. These custom applications can be related to the performance function of an employee or a group of employees. Continuing with the example concerning the sales employee, because this employee may need to visit clients, a navigation application can be provided to that employee's device . In another example, because this employee will be dealing with numerous clients, an application that manages information concerning business contacts can be provided to the device . Like the default applications, custom applications can be pushed to the device  or made available at an application repository, whether at activation or during any suitable, subsequent time.","The managed services platform  can provide services to multiple portable computing devices . Two or more users of such devices  may be associated with a first entity, although not necessarily so. Similar to the description above, the DMS server , once it identifies the second device , can be operable to provide a second bundle to the second device  that is assigned to, for example, an administrative assistant. The second bundle can also contain content that at least includes one or more configuration commands and an application set that contains at least predefined applications. The second bundle can be provided to the second device  when an activation notice is received from the second device  or by some other suitable act by the second device .","The content of the second bundle can be based on the identification associated with the second computing device  such that the configuration messages and\/or the application set that are provided to the second device  are done so according to the identification associated with the second device . The identification associated with the second device  can be related to a performance function of a second intended user of the second device  such that the configuration messages or the applications that are provided to the second device  are related to the performance function of the second intended user. In one arrangement, the performance function of the second intended user is different from the performance function of a first intended user of the first device  described above. In this arrangement, the content of the bundle provided to the second intended user can be different from the content of the bundle provided to the first intended user of the first device .","In view of these multiple devices , the DMS server  or some other suitable component can be operable to provide a default set of applications and a custom set of applications for both the first computing device  and the second computing device . As an example, the default set of applications can be the same for both the first device  and the second device , while the custom set of applications for the first device  can be different from the custom set of applications for the second device .","Continuing with the above example, one of the users may be an employee of the first entity and can be involved in sales. This first user can be assigned a first computing device , which can receive configuration messages and applications that are related to the type of work, i.e., sales, conducted by the first user. A second user may be an administrative assistant who is also an employee of the entity and who is assigned a second portable computing device . This second user has a different performance function from that of the first user. As such, some of the configuration messages for the second device  assigned to this user may be structured differently from those provided to the first device  that is assigned to the first user. As an example, the administrative assistant may only be permitted to use the second device  on the entity's campus, which may eliminate the need to set the second device  for permanent use of a VPN.","Further, some of the applications provided to the first user's device  may be different from those provided to the second device  assigned to the second user. For example, the administrative assistant may never travel on the company's behalf, which would obviate the need for provided the second device  with a navigation application. Accordingly, one or more applications designed for use by the administrative assistant on the second device , i.e., a custom set of applications, can be different from those of the employee involved in sales. Nevertheless, some of the applications provided to the sales employee, the administrative assistant and other employees can be common, i.e., a set of default applications, installed on all relevant devices .","As such, the presentation of applications to employees or other individuals can be general or selective in nature. This control of access to applications can occur when the portable computing device  is initially activated or at any other subsequent time. Moreover, this feature applies to applications that are pushed to a device  without any solicitation from a user or when a user tries to access applications from an application repository. In the latter scenario, a managing entity may control the type of applications that a user of the device  can retrieve from an application repository. For example, the managing entity may only present to a user those applications in the application repository that the user is entitled to install on his\/her device , which can be based on, for example, the user's performance function.","In certain embodiments, multiple users may be assigned to a single portable computing device . For example, an entity may assign a first user and a second user to a first device , and both the first user and the second user can set up accounts on the first device . The first device  can be operable to identify the first and second users through various conventional means, like passwords or biometric identification. In addition to providing its own unique identifier, the first device  can provide identification for both the first and second users by, for example, supplying information that identifies which of the first and second users is currently active on the first device .","Because there may be multiple users for a single portable computing device , a corresponding number of bundles may be provided to the device . As such, the content of a first bundle provided to a first device  can be based on an identification associated with the first device . To accommodate this feature, the device  can be operable to switch between a first account associated with the first user and a second account associated with the second user. Additionally, the DMS server  can be further operable to provide a second bundle to the first device  based on the identification associated with the first device . The content of the first bundle can be arranged for the first user, and the content of the second bundle can be arranged for the second user, in accordance with the description above. The first and second users may have similar or even dissimilar performance functions, and the first and second bundles may include configuration messages and applications geared towards those performance functions. The first and second users may be associated with a common entity, such as an employer, but not necessarily so.","As noted earlier, the content of the bundle can be determined, at least in part, by a first entity. This first entity can also be responsible for assigning portable computing devices  to one or more users, each of which can be associated with the first entity. For example, the first entity may be a corporation that provides devices  to a number of its employees. In one arrangement, one more application repositories  can be assigned to and associated with the first entity. Such an application repository  can have a look and feel that is related to the first entity, which can give a user of the repository  that the repository  is maintained by or at least approved by the first entity.","In response to the receipt of a bundle, a portable computing device  can be provided with access to the application repository  that is assigned to and associated with the first entity. The phrase \u201cprovided with access to an application repository that is assigned to and associated with the first entity\u201d is defined as a state in which a computing device is authorized to access and retrieve material from an application repository or have material from the application repository pushed to the device in which the application repository is either managed or approved by the first entity. As an example, the device  can download applications from the application repository , whether solicited by the device  or pushed to the device . This relationship means that the default application sets, the custom application sets or both can be selected from an application repository  that is associated with the first entity. As such, the first entity can determine which applications are to be part of the application repository , including the number and types of applications that are to be included in the default application sets, the custom application sets or both. It must be noted, however, that entities other than this first entity may make these determinations, and additional detail on this process will be presented below.","In one arrangement, the first entity referred to above can be responsible for setting up and maintaining the managed services platform  or at least part thereof, in addition to determining the content of the bundles provided to the computing devices . For improved efficiency or to lessen the burden on the first entity, at least part of the managed services platform  can be developed and managed by a second entity that is distinct from the first entity. For example, the DMS server  and the AS server  can be hosted by the second entity. As another example, the second entity can be a managing entity that is responsible for preparing and providing the bundles according to input from the first entity.","An example will be presented to help explain this arrangement. Consistent with the examples above, the first entity may be a corporation that assigns portable computing devices  to a number of its employees. While the corporation may set up and manage a managed services platform \u2014including an application repository \u2014on its own, the corporation may delegate such responsibilities to some other organization, i.e., the second entity. The second entity may be another company that specializes in providing managed services and can, at the direction of the first entity, develop and host the components of the managed services platform . As part of this assignment, the second entity can develop and maintain the application repository  on behalf of the first entity, which may include approving applications for publication in the repository . Further, the first entity can direct the second entity to prepare the bundles that can be provided to the relevant portable computing devices , including the pushing of subsequent updates and other content to these devices . In this case, the first entity can provide input to the second entity to ensure the second entity properly prepares the bundles. Of course, the first entity can take on any of these processes on its own accord.","Referring to , an example of a managed services system  is shown. Any number of managed services platforms , as described above, can be implemented into the managed services system . In one arrangement, the system  can include one or more application developer portals , one or more approval portals , one or more administrator portals , one or more client portals  and one or more sub-client portals . An overview of the managed services system  will now be presented.","The application developer portal  is a system that enables one or more application developers to submit applications for publication in one or more, for example, application repositories . Once an application is submitted for publication, the application developer portal  can forward the application to one or more approval portals . The approval portal  is a system that enables testing and analysis on the submitted application to ensure that the application complies with a set of requirements for publication in the application repository. If the application meets these requirements, the application may be approved, and the approval portal  can forward the approved application to, for example, one or more administrator portals . The approval portal  can also signal the application developer portal  that the submitted application has been approved.","The administrator portal  is a system that enables the distribution of the approved application to one or more entities or components. Once it receives the approved application, the administrator portal  can, for example, push the application to one or more of the portable computing devices  (see ) through the managed services platform  (see ) or can cause the application to be published in the application repository  or to become part of a bundle. In this scenario, the portable computing devices  may be associated with an entity that is responsible for operating or managing the administrator portal .","The administrator portal , once it receives the approved application, may also perform one or more other processes, either in lieu of or in addition to the steps listed above. For example, the administrator portal  can forward the approved application to one or more of the client portals , which can serve as a notice that the application is available for publication in one or more application repositories. The client portals  can be systems that accept approved applications from, for example, the administrator portal  and can make determinations as to whether to publish the approved application in an application repository. As an example, the application repository in which the approved application may be published can be associated with a client portal .","In one arrangement, one of the client portals  may be associated with one or more of the sub-client portals . In one example but without limitation, a client portal  may be associated with a multi-national corporation, and a sub-client portal  may be set up for one or more subsidiaries of the corporation. In this arrangement, the client portal  may facilitate the availability\/publication of applications for the sub-client portals , such as for application repositories associated with the entities that oversee or operate the sub-client portals . For example, if the client portal  decides to publish the submitted application in an application repository, the client portal  can forward the application to one or more of the sub-client portals . At this point, the sub-client portals  can determine whether to publish the application on an application repository associated with the entity overseeing or operating the sub-client portal .","The preceding overview is not meant to be limiting, as it is merely one example of a managed services system and its operating processes. Each of the components shown in , however, will be discussed in more detail below, beginning with the application developer portal  and the approval portal .","Referring to , exemplary block diagrams of the application developer portal  and the approval portal  are shown. As explained earlier, the application developer portal  enables one or more application developers to submit one or more applications for possible publication in one or more application repositories. To facilitate this operation, the application developer portal  can include several components, such as a display , memory , a testing interface , and approval portal interface  and a processor . The display  can display various types of relevant information, such as one or more applications that have been received from, for example, an application developer. The memory  can be any suitable type of memory for storing the submitted applications, as well as instructions for carrying out any of the processes described herein.","The testing interface  can be configured to permit an application developer to test, analyze, review or otherwise manage any application that it has submitted to the application developer portal . For example, the testing interface  can support wired or wireless communications with one or more testing devices (not shown), which can permit the installation of a submitted application on a testing device. As an example, a testing device can be similar to a portable computing device  described above or some other similar unit that may eventually install the submitted application. The approval portal interface  can support wired or wireless communications with the approval portal  and\/or some other suitable component. This connection can permit the application developer portal  to submit applications to the approval portal  for approval and for message or data exchange between the two components.","Each of the display , the memory , the testing interface  and the approval portal interface  can be communicatively coupled to the processor . In addition, the processor  can control the operation of each of these components. The processor  can be configured or operable to cause the execution of any the processes described herein.","As explained above, the approval portal  can permit the review and approval of applications submitted for publication from the application developer portal . Similar to the application developer portal , the approval portal  can include a display , memory , a testing interface  and a processor . The approval portal  can also include an administrator portal interface , an approval engine  and an application developer interface .","The display  can display one or more applications that have been submitted for approval, as well as other relevant information. The memory  can be any suitable type of memory for storing the applications submitted for approval, as well as instructions for carrying out any of the processes described herein. The testing interface  can be configured to conduct wired or wireless communications with one or more testing devices (not shown), which can permit the applications submitted for approval to be downloaded to such devices. A testing device can permit the submitted application to be tested in an environment similar to that available on a portable computing device . As such, the testing device may be similar in structure and capabilities as a portable computing device , although the testing device is certainly not limited to this arrangement.","The administrator portal interface  can support wired or wireless communications to enable the approval portal  to send approved applications to the administrator portal  (see ), as well as to allow message\/data exchange between the two systems. Of course, the administrator portal interface  can be used to permit the approval portal  to conduct wired or wireless communications with other suitable systems or components. Similarly, the application developer interface  can support wired or wireless communications with, for example, the approval portal interface  of the application developer portal  or any other suitable component. In one arrangement, the approval engine , which can be any suitable combination of hardware and software, can be configured to conduct testing on the submitted application. For example, the approval engine  can execute testing or analysis programs on the submitted application to provide an indication as to whether the submitted application complies with any number of approval requirements.","Each of the display , the memory , the administrator portal interface , the testing interface  and the approval engine  can be communicatively coupled to the processor . In addition, the processor  can control the operation of each of these components. The processor  can be configured or operable to cause the execution of any the processes described herein.","Examples of the operation of the application developer portal  and the approval portal  will now be presented. The application developer portal , which may also be referred to as a computing device, can be configured to present a first interface to permit application developers to submit applications for approval for selective publication in a first application repository, a second application repository or both first and second application repositories. In one arrangement, the first application repository can be associated with a first client, and the second application repository can be associated with a second client, although either application repository may be associated with a single client or entity. The term \u201capplication developer\u201d is defined as an entity that submits an application for approval for publication or at least possible publication in an application repository and includes an entity that actually generates the application or an entity that supervises the generation of the application. The phrase \u201cto submit applications for approval for selective publication\u201d is defined as a process in which applications are submitted for an approval process in which it is determined whether the submitted application meets one or more requirements for publication or at least possible publication in one or more application repositories.","The approval portal , which may also be referred to as a computing device, can be configured to present a second interface to permit the approval of a submitted application for the selective publication in the first application repository and\/or the second application repository. The term \u201capproval\u201d is defined as a process or state in which an application has been deemed to meet one or more requirements to be eligible for publication or at least available for publication in one or more application repositories. If a submitted application is approved, the approval portal  can be further configured to notify the application developer portal  that the submitted application has been approved, such as through a communication between the application developer interface  and the approval portal interface .","Referring to , an example of an interface  that the application developer portal  can present to permit application developers to submit applications for approval for selective publication is shown. As an example, the interface  can be one or more GUI elements that provide information to a user and enable the user to take one or more actions. As part of the interface , the application developer portal  can present a home page , which can be accessed through, for example, a home tab .","In one arrangement, the home page  can provide performance data relating to a submitted application once the application is published in the first application repository or the second application repository. Examples of performance data can include the number of times an application has been published in an application repository, how many times the application has been downloaded from the application repository and financial information. In this case, the home page  can include an application performance section  that can display the amount of revenue generated by a selected application, such as over the course of several months. As an example, this revenue can be generated from users downloading the application from an application repository. Of course, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the home page  can demonstrate other information that is related to the performance of one or more individual applications.","In another arrangement, the home page  can be configured to provide cumulative performance data relating to a plurality of published applications in the first application repository or the second application repository. For example, the home page  can include a cumulative performance section , which can show the amount of revenue that has been generated from a plurality of submitted applications that have been published, such as all published applications. This information can be displayed in relation to any suitable amount of time, such as the monthly performance markers shown in the cumulative performance section . As part of the cumulative performance section , a pie chart \u2014or some other form of displaying cumulative data\u2014can be used to demonstrate the total market share of each of the applications that have been published and downloaded. It is understood, however, that the home page  is not in any way limited to these examples, as other suitable formats can be used to display cumulative performance data of a plurality of applications.","In addition to performance data, the home page  can provide other important information. For example, the home page  can show the number of applications that have been submitted by a particular application developer. As part of this feature, the home page  can provide the total number of submitted applications in a particular state, such as the total number of applications that have been published or rejected or are still pending approval. Additional discussion on these states will be presented below. Comments relating to one or more submitted applications may also be presented on the home page . These comments may be submitted by, for example, application developers, personnel involved in approving the submitted applications or any other suitable entities. A date range selection mechanism  can also be provided to enable a user to select a particular date or a range of dates in an effort to focus on performance data or other information associated with a particular temporal period.","The application developer portal  can be configured such that all of or portions of performance data associated with the submitted applications can be selectively isolated such that access to the performance data is restricted. For example, a password or a biometric identification process may be required to access the performance data, which can effectively prevent unauthorized users from obtaining access to this potentially sensitive data.","Referring to , an example of an applications page  is shown, which can be part of the interface  and can be accessed through an applications tab . As an example, an application developer can upload one or more applications for approval through this applications page , such as by selecting an addition feature . One or more submitted applications  can be presented on the applications page , and these applications can be represented by any suitable type of icon. As part of the display, the name and version of the application  can be shown. Additionally, a rating indicator  can be displayed as part of the presentation of the submitted applications . The rating indicator  can represent an overall rating that is attached to an application  to provide an indication as to, for example, the effectiveness, suitability, performance or utility of the application. As an example, the rating indicator  can be applied to applications that have been published and downloaded to portable computing devices  and can represent a cumulative grading. The cumulative grading can be based on information provided by users who have downloaded and used the published application, for example.","In this case, the rating indicator  can be a grading scale based on a number of stars, which can range from the number zero to the number five, with more stars being hi-lighted as the cumulative grading becomes more favorable for the application. Those submitted applications that have not yet been published and cannot be downloaded may typically have no rating indicator  or a rating indicator  that shows that no such grading is available yet. In this example, none of stars are hi-lighted for a submitted application that has not yet been published and therefore has no grading. While a star system is a suitable example for a rating indicator, it is understood that other mechanisms can be used to indicate the favorability of an application, such as a color coding system or additional icons or adjustments to the application icons.","In one embodiment, the application developer portal  can assign a status indicator , which can provide information as to the stage of review for approval for a submitted application . The term \u201cstatus indicator\u201d is defined as a GUI element that provides an indication as to the stage of approval review for a particular application. As an example, the status indicator  can be presented proximate to or at least partially directly over the relevant application . The status indicator  can take on several forms, each one representing a particular state. Moreover, a status indicator section  can provide an explanation as to what each status indicator  represents.","For example, once an application  is submitted for approval, the status indicator  for that submitted application  can indicate that the submitted application is in a pending state, if the submitted application  is under review and has not yet been approved for publication by the approval portal . In another example, once a submitted application  is approved for publication, the status indicator  for the application  can indicate that the application  has been approved for publication or is in an approved state. In yet another example, once an approved application  is published in one or more application repositories, the status indicator  can indicate that the application  is in a published state. In contrast, if a submitted application  is rejected for approval for publication, the status indicator  can indicate that the submitted application  has been rejected or is in a rejected state.","In one arrangement, following the submission of an application , an application developer or some other suitable entity may have the opportunity to upgrade the application . This process can involve any suitable type of modification, such as debugging or adding new features to the application . In this case, if a submitted application  is upgraded, the status indicator  can indicate that the application  has been upgraded. These upgrades can occur once an application  is submitted for approval for publication (i.e., a submitted application), once the application  has been published or after it has been rejected.","The status indicator  may indicate multiple states for a particular application , if applicable. For example, if a submitted application  yet to be approved has been upgraded, then the status indicator  can indicate both states (i.e., submitted and upgraded) for the submitted application . Moreover, the status indicator  can change its indication to reflect modifications in the state of an application  once such modifications occur.","Several examples of indications for the status indicator  are presented in . It is understood, however, that the interface  is not limited to these particular examples, as any suitable form of indicating the state of an application  can be employed here. Such forms of the status indicator  can include the use of various colors, shapes and different insignia.","In one arrangement, the application developer portal , through the interface , can be configured to present information associated with a submitted application  uploaded by, for example, an application developer. The application developer portal  can be further configured to enable the selection of the information, such as prior to the uploaded application being submitted for approval. Referring to , an application presentation page  is shown, which can present such information. For example, a user can select an application , and the application presentation page  can present various types of information associated with the selected application . Information can be displayed for one or more applications , and the selected application  can be in any one of the states described above (e.g., pending, approved, etc.).","Some examples of information that can be presented for a selected application  include an application name , an application category , an application version , an application rating , a licensing model , a price , a description , a log of edits , promotional text  or a language selection . In addition, a status\/release stage , which can correspond to the status indicator , can be presented for the selected application . An update date  (if appropriate) and a creation date  can be shown for the submitted application . The rating indicator  can also be presented for the submitted application , if desired.","The application category  can identify a category to which the selected application  belongs. Examples include social networking, gaming, finance, media, etc. The application version  can identify the version of the selected application  (a higher number may indicate a more recent version), while the application rating  can show a rating that has been assigned to the selected application . Examples of such ratings include one that signifies that the application is suitable for all ages, one that indicates that the application is intended for mature audiences and one that shows that the application has no rating. Other ratings may be used here, as the examples listed above are not meant to be limiting.","The licensing model  identifies the licensing arrangement that is available for the selected application . For example, the licensing model  can be a floating license, a free license, a pay license, a subscription-based license or a volume license. In particular, the floating license can be a pool of active licenses that is limited to a certain number of licenses, but members who are part of this number of licenses can be freely exchanged. For example, a company may be granted ten licenses for an application. While the number of licenses at any one time may be limited to ten, employees who are part of this group of ten licenses may be swapped with other employees to permit selective access to other workers. In the case of a free license, no financial transaction is required for download and use of the application , while a pay license can be a one-time, up-front payment to do so. A subscription-based license is one in which a user may pay on a periodic basis for use of an application , which may remain in place so long as the payments continue to be made. A volume license is one in which discounts may be given for relatively large number of licensees, and the discount may increase as the number of licensees rises. The price  can indicate the amount of money involved for any of the licenses described above.","The description  can be, for example, text that explains the operation of the selected application  and any other relevant points. The log of edits  can display all or a portion of any modifications or notes related to such modifications that are involved with the selected application . The promotional text  can present information related to any program or effort to entice users to download and install, whether permanently or on a trial basis, the selected application .","In addition to presenting information associated with the selected application , the application presentation page  can enable any of the information described above to be modified. For example, a developer of the selected application  can determine what type of licensing model  will be assigned to the application  and the price  associated with such determination. As part of the presentation and modification of the information of the application presentation page , the language selection  can enable the application developer or some other party to select the language in which such information will be presented or modified.","The application presentation page  can provide functionality to enable a party to submit the selected application  for approval for publication in an application repository. For example, a publish initiator  can be activated, which can, in response, forward the selected application  to the approval portal  for approval. In another arrangement, the application presentation page  can provide a removal initiator , which, upon being activated, can remove the selected application  from consideration for approval by the approval portal . The application developer or some other suitable party may wish to take this step if it is deemed, for example, that the selected application  is not ready for review by the approval portal .","The application presentation page  may also present one or more features to enable testing of a selected application . For example, the application developer portal  can be configured to push the uploaded (i.e., selected) application  to a testing device, such as a portable computing device . Once pushed to the testing device, the selected and pushed application  can be tested to determine its suitability for submission to the approval portal . Any suitable entity can perform the testing, such as (but not limited to) the application developer. As another example, the application developer portal  can be configured to pull the application  from the testing device, which can be done, for example, following the completion of the testing phase at the application developer portal . Additional discussion on this feature will be presented below.","The application presentation page  may include several tabs , the selection of which may present different types of information to be displayed or otherwise available. For example, the selection of a tab  labeled with the word \u201cGeneral\u201d can cause the information described above in relation to . In addition, the selection of a tab  labeled with the word \u201cFiles\u201d can cause the application developer portal  to display a file page  that presents information related to the files associated with the selection application , an example of which is shown in . In one arrangement, the files that are part of the selected application  and that are uploaded when the application  was submitted for approval can be shown here.","Similarly, selection of a tab  noted with the word \u201cComments\u201d can cause the portal  to show a comments page , an example of which is shown in . Here, the comments of application developers, testing personnel, administrators or any other suitable entities that are related to the selected application  can be presented here. These comments can relate to various aspects of the application , such as its features, its performance, its information presented in the General tab , etc. The comments page  can also enable replies to be submitted in response to any comment presented on the comments page .","Another example of a tab  is one labeled with the term \u201cStatistics.\u201d Selection of this tab  can cause the application developer portal  to present a statistics page , an example of which is shown in . Any suitable statistic associated with the selected application  can be displayed on the statistics page . For example, if the selected application  has been published, the number of times that the application  has been published and the amount of revenue associated with these downloads can be presented. As another example, the grade from the rating indicator  and any reviews of the application  can be presented here. In addition, the number of deletions from units that have installed the application  and the rank of the application , as compared to other published applications , can also be displayed. These examples here are not meant to be limiting, as other suitable types of statistics can be presented on the statistics page . Moreover, the application developer portal  can be configured to present other types of tabs , as those described here are intended to be exemplary in nature.","The application developer portal  can be configured to provide a publication indicator  and a removal indicator . The publication indicator  and the removal indicator  can be part of, for example, the application presentation page , the file page , the comments page  and the statistics page . When the application developer or any other suitable party is ready to submit the application  for approval, the application developer or party can activate a publication indicator . This step can cause the generation of a publication command, and in response, the application developer portal  can forward the application  to the approval portal . If the application developer or some other party does not believe that the application  is ready to be submitted, the application developer of the party has the option to remove the application  from the application developer portal  by activating the removal indicator .","As noted earlier, an application  can be pushed to or pulled from a testing device. Any suitable computing device can serve as a testing device, and the testing can be performed by any suitable entity (i.e., not just the application developer). To facilitate this process, the interface  can present a devices page , which can list one or more testing devices  and an example of which is shown in . The devices page  can be accessed through a devices tab . Although not so limited, the testing devices  can be listed according to a MAC address, and the devices pages  can also present a short description of the testing devices and when they were added as a testing device. A user can select an add button  to add a testing device to the devices page  to enable such a device to begin testing submitted applications . To push an application  to or pull an application  from a testing device , a push\/pull indicator  can be activated. As an example, the push\/pull indicator  can be part of the application presentation page , the file page , the comments page  and the statistics page .","As an option, a user can select one of the testing devices  to determine additional information about the selected testing device  or to make edits or selections associated with the selected testing device . When such a testing device  is selected, a device information page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . As an example, the MAC address of the testing device  can be shown, along with the date the testing device  was added and any update dates associated with the device . The type of firmware installed on the testing device  can be hi-lighted, and additional firmware versions that the testing device  can be flashed with can also be presented. As explained earlier in relation to the portable computing devices , when the testing device  is flashed with one of these firmware selections, the testing device  can take on a look and feel of an entity that is associated with the selected firmware.","In another arrangement, any applications  that are installed on the testing device  for testing can be presented on the devices page , such as through selection of an applications tab . Moreover, a testing device  can be removed as a testing device  via selection of a removal button  and can be messaged, such as through activation of a message button . The devices page  is certainly not limited to the features and arrangements described above, as other elements can be presented here in accordance with other suitable placements.","An application developer may be a single individual or entity or may consist of a group of individuals or entities. If the application developer is comprised of several individuals or entities, there may be a desire to shield sensitive information from some of these individuals or entities. For example, a first company may contract with a second company to develop applications to be uploaded to the application developer portal . As noted above, information related to the performance of an application  may be presented on the home page , and, as an example, the first company may consider such information to be confidential and not to be released or disclosed to the second company. The interface  can be configured to accommodate the privacy concerns of one or more individuals or entities in situations like this.","For example, the home page  can include a tab , which when selected, can present an interface (not shown) that can be similar to the interface  but without displaying sensitive information. That is, a restricted interface can be presented to portions of an application developer team that enables these members to provide applications  in a fashion similar to that described above; however, these members will not be given access to certain types of information, like that related to the performance of an application . Moreover, this restricted interface may also prevent these members from activating certain features that were described above in relation to the interface . For example, these restricted members may not be given the opportunity to cause the transmission of uploaded applications  to the approval portal , with such feature being reserved for a supervisory or managing entity.","As previously explained, applications  that are uploaded to the application developer portal  can be forwarded to the approval portal  where they can be evaluated for possible publication in one or more application repositories. One example of an interface  that facilitates such an approval process is shown in . The interface  can include an applications page , which can be accessed via an applications tab . The applications page , in one arrangement, can present one or more applications  that are pending, or waiting to be approved for publication in one or more application repositories. As such, when an application developer uploads an application  in the application developer portal  and releases the application  for approval, the application  can be presented here on the applications page . Once the submitted application  has been received at the approval portal , the approval portal  can signal the application developer portal  (see ), which can notify the application developer through any suitable manner, such as through displaying one or more messages on the application developer portal .","As part of presenting applications  on the applications page , information related to the submitted applications  can be displayed. Examples include a brief description of the application , the application developer, the category to which the application  pertains, the version of the application  and the date of the last update of the application . Of course, not all this information is required to be presented as part of the applications page , and other suitable pieces of information about an application  can be shown here. Moreover, although the applications  shown here are pending applications  that are awaiting approval, applications  that have been approved or published may be presented here, as well. In fact, the applications  presented on the applications page  can be tagged with status indicators and\/or ratings indicators, similar to those shown in .","From the applications page , an entity that is assigned to approve a submitted application  can select one of the applications . Once selected, an application review page  can be presented to the entity, an example of which is shown in . Here, the approval portal , through the application review page , can provide information associated with the submitted application  that has been selected.","In one arrangement, the information to be presented can be similar to that described in relation to . In particular, the application review page  can present the application name , the application category , the application version , the application rating , the licensing model , the price , the description , the log of edits  or the promotional text . As an option, the information can also include a language selection (not shown here). In addition, a status\/release stage , an update date  (if appropriate) and a creation date  can be shown for the submitted application . The status\/release stage  can also be presented, which can indicate the stage at which the submitted application  is currently situated. The rating indicator  can also be presented for the submitted application , if desired.","As noted earlier, this information can be based on selections made by the application developer, so corresponding information presented here on the application review page  can be of similar type and content to that of . Of course, the application review page  is not necessarily limited in this regard, as other types of information may also be included. Although in most arrangements, the entity responsible for approving the application  may not alter this information (due to it normally being selected by the application developer), the interface  can be configured to accommodate such a feature.","The interface  can also present a files page , which can be accessed through a tab . An example of the files page  is shown in . As an example, the files that are associated with the selected application  can be presented here. In addition, a comments page (not shown) can be accessed by a tab , which can permit users to provide or view comments. For example, during testing, those responsible for approving the submitted application  can provide their comments here, and comments from the application developer or some other suitable entity can be displayed here. A statistics page  can also be part of the interface , an example of which is shown in , and can be accessed through a tab . Information presented on the statistics page  can be related to, for example, the performance of the selected application . In one arrangement, the elements that make up the statistics page  can be similar to those described in relation to , although other parameters can be presented here.","The interface  of the approval portal  can be further configured to enable a user to approve or reject the submitted application for selective publication in one or more application repositories. For example, referring back to , application review page  can include an approval indicator  and a rejection indicator . The approval indicator  or the rejection indicator  can also be part of the files page  (see ), the comments page and\/or the statistics page  (see ). One or more entities can review, test and\/or analyze the submitted application  to determine whether to approve the submitted application for selective publication in an application repository. The term \u201cselective publication,\u201d in relation to an application repository, is defined as the actual publication of an application in an application repository such that the application is ready for download from the repository or an indication that the application is in a condition that would permit it to be published in an application repository.","As part of this process, the entity responsible for determining the suitability of the submitted application  can ensure that the application  meets or does not violate a set of predefined criteria. In one arrangement, the predefined criteria can be selected by an entity that is responsible for managing or overseeing an application repository in which the submitted application  is to be published. Of course, other suitable entities can select the predefined criteria for approval. In addition, any suitable party can be tasked with approving or rejecting the submitted applications, examples of which will be presented later.","The predefined criteria against which the submitted applications  are to be reviewed can include any suitable restriction or parameter. For example, the criteria may specify that the application  cannot contain content that is not suited for children. Moreover, the criteria may forbid the collection of certain forms of data by the application , like personal information related to a user or to the user's family. The criteria may also require that the application  meet certain security requirements, particularly if the application  will facilitate financial transactions. These examples for the predefined criteria are not meant to be limiting, as virtually any suitable requirement can be part of the criteria. Further, the predefined criteria for a first application repository may or may not be the same for a second or more application repositories. As part of the approval process, the party responsible for approving the submitted application  can also ensure that the application  is in working order and that it is substantially free of programming of functional defects.","To facilitate the review of the submitted applications , the interface  can present a testing devices page , an example of which is shown in . The testing devices page  can be accessed through a tab  and can present a listing of all testing devices  (identified here through their MAC addresses) that can be used to test submitted applications . The information presented on the testing devices page  can be similar to that of the devices page  of the application developer portal  (see ), although different types of information can be displayed if desired. Testing devices  can be added through an addition button . Moreover, selection of one of the testing devices  can present information and features here that are similar to those presented in relation to  (including the presentation of installed applications and firmware versions on the testing devices ). Applications  can be pushed to or pulled from the testing devices  through a push\/pull button , which can be positioned on, for example, the application review page  (see ), the files page  (see ), the comments page and\/or the statistics page  (see ).","Once the party responsible for reviewing the submitted application  determines that the application  meets the requirements for publication in an application repository, that party can select the approval indicator , such as displayed on the application review page  (see ). The approval portal  can be configured to notify the application developer portal  of the approval in response to the selection of the approval indicator . The application developer portal  can take any appropriate steps to ensure that the application developer has been made aware of the approval. For example, the application developer portal  can generate messages to be displayed or broadcast at the portal  or at some other suitable component.","In addition, the approval portal  can be configured to notify other computing devices of the approval of the submitted application . For example, referring to , the approval portal  can signal the administrator portal  about the approval of the application . As part of this process, the approval portal  can also forward the approved application  to the administrator portal . In one arrangement, the other computing device, such as the administrator portal , can be configured to notify operators of one or more application repositories of the approval of the submitted application . This process can also involve the receipt of the approved application  by the operators of the application repositories. This process will be explained in detail below.","If, however, the party responsible for reviewing the submitted application  determines that the application  fails to meet the requirements for publication, that party can select the rejection indicator  (see, for example, ). The approval portal  can be configured to notify the application developer portal  of the rejection in response to the selection of the rejection indicator . Similar to the process described above in relation to the receipt of an approval notice, the application developer portal  can take action to inform the application developer and\/or any other suitable parties. As part of this feature, the notification may include rejection information that explains why the submitted application  was not approved. This information can be prepared by the party that conducted the review of the application or by some other suitable party. As an example, the rejection information may specify that the submitted application  contains content that is unsuitable for children or does not include certain mandatory security features. This rejection information may also provide guidance for the application developer to modify the rejected application  to ensure its approval during a subsequent review. At this point, the application developer can modify or upgrade the rejected application  and can submit it again in accordance with the discussion presented above.","Referring back to , as previously explained, the administrator portal  is a system that enables the distribution of approved applications to one or more entities or components. Once it receives an approved application, from the approval portal , the administrator portal  can, for example, push the application to one or more of the portable computing devices  (see ) through the managed services platform  (see ) or can cause the application to be published in an application repository or to become part of a bundle.","The administrator portal  may also perform one or more other processes once it receives the approved application, either in lieu of or in addition to the steps listed above. For example, the administrator portal  can forward the approved application to one or more of the client portals , which can serve as a notice that the application is available for publication in one or more application repositories. The client portals  can, for example, make determinations as to whether to publish the approved application in an application repository. Moreover, the client portal  may facilitate the availability\/publication of applications for the sub-client portals , such as for application repositories associated with the entities that oversee or operate the sub-client portals . For example, if the client portal  decides to publish the submitted application in an application repository, the client portal  can forward the application to one or more of the sub-client portals . At this point, the sub-client portals  can determine whether to publish the application on an application repository associated with the entity overseeing or operating the sub-client portal . Examples of this process will now be presented.","The administrator portal  (see ) can be, for example, a managed services computing device. The portal  can be made up of one or more components and can be operated by any suitable entity. A block diagram of an example of the administrator portal  is shown in . In particular, the portal  can include one or more user interface elements  that can be configured to enable a user to make selections associated with the management of services for a first client and a second client. As an example, the user interface elements  can include a display  (which can be a touch-screen display or a conventional display), a keyboard or keypad , a mouse or other pointing object  or a remote device  (a component or a group of components that permit a user to enter data from a remote location). In fact, any device that enables a user to enter data into an electronic device can serve as a user interface element . The administrator portal  can also include memory , an approval portal interface , one or more client portal interfaces , a testing interface  and a processor . The portal  can also have a managed services platform interface .","The memory  can be any combination of temporary memory and persistent memory, and the approval portal interface  can be used to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with the approval portal . Similarly, the client portal interfaces  and the testing interface  can be used to facilitate wired and\/or wireless communications with the client portals  (see ) and testing devices (not shown), respectively. The processor  can be coupled to each of the components described above and can be operable to execute operations that will be described herein.","Similar to the application developer portal  and the approval portal , the administrator portal  can present an interface that can enable a user to manage services for devices\/portals associated with the administrator portal . As part of this configuration, the administrator portal  can be communicatively coupled with a managed services platform , an example of which was previously described in relation to . The managed services platform interface  can accommodate such communications, whether wireless and\/or wired. As such, the administrator portal  can communicate with a plurality of portable computing devices  via the DMS server . Moreover, the administrator portal  can be associated with an application repository  via the application server . As will be described below, the administrator portal  can manage portable computing devices  and the application repository  through this arrangement.","As noted above, the managed services system  can include one or more client portals  (see ). In one arrangement, the client portals  can be communicatively coupled to the administrator portal . The administrator portal  can have a relationship with the client portals , which, as will be fleshed out below, can range from relatively low cooperation in providing applications to a more extensive managerial function.","An example of a block diagram of a client portal  is shown in . The structure of the client portal  can be similar to that of the administrator portal , although the client portal  is not so limited. In one arrangement, the client portal  can include one or more user interface elements  that can permit a user to make selections associated with the management of services for, for example, a first sub-client and a second sub-client. As an example, the user interface elements  can include a display  (touch-screen or conventional), a keyboard\/keypad , a pointing object  or a remote device . As with the administrator portal , any device that enables a user to enter data into an electronic device can serve as a user interface element . The client portal  can also include memory  (persistent and\/or temporary), an administrator portal interface , one or more sub-client portal interfaces , a testing interface  and a processor . The client portal  can also have a managed services platform interface .","The administrator portal interface  allows for wireless and\/or wired communications with the administrator portal , while the sub-client portal interface allows for the same with the sub-client portals  (see ). The testing interface  permits wired and\/or wireless communications with one or more testing devices (not shown). Also like the administrator portal , the client portal  can be communicatively coupled (wired and\/or wireless) with a managed services platform  through the managed services platform interface . This arrangement allows the client portal  to communicate with a plurality of portable computing devices  via the DMS server  and to be associated with an application repository  via the AS server . As such, the client portal  can manage portable computing devices  and the application repository  through this arrangement.","As noted above, the managed services system  can include one or more sub-client portals  (see ). In one arrangement, the sub-client portals  can be communicatively coupled to a client portal . The client portal  can have a relationship with the sub-client portals  in which the client portals  can provide services to the sub-client portals , examples of which will be presented below. This structure can also allow the administrator portal  to have a relationship with a sub-client portal , if desired. Examples to which the level of services the administrator portal  can provide to a sub-client portal  will also be presented later.","The sub-client portals  can have a structure that is similar to that of the client portals  presented in . The components can be essentially the same, which can permit the sub-client portals  to communicate with a managed services platform , like the client portal  and the administrator portal . The sub-client portal , however, can include a client portal interface (not shown) to communicate with the client portal . In addition, this model is scalable, meaning that additional layers can be added to the system  (see ). That is, the system  can include, for example, sub-sub-clients portals (not shown), which can be communicatively coupled with a sub-client portal . In this case, the sub-client portal  can have a sub-sub-client portal interface (not shown) to permit wireless and\/or wired communications with a sub-sub-client. In one arrangement, each successive portal in this scalable arrangement, like the sub-sub-client portal, can also communicate with portable computing devices  through the DMS server  and can be associated with an application repository  through the AS server .","Referring back to , a brief overview of some of the services that the administrator portal  may offer will now be presented. There are two main parts of this discussion. The first set of services offered by the administrator portal  focuses on devices that are to be directly managed by the administrator portal. For example, the administrator portal  may be operated by a company that has assigned portable computing devices  to its employees, and the company wishes to manage these devices . In one particular but non-limiting example, the company may wish to send messages to the devices  or to package applications, firmware and settings for these devices .","The second set of services offered by the administrator portal  is directed to client portals that have established relationships with the administrator portal , such as the client portals , the sub-client portals , the sub-sub-client portals or any subsequent client portals. For example, the administrator portal  can be operated by a first company, and a client portal  may be operated by a second company. The second company may wish to have the first company manage at least some services for the client portal . In one particular example, the second company may request the first company, through the administrator portal , to forward to it applications that it receives from the approval portal  that have been approved for publication in an application repository. The second company may also ask the first company to manage portable computing devices  on behalf of the second company, which can be done through the administrator portal . Additional discussion\/examples concerning these services will be described below. The material that immediately follows, however, is directed to the first set of services summarized above.","To facilitate its operation, the administrator portal  can provide an interface . One part of this interface  is shown in . In particular, an example of an applications page  is illustrated, which can be accessed through a tab . The applications page  can present one or more applications  and information that is associated with the applications . Examples of such information can include an application name, a short description, the application developer, the application category, the most recent version and the last date\/time that the application  was updated. Of course, other types of information can be presented on the applications page .","In one arrangement, the applications page  can present applications  in one or more different states or categories. For example, a tab  can be selected to show applications  that have been approved by the approval portal  and that have been received by the administrator portal . These applications  may be categorized as available applications . Another tab  can present applications  that are currently under review at the approval portal  (have not yet met an approval threshold), which may be categorized as pending applications . In yet another example, a tab  can present applications  that have been published in an application repository. These applications  can be categorized as published applications .","In one arrangement, the administrator portal  can be associated with a managing entity, and the managing entity can be assigned an application repository  (see ). For example, a managing entity can operate or control the administrator portal  or direct another entity to operate or control the portal . A managing entity can be any entity, organization, corporation or individual that is responsible for this operation or control or its direction. In addition, assigning an application repository  to the managing entity can include the production of an application repository that can be configured to present applications on behalf of the managing entity. In this case, the managing entity can determine which applications are to be part of the application repository  or can direct another individual or organization to make such determinations under the guidance of the managing entity or not. In one arrangement, the application repository  can be designed to show that it is associated with the managing entity, such as by appropriate branding of the repository .","In view of the above arrangement, the managing entity may wish to manage (or have managed) the application repository  and its contents. As such, when an application  has been approved by and received from the approval portal , the managing entity, through the administrator portal , can determine whether to publish the approved application in the application repository  that is assigned to the managing entity.","To do so, one of the approved applications  under the tab  (available applications), can be selected. When selected, an application selection page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . Here, information about the approved application  can be presented, under the tab . In one arrangement, this information can be similar to that described in relation to . In particular, the application selection page  can present the application name , the application category , the application version , the application rating , the licensing model , the transactional fee or price , the description , the log of edits  or the promotional text . The information can also optionally include a language selection (not shown here). In addition, a status\/release stage , an update date  (if appropriate) and a creation date  can be shown for the submitted application . The rating indicator  (such as a cumulative user rating) can also be presented for the submitted application , if desired. The licensing model  can be selectable from one of the following arrangements: a free model; a subscription-based model; a floating model; a volume model; or a paid model. The licensing model  can be selected by the application developer or some other suitable entity, including the entity responsible for the administrator portal .","As noted earlier, this information can be based on selections made by the application developer at the application developer portal  (see ), so corresponding information presented here on the application selection page  can be of similar type and content to that of . Of course, the application selection page  is not necessarily limited in this regard, as other types of information may be so included. Although in some arrangements, the entity responsible for operation of the administrator portal  may not alter this information (due to it normally being selected by the application developer), the interface  can be configured to accommodate such a feature.","It should be noted that pending applications  (tab ) and published applications  (tab ) can be selected and their associated information displayed in this manner. Moreover, selection of a tab  can permit the viewing of or entering of comments related to pending, available or published applications , while selection of another tab  can enable the viewing of or entry of statistics for such applications .","In one arrangement, it may be desirable to test or otherwise evaluate applications , particularly applications  that are available. To do so, an application  can be, for example, pushed to or pulled from one or more testing devices (not shown). These testing devices may be associated with an entity that is responsible for operating or managing the administrator portal , such as the managing entity.","As an example, if an available application  has been chosen and the user wishes to push the application  to a testing device, the user can do so by selecting a push\/pull feature . Such a process can enable an entity to evaluate on a testing device the suitability of an application  for publication in an application repository . The criteria for determining this suitability can be similar to that described earlier in relation to the approval portal , although different parameters or values may be considered during this evaluation. Such a review, also, does not necessarily have to be as extensive as that carried out at the approval portal .","If it is determined that the available application  is suitable for publication in the application repository , then the entity operating the administrator portal  can take steps to cause the publication of the application  in the repository . For example, the entity can activate a publication feature  to cause the available application  to be published in the relevant application repository . In one arrangement, this application repository  can be assigned to or associated with a managing entity that is responsible for operating the administrator portal . Once the application  is published, anyone with access to the application repository  can install the application  on one or more portable computing devices . This installation can also occur on an automatic basis, under the direction of the managing entity. Moreover, the application  can be published in other application repositories , including repositories  that are assigned to or are associated with entities other than the managing entity. Also following publication, the application  can be shown as a published application  on the applications page  (see ).","In summary, a managing entity can operate the administrator portal  and can have an application repository  assigned to the managing entity. The administrator portal  can receive applications  that have been submitted at the application developer portal  and approved at the approval portal . To help populate the application repository , the managing entity, through the administrator portal , can cause the publication of the applications  in the repository . In one arrangement, the managing entity can be responsible for the administrator portal  and can oversee the operation of the application developer portal  and the approval portal . It is understood, however, that the arrangements described herein are not so limited. Other suitable entities (including a single party or multiple parties) can operate or be responsible for the application developer portal , the approval portal , the administrator portal  or any combination of the three.","The interface  of the administrator portal  also can enable the management of devices, such as portable computing devices . For example, referring to , an example of a devices page  is shown, which can be accessed by a tab . Here, individual portable computing devices  that are associated with the administrator portal  can be displayed and managed. For example, the managing entity may be responsible for operating the administrator portal  and may have assigned portable computing devices  to multiple individuals. In one embodiment, once a portable computing device  registers with the managed services platform  (see ), the device  can be listed on the devices page . As such, information about these devices  can be presented here. Information about testing devices for evaluating applications  may also be shown here. At least in this context, reference to a portable computing device  may also refer to a testing device such that all the features and description here may apply to both.","In one arrangement, information associated with the portable computing devices  and displayed on the devices page  can include MAC addresses, creation dates (when the device  was registered with the DMS server  or the administrator portal , for example), a description of the devices  and an application repository code. As an example, the description of a portable computing device  can include a description of the performance function associated with the device . As another example, the application repository code can provide an indication as to which application repository the portable computing device  is associated. That is, when the portable computing device  registers with the DMS server  and the AS server , a code that identifies the application repository  that is supported by the AS server  can be registered with the device . This application repository code can then be presented here at the devices page  or on some other suitable component.","As noted earlier, the administrator portal  may be operated or managed by a managing entity. This managing entity may also assign multiple portable computing devices  to numerous individuals, and these individuals may be associated with the managing entity in some way. For example, the individuals may be employees or customers of the managing entity. As such, there may be many portable computing devices  listed on the devices page . To simplify the task of locating or managing a particular portable computing device , the devices page  can be equipped with a searching module , which can be configured to enable the portable computing devices  to be searched individually. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous suitable parameters that can be used to search for individual devices , such as MAC addresses or user-friendly monikers.","Once an individual portable computing device  is identified, a user can select the identified device(s) . In response, a device details page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . Here, additional details about the selected portable computing device  can be shown by clicking a tab . For example, operational information  for the selected device  can be presented, examples of which can include the MAC address, the firmware currently installed on the device , the last date time that the device  was updated (this can refer to any suitable type of update) and the date the device  was added to the devices page .","A general name  and description  of the portable computing device  may also be shown. The description  can provide details that illustrate the purpose of the portable computing device  or the individual to whom the device  is assigned. In one arrangement, a listing  of available firmware that can be delivered to the device  can also be presented here. As explained earlier, the portable computing devices  can be flashed with various types of firmware to set or alter the look and feel of the devices . The device  can be flashed with a particular firmware simply be selecting one of the firmware version in the listing . As such, a portable computing device  can have content, such as firmware or even settings, delivered to the device  on an individual basis.","Selection of a tab  can cause the presentation of a device application page , an example of which is shown in . Here, the operational information  of the selected portable computing device  can be shown, if desired. The primary purpose of the application page , however, is to present the applications  that are installed on the selected portable computing device . The applications  that are installed on the device  can be listed in an installation list . In addition, applications  that are available to be installed on the selected portable computing device  can be presented in an available list . As an example, the applications  in the available list  can be applications  that have been published in one or more application repositories  or have been approved for publication in at least one application repository . Such application repositories  may or may not be assigned to the managing entity responsible for operating the administrator portal .","The applications  in either the installed list  or the available list  may be individual applications or may be grouped together as part of a bundle. Moreover, certain information about the applications  in either list ,  can be presented, such as the rating indicator . In addition, selection of one of the applications  in either list ,  can enable one to view additional information about the selected application , in accordance with previous descriptions.","In one arrangement, the applications  that are in the available list  can be installed on a portable computing device . In this section, because the devices page  is generally designed for interaction with portable computing devices  on an individual basis, the available applications  can be installed on a single portable computing device . For example, a user can simply select and drag an application  from the available list  to the installation list . Any suitable number of applications  can be installed on a selected portable computing device  in accordance with this manner. In addition, one or more predefined bundles or groups of applications  can be pushed to a selected portable computing device  by simply selecting such a bundle or group and dragging to the installation list .","As an additional feature, any number of application  or groups or bundles of applications  can be removed from a selected portable computing device  (an individual basis). This process can be accomplished by selecting and dragging the application(s)  from the installation list  to the available list . Of course, other suitable procedures can be followed to install applications  on the device  or to remove applications  from the device . For example, a message can be sent to the device  requesting that the user of the device  add\/remove the relevant application . As another example, a message can be sent to another entity requesting that entity to execute the installation\/removal process.","In one arrangement, the device details page , the device application page  or both can offer a messaging feature  to enable messages to be sent to portable computing devices , such as on an individual basis. For example, a message feature  can be activated on either the details page  or the application page , which can enable one to generate a message to be sent to the selected portable computing device . The message can be simply text-based or can incorporate any combination of icons, animations, audio, video, haptics, etc. Moreover, the messages can be of an ad hoc nature or can be selected from a list of predefined messages. The messages can also be generated and sent to the device  on an automatic basis based on an event or can be done so if an entity believes that the generation and transmission of a message is warranted.","The interface  can also provide information related to one or more users, as shown in . For example, a users page  can present one or more user identifications  and can be accessed by selecting a tab . In one arrangement, the user identifications  can be associated with the portable computing devices . As a more specific example, the administrator portal  and one or more portable computing devices  can be associated with the managing entity. The user identifications  can be associated with these devices ; thus, the user identifications  can be associated with the managing entity. For example, the user identifications  may represent employees, contractors, vendors or other personnel associated with the managing entity. As such, the portable computing devices  that are associated with the managing entity can include devices  that are assigned to an application repository  of the managing entity, devices  that are assigned to application developers who develop applications for the application repository  of the managing entity and devices  that are assigned to testing personnel. Of course, the users page  is not so limited, as user identifications  associated with other personnel or entities may be presented here. As will be explained later, the administrator portal  is further operable to enable access control to at least some of the portable computing devices  that are associated with the user identifications .","In one arrangement, the user identification  on the users page  can display general information  about the user. Examples include contact information, MAC address of the device  assigned to the user and\/or the date the user identification  was added to the user page . Additional information about the user can be accessed by selecting the user identification . For example, an information page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . The information page  can be accessed by selecting a tab .","Virtually any type of information associated with the user identification  can be presented on the information page . Non-limiting examples include the name or title of the user, the user's address, the user's contact information, a Web site associated with the user and a description of any relevant characteristic of the user, such as the job function of the user. Account information relating to the user, such as whether the user's account is enabled, expired or locked can also be presented. The status of any credentials assigned to the user can also be shown here. Of course, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other forms of information can be part of this presentation, and the preceding examples are certainly not meant to be limiting.","In addition, a roles page  can be accessed by selecting a tab , as shown in . Here, one or more roles  that are associated with a user identification  can be presented. A role  can be, for example, a job function, a security clearance or some other feature associated with a user. In one particular example, a role  can signify that a particular user, identified by a certain user identification , is assigned a job function of maintaining the operation of the administrator portal . A description  can provide a user-friendly explanation of the corresponding role .","Referring back to , as noted earlier, the users page  can present, among other things, one or more user identifications . In the example presented above, the user identifications  presented on the users page  may be associated with a managing entity that oversees the operation of the administrator portal . To be clear, the users associated with the user identifications  may serve various roles under the managing entity. As such, these users can be grouped in one of several possible categories to make the management of the user identifications  easier. For example, the categories can be created based on certain job functions performed by the users. Categories may also be created for vendors or contractors, including the application developers and users responsible for reviewing and approving submitted applications. To access such categories, one of several tabs  can be selected. Moreover, a search function (not shown) can be incorporated into the users page  or some other suitable interface to enable searching of the user identifications . User identifications  can be added through an addition feature  or deleted by a deletion feature . Some of the information presented herein may be the same for different users, particularly if such users share a single portable computing device .","As previously explained, firmware or other software packages can be made available to one or more portable computing devices , such as through the managed services platform . Moreover, such a package can be selected at the administrator portal  for delivery to a portable computing device  by making selections at the device details page  (see ). To facilitate this feature, the interface  can include a firmware page , which can be accessed through a tab . An example of the firmware page  is shown in . As an example, the firmware page  can present one or more different firmware packages . A firmware package  is not necessarily limited to firmware, as other forms of software, operational settings and parameters may be part of a firmware package .","As also explained earlier, the receipt of a firmware package  at a portable computing device  can cause the device  to incorporate a certain look and feel associated with that firmware package . For example, the managing entity may wish to assign such devices  to its employees, and the managing entity, through the administrator portal , can direct a particular firmware package  to these devices . This firmware package  can be configured to cause the devices  that receive the package  to, for example, display user interface elements that are associated with the managing entity. The managing entity can develop the firmware package  on its own or can direct another party to do so on the managing entity's behalf. It is understood, however, that the firmware package  associated with the managing entity can be delivered to portable computing devices  that are not necessarily associated with or assigned by the managing entity. Moreover, the firmware packages  presented on the firmware page  are not necessarily limited to the managing entity that operates the administrator portal , as the firmware page  can receive packages  from any suitable party.","As part of the presentation of the firmware packages , the firmware page  can provide information about such packages . Non-limiting examples include the entity to which a firmware package  is associated, the date the package  was created and the date that the package  was last updated. Moreover, an addition feature  can be provided as part of the firmware page , which can allow firmware packages  to be uploaded to the administrator portal . The firmware packages  can also be updated by activating an update feature . When a firmware package  is updated, the administrator portal  can generate a notification. This notification can inform a user or another entity that such an update is available for a particular firmware package . Steps can then be taken to ensure that the relevant portable computing devices  or other components receive the update.","In one arrangement, the firmware page  can provide a search feature , which can permit a user to search for particular firmware packages . In another arrangement, the system  (see ) can be configured to enable firmware packages  to be submitted, approved and delivered to portable computing devices , similar to the process described with respect to the publication of applications . Additional details concerning this feature will be presented below.","The concept of providing bundles to one or more portable computing devices  was previously described. For example, a bundle may contain content that at least includes one or more configuration settings (including firmware packages) or messages, an application set that contains one or more predefined applications or both. To accommodate this feature, the interface  can provide a bundles page , which can be accessed by a tab . An example of a bundles page  is shown in . In one arrangement, the bundles page  can present one or more bundles , and the bundles  may contain similar or dissimilar content in comparison to one another.","In one particular example, the bundles may be designed for portable computing devices  that are associated with an entity that is managing the administrator portal  or directing another party to manage the portal . That is, the bundles  may be designed for and assigned to portable computing devices  that are associated with the managing entity. As noted earlier, there may be individuals, like employees, contractors, vendors, etc., who are associated with the managing entity and who have been assigned a portable computing device . These individuals may have one or more performance functions based on their relationship with the managing entity. For example, the managing entity may have assigned portable computing devices  to members of a sales team of the managing entity and to executives of the managing entity. Examples of a sales team bundle or sales bundle  and an executive team bundle or executive bundle  are shown in .","In view of the performance functions of the individuals associated with the managing entity, the bundles  can be assigned to one or more performance functions, and the bundles can contain information that is based on their assigned performance functions. In addition, the information contained in the bundles can include one or more configuration settings, one or more applications or both, and the configuration settings and the applications can be arranged based on the assigned performance functions. For example, consider the sales team associated with the managing entity. The managing entity can develop or instruct another party to develop bundles  that are geared towards the performance function of the members of the sales team, i.e., sales. As an example, the settings and applications in the bundle  can be selected based on their ability to assist a member of the sales team in his\/her duties. This process can lead to the creation of the sales bundle . The executive bundle  can be created in a similar manner.","The bundles  can be created by any suitable party. As an example, the managing entity can generate the bundles  for the portable computing devices  that are associated with the managing entity. Alternatively, the managing entity can direct another party to prepare the bundles , with the managing entity providing at least some input, for the portable computing devices . Any suitable criteria can be used to determine the type of content that is to be part of a bundle , such as employee or management feedback and input from consultants or the manufacturer(s) of the portable computing devices . In one arrangement, the applications that are part of the bundle  can be selected from the application repository  associated with the managing entity or an application repository  associated with any other suitable party.","Because the bundles  can be created based on different performance functions, it is anticipated that the content may be different for various bundles . Some bundles , however, may contain identical or at least similar content, even if they are designed for different performance functions. Moreover, one or more bundles  or even each bundle  may contain one or more default items or settings that are to be deployed to each associated portable computing device . Default items or settings may also apply across particular team bundles . For example, the managing entity may wish that a particular application be installed on each portable computing device  associated with the managing entity or on every portable computing device  that is assigned to members of a sales team that is associated with the managing entity. In fact, bundles  that only contain default items or settings can be created for delivery to all or a portion of relevant portable computing devices .","Once a bundle  is created, the bundle  can be added to the bundles pages , such as by selection of an addition feature . These bundles  can be selectively distributed to the relevant portable computing devices  through the managed services platform  (see  and related discussion). In another arrangement, a search feature  can be incorporated into the bundles page  to search for a particular bundle .","Similar to processes described above, additional information about a particular bundle  can be gleaned by selecting the bundle  from the bundles page . In addition, the content of a bundle  can be edited. For example, the configuration settings or the applications in a bundle  may be modified. To facilitate these features, a bundle application page  can be presented as part of the interface . This page  can be accessed by selecting a tab , and an example of the page  is shown in .","In one embodiment, general information  that is associated with the selected bundle  can be presented on the bundle application page . The general information  can be metadata about the bundle . Examples of the general information  can include the name of the bundle , the application repository  to which the bundle  is assigned (or to be assigned), a role name (which can give an indication as to the performance function related to the bundle ), an update date (last time the bundle  was updated) and\/or the creation date of the bundle .","Additional metadata about the bundle  that can be part of the bundle application page  can include a firmware package  that is assigned to the bundle , whether location services  are enabled for the bundle  and whether an application repository permission  is allowed. Location services  can include services or features that are designed to determine the whereabouts of a portable computing device  and, hence, the user of the device . Thus, when enabled, the administrator portal  or some other component or entity can monitor the whereabouts of the relevant portable computing device . Further, the application repository permission  is a setting that enables the relevant portable computing device  to download and install applications from one or more application repositories . When allowed, the device  can be granted permission to execute such downloads\/installations. This permission can be extended to multiple application repositories , each of which may or may not be associated with the administrator portal  or, for example, the managing entity described above. The application repository permission  can also be configured to identify the application repositories  to which the permission extends.","As another example, the bundle application page  can show the applications  that are part of the selected bundle . These applications  can be listed in accordance with any suitable protocol, and default applications  can be tagged with an indicator (not shown) designating them as such. Additional information about the applications  can be accessed by selecting an application , in accordance with previous descriptions (see ). As part of this listing, a desktop indicator  and a removable indicator  can be provided. As an example, if the desktop indication  is selected or activated, then a shortcut for the application  may be installed on a display of the relevant portable computing device . As another example, if the removable indicator  is selected or activated, then the relevant portable computing device  may have permission to remove, uninstall or otherwise deactivate the application .","As noted above, certain configuration settings may be part of the content of a bundle . In one embodiment, the bundle  can include VPN settings and Wi-Fi settings, although the bundle  is certainly not limited to these particular examples. Referring to , an example of a VPN page  is shown, which can be accessed by selecting the tab . As is known in the art, a VPN can allow for secure communications for a mobile device. As such, a party that assigns or causes to be assigned portable computing devices  to one or more individuals can ensure secure communications between the devices  and other components by incorporating VPN information\/settings into a bundle  to be delivered to one or more devices .","Any suitable type of information can be part of the VPN page . Several examples of such information can include the general information  associated with the bundle , a VPN perfect forward security (PFS) indication  (if selected, then VPN PFS may be required for the relevant portable computing device ), a group name , a gateway address , a group password  and an IKE Hash . Other suitable examples of information that can be presented on the VPN page  can include a domain name , a vendor type  (related to the VPN), an IKE cipher , an IPsec cipher and hash  and an IKE DH group . It is understood that the VPN page  is certainly not limited to these particular examples, as other suitable parameters or settings can be presented here.","Referring to , an example of a Wi-Fi page  is shown, which can be accessed by the tab . Similar to the VPN page , the Wi-Fi page  can present the general information  about the bundle . As is known in the art, a Wi-Fi connection can be useful for establishing communications between two or more wireless components, like the portable computing device  and some other wireless unit. As such, information useful for establishing a Wi-Fi connection for the relevant portable computing device  can be part of the bundle . Examples of such information can include a Wi-Fi security protocol , an SSID , a default key ID  and one or more security keys , such as WEP keys. The Wi-Fi page , however, is not limited to these particular examples, as other suitable parameters or settings can be presented here. Moreover, additional pages can be part of the interface  if additional wireless or wired communication protocols are to be used with the portable computing devices . For example, dedicated pages can be created for short range wireless standards\/protocols, like Bluetooth or IEEE 802.15.4, or for wide area networks, both wired and wireless. Additional certificates (not shown) that may be applicable to the VPN page , the Wi-Fi page  or both can be part of the information described above.","In one arrangement, the content of a bundle  can be edited\/modified. To do so, an editing feature  can be activated. The editing feature  can be incorporated into any one of the bundle application page , the VPN page  or the Wi-Fi page  (see ). When activated, a general editing page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . The general editing page  can be accessed by selecting a tab . Here, one or more configuration settings of the relevant bundle  can be modified.","For example, a VPN settings indicator  can be selected to require that the portable computing device  that receives the bundle  uses a VPN when conducting communications. Other exemplary settings that can be altered for the bundle  include the location services , which can be enabled or disabled, and whether the application repository permission  is allowed or disallowed. In another arrangement, a firmware package  can be selected (or changed) to serve as a default firmware package  for the bundle . It is understood that the general editing page  is not limited to the examples listed above, as other configurations settings can be presented here for editing.","Referring to , an example of a VPN editing page , which can be accessed by selecting a tab , is shown. Here, any one of the VPN PFS indication , the group name , the gateway address , the group password , the IKE Hash , the domain name , the vendor type , the IKE cipher , the IPsec cipher and hash  or the IKE DH group  can be edited in any suitable fashion. Referring to , an example of a Wi-Fi editing page  is shown. The Wi-Fi editing page  can be selected through the tab . Here, any one of the Wi-Fi security protocol , the SSID , the default key ID  or the security keys  can be modified in any suitable fashion. A certificates editing page , an example of which is shown in , can also be presented. The certificates editing page , which can be accessed through the tab , can enable the uploading or removal of any suitable type of certificate  for the bundle .","Referring to , an example of an application editing page  is illustrated, which can be accessed by selecting the tab . The application editing page  can permit applications  to be added to or removed from the bundle . These applications  can be designated for a particular bundle , and at least some of them may be considered default applications , either for an entire collection of portable computing devices  or for those devices  that are part of a group (e.g., a sales team or a team of executives).","In one arrangement, the application editing page  can include a bundle application listing  and an available application listing . The bundle application listing  can show the applications  that are currently included as content for the bundle , while the available application listing  can list those applications  that are not currently part of the content for the bundle  but that may be available for being included in the content. Additional information about any of these applications  can be accessed, such as by selecting an application , as described earlier. Here, a user can add applications  to the bundle  by simply clicking and dragging applications  from the available application listing  to the bundle application listing . Applications  can also be removed from the bundle  by clicking and dragging applications  from the bundle application listing  to the available application listing . In any one of the editing pages described above, any edits made can be saved by selecting a save button  or canceled by choosing a cancel button .","Once a bundle  is generated, the bundle  can be stored at any suitable location. For example, a bundle  can be stored in an application repository  for eventual delivery to one or more portable computing devices . Thus, the content of a bundle  may be stored on a portable computing device , in the application repository  (i.e., the AS server ) or some other component. To ensure that any edits made at the editing pages () are properly disseminated, the administrator portal  can signal such modifications to the managed services platform  and to the portable computing devices  through the heart beating process (see ). Consequently, any edits made at the editing pages can be dynamically applied to the bundles  that are part of the application repository  or that have already been delivered to a portable computing device . As an option, these edits can be propagated according to a predefined schedule to minimize disruptions, as opposed to near real-time delivery.","In view of this description, it is possible to provide content or make modifications to a group of portable computing devices , i.e., a group basis. For example, an operator of the administrator portal , such as the managing entity, could push applications, firmware updates or operational settings to an identified group of portable computing devices . Thus, the devices  assigned to, for example, a specific sales team could be updated with limited interruption to the members of the team.","The interface  can also provide features to manage portable computing devices  on a larger, even global, scale. Referring to , an example of a management page  is shown, and the management page  can be accessed by selecting a tab . As part of the page , a hierarchical arrangement  can be displayed, which can show the relationship between the administrator portals , the client portals  and the sub-client portals  (see also ). An oversight portal  can also be part of the arrangement , the structure\/function of which will be explained below. Additional information will also be provided later to describe the relationship between the entities of the arrangement . For now, however, the discussion will focus on the administrator portal .","The administrator portal  of the arrangement  can be selected on the management page . Referring to , an example of an application repository information page  is shown, which can be reached by selecting an administrator portal  on the management page  and a tab  in . As explained previously, the administrator portal  can have one or more application repositories  assigned to the administrator portal  (and, thus, to the entity that oversees operations of the administrator portal , like the managing entity). The information page  can provide information  about the application repository  assigned to the administrator portal  and, for example, the managing entity. Examples of such information relating to the application repository  include a name , a code  that identifies the repository , a description  and a key  (such as a security key) for the application repository . Any one of the name , the code  or the description  can identify the party responsible for the application repository , such as the managing entity. Additional examples include a creation date  and a most recent update date  for the application repository . In one arrangement, an identification code  for a parent application repository  and\/or an identification code  for a central application repository  can be provided. Additional information about a parent and a central application repository  will be provided later. It is understood that other suitable types of information about the application repository  can be presented on the application repository information page  or some other suitable location or medium.","Selection of a tab  can enable a user to choose from one or more default pages that present information about default settings or parameters for portable computing devices . In one arrangement, these portable computing devices  can be assigned to a particular application repository , such as the one identified on the application repository information page  (see ). As such, these devices  can be associated with the entity responsible for the application repository , such as the managing entity. In one arrangement, these default pages can permit the managing entity to manage all the devices  assigned to the application repository . As an example, this process can enable global management of the devices  assigned to a particular entity.","For example, a general default page , an example of which is shown in , can be accessed by selecting a tab . Here, several default settings that apply to the portable computing devices  that are under the control of the party operating the administrator portal , such as the managing entity, are presented. The default settings can be a package of operating conditions, settings, applications, parameters, etc. that the managing entity wishes to have applied to the portable computing devices  under its control. In one arrangement, delivery of this content can be in the form of a bundle, similar to the configuration and processes explained in relation to , the difference being that this content may consist of the minimal requirements designed for all portable computing devices  associated with the administrator portal .","As an example, on the general default page , default information like a VPN setting , a firmware package , a location services setting  and an application repository permission setting  can be presented. These settings can be similar to those described with respect to the bundles  of . As such, the default information\/settings presented here can be applied to the portable computing devices  when these devices  register with the managed services platform . As will be explained below, edits can be made to these default information\/settings and can be propagated to the devices  through the managed services platform . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other default information can be presented on the general default page , and such page  is certainly not limited to these examples.","Referring to , an example of a default certificates page  is shown, which can be accessed via the tab . Like general default page , the default certificates page  can be assigned to the tab . The default certificates page  can list one or more certificates  that can be applied to the portable computing devices , such as during registration or at a later time. These may be security certificates, although that is not necessarily the case. Moreover, certificates can be added, removed or upgraded, each of which can be applied to the portable computing devices .","Referring to , an example of a default applications page  is shown. The default applications page , which can be accessed by selecting the tab , can list the applications  that are to be installed on the portable computing devices  as part of a default application set . That is, the default application set  can be the minimum number of applications  that should be installed on the portable computing devices  that are assigned to the administrator portal  and, optionally, the managing entity. As an example, these applications  can be delivered to the devices  when the devices  register with the managed services platform  or at some other later time. Any suitable amount of information relating to the applications  can be presented here, some of which may be accessed by selecting an application  in accordance with previous discussions.","In one arrangement, the interface  can be configured to enable any of these default settings or applications to be edited. For example, the general default page , the default certificates page  or the default applications page  can include an edit feature , which when activated, can permit modifications to the settings\/applications on its respective default page. In one particular example, if the edit feature  on the general default page  is activated, a general default edit page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . Here, the VPN setting , the firmware package , the location services setting , the application repository permission setting  or any other default setting can be modified. When so modified, the edit can be propagated to the portable computing devices  through the managed services platform  forthwith, such as by selecting a save feature , or at a later time.","As part of the process of delivering the edits to the portable computing devices , the interface  of the administrator portal  can present a schedule rollout option , which can be used to set a delivery schedule for the editing of the default settings or applications. When the schedule rollout option  is activated, a delivery page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . Here, a user can select any appropriate time to have the modifications pushed to the portable computing devices . As an example, these edits can be effected at a time that will cause minimal disruptions to the users of the devices , such as during early morning hours.","Edits can also be made to the default certificates page  and the default applications page  and delivered to the devices  in a similar manner. An example of an applications edit page  is shown in . Here, an available applications list  and a current default applications list  can be presented. The current default applications list  can show those applications  that are currently part of the default application set  (see ). The available application list , meanwhile, can display the applications  that are available to be part of the current default applications list  and, hence, the default applications list . A user can simply click and drag applications  from the available application list  to the current default applications list  to enable the application(s) to be added to the portable computing devices  on a broadcast or global basis. As an option, such a delivery could be scheduled using the schedule rollout option . As an option, information about the applications  can be reviewed or accessed here, similar to previous descriptions.","In addition to global addition, one could perform a global removal of an application  from the default application list  and, thus, the portable computing devices  associated with the administrator portal. As an example, a user can simply drag one or more applications  from the current default applications list  to the available application list . This change can be executed throughout the portable computing devices  through the managed services platform . The modification can occur in real-time or can be conducted at a later time, such as through the activation of the schedule rollout option .","Moving from the tab , information about the various users of the portable computing devices  associated with the administrator portal  can be obtained by selecting the tab , which can cause a users page  to be presented. An example of the users page  is shown in . The presentation and functions here can be similar to that described in relation to . For example, the users page  can present one or more user identifications  that display general information  about the corresponding user. Moreover, additional information about the user can be accessed by selecting the user identification , similar to the process described in relation to . For example, an information page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . The information page  can be accessed by selecting a tab . In addition, a roles page  can be accessed by selecting a tab , as shown in . The roles page  here can present information similar to that described in relation to . The information presented here on pages  and  can be similar to the information described with respect to , although other forms of information can be added to or excluded from the pages , .","Referring back to , as noted earlier, the users page  can present, among other things, one or more user identifications . In the example presented above, the user identifications  presented on the users page  may be associated with a managing entity that oversees the operation of the administrator portal . The users associated with the user identifications  may serve various roles under the managing entity, and the users can be grouped in one of several possible categories to make the management of the user identifications  easier, similar to those described in relation to . To access such categories, one of several tabs  can be selected. A search function (not shown) can also be incorporated into the users page  or some other suitable interface to enable searching of the user identifications . User identifications  can be added through an addition feature  or deleted by a deletion feature . Some of the information presented herein may be the same for different users, particularly if such users share a single portable computing device . While the features described in  are similar to those written about in relation to , there are some additional elements that are part of the former that will be described below.","In addition to the individual and group management of portable computing devices  (see  and -, respectively), the interface  of the administrator portal  allows for global or broadcast management of such devices . For example, as explained earlier, these devices  can be assigned to a particular application repository  and an entity responsible for operating the administrator portal , such as the managing entity. Referring to , a devices page  is shown, which can be accessed by selecting the tab . Here, the portable computing devices  associated with the administrator portal  can be presented in a devices list . In one arrangement, the devices list  can show all the devices  that are associated with the administrator portal . Various types of information about the portable computing devices \u2014like a name, MAC address and the application repository  to which the device  is assigned\u2014can be presented in the devices list .","It is conceivable that the devices list  may display a high number of portable computing devices . To make the management of these devices  easier, the devices list  can be configured to group the devices  in accordance with several predefined categories. For example, portable computing devices  can be grouped together according to a performance function of users assigned to the devices . As a more specific example, the portable computing devices  assigned to a sales team can be grouped together and given an identity that provides an indication of the sales team grouping. In addition, the devices list  can include a search feature (not shown) to enable searching of individual portable computing devices  or groups of such devices .","The portable computing devices  of the devices list  can include devices  that have registered with the managed services platform  and are assigned to the administrator portal . Such devices  can be referred to as provisioned portable computing devices . In one arrangement, a provisioned device  can take on those elements, like settings, firmware, applications, that the entity that assigns such devices  wishes the devices  to have. For example, the managing entity can set, for example, the default settings, default applications, bundles, etc. that the managing entity wants to be incorporated into the portable computing devices  that the managing entity assigns to individuals.","The devices page  can be configured to enable automatic provisioning of a portable computing device . Specifically, the devices page  can include an available devices list  that shows portable computing devices  that are not provisioned devices , unlike those in the devices list . A non-provisioned device  can be a portable computing device  that may not yet be assigned to the administrator portal  and may not include one or more elements or features (firmware, applications, settings) that have been implemented in the provisioned portable computing devices . For example, a non-provisioned portable computing device  may be assigned to a portal other than the administrator portal  or may not be assigned by the managing entity. As another example, a non-provisioned device  may be a device  that has not yet registered with the managed services platform . For devices  that are assigned to a portal other than the administrator portal , permission to provision the non-provisioned device  may need to be obtained from one or more parties.","In one arrangement, a user of the administrator portal  can provision one or more non-provisioned devices  by dragging them from the available devices list  to the devices list . Once received at the devices list , the portable computing device  can receive content (e.g., in a bundle) to make it a provisioned device , such as default settings, default firmware, default applications. Also, a bundle  (see ) can be delivered to the newly-provisioned portable computing device . In fact, virtually any content can be delivered to such a device . Similar to previous discussions, the content can be received at the device  through the managed services platform , in real-time or at a scheduled time. For those devices  that have not yet registered with the managed services platform , the content can be received once a device  initiates such registration.","The devices page  can also be configured to allow one or more provisioned portable computing devices  to return to a non-provisioned state. For instance, a user can drag a provisioned device  from the devices list  to the available devices list . Such a step can cause all or at least a portion of the modifications that were made to put the device  in a provisioned state to be removed, altered or deleted to return the device  to a non-provisioned state. This change can be effected right away or scheduled at a later time.","In one embodiment, the devices page  may include a messaging feature . The messaging feature  can also be incorporated into other pages (see  and ). Here, messages can be sent to the portable computing devices  on a broadcast or global basis via the managed services platform . This may or may not include all the devices  assigned to the administrator portal . As such, the administrator portal  can quickly and efficiently disseminate messages to its assigned devices . In one arrangement, such messages can be sent to groups of portable computing devices , based on the relevance of the message to those groups. Other factors may be considered when deciding on the reach of the message delivery to the devices , such as security, urgency, content, etc. If desired, in addition to global and group messaging, messages can be transmitted to a device  on an individual basis, similar to that described in relation to .","In view of the above discussion, the administrator portal  can be configured to manage a large number of portable computing devices  assigned to the administrator portal . These devices  may also be associated with a managing entity. This management, as has been presented, can include the selective delivery of applications and\/or settings to an application repository  associated with the administrator portal  and to the devices . There are other portals that may operate in a similar fashion.","For example, referring once again to , the managed services system  can include one or more client portals  and one or more sub-client portals . The client portals  can be communicatively coupled to one or more administrator portals , while the sub-client portals  can be communicatively coupled to one or more client portals . In view of this arrangement, the administrator portal  can have a working relationship with any number of the client portals  and any number of the sub-client portals . In fact, each of the participant portals in the system  can have working relationships with any other portal in the system . The operator of a portal can determine the parameters of such a relationship and to which portal(s) such a relationship may extend.","The vertical integration here can result in upstream and downstream portals. A downstream portal is defined as a portal that is communicatively coupled to a parent portal, while an upstream portal is defined as a portal that is communicatively coupled to a child portal. For example, the client portals  can be referred to as a downstream portal in relation to the administrator portal . The client portals  can also be considered as an upstream portal in relation to the sub-client portals .","As previously explained, the managed services system  is scalable such that additional entities can be incorporated into the system , and these additional entities include any suitable number of upstream and downstream portals. For example, a sub-sub-client portal (not shown) could be part of the system  and could be communicatively coupled to one or more sub-client portals . Another example of the scalability of the system  is the oversight portal  of . This portal  can be communicatively coupled to have a working relationship with the administrator portal , similar to the arrangement between the administrator portal  and the client portal(s) . In fact, additional upstream portals may be incorporated into the system  such that the oversight portal  can also be designated as a downstream portal. As such, the basic structure presented in  is a mere fraction of the complexity that can be reached in the system , given the scalability of the system .","In one arrangement, other portals in the managed services system  can be configured to implement an arrangement and processes that are similar to that described above for the administrator portal . As an example, consider a client portal . The structure of the client portal , as explained earlier, can be similar to that of the administrator portal  (see ). Moreover the client portal  can be configured to receive applications from an application developer portal after the applications are approved by an approval portal. The application developer portal, the approval portal or both can be the application developer portal  and the approval portal  of . In one arrangement, the application developer portal  and the approval portal  can be operated or managed by any suitable entity. For example, a party that manages the administrator portal , such as the managing entity described above, can also manage the application developer portal  and the approval portal . Of course, one or more parties different from the entity can be assigned to manage the application developer portal  or the approval portal .","In an alternative arrangement, the application developer portal and\/or the approval portal associated with the client portal  can be separate and distinct from the application developer portal  and the approval portal  of . That is, the party responsible for the client portal  may wish to create or direct the creation of an application submission and approval process specifically for the client portal . The operation and structure of the application developer portal and approval portal associated with the client portal  can be similar in structure and operation to those portals ,  described in relation to  (see also ). Like the description above, if separate application developer and approval portals are developed for the client portal , any suitable entity or entities can manage these portals. For example, the client portal  may have a managing entity that is responsible for the operation of the client portal  and its associated application developer and approval portals.","Just as with the administrator portal , the client portal  can selectively publish the applications that it receives. Further, in one embodiment, the client portal  can communicate with a managed services platform  and can be assigned an application repository . The managed services platform  and the application repository  may be the same ones utilized by and assigned to the administrator portal . Alternatively, the client portal  may utilize a managed services platform  and\/or be assigned an application repository  that is different from those associated with the administrator portal .","Because the client portal  can be configured and operated in a manner similar to that of the administrator portal , the client portal  can include an interface similar to the interface  of the administrator portal , as described above in relation to . That is, the client portal  can facilitate testing and publication of one or more applications , where the applications  can be published in an application repository  that is associated with the client portal  (see ). The client portal  can also manage portable computing devices  associated with the client portal  on an individual basis, such as enabling the installation\/removal of applications  from the devices  and the transmission of messages to the devices (see ).","The client portal  can also permit one to access information about users of the portable computing devices  (see ) and to manage firmware for the devices (see ). Also like the administrator portal , the client portal  can be configured to generate, maintain and distribute bundles  to the portable computing devices  (see ). As such, the client portal  can also enable the distribution of content (e.g., configuration settings, applications) to the devices  on a group basis. Additionally, the client portal  can permit maintenance\/monitoring of its application repository  and global management of portable computing devices , as outlined in . This includes content (e.g., settings, certificates, firmware, applications, etc.) selection and delivery (real-time or scheduled) for the devices , as well as the provisioning on non-provisioned devices . In summary, all the features described with respect to the administrator portal  may apply to the client portal . This principle may also extend to other portals, like the sub-client portals  and the oversight portal  and any other upstream or downstream portals.","Much of the discussion to this point has focused on internal management by a portal. For example, the administrator portal , among other portals, has been described as having the capability of managing portable computing devices  and application repositories  that are associated with or assigned to or by the administrator portal . As mentioned before, the administrator portal  can offer a second set of services that are directed to client portals that have established relationships with the administrator portal , such as the client portals , the sub-client portals , the sub-sub-client portals or any subsequent client portals.","To explain this second set of services, consider the following scenario. A first client portal  and a second client portal  may be communicatively coupled to and have a working relationship with an administrator portal  (see ). In addition, the first client portal  can be assigned a first application repository  that is associated with the first client portal , while the second client portal  may be assigned a second application repository  that is associated with the second client portal . As an example, the administrator portal  can be operated and\/or managed by the managing entity described above, and the first client portal  can be operated and\/or managed by a first client. Similarly, the second client portal  can be managed by a second client. For example, referring to , the administrator portal  can show an arrangement that demonstrates an application repository relationship between a managing entity associated with the administrator portal  and the first and second clients.","In this arrangement, the first and second clients may be organizations, companies, individuals, groups, etc. that desire to have the managing entity provide services for the first and second clients through the first client portal  and the second client portal . Also in this example, there may be multiple portable computing devices  that have been assigned to the first client portal  and multiple devices  that have been assigned to the second client portal .","Continuing with this example, the first client portal , the second client portal  or both may be associated with one or more sub-client portals  (see ). Thus, the first client can be associated with one or more first sub-clients, and the second client can be associated with one or more second sub-clients. The arrangement, therefore, can demonstrate an application repository relationship between the managing entity, the first and second client and the first and second sub-clients, if such sub-clients exist. The sub-clients may also be organizations, companies, individuals, groups, etc, that want to have the first and\/or second clients provide services for them through the first sub-client portal  and the second sub-client portal . As the managed services system  is readily scalable, these types of relationships can exist at any level among the different portals. Moreover, relationships can be forged between portals that are more than one degree apart in terms of vertical separation. For example, the administrator portal  and a sub-client portal  can be configured to enable the administrator portal  to provide services for the sub-client portal .","As explained earlier, the administrator portal  can receive applications  from the approval portal , as submitted at the application developer portal . Thus, the administrator portal  can receive a notification of an application  that has met an approval threshold. In response, the administrator portal  can cause the presentation of the application . The presentation of the application may or may not result in the application  being published in an application repository  associated with, for example, the administrator portal , being delivered to one or more portable computing devices  associated with, for example, the administrator portal  or both.","In one arrangement, the administrator portal  can also cause the transmission of the availability of the application  to the first client portal  for publication in the first application repository . Similarly, the administrator portal  can cause the transmission of the availability of the application  to the second client portal  for publication in the second application repository .","The transmission of the availability of the application  to the first client portal  and the second client portal  for publication can include different scenarios. In one arrangement, the transmission of the availability of the application  for publication can provide a notice of such availability, and the first and second clients can review the application for publication suitability. The process of review can be similar to that described in relation to the administrator portal . If the first or second clients determine that the available application is suitable for publication, the first or second client portal  can cause the application to be published in the appropriate application repository . The first or second clients, through the first or second client portals , also have the option of directing the installation of the application  on relevant portable computing devices  on an individual, group or global (broadcast) basis. This process can be similar to that presented for the administrator portal .","In another arrangement, the transmission of the availability of the application  for publication can result in the automatic publication of the application  in the relevant application repository , the delivery of the application  to the relevant devices  or both. That is, the first and second clients may rely on the judgment of the managing entity to make the determination of whether to publish an application  on their behalf.","In either arrangement, the administrator portal  or other relevant portal can set the transmission of the availability of the application  for publication on a selective basis. For example, the administrator portal  can determine that the availability transmission may be sent to the first client portal  but not the second client portal . This determination can be based on various factors, such as input from the parties responsible for the operation of the client portals  or other portals or some other suitable party. For example, the application developer portal  or the approval portal  can be configured to respectively permit, for example, the application developer or the party responsible for approving the application to make the selective transmission decision or at least recommend a decision.","It is understood that this process is certainly not limited to applications , as the availability of other content can be transmitted to other portals. For example, the administrator portal  can receive a firmware update and\u2014if the update is deemed worthy of dissemination\u2014can distribute the update to the application repository  or some other medium accessible by a portable computing device . The administrator portal  can also distribute such an update to appropriate portable computing devices  through the heartbeat process described above. In either arrangement, when such a firmware update is distributed (or even if it is not), the administrator portal  can notify, for example, the client portal  or any other portal about the availability of the firmware update. The party responsible for the client portal  (or other portal) can then determine whether to distribute the firmware update to its application repository , its portable computing devices  or both. If the firmware update is so distributed (or even if not), the client portal  can notify, for example, a sub-client portal  or some other portal. This process can be repeated for other portals (both upstream and downstream), as desired. It is understood, however, that other content can be distributed in this manner, other than firmware updates. For example, any type of operational settings or parameters or any type of software package for an application repository  or one or more portable computing devices  may be disseminated in a similar fashion.","In fact, this arrangement can enable a node hierarchy in which virtually any form of content can be distributed between nodes. For example, a first node can generate or receive some form of content and can distribute this content to one or more lower level nodes (e.g., child nodes). Once received, a lower level node or some other suitable entity can then determine whether to make this content available to portable computing devices associated with the lower level node or some other node. Any suitable type of criteria may be used to determine whether to disseminate the received content. Non-limiting examples include applications, firmware, settings, policies, certificates, statistics, manuals, publications, video, audio, directives, etc.","In view of the vertical integration of the managed services system , the management of application delivery (or other content delivery) can apply to any portal relationship in the system . For example, if and when a client portal  takes steps to publish an application (whether so in an application repository  or through delivery to a portable computing device ), the client portal  can cause the transmission of the availability of the application  for publication to the first or second sub-client portal . The first and second sub-clients, like the first and second clients, can determine whether to publish such applications  or to defer to the judgment of the first or second clients for automatic publication.","The management of services contemplated here is not limited to the management of the distribution of applications. In particular, an upstream portal can be configured to manage the portable computing devices , the users of such devices  or the application repository  associated with a downstream portal. To explain such an arrangement, again consider the relationship between the administrator portal  and the first and second client portals . Assume that the first and second clients have agreed to enter into an agreement with the managing entity (or other party responsible for the administrator portal ) such that the managing entity has the right to manage the portable computing devices  and the application repositories  associated with the first and second clients, including the management of the users of such devices  and repositories . In view of the integration and scalability characteristics of the managed services system , such an arrangement can exist between any suitable number of upstream and downstream portals.","For example, the administrator portal  can receive a control notification or some other form of permission from the first client portal  or the second client portal . The term \u201ccontrol notification\u201d is defined as a notification in which one portal is granted permission to manage at least some services on behalf of another portal. Once the administrator portal  receives the control notification, the administrator portal  can begin to manage services for the first or second client portals . In one arrangement, the administrator portal  can receive additional control notifications from sub-client portals  or other downstream portals. This process can permit the administrator portal  to manage services for the sub-client portals  and any other downstream portals. The control notifications can be sent directly from a particular portal or by a portal on behalf of another portal. For example, the client portal  can generate and send a single control notification, which can authorize the administrator portal  to manage services for both the client portal  and a sub-client portal  associated with the client portal . Alternatively, the control notification can be generated and sent from the sub-client portal  without any input from the client portal .","Referring to , the management page  presents an interface that enables a portal to manage services for another portal. In particular, if, for example, a control notification is received, a user of the portal that receives the notification can select from the hierarchical arrangement the portal that sent the notification. This selection may bring up the interfaces that were described above to enable the management of services for the portal sending the control notification.","To explain this process, an example will be presented in which a client portal  has provided the administrator portal  with a control notification. The control notification may indicate that the client portal  wishes to have the administrator portal  manage the application repository  of the client portal  (if one exists) and one or more portable computing devices  that are assigned to or associated with the client portal . For example, in , the administrator portal  with the circle and the subscript \u201cP\u201d can receive the notification from the client portal  with the circle and the subscript \u201cC.\u201d A user of the designated administrator portal  in this drawing can then, as an example, select the client portal , tagged in this drawing, too. Doing so can cause the presentation of information relating to the application repository  assigned to the client portal . Specifically, the information related to this application repository  can be presented in a form that is similar to that shown in  for the administrator portal . This feature may also apply to other portals in the arrangement of , such as other client portals or sub-client portals. To permit such access, the user may be required to provide authentication information.","In view of this feature, a user of the administrator portal  can access an interface for the client portal  that can be similar to the application repository information page  for the administrator portal , as pictured in . That is, the application repository information page  for the administrator portal  can be re-branded such that the page  is configured for the client portal . The re-branding may not materially affect the operation of the page , other than that its operation can be directed to the client portal  and some indication of this change may be provided, such as a symbol or some other designation that identifies the client portal . This re-branding can also provide to the user access to all the features described with respect to the application repository information page  on behalf of the client portal . This re-branding principle also may apply to all the pages that follow the application repository information page . For example, a user of the administrator portal  can view the default settings, default certificates or default applications  for the client portal  (see ). As another example, the user of the administrator portal  can provide or make edits to the default settings, default certificates or default applications , if the administrator portal  has permission to do so (see ). Like the discussion above, these edits can be executed in real-time or in accordance with a delivery schedule.","As such, if permission is granted, the administrator portal  can manage services for the client portal  by accessing information about the application repository  assigned to the client portal  and information about the default settings and applications  for portable computing devices  associated with the client portal . This management may also entail the administrator portal  making changes to the default settings or applications. For example, the administrator portal  can add, remove or even modify applications  with respect to a default application set for the application repository  of the client portal  or the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal . As another example, the administrator portal  can change VPN settings, locations services settings or the default firmware of the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal . These changes to the portable computing devices  can be on a global or broadcast basis on behalf of the client portal , and the administrator portal  can also determine if the edits are to be disseminated right away or based on a delivery schedule.","In addition, a user of the administrator portal  can have access to the user identifications  associated with the portable computing devices  of the client portal , which may include the addition or deletion of the user identifications  and the information related to such user identifications  (see ). Further, a user of the administrator portal  can have access to a devices page  (see ) that displays the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal . The devices  of the client portal  can be grouped together in accordance with several predefined categories, such as a performance function of users assigned to the devices , and a searching function can be provided.","The portable computing devices  of the client portal  that the administrator portal  can manage can include those devices  that have registered with an appropriate managed services platform  and are assigned to the client portal . As part of its management function, the administrator portal  can also enable automatic provisioning or de-provisioning of a portable computing device  on behalf of the client portal . For example, the administrator portal  can present portable computing devices  that are provisioned devices  or are available devices  that can be provisioned. A provisioned device  in this case can be a portable computing device  that is assigned to an application repository  of the client portal .","In one arrangement, the administrator portal  can also send messages to the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal  on behalf of the client portal . Similar to the description above, the messages can be sent to the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal  on a broadcast or global basis via the managed services platform . This may or may not include all the devices  assigned to the client portal . In short, with the proper permission, the administrator portal  can provide interfaces for managing another portal's application repository, portable computing devices or some other feature in which the interfaces are similar to those for managing the same for the administrator portal  (see ) but which may have been re-branded to identify with the client portal .","The administrator portal  can also manage other services for the client portal . For example, several of the interfaces of the administrator portal , such as the application repository information page  and the general default page  (see  , respectively), can include a launch feature . When activated, the launch feature  can provide a user of the administrator portal  with the ability to manage additional services for the client portal , if the administrator portal  has permission to do so. Authentication may be required for the user of the administrator portal  to manage these additional services on behalf of the client portal .","As an example of such additional services, the applications page  of  can be presented, which can enable a user to manage one or more applications  on behalf of the client portal . The user can also review information that is associated with the applications  by accessing the application selection page  (see ). Similar to that described above, the applications page  and the application selection page  can be re-branded in terms of the client portal ; however, the substantive operation of these pages  and  and the information that is presented can be similar to that described above in relation to . As such, the administrator portal  can control the operation of the application repository  assigned to the client portal .","For example, the administrator portal  can monitor the progress of the submissions of applications  and receive approved applications  on behalf of the client portal . These applications  can be received from an application developer portal  and an approval portal , as explained above. The administrator portal can also provide lists of pending, available or published applications  that are associated with the client portal . In addition, a user of the administrator portal  can determine whether to cause the publication of such applications , such as in an application repository  associated with the client portal . This determination may include the testing or evaluation of an application  in accordance with criteria set forth by the party overseeing the client portal .","If the application  is published in the application repository  associated with the client portal , the client portal  or the administrator portal  (on behalf of the client portal ) can transmit the availability of the application  for publication in an application repository  associated with one or more downstream portals, like a sub-client portal . In one arrangement, once the application  has been published in an application repository  associated with the client portal , the application  can be downloaded to portable computing devices  that are associated with the client portal .","As part of the management of services for the client portal , the administrator portal  can also manage portable computing devices  that are assigned to or associated with the client portal . In particular, the administrator portal  can present the devices page  (see ), the device details page  (see ) and the device application page , each of which can be re-branded in a configuration that is related to the client portal . As such, through these interfaces, a user of the administrator portal  can see representations of and manage the devices  for the client portal  similar to the way that user would do so for devices  associated with the administrator portal . For example, the administrator portal  can provide access to information about any one of the portable computing devices  associated with the client portal  (see previous examples), can search for such devices  and can enable the installation of content on or removal of content from these devices  on an individual basis, like applications , configuration settings or firmware or software packages. The administrator portal  can also enable a messaging feature to enable a user of the portal  to generate and transmit (through a managed services platform ) messages to the portable computing devices  of the client portal  on an individual basis, similar to that process described earlier with respect to messaging to devices  associated with the administrator portal .","As another part of its capabilities, the administrator portal  can present the users page , the information page  and the roles page  (see ) in a re-branded format that relates to the client portal . As such, a user of the administrator portal  can access one or more user identifications and related information that can be associated with the portable computing devices  of the client portal . That is, the description related to  in which various types of information relating to users of portable computing devices  associated with the administrator portal  can also apply to those users of devices  that are associated with the client portal . The information that can be accessed for the users associated with the client portal  can be similar to that described earlier with respect to users assigned to the administrator portal , although such information is certainly not necessarily so restricted. The user identifications of the client portal  can also be grouped or categorized and can be searchable. In addition, the administrator portal  can also be used to add or remove user identifications on behalf of the client portal , if the administrator portal  has permission to do so.","When it receives the control notification from the client portal , the administrator portal  can also present the firmware page  (see ), which can be re-branded in terms of the client portal . As previously explained, firmware or other software packages can be made available to one or more portable computing devices , such as through the managed services platform . Moreover, such a package can be selected at the administrator portal  for delivery to a portable computing device  associated with the client portal  by making selections at the device details page  (see ). The re-branded firmware page  can facilitate this feature for the client portal  by presenting one or more different firmware packages. As noted earlier, a firmware package is not necessarily limited to firmware, as other forms of software, operational settings and parameters may be part of a firmware package. The description of receiving, adding and updating firmware packages and related notifications, as well as the parties responsible for their production and delivery, can be applicable here in terms of the administrator portal  handling this operation on behalf of the client portal . As such, a user of the administrator portal  can help facilitate the distribution of firmware packages to an application repository  and\/or one or more portable computing devices  associated with the client portal .","As part of the delegated management, the administrator portal  can also manage bundles on behalf of the client portal . The concept of providing bundles to one or more portable computing devices  was previously described. To accommodate this feature, when the administrator portal  has permission to do so, the administrator portal  can present the bundles page  (see ) in a re-branded format that designates its relation to the client portal . Here, bundles that can be designed for portable computing devices  associated with the client portal  can be made available to a user of the administrator portal . The party responsible for the operation of the client portal  can design these bundles or can work with another party, like the managing entity of the administrator portal , to produce the bundles. The bundles\u2014and the content contained therein\u2014prepared on behalf of the client portal  and available on the bundles page  of the administrator portal  can be done so based on a performance function or some other category, similar to the bundles  described earlier. The bundles for the client portal  may also contain default applications, settings or other items, also like the bundles . See the previous discussion for examples of the content that can be contained in the bundles for the client portal  or for information that can be presented for the bundles.","Bundles for the client portal  can easily be added to the re-branded bundles page  of the administrator portal . Subsequently, a user of the administrator portal  can manage these bundles on behalf of the client portal  in accordance with the processes described in relation to . For example, the administrator portal , through re-branded interfaces, can allow a user to access information about the bundles and make edits to the content of the bundles, including the addition or removal of content. The administrator portal  can also enable the storage\/distribution of the bundles to the portable computing devices  and\/or the application repositories  associated with the client portal , in accordance with those processes described earlier with respect to . This feature includes immediate or dynamic delivery or a delivery based on a predetermined schedule.","As such, it is possible for the administrator portal  to provide content or make modifications to a group of portable computing devices , i.e., a group basis. For example, an operator of the administrator portal , such as the managing entity, could push applications, firmware updates or operational settings to an identified group of portable computing devices  on behalf of the client portal . These principles can also apply to an application repository  associated with the client portal .","In view of the above description, the administrator portal  can be used to manage one or more services for the client portal . In fact, this management can be similar to how the administrator portal  can manage its own application repository  and its own portable computing devices . This management role can also apply to other portals. For example, if the administrator portal  receives a control notification, the administrator portal  can also manage services in a similar manner for a sub-client portal  or other downstream portals. The administrator portal  can provide such services for one or more different portals at the same time or can be configured to provide such services to only one portal at any one point in time.","Moreover, the client portal  can perform the same function in relation to the sub-client portal . That is, if it receives a control notification, the client portal  can manage services for the sub-client portal  or some other downstream portal in accordance with the description above. Like the administrator portal , the client portal  can provide these services to one or multiple portals at any given time. This principle is commensurate with the scalability of the managed services system  (see ) such that any portal can provide services on behalf of another portal. It is also understood that a portal can provide such services to both upstream and downstream portals, if desired. For example, as an option, the administrator portal  can manage services for an upstream portal, like the oversight portal , in accordance with the descriptions above. Similarly, the client portal  can manage services on behalf of the administrator portal .","Examples of a managed services system  have been presented here (see ). To assist in the understanding of the structure and operation of the system, certain portals were designated with functional labels. For example, because the administrator portal  can provide services for the client portals  in one particular embodiment, the term \u201cadministrator\u201d was used in the descriptions above when explaining the features of this portal. Given the flexibility of the system , however, it must be noted that such exemplary designations are not intended to limit the utility of the system . For example, the administrator portal  may operate like a client portal  in relation to the oversight portal . As another example, the client portal  may act like the administrator portal  in relation to the sub-clients . In fact, the roles that the portals of the managed services system  take on may be completely interchangeable.","There may be other interfaces that can be used with the system  (see ), the managed services platform  (see ) and the managed services system  (see ). One such example is shown in . Here, an interface  is illustrated that can be useful for enabling the management of portable computing devices . The principles described above may apply here such that the interface  can be incorporated into any portal and operated by any suitable entity. To describe its operation, reference will be made to the administrator portal , although this interface  could easily be implemented into a client portal , a sub-client portal , an oversight portal  or any other suitable portal. This interface  can be used to facilitate management of portable computing devices  that are associated with any entity, including an entity that is not responsible for operating or managing the portal on which the interface  is implemented. Additional details will follow.","Reference will now be made to . As noted earlier, the administrator portal  can include one or more user interface (UI) elements , and the UI elements  can enable a user to make selections associated with the management of services for one or more portable computing devices . The administrator portal  can also include a processor  that can be communicatively coupled to the UI elements . In one arrangement, the processor  can be operable to receive a request to determine a status of one or more of the portable computing devices  or to cause an action to occur on one or more of the portable computing devices . The processor  can also be operable to provide the status of the one or more portable computing devices  or to effect the action on the one or more portable computing devices . The status of the portable computing devices  can be provided on an individual, group or global basis. Similarly, the action on the portable computing devices  can be effected on an individual, group or global basis.","The term \u201cstatus of one or more of the portable computing devices\u201d is defined as a measurable characteristic of a portable computing device, while the term \u201caction on one or more of the portable computing devices\u201d means the execution of an operation on a portable computing device and includes operations that are undertaken by the portable computing device or operations that are executed under the direction of another device or system. The term \u201cindividual basis\u201d is defined as a circumstance involving a single entity, part, device or component, while the term \u201cgroup basis\u201d is defined as a circumstance involving a group of entities, parts, devices or components that is fewer than all available entities, parts, devices or components. The term \u201cglobal basis\u201d is defined as a circumstance involving all available entities, parts, devices or components.","Many examples of providing a status of a portable computing device  or effecting an action on the device  on a particular basis have already been presented. For example, through the interface , a user can cause applications  to be installed on or removed from one or more portable computing devices  on an individual, group or global basis. As another example, bundles \u2014and the content contained therein\u2014can be delivered to or removed from such devices  in accordance with an individual, group or global basis. Moreover, a user can determine the applications  and other content (e.g., firmware) that are installed on such devices , again on an individual, group or global basis.","Referring once again to , the interface  presents an additional interface to permit this management of portable computing devices . As explained previously, the administrator portal  will be used to explain the interface , as the example here will demonstrate the interface  as being implemented on the administrator portal . Similar to earlier descriptions, the administrator portal  can be operated or managed by a first entity or a managing entity.","The interface  can include a home page , which can show various information related to one or more portable computing devices . In one arrangement, these portable computing devices  can be associated with the administrator portal  and\/or the managing entity. The home page can be accessed through a tab . An executive summary  can indicate, for example, the total number of portable computing devices , the total number of applications  on these devices , the total number of users of the devices  and the total number of bundles  on the devices . An unused application section  can list or show, for example, the applications  that are available to be installed on the devices  but that are not currently so installed. In contrast, a top applications section  can show, for example, the top applications  for the devices , in terms of the number of times each application  has been installed on a device . Moreover, an applications section  can list all the applications  that are available for installation on the devices . Of course, the information presented here on the home page  in  is merely exemplary in nature, as virtually any other suitable type of material can be shown on the page .","Referring to , another devices page  is shown, which can be accessed via a tab . The devices page  shown here is similar in operation and design in comparison with the devices page  described in relation to . That is, the devices page  can enable the management of individual portable computing devices . The devices page , however, shows additional features that can be implemented into a device management system.","For example, selecting a device  on the devices page  can cause a device information page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The device information page  can be accessed through a tab  on a tool bar . The device information page  can show any suitable type of information about the selected portable computing device . Examples include a device name, a device description, a MAC address, a device type, a software version, an asset tag, a serial number, an IP address, an international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) number, a model type or an indication as to whether the device  is managed. The device information page  is in no way limited to these particular examples, as other pieces of information about the selected device  can be presented.","Selecting a tab  on the tool bar  can cause a location page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . Through the location page , the status of a portable computing device  can be provide by supplying location information of the device . For example, the location page  can show the physical location of the selected portable computing device , if such a feature has been enabled and\/or authorized. The location of the selected device  can be superimposed over a map or imagery of the general area. The location of the device  can be updated in real time, if desired.","Selecting another tab  on the tool bar  can cause a menu  to be presented, as shown in . The menu  can offer one or more features for managing the selected portable computing devices . Selection of any one of these features can effect some action on the selected device . For example, a ring feature  can be selected, which can cause a ring tone or other signal to be generated at the device . This ring feature  can override any settings on the device , such as a muting or silence feature on the device , and can help a user locate a lost device , for example. In addition, a message feature  can be activated, which can permit a message to be sent to the selected portable computing device . It must be noted that any message sent to any number of portable computing devices  can be a predefined message or can be dynamically generated.","Selection of a tab  can enable the selected device  to be locked out, while selection of a tab  can enable the device  to be unlocked. In a locked out state, the entire device  can be locked such that the device  may not respond to any inputs from a user. The locked out state is not so limited, however, as the features or operation of the device  can be selectively disabled. For example, in a locked out state, the device  may be permitted to conduct voice calls but not allowed to conduct exchanges involving data. Selection of the tab  can return the device  from the locked state to the original pre-locked state or a state in which at least some features or operation of the device  is enabled again. For example, the device  may be completely disabled in the locked out state and selection of the tab  can once again permit the device  to make emergency calls or other voice calls but not data exchanges.","Selection of a tab  can enable the logout of one or more users of the selected portable computing device . For example, all users of the device  can be logged out or only a portion of the users assigned to the device . This logout feature can be activated at any time and can be set to occur automatically, such as after a predetermined time period during which no activity is detected on the device .","A tab  can be selected to activate a wipe feature. The wipe feature can be used to, for example, return the selected device  back to factory or default settings. This process can be directed at the entire device  or at only portions of the device . In particular, all the features, settings, applications and content of the device  can be returned to the original conditions of the device  or only some of these features, settings, applications or content may be returned to such a condition. For example, several settings of the device  may be returned to default, while other settings may remain intact. As an additional option here, when the wipe feature is activated, one or more security scans can be conducted on the device , with results being reported back to the administrator portal .","Another tab  can be selected to activate a reset feature of the portable computing device . As an example, the reset feature can be similar to a reboot process, although this feature is not necessarily so limited. Moreover, the reset feature can be used to rest or reboot only certain portions of the device . For example, the reset feature can be used to reset a particular application. Of course, the reset feature can be used to reboot the entire operating system and other applications of the device , if so desired. A wipe user feature can also be used to disable or delete the account of a user of the selected device , which can be accessed through a tab . This feature can be utilized if, for example, a user is no longer employed by an entity that has assigned the device  to that user. While the wipe feature can be used to entirely disable or delete all settings, content, applications, etc. associated with a user, the wipe feature can also be used to only disable or delete a portion of such material. For example, only the applications associated with a particular user may be removed or otherwise disabled.","Referring back to the tool bar  (see ), selection of a tab  can cause a firmware page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The firmware page  is similar to the firmware features described earlier with respect to the device details page  (see ) and the firmware page  (see ). As such, a particular firmware package  can be selected here and delivered in real-time or based on a scheduled time to the portable computing device  through the managed services platform , as previously explained.","The interface  can also be configured to present and facilitate the distribution of bundles  to portable computing devices . For example, referring to , another bundles page  is presented, which can be accessed through a tab . Like the bundles  presented earlier (see description relating to ), the bundles  of this interface  can be used to provide content, such as configuration settings and applications or edits to such content, to any suitable number of portable computing devices  and can be distributed in real-time or in accordance with a delivery schedule.","As an example, a bundle  can be selected from the bundles page , and a bundle information page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . As part of the bundle information page , a bundle tool bar  can be presented. Selection of a tab  on the bundle tool bar  can enable a user to access the bundle information page . The bundle information page  can provide any suitable type\/amount of information about the selected bundle . Examples include a bundle name, a description, a bundle role, a priority index, a domain key, a profile key, a version key, a creation date or a last update date. The bundle role can provide an indication as to which performance function the bundle  is assigned, and the priority index can be used to prioritize the content of the selected bundle  in view of other bundles . In particular, a lower number for the priority index can indicate that the content of the associated bundle  has a higher priority in comparison to a bundle  having a higher number for the priority index. This priority index can be useful if a user of a portable computing device  is assigned two or more different bundles . The domain key and the profile key can be used to facilitate identification of the bundle .","Referring once again to the bundle tool bar , activating a tab  can cause a profile menu  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The profile menu  can be configured to enable the selection of one or more profile settings, as will be explained below. For example, a password profile page , which can be accessed through a tab , can provide information about and enable the selection of settings related to a password for the bundle . That is, the data here can be part of a bundle  that when delivered to a portable computing device  can establish a password feature for the device . In one arrangement, the password profile page  can present and\/or enable the editing of the following password parameters: a level of complexity (i.e., quality); a minimum length; a maximum length; an amount of time before lock; a password lifetime; or a maximum number of times an incorrect password can be entered before the device  is locked or wiped (completely or partially). A password lifetime can identify, for example, the amount of time the password may be in effect. Other examples may include a minimum or maximum number of alphabetic characters, lower case letters, upper case letters, non-alphabetic letters, numeric digits or special characters. In addition, a history size can be provided. The history size can be a parameter that sets the number of previous passwords to be reviewed to minimize the use of recent passwords. For example, a history size of three would direct the portable computing device  or some other remote unit to store the last three passwords used on the device  and to review these three passwords to ensure that these passwords were not currently selected as a password. An enablement feature  can be activated, which can direct the relevant portable computing device  to implement the password profile once the device  receives the bundle .","Any number of the above parameters can be edited or set on the password profile page  for controlling any suitable number or type of password that may be employed on the portable computing device  that has received the bundle . As previously explained, such an editing or setting can be delivered to bundles  installed on portable computing devices  or in other components (like an application repository ) in real-time or in accordance with a delivery schedule. These edits can be implemented on the portable computing devices  once the bundles  are updated. The password profile itself can be enabled or disabled here on this page . In addition, the password profile page  may be configured to manage multiple passwords or the interface  can have multiple password profile pages  to accommodate multiple passwords.","Activation of a tab  from the profile menu  can cause a wireless or Wi-Fi profile page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . While the Wi-Fi profile page  of  may be directed to Wi-Fi, it must be noted that the page  is not so limited, as the page  can accommodate any other suitable wireless protocol or standard. In fact, the Wi-Fi profile page  can be configured to accommodate multiple wireless standards\/protocols or a separate page can be used to manage different wireless standards\/protocols.","The Wi-Fi profile page , in one arrangement, can include a wireless profile listing , which can include one or more wireless profiles , any one of which may be selected for the bundle  and eventually a portable computing device . To the left of the wireless profile listing , settings about the selected wireless profile  can be presented. The following list shows examples of settings for a selected wireless profile : a name; a service set identifier (SSID); a security type; a password; an extensible authentication protocol (EAP) ID; an EAP method; an EAP second phase; an EAP anonymous identifier; certificates for a user and a certificate authority; or a private key. The profile page  can be configured to allow these settings to be edited, if desired.","The Wi-Fi profile page  can also include an initiation feature  and a disablement feature . The initiation feature , if activated, can direct the portable computing device  that receives the bundle  to connect to the SSID identified on the profile page  when the device  comes within range of the network. In contrast, if the initiation feature  is not activated, the profile on the profile page  can simply be saved in the bundle  and the device , and the connection to the network may be executed at a later time. In addition, the disablement feature  can, when activated, direct the portable computing device  that receives the bundle  to disable other wireless profiles on the device  and to prevent future profiles from being installed on the device . This disablement can be complete such that no other profiles are permitted to be used by the device , or other acceptable profiles may be permitted on the device . If the disablement feature  is not activated, then other profiles on the device  may not be disabled.","Referring to , activation of a tab  on the profile menu  can cause a VPN profile page  to be presented, an example of which is shown here. Like the Wi-Fi profile page , the VPN profile page  can include a VPN profile listing , which can list one or more VPN profiles . A VPN profile  can eventually be implemented on a portable computing device  that receives the bundle  containing the profile . Various settings, which can be editable, can be presented for a selected VPN profile . Examples include a name; a type; a server address; one or more domain names; or certificates for a user and a certificate authority. The VPN profile page  can also include a secret feature . When activated, this feature  can, for example, ensure that Layer 2, Tunnel Protocol secret is enabled, although other standards or protocols may be employed here.","Referring to , activation of a tab  on the profile menu  can cause a hardware profile page  to be presented, an example of which is shown here. The hardware profile page  can enable the enablement or disablement of one or more hardware features of the portable computing device  that receives the bundle . For example, activation of a camera feature  can enable a camera on the device  for operation, while deactivation of this camera feature  can disable the camera such that the camera is not functional. The hardware profile page  can also include, for example, a Wi-Fi feature  for enabling\/disabling a Wi-Fi stack of the device , cellular feature  for enabling\/disabling a cellular stack of the device , a secure digital (SD) card feature  for enabling\/disabling an SD card feature of the device , a Bluetooth feature  for enabling\/disabling a Bluetooth stack of the device  or a microphone feature  for enabling\/disabling one or more microphones of the device . Any suitable indication can be used here to indicate whether a hardware feature is enabled or disabled.","It must be noted that the hardware profile page  is not limited to the examples described above, as other suitable hardware features or physical components can be selectively enabled or disabled through this page . Moreover, any changes made to these settings can be propagated to the devices  in real-time or based on a predefined schedule.","Referring to , activation of a tab  on the profile menu  can cause a certificate profile page  to be presented, an example of which is shown here. The certificate profile page  can include a certificate profile listing , which can show one or more certificate profiles . One or more of the certificate profiles  can be part of the bundle  for the portable computing device . Information such as the name, description or password for a selected certificate profile  may be presented on the profile page . Certificate profiles  can be added or removed from the certificate profile listing .","Referring back to , selection of another tab  on the bundle tool bar  can present a policy page , which can define one or more actions to be executed in response to a detected event. An example of the policy page  is shown in . The policy page  can include a policy menu  and a policy listing . The policy menu  can provide access to various policy pages, while the policy listing  can list one or more policies  that may be active. As an example, the policy listing  may also show the detected event that may initiate the action associated with a policy  and the action that is taken when such event is detected.","Any suitable number of policies can be implemented here. As an example, a tab  can be selected, which can present a proxy policy page , an example of which is shown in . The proxy policy page , in one arrangement, can identify a proxy  to be used by a portable computing device  that has received the bundle , which may also include criteria for determining when to use the proxy . For example, the proxy policy page  can include a criteria listing , and the listing  can present the criteria or detected event that would cause the portable computing device  to use the listed proxy . The proxy policy page  can also include an enabling feature , which can ensure that the portable computing device  uses the proxy  when the predefined event is detected.","In one arrangement, the detected event can be a permanent condition or after a specific event or events are detected or even not detected after some time. For example, the detected event here may be to direct the portable computing device  to use the selected proxy  at all times or after the device  is detected in a certain location. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are a great number of criteria that can be used to direct the portable computing device  to use the selected proxy . Moreover, any number of proxies  and detected event information (i.e., criteria) can be added to the proxy policy page  and delivered to the portable computing device  in accordance with any of the methods previously described. Priority rankings can also be used in the case of multiple proxies  or detected events to minimize conflicts.","Another tab  can be selected, which can cause a VPN policy page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The VPN policy page  can be used to force the portable computing device  that receives the bundle  to use a selected VPN  if a predefined event is detected. The VPN policy page  can allow for a single or multiple VPNs . In addition, the VPN policy page  can include a criteria listing  that can present criteria for determining when the device  is to use the selected VPN . For example, it can be determined that the portable computing device  is not using an internal SSID, and in response, the device  can be required to use the VPN . An enabling feature  can be provided to enable or disable the VPN policy. The settings on the VPN policy page  can be edited\/modified and such changes can be delivered to the portable computing device  in accordance with previous discussions.","Steps can be taken to ensure that portable computing devices  avoid downloading or installing questionable material, such as malware or unauthorized websites. As an example, a tab  from the policy menu  can be selected, and a blacklist policy page  can be presented, an example of which is shown in . In one arrangement, the blacklist policy page  can include a blocking list , which can list blocked objects  that are not permitted to be accessed by or downloaded or installed on the portable computing device  that has received the bundle . Non-limiting examples of blocked objects  may include applications or Internet sites. Any suitable number of blocked objects  may be added to (or removed from) the blocking list . Again, any changes to the blacklist policy page  can be propagated to the portable computing devices  in accordance with earlier discussions.","A whitelist policy page , in contrast, can be used to identify material that is permitted to be accessed by or downloaded or installed on the portable computing device , an example of which is shown in . The whitelist policy page  can be accessed by selecting a tab  from the policy menu  and can present an allowance list , which can present allowed objects  that are permitted to be accessed by or downloaded or installed on the device . Non-limiting examples of allowed objects  may include applications or Internet sites. Any suitable number of allowed objects  may be added to (or removed from) the allowance list . Like the blacklist policy page , any changes to the whitelist policy page  can be propagated to the portable computing devices  in accordance with earlier discussions.","In one arrangement, the blacklist policy page  or the whitelist policy page  (or both) can be configured such that their restrictions\/allowances may take effect based on detected events (i.e., criteria). For example, the restrictions of the blacklist policy page  may be set to only take effect when a user of the portable computing device  is within a working location, as determined by the detection of a specific SSID.","Selecting a tab  on the policy menu  can cause a report policy page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The report policy page  can include a report listing , which can show one or more reporting policies . A reporting policy  can cause a portable computing device  that has received the bundle  to report one or more parameters or conditions in response to a detected event. A detected event can be any condition that can be detected and useful for reporting conditions or characteristics about the portable computing device . For example, if the portable computing device  determines that its signal strength (or received signal strength indication (RSSI)) has reached or is above a predetermined threshold or that the SSID in contact with the device  is a certain SSID, then the reporting policy  can direct the device  to report its location to any suitable entity or component.","Any suitable number of reporting policies  may be part of the report listing  and priority rankings can be employed here to minimize conflicts. Reporting policies  can also be added or removed from the report listing , and any edits or changes to the report policy page  can be distributed to the portable computing device  in accordance with prior descriptions. The report policy page  can also include activation\/deactivation features , which can be used to selectively activate or deactivate reporting policies .","A new policy tab  can be part of the policy menu . Through this tab , additional policies may be added to the policy menu . The policy menu  can also include a delete policy tab (not shown) for removing unwanted policies.","Referring back to the bundle tool bar  of , selection of a tab  can cause an application page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The application page , similar to the description presented with respect to, for example, , can include an application listing  that can show the applications  that are part of the bundle . As explained previously, in one arrangement, these applications  can be default applications . Selection of an edit feature  can cause an application edit page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . Here, in accordance with previous descriptions, one or more available applications  in an available application listing  can be added to a bundle application listing  and, hence, the bundle . Moreover, applications  can also be removed from the bundle  by moving applications  from the bundle application listing  back to the available application listing . These edits can be propagated to the portable computing devices  containing the bundle , as previously described, in real-time or based on a delivery schedule.","Referring back to , the bundle tool bar  can also include another tab , selection of which can cause a bundle devices page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The bundle devices page  can include a devices listing , which can show all the portable computing devices  that have received the bundle . The bundle devices page  can also include a devices menu , which can provide selections that are similar to those described with respect to . Through the devices menu , the portable computing devices  that have received the bundle  can be managed by invoking any one of the options of the menu . For example, selection of a ring tab  can cause each of the devices  that have received the bundle  to activate a ringer or some other alert mechanism. As another example, selection of a messaging tab  can cause a message to be delivered to these devices , while selection of a locking tab  and an unlocking tab  can respectively cause the devices  to lock and unlock the devices  (see earlier description for details).","As another example, selection of a logout tab  can cause current users of the portable computing devices  to be logged out, possibly necessitating a re-authentication. As yet another example, selection of a wipe tab  can enable the portable computing devices  to be rest to factory or default settings, which can be designed to affect the entire device  or a portion of the device . A reboot tab  can be selected to facilitate a reboot of the portable computing devices , while a wipe user tab  can be used to reset (e.g., return to factory or default settings) one or more users associated with the portable computing devices .","The tabs presented in the devices menu  can enable the portable computing devices  that have received the bundle  to be managed in accordance with their respective functions, as outlined above. It must be noted, however, that there may be other ways to manage such devices  above those presented here. Moreover, the devices menu  is not necessarily required to have each of the tabs that are shown here.","Referring back to , the bundle tool bar  can also include another tab , selection of which can cause a users page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The users page  can include a users listing , which can show each of the users that are assigned to portable computing devices  that have received the bundle . In addition to presenting the users, the users page  can also be configured to enable the management of these users. For example, the users page  can be designed to enable the addition or removal of users, the level of access to content\/information provided to the users or the assignment of users to particular bundles .","Referring to  and moving away from the discussion about bundles , an application tab  can be accessed, which can cause an application interface  to be presented, an example of which is shown here. The applications interface  is similar in function and design to that described in relation to . That is, the applications interface  can enable access to pending, available or published applications , as described earlier. The applications interface , however, can provide an additional feature, which can be accessed by selecting an in-house tab . This selection can cause an in-house application page  of the applications interface  to be presented.","The in-house application page  can show applications  that have been submitted for approval for publication, such as in an application repository  (see ). That is, the in-house application page  can serve a function similar to the one performed by the approval portal  (see ). As such, a user of the administrator portal , for example, can review submitted applications , test\/analyze such applications  and determine whether such applications  are acceptable for publication, in accordance with procedures presented earlier. In particular, the in-house application page  can include a status menu  that can present the status indicators  described with respect to , which can be displayed next to applications  to show the status of the applications .","In one arrangement, the applications  that are submitted and presented on the in-house application page  can be associated with the entity that is operating the portal that has implemented the interface . For example, the interface  may be implemented on the administrator portal , and the submitted applications  may be associated with an entity that is responsible for managing or operating the administrator portal . As a more specific example, these applications  can be applications  that have been internally developed by the entity responsible for the administrator portal . Thus, an employee, contractor or vendor can develop applications  for this entity, and the applications  can be uploaded to the in-house application page  for review for possible publication and\/or distribution to portable computing devices . The in-house application page  (and subsequent interfaces to be discussed) can enable such internal applications  to be reviewed for publication, similar to previously described methods.","Selecting an application  on the in-house application page  can cause an application information page  to be presented, which can show information relating to the selected application . An example of the application information page  is shown in . This information can be similar to that described in relation to  and will not be repeated here. Also similar to , the in-house application page  can include a publish feature  for causing the selected, submitted application  to be published, a remove feature  for rejecting the selected, submitted application  for publication and a testing feature  for sending the application  to or removing the application  from a testing device. The remove feature , in another arrangement, can be used to remove an application  from, for example, an application repository  or one or more portable computing devices .","A locale feature  can enable a developer of a submitted application to select a particular country or region and\/or an associated language for the information of the application . This process is similar to that outlined in the description related to  (see the language selection ). Also, selection of a files tab  can enable a user to determine which files are part of the submitted application  and may be configured to allow for upload or removal of such files. A comments tab  can be used to enter or review comments regarding the submitted application  and its review.","In view of the above, a system that has implemented the interface  can enable an internal review of submitted applications . For example, if installed on the administrator portal , then the portal  can perform at least some of the functions that may be handled by the approval portal . Of course, this feature can be incorporated into other portals other than the administrator portal , like a client portal  or a sub-client portal .","Referring back to , selection of a users tab  can cause a users page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . The users page  can include a users listing  that can show one or more users who are associated with, for example, the portable computing devices  that are being managed by the interface . In one arrangement, as has been mentioned previously, the number of users and the number of managed devices  may not be equal, as there may be multiple users for a single device  or a user may be assigned to multiple devices . Here, information about the users can be shown.","Selection of a user can cause a user control page  to be presented, an example of which is shown in . Information about the selected user can be presented here, such as name, contact information and other relevant data, and can be accessed by selecting a general tab . As an option, information about any portable computing device  to which the user is assigned can also be presented here and even managed, if so desired. In one arrangement, the user information can also be edited on the user control page . Moreover, selection of a roles tab  can show the various roles associated with a particular user. A role can identify which type of bundles  may be appropriate for a certain user. For example, if the user is part of a sales team, the role of the user can identify this association and the relevance of a bundle  that is designed for the sales team. A user can have one or more roles, and if multiple roles exist, a priority value can be provided for the roles to show which bundle  of the multiple, associated bundles  should take priority for the user. The role and related information can be also be edited by selecting the roles tab .","A user menu  can allow for additional user control of the selected user. As an example, the user menu  can include a refresh feature , which can direct the portable computing device(s) to which the user is assigned to automatically refresh themselves with, for example, updates, such as software updates. The user menu  can also include a locking feature  and an unlocking feature , which can respectively lock and unlock the device(s) to which the user is assigned. Locking and unlocking processes have been previously described and apply here. A logout feature  can also be part of the user menu , which can cause the user to be logged out of the device(s) to which the user is assigned, while a wipe user feature  can cause at least a portion of the data or settings on the device(s) assigned to the user to return to default or factory settings. Of course, the user menu  is not necessarily limited to these features, as other features may be implemented here or the menu  can have fewer features than those shown here.","The interface  described to this point has focused on an entity managing its own portable computing devices . For example, a corporation can employ this interface  to manage the devices  that it assigns to its employees. In accordance with the discussion presented above, the interface  can be configured to permit an entity to manage devices  that are associated with a second entity. As a more specific example, a first company can operate or manage the administrator portal  and can have the interface  installed on the administrator portal . The first company may receive a control notification or some other authorization from a second company to manage the portable computing devices  associated with the second company. In response, the first company can manage these devices  of the second company through the interface  or any of the other interfaces described above. It is understood, however, that the interface  can be installed on any other suitable portal, as it is not limited to installation on the administrator portal .","As previously noted, user of portable computing devices  in any of the interfaces\/systems presented thus far can be managed. In one arrangement, the management of devices  can be supplemented through the management of users. In other words, a request for a status or for an action to be carried out for one or more portable computing devices  can be done so by managing a user of the one or more portable computing devices . This principle may be particularly true if a user is assigned multiple devices .","For example, consider the scenario where a user has been assigned multiple portable computing devices . Instead of focusing just on the management of the devices  associated with the user, the user can be managed to effect changes to the devices . Specifically, a user account or entry, similar to those presented above, can be accessed, and selections can be made with respect to this user. As a more detailed example, the user can be assigned with a particular bundle , and this bundle  can be propagated to each or a portion of the devices  assigned to the user. As another example, a messaging feature can be activated through an interface linked to the user, and a message can be generated for one or more or each of the devices  associated with the user. This arrangement of focusing on a user to manage devices  can be expanded to incorporate any of the processes previously described herein. Moreover, a first entity can manage users associated with a second entity, in accordance with the principles presented above. Authorization may or may not be required to do so.","It must also be noted that content is not necessarily limited to being sent in bundles or in any sort of grouping. For example, instead of sending a bundle of applications to a portable computing device, individual applications may be distributed to one or more portable computing devices. This principle may apply to any type of content, including settings or commands.","The preceding description is certainly not meant to be limiting, and there are several other scenarios to consider. Additional illustrations and examples that further flesh out the some of the principles and arrangements presented thus far will now be provided.","Business professionals today expect the ability to use personal computers, smartphones and tablets of their choice while working from their offices, homes or on the road. Beyond an increased use of mobile devices, this has introduced a diversification of the types of devices having access to, and storage of, enterprise information. The increased penetration of these devices with consumers has created an expectation among users that they can load a wide set of applications on them, in addition to those dictated by their employer.","This movement has created a new set of challenges for information technology (IT) managers who remain responsible for corporate communications, software deployment, security, policy management, integration and service levels. Moreover, since devices and employees tend to be increasingly mobile, the traditional model of managing devices on a local area network no longer suffices.","The systems, methods, arrangements and configurations (referred to as \u201csystem\u201d hereinafter for brevity) described herein address these new emerging needs. By combining comprehensive device management services with a fully managed application store, a unique product architecture has been created that offers both end-user flexibility and a comprehensive set of corporate controls for enterprise managers.","These solutions can be leveraged across a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems, creating a cohesive ecosystem with remote management capability. Examples of offerings include (1) a fully managed Android solution; (2) the only multi-tiered and fully-managed application store; (3) the only multi-tiered device management and control platform; (4) platform independent and leveraged to run across a variety of hardware devices and operating systems; (5) targeted application\/content delivery to specific customers; (6) full device lifecycle management, including provisioning, updating, redeploying and decommissioning of devices and users; (7) full application lifecycle management, including submission, testing, approval, deployment, updating and deletion; (8) business intelligence reporting, including telecom expense management, which can provide an immediate return on investment to enterprises; (9) immediate revenue opportunities for operating entities, as well as the ability to continue to enhance and increase monetization over time.","The system described herein can extend beyond mobile device management offerings. For example, operating systems, such as Android, can be customized with a number of enhancements that make the operating system far more ideal for enterprise deployments. In particular, a multi-user Android solution that provides real separation between personal and enterprise work spaces is offered, and this solution is applicable to other operating systems. Complete hardware and radio control\u2014including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cameras, microphone, cellular radio, and location services\u2014and enhanced VPN support and data security can also be provided. As part of these services, complex device policy management, including VPN policy management, can also be provided. Another feature that can be offered is an enterprise quality cryptographic bootloader, which can protect device integrity at the lowest levels.","The system described herein provides a complete and robust suite of mobile device management features. Several features will be described in more detail below: (1) tiered deployment model; (2) fully managed application shop; (3) multi-user\/multi-profile support; (4) fully secured cryptographic bootloader; and (5) remote device provisioning.","The tiered deployment model will be discussed first. In particular, the model can allow for advanced device control including: application management, content management (documents, training videos, audio guides, etc.), firmware management (from system firmware all the way up to the OS), device configuration, policy management, device lifecycle management, reporting and system diagnostics.","Along with remote device management features, a Web-based, tiered management model is provided in which management of groups of devices may be delegated to enterprise customers, who may then further delegate the management of sub-groupings of devices within their own organizations. Within each tier, an administrator can segment users and devices into groups (for example, sales, engineering, marketing, support). As an example, each group can have its own set of device configurations, policies, and applications. Such groups, both inter-tier and intra-tier, may be controlled using a simple and secure administration portal.","The tiered deployment model can also allow for applications, content, policies, and device configurations to be propagated down the tiered tree, while reporting and alerts can propagate up the tree. Parent nodes or portals can dictate what applications, content, policies, device configurations they wish to publish to a child (or client) node and which reports and alerts they wish to receive from child nodes. The parent node may also specify if policies, configurations, and alerts are mandatory for a child node and its decedents or if they are optional. A node is equivalent to a portal, as described above. The model may also be used to deploy new services across a wide range of vertical business markets that can greatly benefit from a hierarchical managed device structure, such as education, healthcare, and government.","Turning to the managed application repository or application shop, small and large enterprises can now ensure that each department or specific team can have access to the most up-to-date business applications, documents, and business media. These applications can be pushed to devices or made available via an enterprise-specific, white-label application repository or shop. At the same time, enterprises can restrict access to non-business-related apps and services on corporate-owned devices as needed, and ensure that minimum security requirements are met by personal devices accessing corporate resources. Not only does this improve productivity and efficiency, but it also reduces the risk of a security breach as a result of questionable apps on individual devices. In accordance with the systems, methods, arrangements and configurations described herein, application management can be enabled across a range of devices and operating systems, so at the click of a button, for example, new content and applications can be sent to a multitude of different device types.","Both corporations and end-users may want the ability to segregate professional and personal information. The multi-profile support described herein can allow a user to have separate profiles and associated policies for each. This allows IT to control how users access key corporate information but can also allow the user the freedom to take full advantage of his\/her multimedia devices.","Separate but related is multi-user support, where different users may share a device but login separately to retrieve all of their unique content, like applications. This is ideal for vertically-integrated companies, where a large workforce may share devices (e.g., healthcare, education, government, etc.). Multi-user support also provides an enhanced security framework by presenting secured containers in which all data and information for a user are stored, not just a limited set of personal information. This arrangement also prevents viruses or other malware in one workspace from affecting a different workspace.","From an administrator's perspective, the user-based organization presented herein can streamline the organization of mobile devices. Rather than managing one device at a time, several devices can be grouped into one user and that user can then be assigned the appropriate policies, applications, etc. for their role in the organization. Thus the IT administrator can spend less time managing John Doe's phone, tablet, etc. and instead focus on managing John Doe as a user.","Security and data integrity are a major concern for corporations. To ensure the integrity of devices, a fully secured cryptographic bootloader can be used with such devices. The bootloader can progressively validate each level of software. Starting at the lowest layers of the bootloader, each software component can be first validated for authenticity prior to being executed. In this way, all layers of software, starting from firmware up to the operating system layers, can be at least substantially guaranteed to be authentic and uncompromised. If a software component is found to be invalid, the boot process may fail and, and the device may attempt to revert to a back-up partition. If that partition is also found to be invalid, the device boot sequence may be halted and the device rendered useless. Other actions, such as \u201cphoning home\u201d or otherwise contacting an operating or managing module to obtain the latest stable software, may be available depending on requirements.","Inventory management, software maintenance, and device customization can be costly and time-consuming operations. Remote device provisioning and lifecycle management software, however, can address these complex and essential problems. The device provisioning described herein is operating system and device agnostic\u2014meaning that it is not limited to any platform\u2014and can be used to install and maintain any type of software.","Device provisioning provides an incredible amount of flexibility in deploying software. For example, devices can be deployed with a simple software load that \u201cphones home\u201d or otherwise contacts an authorized module after it has been deployed to download its entire or at least substantial portions of its personality. In another arrangement, the device may have its base operating system distribution pre-installed with a provisioning agent simply customizing the device with any special packages that may be needed by enterprise or consumer customers. For example, consider a generic hardware device capable of running either Android or Windows Phone 8. There is no need for a manufacturer or distributor of the device to pre-provision devices and manage inventory levels of each device. The device provisioning process can allow devices to be deployed into the field and configured once the end user receives the device and has purchased a particular software flavor. After a device and its software have been deployed, the lifecycle management configuration can be used to deploy patches and software updates or distribute special customization packages (i.e., new device themes, etc.). This solution may work for all layers of software, from the firmware all the way up to the application level.","In one arrangement, the software provisioning and life cycle management can be simplified by automatically associating devices with software. For instance, when a manufacturer or distributor ships a tablet to a user whose company is an enterprise customer of that manufacturer or distributor, the act of the user logging into their device can identify the software associated with the device by associating that device with a node under the tree of the manufacturer or distributor. This feature may greatly simplify the provisioning infrastructure of the manufacturer or distributor, while at the same time simplifying IT department deployments. In both cases, provisioning the device becomes a hands-off scenario. Software lifecycle management can also be made easier by providing a framework for rolling out software updates over time. This ability to schedule rollout campaigns helps to mitigate risk associated with introducing new software into the enterprise.","The system described herein presents an end-to-end solution that simplifies device and service deployment and management. In addition, this multi-tier remote device and application management solution spans all channels. Several key functional areas may be encompassed, including (but not limited to) device management, business intelligence, multi-user\/multi-profile, application management, security\/policy control and application shop or repository.","This system delivers broad versatility and expansive value. For example, service providers can conduct white label deployment and provide new services and custom application shops. Enterprises can manage firmware, control access, enhance security, provide custom application shops and offer enterprise licensing models. Consumers can control content and applications, set budgets and allowances and track location and usage statistics.","The system described herein can create new and incremental business opportunities. For example, the system can be packaged and sold in a number of different ways, either as a stand-alone solution (across a range of devices) or tightly coupled to an existing product of a manufacturer or distributor. This opens up new vertical opportunities for branded devices, and also allows manufacturers or distributors to offer the solution as a service agnostic of any particular hardware device. The ability to offer both these sets of solutions from one source creates tremendous operating efficiencies.","In either case, the model may generate recurring revenue streams from per-user licensing, a very scalable and high margin business. Even more exciting is the number of new vertical industry opportunities this solution can create for a manufacturer or a distributor. There are a number of promising opportunities with a need to deploy technology in a way that can be tightly managed in a tiered hierarchy. Some examples include (1) enterprise deployments where the IT administrator can select different applications and policies for different user groups such as sales, engineering, etc.; (2) education opportunity where students can share a group of tablets (with multi-user support to identify their applications\/content), while at the same time restricting how they are able to interact with the devices (e.g., only 10 minutes of Angry Birds per day); and (3) consumer devices that enter the workplace and where users want to preserve their personal information while still accessing proprietary work information (multi-profile). Obvious benefits to a manufacturer or distributor include expanding the relationship with IT manager customer bases, additional and recurring service revenue streams, customer acquisition and retention, as well as a number of others that stem from providing the platform on which to launch future products and services.","The following description presents additional details of the functional areas noted above. For example, for device management, the following points may be relevant: (1) fully-hosted, tier-based deployment model for remote device management; (2) optional cloud-based (or network based) or on-site deployment (for customers with high security restrictions, such as the government or military); (3) remote device settings configuration; and (4) enterprise e-mail configuration.","As another example, for application management, the following points may be relevant: (1) hierarchical management; (2) whitelisting or blacklisting of applications; (3) allowing or disallowing on-device application installations; (4) remote application installations, removals or updates.","For application shop or repository, the following points may be relevant: (1) white-label, hierarchical application shop; (2) full application life-cycle control, including portals for developers, testers and approvers; and (3) application license management, such as free, bulk, single use and license revocation and billing controls.","For multi-user\/multi-profile, the following points may be relevant: (1) ability to remotely manage aspects of multiple users and\/or multiple profiles; (2) automatic account provisioning; (3) addition or removal of users; and (4) allow corporate access to one profile while maintaining personal information in another profile.","For policy control and security, the following points may be relevant: (1) simple enforcement of IT security and policies; (2) rule-based control of 3G\/4G modems; (3) security policies, like rule-based VPN control, password rules, LDAP\/Active Directory integration, full cryptographic software validation, secure download of components, disable secure digital (SD) booting and disable device rooting; and (4) security controls, like addition\/removal of users, revocation of network access, device locking, logging out of users, disablement of user's ability to enable side-loading of applications, selective or complete wiping of devices (including for both enterprise and personal devices), browser security settings, password resets, role-based access to interfaces, operation in network address translation (NAT) environments and guaranteed message delivery.","For business intelligence, the following points may be relevant: (1) suite of standard and custom reports may be available; (2) application usage tracking; and telecommunications expense management, like usage of voice, data and short message service (SMS).","This next section will focus on device management. The system described herein offers comprehensive, large-scale, device management services, including the ability to push applications, perform firmware updates, send alerts, optimize telecom expenses, set device options, lock and unlock devices, wipe device of user data, and force reboots. As such, the system enables the ability to remotely monitor and manage devices in the field.","For example, fully managed devices may be capable of installing firmware, bootloader, custom supplicants, kernel drivers, operating systems, operating parameters\/policies, documents, media, arbitrary files, and certificates from cloud-based servers. Such servers can also verify devices, query device state, and send messages to one or a group of many devices.","Some exemplary features are listed here: (1) remote installation and\/or removal of applications; (2) enable and\/or disable applications; (3) allow and\/or disallow user-initiated application installation; (4) enable and\/or disable side loading of applications; (5) enable and\/or disable loading applications for SD card; (6) listing of application per user and\/or device; (7) listing of all applications deployed in an enterprise or other entity; (8) reporting application usage information; (9) configure password complexity, such as length, age, special characters, etc. (10) automatic wiping device in view of multiple password failures; (11) remote password reset; (12) VPN configuration; (13) VPN policy control; (14) wireless or Wi-Fi configuration; (15) wireless or Wi-Fi policy control; (16) proxy configuration; (17) proxy policy control; (18) encryption support; (19) wipe user data or perform a complete wipe of device; (20) remote lock and unlock of device; (21) remote logout of device's current user; (22) query device's hardware and system state, such as subscriber identity module (SIM) operator, wireless or Wi-Fi status, connected SSID, Bluetooth status, SD card, GPS, etc.; (23) enable and\/or disable device peripherals such as wireless or Wi-Fi, cellular modem, Bluetooth, camera, SD card, GPS, etc.; (24) aggregate devices into policy groups so that enterprise can enforce a set of approved configurations; (25) support separate profiles per user; (26) ring or contact device for help in locating the device; and (27) location of device.","This remote device management support can provide IT departments with unparalleled control and management over their mobile devices. It may allow IT departments nearly complete remote configuration of the device and simplifies the process through configuration profiles and automatic updates.","From an operations view, device settings may be associated with users. Each user may be associated with a bundle via an IT-specified user filter. A bundle, as previously explained, can be a set of applications, policies, configurations, and data associated with an IT-defined group. When a user's device logs into the system, the user's bundle contents and configurations may be pushed to the device. The system client can use the bundle configuration information to set device policies, configure device settings and download any required applications and data. In this manner, an IT administrator can create, for example, a small number of bundles to control a large number of devices for a vast number of users. As an example, by assigning a new user to a predefined profile, the administrator can instantly apply appropriate policies to all of that user's devices.","The servers of the system can interact with a managed device client that may reside on each monitored device. This client software can be designed for easy portability and integration, turning a wide range of devices into fully managed devices. This applies to Android and other operating systems.","As there is no single industry standard for mobile operating systems, the solution described herein can be designed to support multi-platform management of various smartphone and tablet operating systems. In addition to a fully managed Android client software, similar functionality can be provided as a third party application, downloadable from the Android Market, for example. This Android version may be restricted to capabilities provided through Android's public APIs; however, it still meets or exceeds the specifications of any other tier-1 mobile device management provider and can be suitably expanded to accommodate other features. It is installable on virtually any Android device. In addition to Android, the system is designed to support iOS, Blackberry, and Windows Phone. Like other players in this part of the mobile device management space, publicly available APIs from the respective operating system vendors can be used to control these devices.","A multi-user framework, as described herein, may provide the most secure encapsulation of enterprise data. Other solutions may claim to encapsulate personal data in a secure container, but these methods only address security concerns for data saved to disk. Since these other personal information containers run within the context of an unmanaged environment, the device is still vulnerable to Trojan and virus exploits that can sniff network traffic, track location, report network configurations, etc. The solution described herein can expand the secured container to the entire user space, giving IT administrators the ability to fully lock down and control the enterprise space, while allowing users to have a fully unmanaged account as well. When switching between accounts, this solution may stop running operating system activities and services, first giving them a chance to persist data, in order to ensure a secure environment for each account. The data for each account may also be sandboxed or isolated so that no other account can access it. Additional information on multi-user\/multi-profiles can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 61\/411,800, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","To optimize device flexibility and increase ease of user management, user profiles do not need to be created on a per-device basis and are not necessarily tied to any particular device. The system can support both a proxy connection to the enterprise's directory services server (LDAP, Active Directory, etc.) and a hosted directory services model. An enterprise user's login credentials may be authenticated by the system's servers when he\/she signs in to the device. If the device does not have a network connection available when the user logs in, then the user may be authenticated against a local authentication database. If a user is authenticated against the system server and the user does not currently have an account on the client device, the client device may create a local account for the user, download the user's configuration (policy, device settings, applications, media, documents, etc.) from the server and apply the configuration for the user. As such, it is not necessary to manually create user accounts on devices or in the system network or cloud.","A feature of the system's device management framework is its provisioning infrastructure. This allows custom setup of new devices with little to no work on the part of the customer. Upon first boot-up and initial connection to the network, a device can securely connect to the back-end via IP and can contact the provisioning service. The server can respond to the new device with pre-determined provisioning information, such as required certificates, device settings, applications, and, if necessary, updates for firmware. With this automated installation and registration procedure, there is little burden on the end user. It also greatly simplifies the logistic of deploying devices for enterprises and device manufactures.","As explained earlier, an administrator can manage device configuration globally, by groups or by individual devices. The use of bundles and roles within the system management consoles may enable easy configuration and management of thousands of devices with a very limited number of IT generated configurations. Additionally, as the system may be hierarchical in nature, corporate IT can push down policy and configuration requirements to the company's divisions quickly and easily while enforcing compliance. This interface may allow administrators to maintain consistent policies across all the devices in their enterprise.","Another feature of the solution described herein is its ability to perform remote firmware and software updates without placing any burden on the end user, meaning limited or no user interaction. Updates may be applied through staged campaigns whereby they are first applied to a small sample of the customer base to validate the upgrade prior to global rollout. Additionally, this same feature allows for user profile-based and regionally designated updates. As with the automated provisioning method, devices that \u201cheartbeat\u201d with outdated firmware\/software can automatically receive updates. The system also supports optional firmware updates that can be applied at the user's discretion. All updates can either be silent or with notification to the user.","The system can apply content management rules to firmware updates to ensure proper lifecycle management. IT administrators may have full control over the firmware deployed in their enterprises. For example, such administrators have the option to automatically promote authorized software to \u201cproduction ready\u201d status, or they can opt for a trial run on their group of user acceptance test devices. Once the administrator approves and releases the software, it then may become available for production-fielded devices. Finally, various reporting mechanisms can allow administrators to quickly determine the current software levels or configurations of their deployed devices.","The solution described herein can also provide comprehensive application and file management both on the Web services end with a complete application store or repository and on the client side with control of applications and files on devices. A more extensive list of application management features is listed here: (1) hierarchical application and data management; (2) system nodes can publish applications and enterprise data to their child nodes; (3) child nodes can accept or reject applications and enterprise data from parent nodes; (4) each node in the system tree can be individually branded by entity or organization; (5) licensing and fees can be customized per node, incentivizing re-seller networks; (6) allow and\/or disallow application execution (e.g., whitelisting or blacklisting); (7) allow and\/or disallow on-device application installation; (8) remote installation, remote removal and\/or remote updating; (9) application installation, application removal and\/or application update reporting; (10) reporting all or a portion of applications deployed in the enterprise; (11) application usage tracking and statistics; (12) full role based application life-cycle facilities; (13) developer portal to allow developers to: (a) test applications prior to publication; (b) publish their applications to one or more nodes; (c) define licensing and fee structures; and (d) track sales and revenue from their applications; (14) application approval portal to allow nodes to evaluate and track applications that developers have submitted for publication; (15) finance portal to allow node owners to track revenue generated by their node; (16) administrator portal to allow full mobile device and application management; (17) consumer portal that provides a simplified management interface client that allows end user to buy or add new applications; and (18) application licensing, such as for a fee, for free or bulk download.","The system also provides for a white-label hosted application store. This feature enables any suitable entity to have its own application store, which can be managed by another entity. As an example, it can provide a Web interface for managing application packages and for developers to upload, describe, and test their software. The client-side interface can also allow customers to browse and search for applications and then go through a checkout process to download and install them onto the device. In one arrangement, a device may be configured such that it may only see applications that are suitable for that device type and available to the node that it is associated with.","A managed application repository or store may be ideal for enterprises and service providers that need to deploy custom applications, impose specific licensing terms on applications, and have complete control over the deployment, update, and revocation of applications on customer devices. In one embodiment, the platform described herein can maintain a hierarchical level of content control where content entered at various nodes may not be accessible by sibling or parent nodes. A sibling node is a node that exists on a level that is equivalent to another node and may have a parent node that is similar to the other node. The content owner can determine when and which lower level nodes may access the content. The hierarchical structure can be unbounded and can support any level of organization or deployment complexity. Several types of portals for application management focused on different types of user, enterprise, SMB, and family can be provided, although at least some portals may use the same web services APIs, simplifying implementation and customization. These features may be inherent in the system and can be configured real-time in a cloud environment or prepackaged in an enterprise appliance bundle.","Developers from around the world can sign up with a developers program through a developer information portal or application developer portal and can obtain a license and supporting documentation. The application developer portal may offer mechanisms for developers to publish and manage their applications.","Standard applications can be uploaded through the application developer portal for beta testing, for example. In particular, the developer or some other suitable entity may enter key attributes of the application (description, graphics, etc.), and can upload the application components. At this time, the developer can install the application via the application developer portal on his\/her personal sandbox device. When they are ready, developers may submit completed applications through this portal into a central pool of applications or directly to a specific node.","At this point, the application may be available in the approval portal for the node the application was published to. The node owner can now do a functional check of the application and can make sure the application works correctly. Even though an application may run in a sandboxed environment, the check can ensure that the application runs as advertised and is not attempting to subvert the system.","Following that, the application can be made available to the node administrator, whose managers can use the administrator portal to approve or reject an app for its subscriber base. Service providers can define a policy specifying that applications should pass through to customers or whether they need explicit approval first. The hierarchical architecture of this process also allows administration portals to be offered to other entities as a service.","The system described herein can also add support for multiple users on a single device. User switching can be activated, for example, via a widget, app or lock screen. The widget, which can be a user interface element that covers all or part of a display, may sit on the desktop\/home screen and can allow users to easily change to another profile\/user. The application can be launched from an application launcher and can allow for personal workspaces to be created, as well as switching. Enterprise user accounts may be automatically created once the enterprise user logs in and can be authenticated against the system servers. Also, non-managed\/personal users can be added with, for example, restricted permission levels to ensure that they cannot add or remove other personal accounts. For instance, a child's account would not be able to remove a parent's account. In one arrangement, enterprise accounts may only be removable by an enterprise administrator. The lock screen can allow a user to log into his\/her account, even if the device is currently locked by another user. At least some or all of the applications and services may be given a chance to persist their data prior to users being logged off. Each profile (i.e., work, personal, kids, etc.) may have separate data, applications, settings, wallpapers, customizations, logins, etc. The multi-user framework may also provide support for shared, pre-installed system applications and user or administrator-installed, shared third party applications.","Multi-user support can allow users to maintain multiple profiles, such as one for enterprise use and another for personal use. This may provide IT organizations with the ability to manage devices deployed throughout the enterprise, while giving control to users for their personal profile. For example, employees can use their devices on campus and off with separate profiles for work-related applications and personal applications. Each profile can be completely sandboxed from other profiles to ensure the integrity of enterprise profiles. Also, the act of switching profiles may completely bring down all running applications and services, thereby ensuring that any Trojans or viruses that may have been running under a user's personal profile are not active in an enterprise profile. On enterprise profiles, the administrator can manage each user profile, including locking users and wiping user data (e.g., email credentials), for instance, when a device is lost or needs to be replaced.","Multi-user support may also provide IT managers with the ability to conduct all of these actions without impacting the personal profiles of company employees. IT managers can conduct firmware updates, application updates, etc. without interfering with the personal data of an employee.","The system described herein may enable IT administrators to manage device deployments and monitoring through a modular policy management interface, examples of which have been previously presented. Policy control can be broken up into two distinct areas: server side policy control and device side policy control.","Server side policy control may allow an administrator to define the constitution of a deployment group. The system's backend intelligence can manage the synchronization of that configuration to the devices within the managed domain. This feature can allow for phased rollouts of changes made by IT departments. Other policies in the system may be used to enforce scheduled notifications of compliance information or to send software update availability notifications.","On the device side, the policy manager is not necessarily limited to a small, predefined set of policies, but instead continually monitors information flowing through the operating system framework and can use that information to allow arbitrary, complex policies to be defined and enforced by the IT administrator. The policy manager may also interact with a reporting engine to implement scheduled reporting of device performance or configuration metrics, including application usage and installed application lists. Policies can be created for reporting, device logging, alert notifications, and device directives\/actions. Multiple policy templates may be provided to enable quick reuse and testing of a policy, along with automatic generation of policies based on system configuration. For example, the system may use the assigned template for default device configurations when new devices are added to the system. This feature can instruct a device to take on a different policy based on the current group to which the device is assigned. Policies may be integral to configuring and enforcing rules on password complexity, application whitelists, data encryption, etc.","The system described herein may provide a broad range of fine-grained policy control options. For instance, policy controls may exist for the following objects: (1) password configuration, including minimum and maximum password length, password complexity (minimum number of alpha characters, numeric characters and special characters), maximum password age; (2) resetting password; (3) maximum password attempts before automatic wiping of account or device; (4) enable and\/or disable encryption for application data on both local memory and SD card; (5) enable and\/or disable applications; (6) whitelist or blacklist applications; (7) enable and\/or disable hardware, such as Bluetooth transceivers, Wi-Fi transceivers, cellular transceivers, GPS modules, SD cards and cameras; (8) enable VPN when not on an enterprise network; (9) enable proxy when on an enterprise network; (10) enable and\/or disable client device reporting over cellular networks; and (11) enable and\/or disable location services.","The custom bootloader modifications can allow for a series of enterprise requested features. Examples of such features may include the following: (1) ensuring device integrity and fail-safe start-up; (2) validation of the operating system kernel and system file sets as part of the boot process; (3) authentication to ensure that the device remains hardened and has not been rooted; (4) active and standby bootable partitions to prevent device bricking and facilitate in-filed recovery in the event of failure; (5) disallowing booting from an SD card; (6) managing key press detection for alternate or recovery boot modes; and (7) processing stages or pending updates, such as IFWI (microcode) that require a device restart.","The system described herein may also provide an extensive set of features that enterprise IT organizations require from devices deployed in their organizations. Examples of such features include data encryption, device and user wipe, VPN, device configuration, Web proxy setup and certificate installation.","IT organizations may require support for both VPN and proxy support. VPNs can be used to allow devices to connect securely into the corporate network, and a proxy can be used to support certain enterprise network configurations. As an example, the system described herein can support the following types of VPNs: (1) L2TP\/IPsec pre-shared key based VPN; (2) L2TP\/IPsec certificate based VPN; (3) L2TP only VPN; and (4) PPTP only VPN.","The system described herein can also proxy support to allow devices to access the Internet when on corporate networks. Additional VPN clients or proxy support can be integrated to support various requirements.","Configuring roaming permissions on thousands of devices can be a time-consuming task usually involving calling a cellular provider, providing account details, and changing permissions. The system can simplify roaming management for IT organizations, allowing administrators to easily enable and disable roaming on a device through the system console.","The system described herein can also enable a wide range of tools to ensure enterprise data security. For example, the system supports remote device wipe, for both individual users as well as a complete device wipe to ensure corporate data is removed from lost or stolen devices. The system can also provide support for data encryption to ensure that corporate data cannot be hacked, even if a lost or stolen device cannot be wiped. Remote lock and unlock, password policy configuration, hardware control and the ability to enable\/disable applications are also features supported to protect corporate data.","Security implementations can follow industry standards and best practices for securing servers, data and communications. Security is not an add-on but rather a core precept underlying the system design. It manifests itself in several areas.","In particular, customer and administrative Web interactions are performed, for example, via HTTPS using X.509 digital certificates for authentication and key exchange followed by a login\/password scheme over the established covert communication channel. In one arrangement, only password hashes may be stored within the system so that passwords cannot be retrieved. Passwords may be salted (adding a string of random characters) and hashed with an SHA-256 algorithm, maximizing security. The system described herein can be designed to support various other single sign-on integration options. If desired by the customer, remote authorization services (such as OpenID, RADIUS, etc.) can be easily enabled and configured on a per node basis.","Post-authentication access control can be role-based. For example, this means that an administrator who manages the allocation of applications across multiple device types may not have access to customer billing data. Likewise, in one arrangement, software and hardware testers may only have access to their development devices and cannot affect production devices or configurations.","Application and firmware packages may be signed and encrypted. For web service access, calling parties may submit an API-KEY along with each web service call. An API-KEY can be similar to a login and password for machine-to-machine communications. Data can be stored on secured, load-balanced, firewalled servers. Applications on customer-facing portals may allow customers to view past usage\/billing\/download data or delete accounts and thus remove all prior records.","Scalability and fault-tolerance have been considered in the architecture of the system described herein. Services can be on dedicated machines at secure commercial hosting centers, such as Rackspace. Each center, or point of presence (POP), may contain a load balancer that can distribute traffic to multiple web servers and application servers. The back-end database holding customer and appliance records can be replicated within each POP, ensuring that records shall not be lost in the event of a failed server. In addition to being linearly scalable, the database solution can also replicate across datacenters, enabling both high availability and geographic preference to clients. A global load balancing solution can enable clients to connect to a POP that is either closer to their physical location or that may provide the best performance. The near-real time replication of data across all POPs can ensure consistent behavior for clients connecting to different POPs.","Load balancing can serve several key functions. For example, in addition to allowing increased scalability by distributing the load among all available servers, load balancing can provide for increased fault-tolerance since non-functioning systems may be taken out of the balancing pool. This same mechanism can allow for uninterrupted upgrades as machines can be taken out of the pool, upgraded, tested, and then replaced.","Services may be hosted at multiple POPs, not just for geographic proximity to various customers, but also to handle the case where an entire POP fails. For example, the POP may lose power due to a long-term power outage. In this case, a client device may lose connectivity to its preferred POP, but can do a DNS lookup to retrieve SVR records that identify a prioritized list of alternate POPs.","The system described herein was designed to scale to support millions of deployed devices across potentially hundreds or thousands of service providers. The services architecture is designed for fault tolerance and high scalability. Web\/application servers may provide the front-facing interface that communicates with replicated databases at the back end. The servers may be located behind a firewall and load balancer. The firewall can redirect certain service requests to specific service providers, if needed. For further scalability during peak traffic periods (e.g., system-wide firmware or software updates), downloads can be seamlessly transitioned to a distributed caching service. The system may scale on demand to handle any amount of traffic and peak surges and provides a global reach and intelligent routing to improve users' experience worldwide.","To ensure efficient management of infrastructure, the system can be centrally monitored using a suitable IT infrastructure monitoring systems. The system may take advantage of the Java enterprise monitoring and management APIs to expose various runtime values through the Java Management Extension API (JMX). Custom-built scripts can be used to monitor all aspects of the system by reading both JMX exposed values directly from the application, as well as SNMP values exposed from the operating system. The scripts can enable these values to be aggregated, monitored and exposed with levels of escalations and built-in event handling. Additionally, custom configurations can be used to help monitor performance thresholds across all of the core services and physical memory, CPU, and other components of the server.","Network operations center (NOC) management services can provide reporting of network traffic, automatically alerting clients when performance falls outside of parameter. Network traffic can also be managed and proactive action can be taken to improve performance.","In one arrangement, the system described herein can provide intelligent monitoring and reporting of all managed devices. Operators can quickly view statistics on individual devices as well as deployment groups. Active monitoring and reporting on devices may be necessary to maintain a stable and consistent deployment of devices. The system, for example, exposes web service based APIs that integrate with third-party monitoring and management systems. Both collected statistics and configuration changes can be made through these APIs.","As an example, online reports of any suitable data may be generated on demand in near real-time from data that is logged in hosted databases. The granularity and format of the data presented can be specified by any suitable entity.","Reports may be viewed for an individual device and global or group views to understand trends across a broad user base. The report outputs may be sorted and filtered. Capabilities for printing, exporting, or broadcasting reports to team members may be included. In addition, operators may configure various types of data collection policies that may then be disseminated to the devices.","There are numerous types of data that can be reported and the following are some examples: (1) total number of deployed devices; (2) total number of devices online; (3) average device uptime or time active; (4) average device critical exceptions (crashes); (5) application exceptions; (6) total active device sessions; (7) history of sessions per device; (8) history of user access (such as in a multi-user environment); (9) history of connection states for a device; (10) history of messages sent to a device, and aggregate views by message sender; (11) total application records by device; (12) application usage (aggregate enter\/leave of focus on application); (13) application installation and removal history; (14) current firmware and software version; (15) previously applied updates (update history with date\/time stamp); (16) boot records (with firmware\/software version and date\/time stamp); (17) group assignments (i.e., which individual devices are assigned to which groups); (18) roaming devices; (19) cellular usage and overages; (20) cellular data usages and overages; (21) SMS usage per device and overages; (22) device locations; (23) history of device wireless or Wi-FI connection status and signal strengths; (24) system resource availability (monitoring availability of CPU, memory, disk, etc.); and (25) snapshot view of active processes in the system. Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are other types of date that can be reported.","Reporting elements may also include features for support services, such as device location tracking, network configuration, device specifications, Wi-Fi status, screen capture, etc. As noted above, these are just a few of the reporting possibilities with the system. The system device reporting and policy engine may track numerous event and state variables to be able to report complex information that may be of specific interest to different market segments. For instance, the reporting infrastructure can easily be used by cellular providers for network optimization by mining dropped call data gathered on both device and network sides to determine network performance issues and optimizations. Using the system's bundle capability along with the simple reporting query generator, an operator can enable and disable this type of reporting for select markets or devices. A large number of permutations and options for reporting provided by the system reporting engine is available.","Using the expense management features incorporated into the system described herein, companies are able to, for example, generate reports showing data, voice and SMS usage associated with each different profile of a device. These reports can help allocate expenses associated with business and personal use or different business users. The system may also support (i.e., generate and transmit) notifications to users and administrators if preset usage limits are exceeded. The expense management service can allow IT departments to keep expenses in check.","V. Family Portal","As explained above, a system can be provided in which portable computing devices can be managed. As also previously explained, this management can extend to the type of content that the portable computing devices can receive, including various settings that may be applied to the devices. While many of the examples presented up to this point have been done so in enterprise environments, it must be understood that the arrangements herein are not so limited. For example, a parent may use the embodiments\/methods described herein to manage the portable computing devices of his\/her children. Similarly, a teacher may employ such embodiments\/methods to manage the portable computing devices of his\/her students. In fact, these embodiments\/methods can be integrated into any suitable relationship where one party or entity maintains at least some supervisory authority or responsibility with respect to another party or entity.","One example of such a relationship that can rely on the embodiments\/methods described thus far will now be presented. In particular, a supervisory portal arrangement will be described in which an administrator (a parent) can manage the portable computing devices of child device users (a spouse and several children). The administrator may manage these portable computing devices through an administrator portal, similar to the one described in . The managed portable computing devices can be similar to the portable computing devices  presented in  and can heartbeat with a managed services platform, like the managed services platform  of .","As such, a parent, in this arrangement, can enable content to be delivered to the portable computing devices similar to that described above. For example, as a part of content, a parent can enable the transmission of directives or commands to the portable computing devices. The supervisory portal system can provide a user interface to facilitate remote monitoring or control over one or more child devices. The administrator of the supervisory portal can determine what content is transmitted to one or more child devices. As an example, the administrator can selectively restrict and approve the third party application repositories that can be visited by a child user. In one arrangement, the administrator can obtain updates and download applications. In some instances, the administrator can send directives or have directives sent to have such items installed on one or more child devices.","The supervisory portal system does not change the general operation of the managed services platform, as described above. For example, the supervisory portal system provides a user interface to facilitate communications between an administrator and the managed services platform. For example, a DMS server can receive inputs from the administrator as to controls, policies and\/or restrictions to be imposed on child devices. In response, the DMS server can send directives to the affected child devices to impose the policies in accordance with the heartbeat feature described above. The child devices can be communicatively coupled to the DMS server. In one arrangement, if the child devices violate or attempt to violate any of the imposed controls, policies and\/or restrictions, then the administrator can be alerted of such act.","An administrator can flag or block applications and other content that the administrator does not want the child users to have. An administrator can identify such applications or content to ensure that unauthorized or questionable applications not be downloaded to a child device. This is similar to the blacklist policy described above.","Again, it will be understood that embodiments of the supervisory portal system are not limited to sending directives to child devices. Indeed, the DMS server can direct the distribution or dissemination of other content to child devices. For example, a parent, as an administrator, can also enable the delivery of bundles or individual applications and firmware packages to the child portable computing devices similar to procedures described above. Alternatively, the administrator can also direct the child devices to download applications or content.","In addition to these examples presented above, the administrator (e.g., parent) can also manage portable computing devices similar to that described above. For example, an administrator (e.g., parent) can cause messages to be generated and delivered to child devices. The administrator can wipe data from child devices. The administrator can perform remote logouts and logins on child devices. In fact, all of the description relating to the management of devices as described previously is applicable to the supervisory portal systems and methods. The inputs will be processed by the DMS platform  or similar system.","With the above understanding in mind, a user interface and capabilities of the supervisory portal system will now be explained with reference to . While the drawings associated with the supervisory portal system depict a user interface that is configured for use in a family environment, it will be understood that embodiments are not limited to such an application","A user of the supervisory portal system can access a portal for carrying out the features described herein. Such access may be by way of any suitable portable computing device equipped with an appropriate software application, including from any child device. A user identification page  can be presented to the user, such as on the display of a computing device.  is an example of one possible user identification page . The user identification page  can have any suitable form, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the user identification page  shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. The user identification page  can present on or more user interface elements. The user interface elements can have any suitable form, such as a graphical user interface element.","In one embodiment, the user interface elements can include a graphical member identifier  for each member associated with the supervisory portal network or possibly for just those particular group members who are authorized to use the particular device being accessed. The graphical member identifier  can be an image, photograph, icon, symbol, logo, name, nickname, screen name, initials, member status, associated number and\/or other identifier. The graphical member identifiers  can be customized by the administrator and\/or by the child members of the supervisory portal system. In one embodiment, the graphical member identifiers  can include a member photograph  and a member first name , as shown in . The graphical member identifiers  or other user interface elements can accept a user input in any suitable manner. For example, a user may use a keyboard, keypad, display, touch screen, button, joystick, mouse, microphone or other device to select the appropriate graphical member identifier . Naturally, any computing device can be equipped with such devices.","Again, embodiments herein are not limited to the use of graphical member identifiers  to identify the user. Indeed, the system devices can be adapted to accept biometric command inputs to permit identification of the user. As such, retinal, iris, facial, palm, fingerprint and\/or voice recognition technologies can be implemented to identify a user. Thus, the device can include a suitable camera, scanner or sensor for retinal, iris, facial, palm and\/or fingerprint recognition. Other user identification techniques can be used to identify a user, such as manual input of a user name by a user.","The user identification page  can include a title identifier  of the supervisory portal system. The title identifier  may appear on one or more of pages in the supervisory portal system. The title identifier  can be customized by a system user, such as the administrator.","Once the user is selected, a user authentication page  can be presented to the user, such as on the display of a computing device.  is an example of one possible user authentication page . The user authentication page  can have any suitable form, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the user authentication page  shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting.","The user authentication page  can be configured to receive suitable user authentication to unlock the portal so as to permit access thereto. For example, the user authentication page  can provide user interface elements to receive a user authentication input, such as a field to receive username , password , pass code and\/or personal identification number. The user authentication input can be expressed in any suitable form, including a verbal command, text, object, pixel, or the like. Alternatively or in addition, biometrics can be collected by a system component to authenticate a user. Accordingly, retinal, iris, facial, palm, fingerprint and\/or voice recognition technologies can be implemented to authenticate a user. Thus, the device can include a suitable camera, scanner or sensor for retinal, iris, facial, palm and\/or fingerprint recognition. The user input interface can include a display sensor for entering items or drawing patterns on the display of the system device. The user input interface may include a microphone for voice recognition. Of course, the authentication can be combinations of any of the above as well as other things. The supervisory portal system can be configured to store authentication credentials, such as the username and\/or password, if desired.","The user authentication page  can have any suitable form and can present any suitable content. For instance, one or more of the graphical identifiers for the selected user can be presented, including any of those described previously including graphical member identifier . A member title identifier  of the selected member may also be presented.","In some instances, an identifier of non-selected members may be displayed. For instance, the graphical member identifiers of the non-selected members \u2032 can be presented on the user authentication page  in an offsetting manner to indicate non-selection. Such offsetting can be achieved in any of a number of ways, including, for example, by having the graphical identifiers appear faded, as is shown in .","If the user's inputted credentials are authenticated, then a home page  can be presented to the user.  is an example of a possible home page . The home page  can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the home page  shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. The home page  can display one or more identifiers of the authenticated user, including any of the graphical member identifiers  indicated above. Here, the user's photograph  and name  are presented on the home page .","At this point, it should be noted that the description will be primarily directed to the supervisory portal system from the standpoint of the administrator. Aside from the user identification page  and the user authentication page , the following supervisory portal pages described herein may not be available to child members of the supervisory portal system. It should be noted that there can be one or more administrators of the supervisory portal system. For instance, in a family setting, one or both parents can be administrators.","The home page  can present different supervisory features of the supervisory portal system that are subject to the administrator's review and\/or control. As an example, the supervisory portal system can allow the administrator to view, access, monitor and\/or control applications, devices, usage, location, application wish list, and allowances. A page can be provided for each of these supervisory features. Each of these supervisory features will be described in detail below. Again, these supervisory features are provided as examples and embodiments are not limited to these specific supervisory features. There may be fewer or additional supervisory features available to the administrator.","From the home page , the administrator can select any of the supervisory features of interest for further review. Each of the supervisory features can be presented in any suitable manner. For instance, the supervisory features can be presented on the home page  by a respective user interface element . Each supervisory feature user interface element  can present at least some information can be provided as to that supervisory feature. In one embodiment, relevant information for all child devices can be presented for each supervisory feature. It will be appreciated that the various child devices of the supervisory portal system may have different associated applications, settings and controls. As an example, on the supervisory feature interface element  for applications , the applications installed on all child system devices can be displayed. The relevant information can be presented in any suitable form. For example, an icon and\/or the name of each application software program can be presented.","In some instances, it may difficult or impossible to present complete information for all child users under each supervisory feature user interface element . In such case, the presentation of the information under the supervisory feature interface element  can be modified. For instance, a subset of the information may be presented, depending on the available space afforded by the supervisory feature user interface element . In such case, a subset of the total information will be presented. The subset can be determined in any suitable manner, and may be performed automatically, such as by predefined instructions or protocols, or manually by the user. Alternatively, the size of the information can be changed to fit appropriately within the functionality element to minimize or eliminate the need to present a subset of information. Another possibility is that the format in which the information is presented can be changed. Still another possibility is that scroll bars (not shown) can be added.","The home page  can be altered by the administrator. For instance, the administrator can alter the home page  such that each supervisory feature interface element  can present information for a subset of the child users, including information for a single child user. To implement such alterations, child user filters  can be presented on the home page. The child user filters  can be provided in any suitable form, including any of those described above. As shown in , there can be child user filter  for each child user, which may be the same as the graphical member identifiers  presented on the user identification page .","If the administrator selects one or more of the child user filters , then information for only the selected child user(s) is presented under each of the supervisory feature user interface elements . The appearance and\/or content of each of the supervisory feature user interface elements  may change based on the selection.  shows an example of a home page  in which one of the child user filters is selected. As shown, the content of the supervisory feature user interface elements  has changed, showing information in each element  pertaining only to the selected child user.","If one or more child user filters  are selected, the selected child user filters \u2032 can be offset from the non-selected child user filters \u2033 in some manner to note the selection. For instance, the selected child user filter(s) \u2032 can be enlarged relative to the non-selected child user filter(s) \u2033, as is shown in . Alternatively, the non-selected child user filter(s) \u2033 may be made smaller in size and\/or appear faded relative to the selected child user filter(s) \u2032. Still alternatively, the non-selected child user filter(s) \u2033 may no longer appear on the home page .","For greater information on any of the individual supervisory features, the administrator can select one of the supervisory feature interface elements  using any suitable user interface technique, including any of those described herein. When such a selection made, a specific supervisory feature page can be presented to the administrator. Various specific supervisory feature pages will be discussed below. Again, the specific supervisory feature pages described herein are provided as examples and are not intended to be an exhaustive list.","It should be noted that additional user interface elements can be presented on the home page and\/or on any of the specific functionality pages. For instance, user interface elements for access to an application repository, devices, applications on the administrator device, and logout. For example, a \u201cSHOP\u201d button  can connect the user to an application repository, such as via a suitable communication network. A \u201cDEVICES\u201d button  can cause the devices page to be displayed. One example of a devices page will be described in greater detail below. The \u201cAPPS\u201d button  can cause the applications page to be displayed, as will be described in detail below. The \u201cLOGOUT\u201d button  will log the user off of the supervisory portal system.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, an applications page for supervising applications on child devices can be presented to the administrator.  illustrates an example of an applications page for a supervisory portal system. The applications page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the applications page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. The applications page can present information concerning all applications associated with each device of the supervisory portal system. In this context, \u201capplications associated with\u201d is defined as any application that is installed on, downloaded on, accessed by, executed by, or displayed by a child device of the supervisory portal system.","The applications page can be presented in any suitable manner to facilitate user interaction. Information may be presented for all child users of the supervisory portal system. In some instances, information may be presented for the administrator as well. Alternatively, the applications page can be adapted to present the applications associated with one or more system devices that are associated with a particular child user. To that end, child user filters  can be presented, as described above, so that the administrator can select a subset of the identifiers to customize the information presented on the applications page ","Alternatively or in addition to customizing the display of the applications by user, the administrator may be able to customize the presentation of information concerning the associated applications in other ways. For example, the applications can be presented according to the particular system device that they are associated with or according to the type of system device that they are associated with. As shown in , applications associated with a particular category of device are presented under appropriate headings ,  for that type of device.","Further, the information can be presented in any suitable form. For instance, the information can be presented in rows and columns. In such case, each application could have its own row, and each column can present information regarding the application. For instance, there can be a first column  for a graphical identifier , such as an icon, associated with each application installed on the device. A second column  may present the name of the application. A third column  can present a description of the application. A fourth column  can present the category of each application. A fifth column  can present the price paid for the application. There can be a sixth column  for a rating of the content of the application. Any suitable content rating system can be used, such as those issued by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). There can be a seventh column  of an enablement status of the application. Again, these are just examples of the different information that can be presented. Embodiments are not limited in this respect, as there may be additional or fewer columns than those shown in .","The information displayed on the applications page may be customized by the administrator. For instance, the administrator can add or eliminate columns The administrator can manipulate the columns so that they appear in a customized order. Any changes made to the applications page can be saved using a \u201cSAVE\u201d button  or other user interface element provided on the page. Additional user interface elements, such as scroll bars (not shown), can be provided to facilitate the administrator's interaction with the applications page ","From the applications page , the administrator may be able to control one or more aspects of the applications associated with the child devices of the supervisory portal system. For example, the supervisory portal system can be configured to allow the administrator to selectively enable and disable individual applications associated with child devices. Any suitable user interface elements can be provided on the applications page to facilitate such capability.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, a devices page can be presented to the user.  illustrates an example of a devices page . The devices page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the devices page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. On the devices page , the administrator can be presented with all devices of the supervisory portal system. The child devices of the supervisory portal system can be displayed in any suitable manner. For instance, one or more device identifiers  can be presented for each device of the supervisory portal system. The device identifier  can be provided in any suitable form, including graphical and\/or textual. For instance, the device identifier  can be an image, photograph, icon, symbol, logo or combinations of these possibilities. As shown in , the device identifier  can be an image of the device, including an actual image of the specific device or an image of the general type of device . The device identifier may also include a device name , which can be the user's name and\/or a general descriptor of the device\u2014computer, tablet, phone, smartphone, laptop, etc. The device identifiers  can be customized by the administrator and\/or by the child members.","The devices page can display status information for each device. For instance, an activation status  of each device can be presented on the devices page . The activation status  can be associated with the devices in any suitable manner. For example, the activation status  can be presented directly below the device identifier .","With respect to the activation status , there can any suitable activation status information can be displayed. In one embodiment, there can be two settings: on and off. The \u201con\u201d setting can indicates that the given device is currently powered on or at least enabled to be turned on. The \u201coff\u201d setting can indicate that the given device is currently powered off or otherwise not enabled to be turned on.","The devices page can be configured to allow the administrator to alter the activation status and\/or other aspects of one or more of the system devices. Thus, in one embodiment, the administrator can alter the status of one or more of the devices presented on the devices page . For instance, the administrator may be able to selectively activate and deactivate the system devices from the devices page . For instance, as is shown in , each displayed system device can include user interface elements, such as an ON button  and an OFF button , associated therewith. The administrator can select the ON and OFF buttons ,  or other user interface elements using any known technique. If the administrator selects the ON button , then the particular device can be activated or at least enabled to be activated. On the other hand, if the administrator selects the OFF button , then that particular system device can be locked or disabled.","The system can be configured to send a directive or have a directive sent to the affected child device. The term \u201cdirective\u201d means one or more commands, programs, requests, content or instructions for initiating an action on a device. The directive can be sent in any suitable form, including as a message communicated to the respective receiving child device. In such case, the message can include at least one command to be executed by the receiving child device.","Notifications of an administrator's action can be sent to any affected child users. Such notification can be provided in any suitable form, such as email, instant message, text message or voice message.","The devices page can present information on the devices for all child users of the supervisory portal system. However, the devices page can accept inputs from the administrator to view the system devices associated with a subset of the supervisory portal system users. An earlier discussion of ways in which such customizing can be implemented is equally applicable here. Changes to the status of any of the system devices can be saved using a \u201cSAVE\u201d button  or other suitable user interface element.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, a usage page can be presented to the administrator.  illustrates an example of a usage page of the supervisory portal system. The usage page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the usage page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. On the usage page, an administrator can view the usage of one or more devices of the supervisory portal system. Moreover, an administrator can selectively impose usage restrictions on one or more of the devices in the supervisory portal system.","Controls on usage can be set for each child user and\/or for each child device. For instance, the usage page can present user interface elements  that can allow for the setting of restricted hours for each child user and\/or child device. For example, the restricted hour elements  can allow the administrator to determine whether to impose any restricted hours on a child user or device. The restricted hour elements  can be provided in any suitable form, such as a YES button  and a NO button , as is shown in . If the NO button  or other input is selected, then no further user interface elements for restricted hours may be presented to the administrator. However, if the YES button  is selected, then additional user interface elements may be presented. For instance, user interface elements  can be provided the administrator can select which devices of the supervisory portal system that the restricted hours will apply to. The administrator can make the selections in any appropriate manner. For instance, device check boxes  may be provided for each device presented. If the administrator selects one of the check boxes , the appearance of the check box may change, such as by displaying a check mark within the selected box.","In addition, temporal control options  can be provided to the administrator. As is shown, a child user's usage of the selected devices can be restricted during certain hours. To that end, a disablement start time input element  and a disablement end time input element  can be provided on the usage page . The restricted hours can be input by the administrator in any suitable manner.","Alternatively or in addition to restricted hours, the usage page can allow for the setting of blackout dates for a child user and\/or device in which a particular device or user is prevented from using the device. To set blackout dates, a blackout user input  can be provided. For instance, in the example shown in , a YES button  and a NO button  can be provided. If the NO button  or other input is selected, then no further options for blackout dates may be presented to the administrator. If the YES button  is selected, then additional user interface elements  may be presented so that the administrator can input blackout dates. For instance, a calendar , menu or other element can be presented with which the administrator can operatively interact to set the appropriate blackout dates. In the example shown in , the administrator has selected January 17-26 as blackout dates in which the selected devices of the selected child user will be disabled. Changes to the usage controls of the system devices can be saved using a \u201cSAVE\u201d button  or other suitable user interface element.","The DMS server and\/or the managed serves platform can be configured to send a directive or have a directive sent to the appropriate device(s) to implement the selected usage restrictions. Notifications of the restrictions can be sent to the affected child user(s). Such notification can be provided in any suitable form, such as email, instant message, text message or voice message, just to name a few possibilities.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, a location page can be presented to the administrator.  illustrates an example of a location page of the supervisory portal system. The location page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the location page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. On the location page , the current location of one or more of the child devices of the supervisory portal system can be presented. The location of all child devices can be presented at the same time or, as described above, the administrator may select a subset of all child users and\/or devices for display.","The location of the child devices can be presented in any suitable format. For instance, the location of each child device can be shown on a map . Any suitable mapping application can be used. The map  can display a set of user interface elements (not shown) for interacting with the map, including, for example, a zoom bar, directional movement, return-to-last results button, satellite view, map view, and\/or street level view, one or more of which can enable the user to affect or manipulate the mapping program. Alternatively or in addition, the location of each child device can be presented in terms of coordinates, ZIP code, or the name of the city, county, state and\/or country in which the device is location.","The location of the child devices can be determined in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the child devices can include a positioning system (not shown). The positioning system can be configured to monitor and\/or determine the current geographic position of the child device. The positioning system can be any suitable type of positioning system, including, for example, a global positioning system, a local positioning system or a geolocation system. The positioning system may be implemented with any one of a number of satellite positioning systems, such as the United States Global Positioning System (GPS), the Russian Glonass system, the European Galileo system, the Chinese Beidou system, or any system that uses satellites from a combination of satellite systems, or any satellite system developed in the future, including the planned Chinese COMPASS system and the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System.","Alternatively or in addition, the positioning system can be based on access point geolocation services, such as using the W3C Geolocation Application Programming Interface (API). With such a system, the location of the device can be determined through the consulting of location information servers, including, for example, Internet protocol (IP) address, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Media Access Control (MAC) address, radio-frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi connection location, or device GPS and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)\/code division multiple access (CDMA) cell IDs. Thus, it will be understood that the specific manner in which the geographic position of the device is determined will depend on the manner of operation of the particular positioning system used.","For each child user and\/or device, the administrator may set permitted geographic boundaries. Such geographic boundaries can be defined in any suitable manner. For instance, appropriate geographic boundaries can be defined by geographic coordinates, a specified radius about geographic coordinates or an area defined by geographic coordinate boundaries. The administrator can manually input one or more geographic coordinates into the administrator portal, as a location policy, to be considered as acceptable boundaries within which a child user can move. The child device can be configured to reports its location in any suitable form to the DMS server. The DMS server can in turn notify the administrator if the location policy has been violated or take any predefined action set by the administrator.","If the child user is outside of the predefined boundaries, then the administrator can be notified. The notice can be provided in any suitable form including an email, an instant message, a text message or a voice message, just to name a few possibilities. Further, the supervisory portal can send a warning to a child user. Such a warning can be generated automatically or at the request of the administrator. For instance, a user interface element, such as a NOTIFY button , can be provided. If a child user is in a location that the administrator does not approve of, then the administrator can select the NOTIFY button  to send a warning or notification to the child device.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, an application wish list page can be presented to the administrator.  illustrates an example of an application wish list page . The application wish list page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the application wish list page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. On the application wish list page , requests from child users seeking permission to download applications can be presented for review and approval or rejection by the administrator.","The supervisory portal system can be configured so that the child users are only permitted to access certain application repositories, as determined by the administrator in a managed services platform as well as in a non-managed services platform. While visiting such application repositories, the child user may discover one or more applications of interest. If the child user is unable to download the application due to the prevailing controls of the supervisory portal system or otherwise, the child user can submit a request to the administrator. The request can be sent in any suitable form by way of a child portal with access to the supervisory portal system. The application wish list page can present all of the applications that one or more of the child users wish to download onto their specific device. The administrator can review the individual requests and can selectively approve or disapprove each request. Appropriate user interface elements can be provided on the application wish list page to facilitate the process.","The application wish list page can be formatted in any suitable manner. For instance, information can be provided in rows and columns Any suitable information can be provided. For example, as is shown in , some possible columns can be: graphical identifier of the application , application name , description of the application , category of the application  (i.e., games, sports, entertainment, tools, productivity, multimedia, etc.), the price of the application , and the content rating . There can also be a column  indicating whether the application is enabled or not. Indeed, while a user may have one or more applications downloaded onto the device, the administrator may be able to selectively enable and disable each individual program from the application wish list page . The columns of the application wish list page can be the substantially the same as the column headings on the applications page . In some instances, the columns of the application wish list page can be different than the column headings on the applications page ","Once an administrator has made inputs relative to the wish list, the administrator can save the changes by saving the changes. To that end, a user interface element, such as a SAVE button, can be provided. The administrator's inputs can be communicated to the DMS server, which in turn sends directives to the affected child device.","As before, the information displayed on the application wish list page can be displayed for all child users. Alternatively, the information can be displayed for a subset of all child users, including information for a single child user. To that end, one or more child users can be selected by interacting with identifiers or other user interface elements provided on the page, as described above.","Notifications of an administrator's action on the request can be sent to the requesting child user. Such notification can be provided in any suitable form, such as email, instant message, text message or voice message.","If selected from the home page  or otherwise, the administrator can be presented with an allowances page .  illustrates an example of an application wish list page . The application wish list page can have any suitable form, arrangement, content and features. Thus, it will be understood that the application wish list page shown in  is provided merely as an example and is not intended to be limiting. From the allowances page , the administrator can apply allowance limits to one or more child users and\/or to one or more child devices of the supervisory portal system. The allowance limits can be provided in any suitable form. Some examples of allowance limits will now be described. It will be understood that the following allowance limits are provided as examples and are not intended to be limiting.","One example of an allowance is whether downloads of applications or other content are permitted by a particular child user and\/or on particular a child device. Suitable download enabling user interface elements  can be presented to receive an input from an administrator. For instance, a YES button  and a NO button  can be provided on the allowances page . If the YES button  is selected, then downloads are generally permitted by the child user and\/or on the child device. If the NO button  is selected, then downloads are not permitted by the child user and\/or on the child device.","However, if downloads are enabled for a child user and\/or on a child device, then further allowance limits can be applied by the administrator. Any suitable type of allowance limits can be applied. For instance, limits can be applied to allow only certain types of downloads. The allowances page can present download type user interface elements  to facilitate the setting of such limits. In one embodiment, the download type user interface elements , such as a FREE ONLY button , can be provided to allow the administrator to permit the downloading of free applications and items by a child user and\/or on a child device. Additional user interface elements can be provided to address other application types. For instance, user interface elements, such as a FREE & PAID button , can be provided to allow the administrator to permit the downloading of free applications and items as well as those which must be paid for. The buttons ,  or other user interface elements can be selected using conventional techniques.","Alternatively or in addition, an administrator can apply allowance limits based on the age content of the downloads. To that end, content rating user interface elements  can be presented on the allowances page to receive an input from the administrator. The content rating user interface elements  can be provided in any suitable form. As an example,  shows an embodiment in which an adjustable scale  is provided. Content descriptors (i.e., all ages, pre-teen, teen, mature)  can be provided along the scale . The content descriptors  can be arranged in any suitable manner, such as in chronological order. The administrator can interact with the scale  to set the appropriate limits for each child user and\/or each child device.","Further, the allowances page may allow the administrator to set allowances based on the application category. The type and quantity of categories can vary, and the categories provided in  are only examples. Any suitable user interface elements  can be provided to receive inputs from an administrator to set allowance limits based on application category. As shown in , the application categories user interface elements  can be provided in the form of check boxes  to accept user input. The check boxes  can be selected using conventional techniques. By accepting, the appearance of the check box  may be caused to change, such as by showing a check mark within the box.","Alternatively or in addition to the above possibilities, the allowance page can receive an input from the administrator based on monetary restrictions. For instance, the administrator may impose an allowance for a given time period (such as a month). That is, the administrator can establish a maximum amount that can be spent on downloads by a particular child user and\/or on a particular child device within a given time period. Appropriate monetary user interface elements  can be provided to receive appropriate inputs from the administrator.","The monetary user interface elements  can be set in any suitable manner. For instance, the administrator can input a maximum money limit for each downloaded application . Alternatively or in addition, the administrator can input a maximum daily allowance , a maximum weekly allowance , a maximum monthly allowance , a maximum semi-annual allowance (not shown) and\/or a maximum annual allowance (not shown). If any of the imposed limits are reached, the system can be configured to restrict a child user from downloading further applications or items unless and until the limit is reset or the administrator changes the parameters of the allowance limits. Appropriate warning and\/or notification messages can be sent to the child user and\/or the administrator if one or more allowance limits are reached.","The above discussion provided some examples of the kind of limits that can be placed on child users. These examples are not intended to be limited. Indeed, there are numerous examples of other limits that can be imposed. For example, the administrator may impose limits on the quantity of applications or items that can be downloaded within a defined period of time.","The allowances page can provide a status indicator  of the allowance limits of each child user and\/or child device. For instance, as is shown in , it can show the monthly allowance in terms of the money remaining  and the amount spent for the month  by the child user. Once an administrator has made inputs relative on the allowances page , the administrator can save the changes by saving the changes. To that end, a user interface element, such as a SAVE button , can be provided.","The administrator device, the DMS server and\/or the managed serves platform can be configured to send a directive or have a directive sent to the appropriate device(s) to implement the inputted allowances. Notifications of any allowances can be sent to the affected child user(s). Such notification can be provided in any suitable form, such as email, instant message, text message or voice message, just to name a few possibilities.","One manner of the operation of the supervisory portal system will now be described in connection with . With these examples in mind, various possible steps of a supervisory portal method  will now be described. The method  illustrated in  may be applicable to the embodiments described above, but it is understood that the method  can be carried out with other suitable systems and arrangements. Moreover, the method  may include other steps that are not shown here, and in fact, the method  is not limited to including every step shown in . The steps that are illustrated here as part of the method  are not limited to this particular chronological order, either.","Referring to , an exemplary supervisory portal method  is shown. At step , a user identity can be selected or otherwise inputted on a computing device supervisory portal. At step , a user can be prompted to input user credentials, such as a password, for authentication at step . If sufficient authentication is provided, then access to the supervisory portal is permitted. If the device has been accessed by an administrator, then the administrator can be presented with one or more supervisory control user interface elements over the child devices of the supervisory portal system. The administrator can review information for one or more child devices that are supervised by the administrator.","At step , the administrator can select a supervisory control feature of the supervisory portal system. At step , the user can review, adjust and\/or implement a control setting for the selected supervisory feature. Again, examples of such supervisory control features include applications, devices, usage, location, allowances and approval\/denial of wish list applications. These and other supervisory features are described above. Supervisory control features can be set on the basis of individual child devices and\/or on the basis of individual child users of the supervisory portal system.","At step , the supervisory control feature inputs by the administrator can be sent as a directive to the affected child devices. Such directives can be sent by the DMS server. Once received, an action can be initiated on the child device based on the directive at step .","The flowchart and block diagrams in the figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.","VI.
