{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relates generally to a system and method for controlling telephone calls, and more particularly to a system and method for controlling incoming and outgoing telephone calls in a home or office.","Home telephone service is advantageously delivered through a single \u201cline\u201d (i.e., a single telephone number) that may be connected to a multiplicity of ports so that multiple phone units may be used, simultaneously or individually, on the line. The individual phone units are commonly distributed throughout the home, and may be located, for example, in bedrooms, kitchens, family rooms, home offices, etc. Similar systems may also be used in non-home situations, such as small offices, apartments, condominiums, clubs, etc.","When a call is received by the \u201chome\u201d phone line, the call is typically transmitted to each of the telephone ports that share the common telephone number, with the call generally being transmitted by a wired or wireless network to the various telephone ports. With existing technology, however, the calls are routed non-selectively to the existing telephone ports, and the home or office owner does not have the ability to control the details of how the call is routed through the home or office network. This may cause problems when, for example, a call coming into the home late at night must be sent to all telephone ports regardless of the location of the port.","Similarly, when calls are originated by a telephone of a multi-port home or office telephone network, the home or office owner is not presently able to control the details of which ports may place a call. This allows all ports that share the common number to be able to, for example, place a long distance call regardless of whether that call is allowed or authorized by the home owner.","A solid medium land line such as a metal wire or a fiber optic cable is commonly used to ensure security and a high quality of service for home telephone service. Common calling methods using such solid medium land lines include public switched telephone network (PSTN), and voice over internet protocol (VOIP) services.","When a call is transmitted over a solid medium land line, it is known to utilize certain communication technologies to improve the telephone experience. For example, caller ID (also known also as caller identification, or, more properly, \u201ccalling number identification\u201d) is a commonly-available telephone service that transmits a caller's number to the called party's telephone equipment during the ringing signal to allow the call recipient to know the number that the call is coming from. With some systems, caller ID also provides a name associated with the calling telephone number to further identify the caller. The number and\/or name is typically displayed on the receiving party's telephone, although in some cases it may be displayed on a separate device.","Global address books (also known as global address lists) are a commonly-available directory service for e-mail systems that contains information for all e-mail users, distribution groups, and exchange resources. Each address list can contain one or more types of objects (for example, users, contacts, groups, public folders, conferencing, and other resources), and is typically used to organize recipients and resources, making it easier to find the desired recipients and resources.","As previously indicated though, in spite of the availability of caller ID and global address books, systems to allow a user to more selectively and efficiently manage incoming and outgoing calls on single-line telephone networks are not presently available. The present invention addresses that need.","In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for controlling incoming and\/or outgoing telephone calls for a home or office. The system preferably comprises a telephone system, which may be a home telephone system, having a single telephone line to which a multiplicity of telephone ports are connected. The system also preferably comprises a database of instructions for processing a call received by or originating on the telephone line, with the instructions being determined by one or more user-specified parameters. The system also preferably comprises a central processing unit for applying one or more of the user-specified instructions to selectively process an incoming or outgoing telephone call. The instructions often particularly include instructions for routing an incoming call to one or more of the telephone ports.","The system may additionally include a caller identification device for identifying a caller number associated with a call placed to the telephone number. When a caller identification device is included, the database of instructions may include instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number. For example, the instructions may include instructions for accepting or not accepting a call according to the identity of the caller number, and\/or for routing the call to one or more particular phone ports. Similarly, the instructions may include instructions for applying a selected ring tone according to the identity of the caller number.","In some embodiments the instructions may include instructions for processing an incoming call according to the time of day. If so, the instructions may include instructions for routing the call to a selected subset of the telephone ports depending on the time of day that the call is received.","In other embodiments the system may include instructions for processing outgoing calls. For example, the instructions may include instructions for allowing or disallowing outgoing calls to be made from certain phone ports, or for allowing or disallowing long-distance or other toll calls to be originated from certain ports.","In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for controlling incoming and\/or outgoing telephone calls. The method preferably comprises providing a call control system as identified above, and using the system to control calls. The inventive method may control calls as outlined above, or in other ways as herein described.","For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to certain embodiments and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, and alterations and modifications in the illustrated device, and further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein are herein contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.","As previously indicated, one embodiment of the present invention provides a system for controlling incoming and\/or outgoing calls. The system includes a call control device that is effective for accomplishing one or more of the following: 1) identifying incoming calls by the incoming call telephone number; 2) determining whether an incoming call has been placed from a number for which processing instructions have been provided by the call control device user; 3) processing an incoming call according to user-specified instructions if the call has been placed from a number for which processing instructions have been provided to the call control device by the device user; 4) selectively routing incoming calls to one or more selected phone ports according to instructions that have been provided to the call control device by the device user; 5) determining whether an outgoing call has been placed from a port for which processing instructions have been provided by the call control device user; 6) processing an outgoing call according to user-specified instructions if the call has been placed from a port for which processing instructions have been provided to the call control device by the device user; and 7) allowing the device user to provide and\/or modify the call control instructions by accessing the central processing unit, either remotely or on the premises.","The system is preferably used for controlling incoming and\/or outgoing telephone calls in any facility having multiple telephone ports that serve a single telephone line, such as in a home, apartment, condominium, or office. For the purposes of this description, the term \u201ccontrolling\u201d includes selectively or non-selectively performing one or more of the following: processing, routing, handling, allowing, disallowing, affecting, distinguishing, manipulating, applying instructions to, etc., a telephone call.","Referring now to , the system preferably comprises a home telephone network having a single telephone line  entering the home , to which a multiplicity of telephone ports . . . are connected. While the network is referred to herein as being a \u201chome\u201d  telephone network, it is to be understood that the \u201chome\u201d need not be a single- or multi-family residence, and may be an office, a club, or any other location where a single telephone number is used to serve a multiplicity of phone ports. Moreover, the \u201chome\u201d may be an apartment, a condominium, or any other type of dwelling if indeed it is a residence at all.","The home telephone network ports . . . simultaneously connect a multiplicity of telephone units . . . to the single telephone line . The multiplicity of telephone ports  may be connected by a wired or wireless network.","The system also preferably comprises a database  of instructions for processing a call received by the telephone line, with the instructions being determined by one or more user-specified parameters. The database  of instructions may include instructions for determining how an incoming or an outgoing call should be routed, whether a particular telephone port  should receive a call during certain hours, whether a particular telephone port  should receive a call from a certain telephone number, etc. The instructions are typically stored and formatted in a way so as to be readable and actionable by a central processing unit.","The system also preferably comprises a central processing unit (CPU)  operably connected to the database  of instructions and to the telephone system in a manner effective for allowing the CPU  to receive and apply one or more of the instructions. The CPU  is preferably a microprocessor adapted to fetch, decode, execute, and writeback a sequence of instructions stored in the database .","The system may additionally include a caller identification device  for identifying a caller number associated with a telephone call placed to the call control system user's telephone line . The caller identification system  may identify one or both of two separate pieces of information: the calling number and the billing\/subscriber name. In some embodiments, the CPU  may be used for the caller identification device .","When a caller identification device  is included, the database  of instructions may include instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number. When instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number are provided, the instructions may include instructions for accepting or not accepting a call according to the identity of the caller number, and\/or instructions for routing the call to one or more of the telephone ports. Similarly, the instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number may include instructions for applying a selected ring tone to the call according to the identity of the caller number.","In some embodiments the instructions may include instructions for processing an incoming call according to the time of day. If so, the instructions may include instructions for routing the call to one or more of the telephone ports depending on the time of day that the call is received. For example, the instructions may provide that calls are not received in a bedroom after a certain time, or that only calls from a certain list of numbers are received in a bedroom after a certain time.","In some embodiments the instructions may include instructions for processing outgoing calls. In such embodiments the instructions may include instructions for disallowing a specific phone port to place any calls, or for disallowing specific phones to place calls that incur a call-specific charge (i.e., a toll call), or for disallowing specific phones to place calls to one or more user-specified numbers.","In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for controlling incoming and\/or outgoing telephone calls. The method preferably comprises providing a call control system as identified above, and using the system to control calls. Toward that end, the call control system used in the inventive method may include a home telephone system, as described above, having a single ingoing\/outgoing line  connected to a multiplicity of telephone ports . The system may additionally include a database  of instructions for processing a call to or from said telephone line  according to one or more user-specified parameters, and a central processing unit  for applying one or more of said instructions to selectively process a call. The method includes using the call control system to receive or originate a call, selecting one or more instructions from the database  of instructions, and processing the call according to the selected instructions.","As with the inventive system, the database  of instructions used in the inventive method may include instructions for routing a call to one or more of said telephone ports , and if so, the method may include using the database  of instructions to route a call to one or more of said telephone ports . The set of ports  to which a call may be routed may include a single port, a selected subset of the ports, or all of the ports, according to the instructions provided by the user.","The inventive method may also provide a call control system having a caller identification device  for identifying a caller number associated with a telephone call placed to said telephone line , and if so, the method may include using the caller identification device  to identify a caller number associated with a telephone call placed to said telephone line , and processing the incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number. When the method includes applying instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number, the applied instructions may include instructions to accept or not accept a call according to the identity of the caller number, or to route the call to a particular phone port  or a set of phone ports . Similarly, when the method includes applying instructions for processing an incoming telephone call according to the identity of the caller number, the method may include applying a selected ring tone to the call.","The database  of instructions may include instructions for processing an incoming call according to the time of day, and if so, the method may include using those instructions to process an incoming call according to the time of day. For example, the method may include routing a call to certain phone ports  after a certain selected time, or responding to the call with a pre-recorded message according to the time at which the call is received.","The inventive method may also provide a call control system that includes instructions for processing outgoing calls. In such embodiments the system may include instructions for allowing or disallowing a specific phone port  to place a call (i.e. the ability to render a specific phone port  inoperative), and the method may include the step of allowing or disallowing a specific phone port  to place a call. Similarly, the method may include applying instructions for allowing or disallowing one or more selected phones  to place calls that incur a call-specific charge (i.e., a toll call), and\/or for allowing one or more selected phones  to place calls to one or more specified numbers.","In some embodiments the user may enter instructions and\/or make changes to the instructions using a computer interface. Accordingly, it is not necessary to enter instructions by dialing controls on individual handsets, which can be tedious when long or detailed instructions are desired.","In some embodiments the system of the present invention may be accessed remotely. This allows the user to make changes to the system instructions remotely, thereby facilitating ease of use. The remote access may be performed by calling the system from a remote location, or by accessing the system online via internet services and an application programming interface (API).","The system hardware may be a gateway for any of a set of different types of calling methods, including PSTN, VOIP, etc. The system may also be adapted to accommodate wireless technology, such as Bluetooth pairing technology.","The system may include a device for recording messages for, and sending messages to, the originator of an incoming call. Accordingly, the system may be adapted to send a message to an incoming caller that the call has been received and is being processed, or any other message that is desired.","Incoming calls may be managed by the hardware CPU  and passed through process logic. The process logic may be used to determine which rules should be applied and how the incoming or outgoing call should be handled.","The inventive system may utilize a global address book via custom or open API access. In some embodiments, the global address book may be integrated into the database . The global address book may be used to facilitate determining and\/or applying the user-specified instructions. For example, the global address book may contain a black\/white caller list to facilitate identifying callers from whom calls may or may not be received.","In some embodiments the CPU  may be programmed to \u201clearn\u201d instructions\/rules according to the history of how previous calls were handled. For example, if the system identifies that all previous calls to a certain number were placed from a specific phone port , the system may write and implement a rule providing that incoming calls from that number are routed to that port .","Referring now to the drawings,  shows a process for receiving an incoming call, according to one preferred embodiment. The incoming call is received at step , and an optional messaging hardware\/software informs the caller at step  that the call is being processed. The call control system hardware\/software indentifies the caller at step , and determines at step  whether any rules exist for that specific caller number. If so, the call control system applies the rules at step  and routes or otherwise handles the call accordingly. If there are no rules for the specific caller number, the call is processed at step  according to a user-determined set of \u201cdefault\u201d rules. For example, if no rules exist for the specific caller number, the call may be routed to all telephone ports  or sent to voicemail, to give just two non-limiting examples.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["200","202","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["300","16","14","302","14","14","304","14","306","308","310","312"]},"It is to be appreciated that the inventive system and method allows the home telephone system user to enforce call handling rules without calling the phone or cable company for changes. This facilitates efficient service, making the system easier to use and less costly.","It is also to be appreciated that the inventive system and method provide a hardware interface that is less expensive than conventional, network based systems.","While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
