abstract: The invention is directed to an apparatus, method and system for providing reduced power consumption, fast processing of digitized communication signals and relatively easy reconfiguration for different applications, such as communication protocols/standards. The invention recognizes that the processing of signals associated with different types of communication standards can be recharacterized as deterministic data flows.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention is directed to signal processors, and more particularly, employing multiple signal processors to process a deterministic data flow associated with a signal.","In recent years, several high-speed data services have become standardized for wireless communication. Also, many of these standardized services employ relatively complex computational techniques to process wireless communication signals. However, this kind of signal processing demand creates significant implementation issues for affordable, lightweight and conveniently sized mobile (wireless) nodes. Also, these signal processing demands can cause bottlenecks in implementing mobile nodes capable of multi-mode, multi-band operation and reduced power consumption.","Some devices employ a custom designed Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to perform digital signal processing of communication signals. Other devices use a single and relatively generic digital signal processor (DSP) to process communication signals. And still other devices employ a hybrid design that includes both ASICs and generic DSPs to process communication signals.","There are benefits and trade-offs when employing either an ASIC or generic DSP to digitally process communication signals. For example, although the \u201chard wiring\u201d of an ASIC consumes substantially less power than a DSP, an ASIC is not easily reconfigurable for multiple modes of operation. On the other hand, although reprogramming or reconfiguring of a generic DSP can be relatively easy, it will tend to consume more power than an ASIC performing substantially the same operations. Also, although the per unit cost of a generic DSP is substantially more expensive than an ASIC, the up front costs to custom design the hard wiring of an ASIC can be substantial and difficult to recoup when a relatively small number of ASICs are needed.","Additionally, System on a Chip (SoC) concepts have been tried for digital signal processing of communication signals. However, owing to the complexity of many communication standards, the highly integrated silicon technology of SoC implementations have not yet been sufficiently compelling to provide an alternative to ASIC, generic DSP and hybrid designs for communication systems. In particular, a typical SoC circuit can only be clocked so fast and still be efficient (not consume as much or more power than a generic DSP based communication system).","In recognition that wireless communication data flows are deterministic and data-centric, it would be preferable to employ this understanding in digital processing of communication signals. Also, by taking a top-level communication system viewpoint and making architectural decisions that best fit the data-flow model of an application, such as a wireless communication standard, it may be possible to address many of the issues that inhibit optimal communication system implementations, e.g., high speed, low cost, and low power.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanied drawings, which form a part hereof, and which is shown by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments of which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The meaning of \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d includes plural reference, the meaning of \u201cin\u201d includes \u201cin\u201d and \u201con.\u201d The term \u201cconnected\u201d means a direct electrical connection between the items connected, without any intermediate devices. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d means either a direct electrical connection between the items connected, or an indirect connection through one or more passive or active intermediary devices. The term \u201ccircuit\u201d means either a single component or a multiplicity of components, either active and\/or passive, that are coupled together to provide a desired function. The term \u201csignal\u201d means at least one current, voltage, or data signal. Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views.","The terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and \u201ccharacterized by,\u201d mean an open-ended or inclusive transitional construct and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements, or method steps. For example, a combination that comprises A and B elements, also reads on a combination of A, B, and C elements.","The term mobile node means a wireless device, e.g., a cellular telephone, pager, Personal Digital Assistant, host or router that is capable of changing its point of attachment from one wireless network or subnetwork to another. A mobile node may change its location without changing its IP address; and it may continue to communicate with other nodes coupled to the Internet at any location using its (constant) IP address, assuming link-layer connectivity to a point of attachment is available.","The term Digital Signal Processor (DSP) means a type of co-processor that is generically designed to perform high speed calculations on analog information presented in a digital format, such as audio, pictures, communication and video signals. Also, a DSP is usually employed in the compression and decompression of the digitally formatted information.","The term Class processor means a DSP with a core that is configurable to perform optimized algorithms associated with a particular category\/class of computation for an application, e.g., a wireless communication standard such as. For example, a Class processor might be configured to perform compression algorithms such as discrete cosine transforms (DCT) and\/or fast fourier transforms (FFT) methods on digitized Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) communication signals. Also, multiple Class processors can be included in a common CSP platform to process different categories of computations for several different types of applications.","The term Communication Signal Processor (CSP) means a processor or platform that can include several Class processors that are arranged to process different classes of computations on deterministic data flows, e.g., data flows that are typical for wireless communication standards. Additionally, the CSP may be included in a platform for System on a Chip (SoC) integration of various components employed by a communication system, such as a mobile node.","The invention is directed to an apparatus, method and system for providing reduced power consumption, fast processing of digitized communication signals and relatively easy reconfiguration for different applications, such as communication protocols\/standards. The invention recognizes that the processing of signals associated with different types of communication standards can be recharacterized as deterministic data flows. Also, for each deterministic data flow, several of the same categories of computation are performed in substantially the same manner, albeit in a different order or somewhat differently, that is unique to a particular application. Based on this recharacterization, the invention divides the processing of the deterministic data flow for a communication signal among several Class processors that are separately configurable to optimize their particular category\/class of computation in the processing of the signal.","A main clock signal can be employed to synchronize the deterministic data flow of the signal between each Class Processor included with the invention. However, each Class Processor can use a different clock signal and\/or different voltage level to asynchronously perform their particular class of computation. A higher, same or lower clock signal and\/or voltage level can be selected for each Class Processor to optimize their particular class of computation and reduce wait states in the processing of the signal. Also, the optimized clock signal and voltage level for each Class Processor reduces the overall power consumption of the invention.","Additionally, since operation of each Class Processor is separately reconfigurable, the CSP can be changed to accommodate different types of applications, such as wireless communication standards without having to undergo a relatively expensive redesign. For example, a CSP included with a mobile device could be initially configured to operate in a GSM based network and later reconfigured to process wireless communication signals in another network, e.g., CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). Although the initial configuration of the operation of Class Processors included with the CSP could be performed during manufacturing, later reconfigurations could be selected or performed automatically by detecting the type of application associated with a currently received signal.","Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","124","110","108","106","102","110","100","108","106","102"]},"Microprocessor  is coupled to several components, including, but not limited to, DSP , control logic , memory , storage device , and input\/output interface .

Typically, a communication system handles two deterministic data flows: transmission and reception flows, as shown in . This aspect of communication systems is a relatively unique feature when compared to many other systems where fully random data flow is considered, such as in a personal computer or Personal Data Assistant where a large number of applications are often supported that can significantly diversify the data flow model.","Advanced communication systems have increasingly adopted more advanced, complex and diversified algorithms for processing signals, such as Turbo decoders, time-frequency diversity, various adaptive algorithms and multi-scheme systems. However, these advanced communication systems still maintain relatively consistent data flow patterns, which are well suited to make a domain specific architecture, i.e. limit the architecture to a relatively fixed and optimized data flow pattern. Currently, other architectures are more often based on a random data flow approach that provides flexibility, but at the cost of higher power consumption due in part to excessive data transitions and clock speed headroom.","On-chip communication flow for communication systems can be divided into three data flow speed groups, as shown in . For the high-speed data flow, which can be hundreds of Mbps, the data movement can be generated by signal processing functions, such as filtering and transforms. The medium-speed data flow, which can be a couple of Mbps, typically carries processed signals\/information from one subsystem to another in sequential order. The low-speed data flow typically operates at tens of kbps and can pass control information from the host control, which can be protocol stack processors or application processors, and the like. If all three data flows were to pass on the same bus, which is what most other SoC designs have assumed in the past, many conflicts can happen, hence a high clock rate is typically required that results in even higher power consumption.","Another consideration in providing a low-power and high-speed communication system is to use more memory as a trade-off for interconnections. However, a shared memory architecture may not be as effective as interconnections because the unit cost of transistors is decreasing and the cost of metal interconnections is becoming relatively more expensive. Thus, separating high-speed data operations from low speed data operations with different memory banks can further reduce overall power consumption. Also, the power consumption can also be lowered by locating relatively high speed memory banks close to a high speed processor core.","The invention employs an object-oriented architecture to divide a communication system into objects, which are connected by data flows. Each object can contain a particular category\/class of high-speed data flows within the object. Each object can be implemented at least in part with fixed logic (hardwired object) and\/or relatively small DSP cores in Class Processors. An object uses a Class Processor core as a software object and its functions can be implemented in firmware that can be changed relatively easily for a variety of different algorithms, different communication standards, and the like. Each class processor can handle a category\/family of algorithms, but still share almost the same programming environment.","A class processor typically includes a configurable core with at least three types of memory, as shown in . Private memory is used to handle local high speed processing data flow. Protected memory is used for peer-to-peer flow of data between Class Processors, and public memory is employed to communicate with the host processor for control operations.","As discussed above, an object-oriented architecture for a CSP platform has several advantages. First, integration is relatively easy since the CSP platform can employ relatively loose coupling for integration. The CSP platform does not necessarily depend on a particular bus architecture, instead it can employ dedicated connections for individual high speed data flow and host native communication infrastructure for control data flow, which is at very low speed. The CSP platform is hostless, which can support any host chosen by a user of the communication system.","Another benefit of the invention is relatively easy programming. All of the Class Processors can employ relatively the same configurable core so that they are able to maintain substantially the same programming environment. Since the CSP platform leverages a relatively fixed inter-core communication network and is coupled very loosely, programming is relatively easier than configuring interconnections or a parallel computing approach.","Yet another benefit of the invention is lower power consumption. Since the CSP platform separates and contains the high speed processing data flow from others data flows, it has the ability to reduce the power consumption associated with interconnections. Also, it can perform better than a uniprocessor approach that employs multiple distributed sequencers and data flows to avoid a high clock rate due to conflicting tasks running in the same sequencer. The CSP platform also reduces the use of ASICs in a communication system by using more memory and class processors, which in turn enables more advanced processes to be used in fabrication.","Still another benefit of the invention is its flexibility. Since system functions can be implemented in firmware, useful applications such as a software-defined radio can be implemented with a CSP platform that employs highly optimized class processors to perform the wireless communication algorithms. Other software radio advantages include changing and upgrading algorithms, and correcting hardware errors.","Another benefit of the invention is its fast time-to-market. The CSP platform separates the SoC design into two activities: class processor design and firmware design. The class processor can be performed in parallel with system analysis, as it doesn't contain too much system knowledge. Also, the algorithm complexity can be carried by firmware.","As SoC designs become more complex, two issues, which are very closely linked to architecture selection, emerge at least as important as computational throughput. These two issues are firmware and tools. Since SoC designs are adopting more and more firmware to replace hardwired circuits, great effort is expended in creating efficient firmware, especially deep embedded firmware. Firmware can also be called embedded software and it often has at least two major sections. The first section is up-embedded software, which can include applications, Real Time Operating System (RTOS), protocols, and the like. The second section is deep embedded software (DES), which can include DSP assembly code, micro-code for a configurable core or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and the like.","Up embedded software is typically characterized as a software despite the fact that it typically resides on the chip. In contrast, the DES occupies more of the boundary between software and hardware, which is tightly linked to hardware architecture. Also, the DES is often numerical, MIPS intensive, difficult to develop, and optimize. However, the DES greatly affects and often determines the overall performance of the communication system and power consumption although its code size is not relatively large.","One method for developing firmware is to use a high-level language like C\/C++. This method works well for up embedded software, but is not as successful with DES or DSP firmware. Often, assembly language programming is employed, because much better performance can be achieved. Also, when large numbers of configurable cores are deployed in a SoC design, there is an increase in the difficulty to create an easily programmable interface. Additionally, if a high level language is employed, the overhead introduced by its compiler may diminish many of the advantages achieved by the use of configurable cores.","Currently, many of the other DSP architectures present too complicated a programming model to be used with an assembly language. One approach for programming firmware is to employ a high-level language environment that is supported by an assembly language library and intrinsic functions. This approach can be adequate for certain applications, but not for very advanced algorithms since they typically haven't been covered in the libraries. Also, since the CSP platform employs a number of small and simple class DSP cores in the SoC chip, all of the cores can be relatively easily programmed in assembly language. However, a multi-layered code authoring and verification method can be used to upgrade an assembler environment to the C program language level, while still maintaining substantially the same performance as assembly language programming.","A SoC tool also plays a role in creating and verifying communication systems that may have multiple cores. Currently DSP tools are mostly point tools, which support a relatively standalone uniprocessor or core. Thus, when an entire SoC communication system is integrated into one chip and running in real-time, providing visibility, bug fixes, system parameter tuning, and algorithm adaptation verification is challenging. Typically, the SoC tool is configured to provide at least some support for heterogeneous and homogeneous multiple-core tools, which are employed in product development and marketing. Thus, when the entire communication system is integrated into a single device, the evaluation board hardware may not be difficult to make, but it may not demonstrate sufficient functionality for the SoC. Thus, sophisticated software tools that can view the internal workings of the SoC are a factor in acquiring customers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","302","302","304","304","306","306","308","308","310"]},"As indicated by the thick curved arrow in each block, computationally intensive processing is performed within the class processor. In contrast, relatively slow operations such as moving the processed data between class processors (indicated by relatively light arrows between each block) and controlling the operation of each class processor (indicated by the dotted arrows) is handled separately.","In operation, each class processor can be configured with a different voltage level and\/or clock signal that enables an optimal processing of the wireless communication signal and the data flow between class processors. Also, the bus for moving the processed signal between class processors and the control of the class processors can employ different clock signals and voltages that are optimally suited for their particular function.

WCDMA supports asynchronous operation of base station networks, therefore, a three-stage synchronization scheme is typically employed.","For a WCDMA receiver, synchronization or cell search procedure searches are complicated by the presence of multipath, soft\/softer hand-off, frequency offset, antenna diversity and other impairments to both the channel and the receiver. To overcome these issues, the received signal is typically oversampled to ensure a proper Nyquist rate and improve timing. Also, this \u201cfrontend\u201d processing usually occurs at some multiple of the clock rate for the receiver. Additionally, since this type of frontend processing is computationally intensive, special ASICs are often employed for this purpose.","However, ASICs are not known for their flexibility, which is an important feature for frontend components capable of accommodating changes and improvements. The invention partitions the hardware and DSP implementation of frontend processing to enable both power efficiency and flexibility. In addition to frontend processing provided by a Rake receiver, which despreads the chip rate sample and combines them, at least part of a cell search procedure is not limited to the initial acquisition of a signal. Rather, during the target mode, a WCDMA receiver can frequently search for a multi-path profile for finger assignment and received signals from neighboring base stations\/sectors for soft\/softer handoff.","The invention's flexible and efficient design can employ variable rate matching and multiple coding structures for different data rates and quality of services to optimize the memory usage and partitioning of tasks between DSP software modules and ASIC, accelerator and\/or coprocessor hardware.
