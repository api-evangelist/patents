title: Apparatuses, methods and systems for a live online game tester including choosing additional subjects from co-users if needed
abstract: A method for testing a new feature of an online gaming application is provided. According to the method, a gaming application request is received from a user, and it is determined whether to add the user to a live test for a new game feature. If the user is added to the live test, then the user is assigned to a test group or a control group. If the user is assigned to the test group, then a gaming application is provided including the new game feature enabled. If the user is assigned to the control group, then the gaming application is provided without the new game feature enabled. User social graph data identifying co-users of the user is obtained, and gaming activity and social network activity of the user is evaluated.

Services like social networks allow users to connect and communicate with one another. Such services also allow users to play games with others online. Users impart a great amount of sensitive information in such social networks.","The APPARATUSES, METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN ONLINE BEHAVIOR MONITOR (\u201cOBM\u201d) transform user social-gaming behavioral pattern data via various OBM components into online social-gaming experience customizations.","In one embodiment, to process a virtual security clearance request, the OBM may obtain user online gaming pattern data including gaming actions and their associated timestamps, user online social activities and their associated timestamps; and virtual security clearance evaluation rules. The OBM may generate a social-gaming activity timeline using the gaming actions, social activities and timestamps. By applying the virtual security clearance evaluation rules to the social-gaming activity timeline, the OBM may calculate evaluation scores. The OBM may compare the evaluation scores to the evaluation score thresholds to generate virtual security clearance flags, and may determine whether any virtual security clearance flags were generated based on the comparison. The OBM may, upon determining that no virtual security clearance flags were generated, obtain user online gaming action input and user gaming environment data, and generate updated user gaming environment data using the user online gaming action input.","In one embodiment, upon receiving a customer service request from a user, the OBM may obtain, for processing the customer service request, user social graph data identifying co-users, social networking action identifiers and associated social networking action timestamps; user online gaming action identifiers and associated gaming action timestamps; and customer service request evaluation rules and associated request evaluation score thresholds. The OBM may generate social-gaming activity timelines for the user and the co-users using the gaming action identifiers, social networking action identifiers and timestamps. The OBM may generate a social-gaming activity thread for the user using the social-gaming activity timelines. The OBM may calculate customer service request evaluation rule scores by applying the customer service request evaluation rules to the social-gaming activity thread, and compare each customer service request evaluation rule score to its associated request evaluation score threshold to generate request evaluation flags. The OBM may determine whether to process the customer service request based on whether any request evaluation flags were generated.","In one embodiment, the OBM may provide, in response to a gaming app request from a user, a gaming app including a test game feature for the user. The OBM may obtain user social graph data identifying co-users of the user. The OBM may also obtain: online gaming pattern data for the users and the co-users, including gaming action identifiers and their associated gaming action timestamps; user online social activity data, for the users and the co-users, including social networking action identifiers and their associated social networking action timestamps; and game feature adoption evaluation instructions. The OBM may generate social-gaming activity timelines for the users and the co-users using the gaming action identifiers and the associated gaming action timestamps, as well as the social networking action identifiers and the associated social networking action timestamps. The OBM may also calculate and provide game feature adoption scores by applying the game feature adoption evaluation instructions to the generated social-gaming activity timelines.","In one embodiment, the OBM may generate individual social-gaming activity timelines for a group of users within a geographical region using user online gaming pattern and social activity data. The OBM may calculate individual time-varying activity level graphs for the users, as well as an aggregate activity level graph. The OBM may identify an activity trough in the aggregate activity level graph, and an event in the geographical region corresponding to the activity level trough. Based on keywords corresponding to the event, the OBM may obtain product results from a product database. The OBM may identify a subset of the users whose individual time-varying activity level graphs include an activity level trough during the activity level trough in the aggregate activity level graph, and may provide an advertisement for a product from the product results for the identified subset of the users.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in .

More suspicious user online social behavior, shown in some examples by a shallow social graph , may include a user with numerous friends where none of the user's friends have a relationship with one another. In contrast, a cohesive social graph exemplifies less suspicious online social behavior and shows a user with numerous friends, all of whom possess some relationship with another. For example, a user's friends may belong to similar groups, exchange messages with another, and\/or the like. In these examples a user's friends may be connected with one another by various degrees of separation. In other implementations, the number of interconnected relationships between a user and a user's friends may affect the level of suspicion associated with the user's online social behavior. In other implementations the types of relationships between a user and\/or user's friends may affect the level of suspicion associated with the user.","In other implementations examples of more suspicious user online social behavior may be shown in a broken-loop transaction graph . In a broken-loop transaction graph a user is on the receiving end of multiple closed social loops. For example, a highly suspicious example of user online behavior may include a user receiving dozens of gift transactions from other various users. Further to the previous example, in other implementations, a user's online social behavior may be even more suspicious if none of the users sending a gift to the user have a relationship with one another . In contrast, a looped transaction graph shows less suspicious user online social behavior. In a looped transaction graph a user may be involved in numerous open social loops. For example, a user may receive various favors from other users and in response may send gifts and\/or friend gestures to each one of those users. Some of these graphs may be discerned by examining users' friend lists and building link topologies\/graphs. In one embodiment, a users' direct friends may be traversed to discern if they each in turn have additional friends. Friends that do not further have their own friends may then be counted as having negative values (e.g., \u22121), while friends that in turn have friends, and in turn have other friends, may be given positive values (e.g., +1) for each recurring leg. A total count may be developed, and thresholds (e.g., total values greater than 0) may be used to mark a graph as suspicious.","In  suspicious social behavior examples are shown according to a user's location according to a gaming\/social networking service, a user's social activity. For example, in a less suspicious example a user may transmit a number of messages to a social networking service, one of which indicating they are leaving for Europe in a few days . After a few days , the user accesses the social network through a server in Europe and submits an image of themselves to the social network service . In other implementations more suspicious social behavior may include abrupt and\/or unannounced changes in a user's social activity patterns. For example, a user may access a social networking service in South America at 3 PM Pacific Standard Time and then, at 6 PM Pacific Standard Time , the user accesses the social network in another part of the world (e.g., Australia, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["701","702","721","729"]},"In some implementations, the user may provide input, e.g., , to the client device indicating that the user desires to utilize an application (e.g., a game) provided by the social gaming network. In response, the client may generate a gaming app request, and provide the gaming app request, e.g.,  to an OBM server, e.g., gaming server . For example, a browser application executing on the client may provide, on behalf of the user, a (Secure) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (\u201cHTTP(S)\u201d) GET message for a HyperText Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) page, wherein the HTML page includes JavaScript\u2122 commands to embed an Adobe\u00ae Flash object including an application for the user in the HTML page.

In response to the gaming patterns request, the gaming behavior database may provide the requested gaming patterns data (e.g., as database records) for the identified user IDs associated with the game ID of the game, e.g., . In some implementations, the evaluation rule may require the evaluation server to obtain social activity data, e.g., activity of the user and\/or co-users of the game on a social networking service (e.g., Facebook\u00ae, Twitter\u2122, etc.). In such implementations, the evaluation server may issue (e.g., via PHP\/SQML commands) a social patterns request, e.g., , to a social behavior database, e.g., . In response, the social behavior database may provide the requested social patterns data, e.g., , for the evaluation server (e.g., as records from the database). For example, the records may include fields such as, but not limited to: user ID, friend ID(s), friend relationship strength(s), social activity timestamp(s), message ID(s), message(s), and\/or the like, and\/or the like. In some implementations, the evaluation server may determine that the social patterns data from the social behavior database if not sufficient (e.g., using social activity timestamps to determine that the data available does not cover the entire time period required by the evaluation rule, data is outdated, data is incomplete, etc.). In such implementations, the evaluation server may query a social networking server (e.g., a Facebook\u00ae server) providing a service utilized by the user and his\/her friends for social data (e.g., new social activity request ). For example, the evaluation server may invoke an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) call to the social networking server. The evaluation server may request that the user log in to the social networking service to provide the evaluation server access to the user's social data.

In some implementations, the evaluation server may parse the data for the social and gaming activities of a user, and identify activity timestamps associated with each of the social and\/or gaming actions of the user. The evaluation server may utilize the activity timestamps to generate a social-gaming activity timeline for the user, to process the evaluation rule. The evaluation server may generate a timeline for each user that whose actions are required to be analyzed to process the evaluation rule. The evaluation server may, in some implementations, also parse each of the activities of a user to determine the co-user at whom the activity was directed (e.g., to whom did the user send the message?; to whom did the user provide a gift?). The evaluation server may then generate social-gaming threads, e.g., , for each user that include data on the user's activities and their associated activity timestamps, as well as activities of co-users at whom the user's actions were directed, and their associated timestamps (e.g., wherein the activities of the user and co-users are combined and arranged in reverse chronological order).","In some implementations, upon generation of the social-gaming activity timeline and\/or social-gaming thread for the user, the evaluation server may apply the processing procedures prescribed in the evaluation rule to the social-gaming activity timeline(s) and\/or social-gaming thread(s).

The evaluation server may determine the social-gaming data required to continue processing the evaluation rules for the user, e.g., . The evaluation server may generate requests for data as specified by the evaluation rule. In some implementations, the evaluation rule may require the evaluation server to obtain the game rules of the game identified by the game ID (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). If so, the evaluation server may generate, e.g., , and issue a game rules request (e.g., ) to a game database. In response, the game database may provide, e.g., , the request game rules, e.g., as XML-encoded data similar to the example XML encoded evaluation rules provided above. In some implementations, the evaluation server may require the gaming environment of the game being played by the user (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). The evaluation server may issue a game environment request, e.g., -, to the gaming environment database using the game ID and\/or user ID as search terms in, e.g., a PHP\/SQL command. In response, the gaming environment database may provide the requested game environment data, e.g., , for the evaluation server. The evaluation server may parse, if needed, the environment data to extract the user ID(s) of the user(s) playing the game, e.g., . In some implementations, the evaluation server may determine that the rule requires the evaluation server to obtain the gaming patterns of the users of the game (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). The evaluation server may generate and issue a gaming patterns request, e.g., -, to a gaming behavior database. In response to the gaming patterns request, the gaming behavior database may provide the requested gaming patterns data (e.g., ) for the identified user IDs associated with the game ID of the game. In some implementations, the evaluation rule may require the evaluation server to obtain social activity data (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d) for a user. In such implementations, the evaluation server may generate and issue, e.g., -, a social patterns request (e.g., PHP\/SQML commands) to a social behavior database for the user's social activity data. In response, the social behavior database may provide the requested social patterns data, e.g., , for the evaluation server. In some implementations, the evaluation server may parse the social activity data and extract the timestamps from the social activity data obtained from the social behavior database. The evaluation server may compare the range of activity timestamps against the requirements of the evaluation rule (which the evaluation server may obtain, e.g., by parsing the evaluation rule). Based on the comparison, the evaluation server may determine whether any additional (e.g., new) social data is needed (e.g., social graph, activity data, etc.). If the evaluation server determines that additional social data is needed (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u2019), the evaluation server may query a social networking service utilized by the user and his\/her friends for social data (e.g., -). In response the social networking service may provide the requested social data for the evaluation server, e.g., . The evaluation server may aggregate, e.g., , the social patterns data from the social behavior database and the social networking server to generate updated social patterns data records (which the evaluation may provide for updating the social behavior database). The evaluation server may parse the data for the social and gaming activities of a user, and identify activity timestamps associated with each of the social and\/or gaming actions of the user. The evaluation server may arrange the timestamps in, e.g., reverse chronological order, in a data structure (e.g., SQL table with one column dedicated to activity timestamps). The evaluation may then include the social and\/or gaming data (e.g., messages, gaming actions, currency transactions, etc.) as additional columns within the table, associated with the activity timestamps column. Accordingly, the evaluation server may generate a data structure (e.g., SQL table) representing a social-gaming activity timeline for the user. The evaluation server may generate such a timeline for each user that whose actions are required to be analyzed to process the evaluation rule, e.g., . The evaluation server may also generate a column in the data structure representing a co-user at whom each activity in the user's social-gaming activity timeline was directed at. Using the data, e.g., in this column, the evaluation server may generate a social-gaming thread, e.g., , for each user for whom the evaluation server determines a social-gaming thread is required for processing the evaluation rule. For example, while generating the social-gaming thread for a user, the evaluation server may search through the social-gaming activity timelines of each of the co-users at whom the user has directed one or more actions in the user's social-gaming activity timeline. The evaluation server may identify actions in the social-gaming activity timelines of the co-users that were directed back at the user, and may parse these records in the co-user social-gaming activity timelines to determine whether their activities were made in response to, or drew a response by way of, the user actions in the user's social-gaming activity timeline. The evaluation server may copy such identified records from the co-user social-gaming activity timelines, and add them in to the social-gaming thread of the user, (re)arranging all the records in the user's social-gaming thread in, e.g., reverse chronological order.","In some implementations, upon generation of the social-gaming activity timeline and\/or social-gaming thread for a user, the evaluation server may apply the evaluation rules for the identified game ID to the social-gaming activity timeline(s) and\/or social-gaming thread(s) of the user. For example, the evaluation server may obtain an evaluation rule, e.g., . The server may parse the evaluation rule, and determine the user ID of users whose activities are to be examined, based on the evaluation rule, e.g., . The server may utilize the user ID(s) to select and obtain the social-gaming activity timelines and\/or social-gaming threads for the identified user(s), e.g., . The evaluation server may apply the processing procedures described in the evaluation rule to the social-gaming activity timelines and\/or social-gaming threads of the user(s), e.g., . Based on the application of the evaluation procedures described in the evaluation rule, the evaluation server may generate a score, e.g., , for each user, for each evaluation rule. The evaluation server may also parse the evaluation rule, and obtain threshold value(s) against which to compare the evaluation score(s), to determine whether to generate (general) rule violation\/Constraint of Service (\u201cCoS\u201d) flags, e.g., . If the evaluation server generates any flags (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d), then the evaluation server may parse the evaluation rule to determine the outputs (e.g., warnings, notices, complaints, lock-out orders, etc.) that the evaluation server needs to produce. The evaluation server may generate, e.g., , the required outputs based on the parsing of the evaluation rule (e.g., in the example rule presented earlier, for the instructions under the <output> tag). The evaluation server may append the generated outputs to a CoS order, e.g., , and\/or provide the generated output(s) to the respective parties as specified in the evaluation rule. The evaluation server continues such a procedure until all the evaluation rules pertaining to the game and\/or user(s) have been applied (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). The evaluation server may determine whether any of the flags generated during the evaluation procedure were CoS flags (e.g., flags for which CoS orders need to be sent, and not clearance acknowledgments). If no CoS flags were generated (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d), the evaluation server may generate a clearance acknowledgment, e.g., , and provide the clearance acknowledgment, e.g., -, for the gaming server.

In such implementations, the may redirect the user's gaming app request to a gaming server that provides  the user with a gaming app that does not include the new game feature. In such implementations, the user may interact  with the control gaming environment presented by the gaming app that does not include the new game feature, e.g., using a user gaming interaction component such as the example UGI  component described above with reference to . The OBM may perform an evaluation  of the user's gaming and\/or social activity (e.g., via a SGBE  component) in a manner similar to that performed by the SGBE  component for the test users of the gaming app including the new game feature. The OBM may, e.g., utilize a social-gaming behavior evaluator such as the SGBE  component to perform the evaluation of the user's and co-users' social-gaming behavior, generate  evaluation score for the evaluation rules, and generate reports based on the scores and flags generated by the evaluation. The OBM may append  the generated report for the control user to an aggregated control group score record.

For example, each object within the gaming app may be assigned an object ID. The OBM may determine which object ID is associated with the game feature that the user is experiencing difficulty with. For example, the OBM may utilize a social-gaming behavior evaluator to generate a social-gaming activity timeline of the user experiencing a low engagement level, and identify a temporal (e.g., stage within a game) and\/or spatial (e.g., pixel sub-area within an Adobe\u00ae Flash object) position within the gaming app at which point the user tends to stop playing the game within a user session. In some implementations, each object ID and\/or stage within a gaming app may have a difficulty weight associated with it. In some of these implementations, the difficulty weight of the object ID and\/or stage may be modifiable during the user's gaming session. In some implementations, the OBM may lower the difficulty weight associated with object ID and\/or stage identified as being the object ID and\/or stage at which the user tends to stop playing the game.","In some implementations, the OBM may identify incentives that the OBM can provide for the user and\/or co-users determined by the OBM to be likely to help the user achieve higher engagement levels. The OBM may provide incentives to encourage the user to re-establish higher engagement levels within the game, or may encourage the co-users to contribute to increasing the user's engagement level. For example, the OBM may obtain and\/or parse the user profiles and\/or social activity messages of the user and co-users to identify keywords that the OBM can use in a search for (virtual) products to offer for sale to the user and\/or co-users. The OBM may utilize the keywords to query  a (virtual) product database for items that may be offered to the user and\/or co-user. In some implementations, the OBM may also utilize keywords related to the object ID within the app and\/or the stage of the game to query for items that may be offered for sale. The (virtual) product database may provide search results listing products for the OBM to offer to the user and\/or co-users. The OBM may provide the (virtual) items  in a flash sale for the user, and\/or co-users with an invitation  to the co-users to help the user overcome the hurdle in the user's game. For example, the OBM may provide a message for a co-user (e.g., \u201cJane needs help defeating the dragon. Buy from the items below at special discounted prices; join Jane's game and use them to help her fight the dragon!\u201d) encouraging the co-user to purchase an offered item, and\/or join the user's gaming environment to help the user overcome the hurdle in the game. In some implementations, the OBM may reduce the difficulty weight of the object ID and\/or game stage upon co-users of the user accepting the invitation to join the user's game to help overcome the hurdle presented by the object ID and\/or game stage within the game. In some implementations, the OBM may provide, to co-users that help the user, rewards and\/or incentives within their own gaming apps and\/or offering further flash sales of items, e.g., at discounted prices because the co-users helped the user overcome the hurdle in the user's game. For example, the OBM may reduce the difficulty weight for objects and\/or game stages within the co-users' gaming apps so as to improve their engagement levels within their own gaming apps. For example, the OBM may calculate new difficulty weights  for objects and\/or game stages in the gaming apps of the user and\/or the co-users based on factors including, but not limited to: number of items sold in the flash sale connected to the invitation to help the user, number of co-users accepting the invitations to help the user, amount of flash sales connected to the invitation to help the user, and\/or the like. In some implementations, upon the co-users accepting the invitations, the OBM may process the co-users' and user's sale item purchases (e.g., using an online shopping system such as the OpenCart open-source online shopping solution). The OBM may also inject the co-users into the gaming environment of the user (e.g., using a gaming session initialization such as the example GSI  component).","In some implementations, the OBM may, e.g., , utilize a social-gaming behavior evaluator (e.g., SGBE  component) to generate a social-gaming activity timeline of the user, and determine whether the user has progressed over the hurdle identified by the app object ID and\/or game stage. In some implementations, the OBM may also determine whether the user requires any more help with the identified hurdle, or any other hurdle the user may be experiencing within the game, e.g., . If the OBM determines that the user needs more help (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d), the OBM may repeat a procedure similar to that discussed above for the user until the OBM determines that the user's engagement levels are comparable to historical levels for the user, e.g., as determined using a social-gaming behavior evaluator component.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIGS. 22A-C","b":"2200"},"In some implementations, the OBM may identify a distinct geographical area, e.g., .

Upon identifying a set of IP addresses associated with the area, the OBM may determine a set of user IDs associated with geographical area, e.g., , based on querying the gaming environment databases using the identified IP addresses. The OBM may, e.g., utilize a social-gaming behavior evaluator component (such as the example SGBE  component), to generate social-gaming activity timelines for the identified user IDs, e.g., . Further, the OBM may generate a time-varying activity level histogram, e.g., , for each user ID. For example, the OBM may generate, for each user ID, a histogram with a period in time on the x-axis, and frequency of activity on the y-axis. The OBM may generate a historical aggregate activity level graph by aggregating the histograms for the identified user IDs, e.g., . The OBM may then identify troughs, e.g., , in the aggregate activity level graph (e.g., by calculating a graph of the differentiation of the activity level graph with respect to time, and identifying any negative spikes in the differentiation graph, identifying time periods where activity level was below a threshold level, or a threshold percentage of the historical average activity level, etc.). The OBM may assign a trough ID to each of the identified troughs in the aggregate activity level graph, e.g., . The OBM may, in some implementations, analyze the positions of the trough compared to the time of day in the geographical region, and neglect\/eliminate, e.g., , activity troughs that are expected (e.g., night-time, peak hours in work day, etc.). The OBM may then analyze each activity trough remaining in the aggregate activity level graph.","In some implementations, the OBM may select, e.g., , a trough identified by a trough ID. The OBM may identify a time of the activity trough, e.g., . The OBM may initiate searches (e.g., using news aggregators, search engines, etc.) for events that occurred during the time period of the activity trough. For example, the OBM may attempt to identify, e.g., , a \u201clocal\u201d event, e.g., an event that occurred within the geographical region during the period of the activity trough. The OBM may, in some implementations, attempt to identify, e.g., , a \u201cglobal\u201d event, e.g., an event that occurred outside of the geographical region during the period of the activity trough. For example, the OBM may aggregate the search results from a variety of news sources, and analyze, e.g., using keyword matching, latent semantic indexing, etc., the aggregated search results to identify any events recurring in the aggregated search results. Based on the analysis, the OBM may identify a local event and\/or a global event, or not identify any event during the time period of the activity trough. If the OBM does not find any local or global event (e.g., , option \u201cNo\u201d), the OBM may repeat the above procedure for a different activity trough, if there are further activity trough identified for the geographical area (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). If there are no further activity troughs for the geographical area (e.g., , option \u201cNo\u201d), the OBM may repeat the above procedure for another geographical area, if there are further geographical areas for which the OBM can perform the above procedure (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). If there are no further geographical areas for which to perform the procedure above (e.g., , option \u201cNo\u201d), the OBM may end the procedure.","In some implementations, the OBM may find a local and\/or global event during an activity trough for the aggregate activity graph of users confined to a specific geographical area (e.g., , option \u201cYes\u201d). In such implementations, the OBM may identify keywords associated with a local event (if any) based on the results of the analysis (e.g., using latent semantic indexing) of the aggregated search results, e.g., . the OBM may identify keywords associated with a global event (if any) based on the results of the analysis (e.g., using latent semantic indexing) of the aggregated search results, e.g., . The OBM may utilize the keywords obtained from analyzing the aggregated search results to query a (virtual) product database for (virtual) items (e.g., physical objects, which may also include game incentives, virtual objects to reduce the in-game difficulty levels of objects and\/or game stages, etc.) that may be offered for sale for the users in the geographical area. For example, the OBM may identify \u201clocal\u201d items in the product database based on querying the database using keywords associated with the local event, e.g., , and \u201cglobal\u201d items in the products database based on querying the database using keywords associated with the global event, e.g., .

For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum; a (fixed and\/or removable) magnetic disk drive; a magneto-optical drive; an optical drive (i.e., Blueray, CD ROM\/RAM\/Recordable (R)\/ReWritable (RW), DVD R\/RW, HD DVD R\/RW etc.); an array of devices (e.g., Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)); solid state memory devices (USB memory, solid state drives (SSD), etc.); other processor-readable storage mediums; and\/or other devices of the like. Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the OBM component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the OBM controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Nan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems. However, more limited and\/or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS, IBM OS\/2, Microsoft COS, Microsoft Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/Vista\/XP (Server), Palm OS, and\/or the like. An operating system may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or the like. Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the OBM controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the OBM controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D) hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol (WAP), WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the OBM controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the OBM database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the OBM database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the OBM. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the OBM as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/XP\/Vista\/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by, with, and\/or atop operating systems and\/or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and\/or operation of program components and\/or system facilities through textual and\/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and\/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the user interface communicates with operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The user interface may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","A Web browser component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and\/or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, web browser plug-in APIs (e.g., FireFox, Safari Plug-in, and\/or the like APIs), and\/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs, cellular telephones, and\/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program components (e.g., plug-ins), and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the OBM enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as, but not limited to sendmail, Microsoft Exchange, and\/or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP, ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, PERL, PHP, pipes, Python, WebObjects, and\/or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as, but not limited to: Internet message access protocol (IMAP), Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)\/Microsoft Exchange, post office protocol (POP3), simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), and\/or the like. The mail server can route, forward, and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent, relayed and\/or otherwise traversing through and\/or to the OBM.","Access to the OBM mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and\/or the operating system.","Also, a mail server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses.","A mail client component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, Mozilla, Thunderbird, and\/or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols, such as: IMAP, Microsoft Exchange, POP3, SMTP, and\/or the like. A mail client may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the mail client communicates with mail servers, operating systems, other mail clients, and\/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, information, and\/or responses. Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous (encryption and\/or decryption) security protocols such as, but not limited to: checksum, Data Encryption Standard (DES), Elliptical Curve Encryption (ECC), International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Message Digest 5 (MD5, which is a one way hash function), passwords, Rivest Cipher (RC5), Rijndael, RSA (which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), and\/or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols, the OBM may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the OBM component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the OBM and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems; i.e., it may act as a client and\/or server of secured resources. Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The OBM database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the OBM database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the OBM database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the OBM database  may be integrated into another component such as the OBM component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A Users table may include fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, ssn, first_name, last_name, middle_name, suffix, prefix, address_first_line, address_second_line, city, state, zipcode, country, birth_date, gender, device_ID_list, device_name_list, device_type_list, hardware_configuration_list, software_apps_list, device_IP_list, device_MAC_list, device_preferences_list, and\/or the like.

One or more of the tables discussed above may support and\/or track multiple entity accounts on a OBM.","In one embodiment, the OBM database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search OBM component may treat the combination of the OBM database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the OBM. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the OBM may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The OBM may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The OBM database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the OBM database communicates with the OBM component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The OBM component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the OBM component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the OBM discussed in the previous figures. As such, the OBM affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The OBM component may transform user social-gaming behavioral pattern data via OBM components into online social-gaming experience customizations, and\/or the like and use of the OBM. In one embodiment, the OBM component  takes inputs (e.g., user input , gaming app , gaming environment data , , evaluation rules , game rules , gaming patterns data , social patterns data , social data , new social activity data , and\/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various components (e.g., gaming session initiation (GSI) component , user gaming interaction (UGI) component , social-gaming behavior evaluation (SGBE) component , gaming session termination (GST) component , virtual security camera (VSC) component , customer service request evaluator (CSRE) component , live online game tester (LOGT) component , game feature set tester (GFST) component , user engagement-tracking game modification (U-ETGM) component , group engagement-tracking game modification (G-ETGM) component , and\/or the like), into outputs (e.g., gaming app request , app query , user session state , display output , user gaming input , clearance request , clearance ACK , CoS order , environment query , user gaming input\/sessions state , user session state , clearance request , evaluation rule request , game rules request , game environment request , gaming patterns request , and\/or the like), as shown in , as well as throughout the specification.","The OBM component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the OBM server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The OBM component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like.

Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques. For example, OBM server(s) and database(s) may all be localized within a single computing terminal. As another example, the OBM components may be localized within one or more entities (e.g., hospitals, pharmaceutical companies etc.) involved in coordinated patient management.","The configuration of the OBM controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or other wise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., the SOAP parser) that may be employed to parse communications data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","Non-limiting exemplary embodiments highlighting numerous further advantageous aspects include:","A1.
