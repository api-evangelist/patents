title: Method for the production of uranium chloride salt
abstract: A method for the production of UClsalt without the use of hazardous chemicals or multiple apparatuses for synthesis and purification is provided. Uranium metal is combined in a reaction vessel with a metal chloride and a eutectic salt- and heated to a first temperature under vacuum conditions to promote reaction of the uranium metal with the metal chloride for the production of a UClsalt. After the reaction has run substantially to completion, the furnace is heated to a second temperature under vacuum conditions. The second temperature is sufficiently high to selectively vaporize the chloride salts and distill them into a condenser region.

One such treatment applies an electrometallurgical process to recover low-enriched uranium and convert radioactive fission products into acceptable waste forms. This treatment utilizes uranium chloride as an oxidizing agent to convert sodium, actinides, and fission products into their corresponding chloride salts.","A supply of uranium chloride is therefore necessary for the continued electrometallurgical treatment of sodium-bonded spent nuclear fuel. However, existing methods of production do not satisfy this requirement because of their reliance upon special equipment, hazardous chemicals, and subsequent purification steps. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,262, issued to Miller and Tomczuk, discloses a method for making uranium chloride salt in a cadmium system using cadmium chloride to oxidize uranium. However, implementation of that method requires special handling and disposal procedures because of its use of cadmium, which is a regulated metal. Moreover, it requires additional equipment and involves the handling of chlorine gas, which poses additional risk. Thus, a method to produce uranium chloride of sufficient purity without hazardous chemicals or additional equipment would be beneficial.","One or more embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method to produce uranium chloride that satisfies the need for uranium chloride without the use of hazardous chemicals and multiple apparatuses for synthesis and purification. A method to produce uranium chloride having features of the present invention includes the steps of: (a) mixing uranium metal and a metal chloride with a eutectic salt in a reaction vessel; (b) heating the reaction vessel to a first hold temperature above the melting point of the metal chloride; (c) maintaining the first hold temperature at a first pressure for a time period sufficient to react the uranium metal and metal chloride, wherein the first hold pressure is less than atmospheric pressure; (d) heating the reaction vessel to a second hold temperature above the melting point of the uranium metal; and (e) maintaining the second hold temperature at a second hold pressure for a period sufficient to distill the uranium chloride salt and allow metal consolidation.","One or more embodiments of the present invention improve upon the existing methods for production of uranium chloride by eliminating the use of hazardous chemicals. Instead, the various embodiments of Applicants' method produce uranium chloride by reacting uranium metal with a non-hazardous metal chloride in the presence of a eutectic salt, such as LiCl\u2014KCl. Following formation, uranium chloride dissolves into the eutectic salt, and the metal alloys with excess uranium.","Applicants also improve upon the requirement for additional machinery by conducting the reaction and purification in a single apparatus capable of heating a reaction vessel under vacuum conditions and distilling chloride salts into a condenser region as described herein. Prior to heating the reaction vessel, the uranium metal, metal chloride, and eutectic salt are mixed, which can be accomplished mechanically. Subsequently, the reaction vessel is heated to a first hold temperature that exceeds the melting temperature of the metal chloride to carry out the reaction between uranium metal and metal chloride. To prevent the spurious vaporization of UCl, the first hold pressure may exceed the vapor pressure of UCl.","One or more embodiments of the present method also obviate the requirement for additional purification by including a step to distill uranium chloride from excess metals. Following the reaction of uranium metal with metal chloride, the reaction vessel is heated to a second hold temperature above the melting temperature of uranium metal under vacuum conditions sufficient to selectively vaporize the chloride salts. The chloride salts migrate in the vapor phase to a condenser region.","In another embodiment of the present invention, an electrorefiner cathode product comprising uranium and a eutectic salt is mixed with a metal chloride. The production and collection of uranium chloride otherwise follows the method described above.","In another embodiment of the present invention, an electrorefiner cathode product of about 20 wt. % LiCl\u2014KCl eutectic salt and about 80 wt. % uranium is mixed in a reaction vessel with CuClin a ratio of between about 25 to 1 and 20 to 1, respectively. The reaction vessel is heated to a first hold temperature of about 650\u00b0 C. under a first hold pressure, preferably at less than atmospheric pressure (about 760 Torr), and even more preferably in the range of about 100-760 Torr. After maintaining the first hold temperature and pressure for a period of about two hours, the reaction vessel is heated to a second hold temperature of about at least 1200\u00b0 C., and the pressure is decreased to a second hold pressure, preferably between about 0.1-10 Torr. The second hold temperature and pressure are maintained for a period of time sufficient to distill the chloride salts into a condenser region and consolidate the uranium metal product in the reaction vessel.","These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the multiple embodiments of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description, appended claims, and by practice of the invention.","Generally, the present invention is directed to a method to produce uranium chloride and includes the steps of: (a) mixing uranium metal and a metal chloride with a eutectic salt in a reaction vessel; (b) heating the reaction vessel to a first hold temperature above the melting point of the metal chloride; (c) maintaining the first hold temperature at a first pressure for a period sufficient to react the uranium metal and metal chloride, wherein the first hold pressure is less than atmospheric pressure; (d) heating the reaction vessel to a second hold temperature above the melting point of the uranium metal; and (e) maintaining the second hold temperature at a second hold pressure for a period sufficient to distill the uranium chloride salt and allow metal consolidation.","In the first step of one or more embodiments, uranium metal, metal chloride, and a eutectic salt are mixed in a reaction vessel. To assure thorough mixing, mechanical means, such as agitation with blades or baffles, are preferably utilized to mix the uranium metal, metal chloride and eutectic salt prior to loading the reaction vessel into a furnace capable of distilling chloride salts, such as an induction-heated furnace or a resistance heated furnace. Alternatively, the uranium metal, metal chloride, and eutectic salt may be mixed in a reaction vessel that is already contained in a furnace or other heating means.","The uranium metal is preferably natural or depleted uranium. Applicants envision various structures of uranium, including rods, sheets, disks, ingots, pellets, slugs, plates, foils, and powders\/particulates\/fines. Uranium sheets provide an advantage over alternative structures because they typically possess a greater reaction surface area. The eutectic salt is preferably a mixture of LiCl\u2014KCl, having a melting temperature of about 360\u00b0 C. Metal chlorides are utilized as a source of chloride to form uranium chloride. The preferred metal chloride for this method is non-hazardous, such as CuCl, MnCl, and ZrCl, and is added to uranium metal in a ratio corresponding to reaction (1).\n\nU+(3)MCl\u2192UCl+(3)M\u2003\u2003(1)\n","In an alternative embodiment, uranium metal and eutectic salt are added to a reaction vessel in the form of an electrorefiner cathode product, comprising about 20 wt. % eutectic salt and about 80 wt. % uranium metal. In this embodiment, the eutectic salt consists of LiCl\u2014KCl with minor amounts of fission product chlorides and sodium chloride.","The reaction vessel has a structural integrity sufficient to house uranium metal and is preferably constructed of a solid graphite mold. In one embodiment, the graphite mold is coated with zirconia to promote release of the uranium metal product from the mold. Alternative reaction vessel coatings envisioned by Applicants include but are not limited to hafnia, erbia, and alumina coatings. In yet another embodiment, Applicants envision lining the reaction vessel with copper metal foil to prevent interaction between the uranium and zirconia.","In the next step, the reaction vessel is heated to a first hold temperature after being loaded into an induction-heated furnace or other heating means. The temperature within the furnace is raised to a first hold temperature that exceeds the melting point of the metal chloride under vacuum conditions. The temperature in the furnace may be increased at various rates, but is preferably increased at a rate of less than 10\u00b0 C. per minute. Preferably, the first hold temperature is about 30\u00b0 C. above the melting temperature of the metal chloride. Even more preferably, the first hold temperature is such that it prevents salt distillation at the first hold pressure. For example, at a pressure of about 1 Torr, the upper range of the first hold temperature is preferably less than 750\u00b0 C. in order to prevent salt distillation. In additional embodiments, a first hold temperature of about 650\u00b0 C. is preferable for CuCl, where the melting temperature for CuClis about 620\u00b0 C. Similarly, a first hold temperature of about 680\u00b0 C. is appropriate for MnCl, and a first hold temperature of about 450\u00b0 C. is appropriate for ZrCl.","The first hold temperature is maintained under vacuum conditions for a period of time sufficient for the metal chloride and uranium metal to react, according to reaction (1). In one embodiment, the first hold temperature and pressure are held constant for a period of about at least 2 hours. To maintain vacuum conditions throughout the reaction, a vacuum system is operably connected to the furnace. In one embodiment, internal pressure in the reaction vessel is preferably in the range of about 100-760 Torr. In another embodiment, the internal pressure of the reaction vessel is between about 0.1-1 Torr. However, any pressure below atmospheric pressure may be compatible with the multiple embodiments of the present invention depending on other operating conditions.","In the next step, the furnace is heated to a second hold temperature above the melting temperature of uranium metal (1132\u00b0 C.) under vacuum conditions to distill the chloride salts and consolidate the uranium metal product. In one preferred embodiment, the temperature is raised to about 1200\u00b0 C., under vacuum conditions in the preferred range of about 0.1-10 Torr. In another preferred embodiment, the temperature is raised above about 1200\u00b0 C., preferably under similar vacuum conditions. The temperature and pressure are maintained for a period of time sufficient for the chloride salts to distill from the uranium metal product. As with the first heating step, a large range of pressures below atmospheric pressure are compatible with the process depending on other operating conditions.","In one embodiment, the second hold temperature is maintained under vacuum conditions for a period of about 2 hours, but any period of time sufficient to distill the chloride salts is acceptable. The distillation is performed under differential vacuum conditions to direct the migration of chloride salts to a specific region of the furnace for collection, generally referred to as a condenser region herein. Upon completion, the chloride salts are then returned to an electrorefiner where the uranium chloride acts as an oxidant to incoming sodium, actinides, and fission product metals.","In addition to formation of UCl, reaction of metal chloride with uranium, as set forth in reaction (1), will also produce UCl, as shown in reaction (2). As depicted in reaction (3), UClmay decompose into UCl. However, this decomposition is precluded where the first hold pressure is below the vapor pressure of UCl, allowing UClto spontaneously vaporize into the condensate. To avoid the spurious distillation of UCl, the first hold pressure should exceed the vapor pressure of UClfor a time sufficient for reaction (3) to run substantially to completion. To this end, a first hold pressure is preferably maintained between about 100 and 760 Torr for about two hours.\n\n2CuCl+U\u2192UCl()+2Cu\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n3UCl+U\u21924UCl\u2003\u2003(3)\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","6","6","6","5","4","5","6"],"sub":"3 "},"A condenser region  is located on top of the crucible assembly . Following the chlorination process, the reaction vessel  is heated to a second hold temperature and distillate materials migrate in the vapor phase from the reaction vessel  to the condenser region , where the chloride salt products are recovered. To maintain vacuum conditions throughout the chlorination and distillation process, a vacuum system  connects to the condenser region  of the furnace , which is housed within an argon-atmosphere vacuum vessel .","While the above description relates to production of uranium chloride salt in a specific furnace, it is apparent to one or ordinary skill in the art that the multiple embodiments of the present invention can be performed in a number of different reaction environments, and the previously described apparatus in no way limits the manner in which the multiple embodiments of the invention can be performed.","A reaction vessel coated with zirconia and lined with copper metal foil was loaded with 2790 g of LiCl\u2014KCl eutectic salt, 5048 g of cupric chloride, and 10,288 g of uranium rods. The uranium rods were approximately 1.9 cm in diameter and 21.1 cm in length, having an effective surface area of 0.12 cm\/g. After loading the reaction components, the pressure within the reaction vessel was lowered to about 25 Torr, and then the temperature was increased to about 650\u00b0 C. The temperature and pressure were maintained for about 2 hours. Subsequently, the pressure was decreased to about 13 Torr, and the temperature was raised to about 1350\u00b0 C. These conditions persisted for about 5 hours to distill the chloride salt products.","Following distillation, chemical analysis of the condensate was performed in duplicate, as represented in Table 1. Eight metals were detected in the condensate, and assuming the chloride species of each of the metals, both samples had a mass balance of about 90%. Based on the amount of copper found in the condensate, the reaction was found to have not run to completion. This was attributed to the low surface area of the uranium rods. The presence of aluminum and zirconium in the condensate was attributed to side reactions of UClwith the alumina liner and zirconia coating of the reaction vessel, and the iron was attributed to UClreacting with the stainless components of the condenser. The sodium was residual from previous metal waste operations. Additionally, the vacuum pressure of 13 Torr was found insufficient for complete distillation of the chloride salts. In a subsequent run, the internal pressure was lowered to 2 Torr and an additional 282 g of salt was distilled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Chemical Analysis of Condensate (values in wt. %)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sample","U","Cu","Li","K","Al","Zr","Fe","Na"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["#1","10.7","3.8","6.4","8.1","2.2","0.6","0.5 ","<0.4"]},{"entry":["#2","10.6","6.2","4.6","9.6","1.9","1.8","0.5","1.8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"A reaction vessel without alumina, coated with zirconia, and lined with copper metal foil was loaded with 2778 g of LiCl\u2014KCl eutectic salt, 5042 g of CuCl, and 10,602 g of uranium sheet pieces.
