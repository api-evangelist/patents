title: System and method for transacting retrieval of real estate property listings using a remote client interfaced over an information network
abstract: A system and method for transacting retrieval of real estate property listings using a remote client interfaced over an information network is described. A set of real estate property listings is maintained in a structured database. Each listing includes a characteristics set describing property listing information organized according to property class. A remote client is interfaced in a dynamic search session via a communications link transiently connected over an information network. The remote client maintains both program code and data exclusively in a general purpose random access memory configured for both transient and persistent storage. A target characteristics set describing one or more such listings in at least one such property class is received from the remote client upon initiation of the session. The listings matching the target characteristics set from the structured database are identified. The listings are provided to the remote client upon termination of the session.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/344,389, filed Jun. 25, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,484,176 issued Nov. 19, 2002, the priority date of which is claimed and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates in general to remote database access and, in particular, to a system and method for transacting retrieval of real estate property listings using a remote client interfaced over an information network.","In the residential segment of the real estate industry, computerized real estate information databases, known as multiple listing service (MLS) databases, have become the premier source of centralized real estate property listing information. MLS databases enjoy widespread acceptance throughout the industry. Individual real estate agencies subscribe to the MLS and provide information about properties both listed and sold. Access is ordinarily restricted to licensed real estate professionals, appraisers, and lending institutions.","Typically, an MLS database contains a set of property listing records describing real estate properties being offered for sale, leasing, or rental for a defined geographic region. Each listing identifies and describes the various characteristics of the property in a standard, pre-defined format, which can be easily and accurately searched. Listings can also include maps and photographs of the property. The characteristics also include mortgage rate, pricing and tax information, including the price and terms at which a particular property sold.","One important aspect of MLS databases is the ability to archive historical information about properties already sold for use by a broad audience. For instance, to a potential seller or purchaser, historical information is crucial in determining the price at which a comparable property would sell in a particular market segment. Similarly, to an appraiser, historical information is essential in arriving at an appropriate appraisal figure. In an active real estate market, near real time historical information is almost a requirement.","Another important aspect of MLS databases is the capability of providing access to new or updated listing information. Most MLS databases are updated continuously. However, as a practical matter, real estate agents do not have continuous access to their respective MLSs. Consequently, real estate agents, and therefore, their clients, generally only learn about new or updated listings during an MLS database access session conducted at the agents' office.","One prior art approach to providing access to an MLS is through a remote terminal session. Typically, a terminal or a personal computer configured with a terminal emulator connects to the MLS database either over a dedicated line or via a dial up connection with a modem. The listing information is served in a character-based, page display format, generally consisting of a 25 by 80 character presentation space. Thus, the terminal or personal computer must provide a sufficient screen size upon which to view the listing information, one page at a time. Moreover, access to historical information and new or updated listings can only be obtained during a given access session.","A similar prior art approach to providing access to an MLS is the MLSWindows product, described in \u201cWyldFyre Technologies, Inc., Leading the Way In Real Estate GUI Software,\u201d Real Innovators, pp. 18-20 (Summer 1997 ed.). Unlike the conventional terminal screen-based approach, the MLSWindows product provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing listing information, including maps. The MLSWindows product also provides a capability to connect to an MLS database via a TCP\/IP network or via synchronous or asynchronous communications. However, the MLSWindows product requires a personal computer with a windowing environment upon which to operate. Although significant progress has been made in miniaturizing portable personal computers, at best, these systems suffer from limited battery life and require a size and weight that make handheld operation impracticable.","Therefore, there is a need for a highly portable and flexible solution for remotely accessing a real estate information database in an interactive fashion. Preferably, such a solution includes a capability to automatically be notified of or inquire into new or updated listings.","There is a further need for an approach to remotely accessing a real estate information database using a portable computing device which could be standalone or integral to a portable information or communication appliance, such as a wireless communications device.","The present invention provides a system and method for transacting retrieval of real estate property listings using a remote client interfaced over an information network.","An embodiment of the present invention is a system and method for transacting retrieval of real estate property listings using a remote client interfaced over an information network. A portable computing device maintains both program code and data exclusively in a general purpose random access memory configured for both transient and persistent storage of program code and data. A database server includes a search engine configured to retrieve listing records from a real estate information database. Each listing record includes a set of characteristics describing an individual real estate property listing. A remote client defines methods in the general purpose random access memory for accessing the real estate information database through the search engine. The methods include a session manager, a search specification method, and a search results display method. The session manager facilitates a dynamic session between the portable computing device and the database server over a communications link. The session manager identifies the remote client to the database server and manages an interactive search session between the remote client and the search engine. The search specification method interactively sends to the search engine search parameters and receives from the search engine the listing records having real estate property listing characteristics matching the search parameters. The search results display method displays the received listing records on the portable computing device.","A further embodiment of the invention is a portable computing device, process, and computer-readable storage medium holding code for providing remote interactive access to a real estate information database. A general purpose random access memory exclusively maintains both program code and data for both transient and persistent storage. A remote client is configured in the general purpose random access memory and includes methods for accessing a real estate information database through a search engine running on a database server. The search engine is configured to retrieve one or more listing records from the real estate information database with each listing record in the real estate information database including a set of characteristics describing an individual real estate property listing. The remote client includes a session manager facilitating a dynamic session between the portable computing device and the database server over a communications link. The session manager identifies the remote client to the database server and manages an interactive search session between the remote client and the search engine. A search method interactively sends to the search engine search parameters including real estate property listing characteristics and receives from the search engine listing records having characteristics matching the search parameters. A display method displays the listing records on the portable computing device.","The present invention facilitates highly portable, interactive access sessions between a portable computing device and a real estate information database, such as an MLS database. The portable computing device can communicate with the real estate information database using a wide range of communication configurations, including a wireless modem, direct dial-up modem, internetwork protocol (IP) modem, and others. A local server could be introduced to continuously transact an access session with the real estate information database and to provide updates to the portable computing device on a regular basis. Similarly, the portable computing device could be configured for automatic update via an express request (pull) or a page (push).","Still other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein is described embodiments of the invention by way of illustrating the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["7","14","9","9","8","8","12","14","12","13","13","14","14","12","21","25"]},"As also further described below, the PCD  is a special purpose computing device and includes a single general purpose RAM  configured for both transient and persistent storage of both program code and data. The RAM  is used exclusively by the PCD  for both program code and data storage, although the operating system, core libraries, and configuration information could be stored in a specialized read only memory (ROM) (not shown), as is known in the art. A remote client  (RC) is loaded and executed in the RAM  for interactively accessing the real estate information database , as further described below with reference to .","The PCD  can be connected to the database server  via three types of communications links. First, the PCD  can be directly interfaced to a serial port of the database server  using a serial connection . Second, the PCD  can be connected to the database server  through a wireless server , which is the preferred mode in connection. With this type of communication link, the PCD  can be equipped with a wireless modem (not shown) which transmits to a receiver  coupled to the wireless server using a radio frequency connection . Alternatively, the PCD  can be equipped with a conventional modem and an adapter for connection to a cellular telephone. In turn, the wireless server  is equipped with a modem  that is interconnected with the modem bank  via a modem link . Finally, the PCD  can be connected to the database server  via a network , such as an internetwork, including the Internet, or an intranetwork. The PCD  is connected to the network  via a network link , which could be via analog modem, internetwork protocol (IP) modem, wireless modem, and the like. In turn, the network  is connected to the network hub  of the database server  via a high speed network link .","The database server  is a general purpose, programmed digital computing device consisting of a central processing unit (CPU), RAM, nonvolatile secondary storage, such as a hard drive or CD ROM drive, network interfaces, and peripheral devices, including user interfacing means, such as a keyboard and display. Program code, including software programs, and data are loaded into the RAM for execution and processing by the CPU and results are generated for display, output, transmittal, or storage. In the described embodiment, the database server  is a legacy-type data processing system consisting of a traditional mainframe computer system, such as manufactured by Tandem Computers, Inc., Cupertino, Calif.","The database system  provided by the RE InfoLink Multiple Listing Service, Santa Clara, Calif., is a typical multiple listing service database form. The database  includes a set of listing records which each contain a set of characteristics describing the real estate property listing. There are ten classes of properties: single family residential, common interest development, multi residential, mobile homes, residential lots and lands, commercial lots and lands, commercial\/industrial, business opportunity, commercial rental, and residential rental. Within each class, a listing record includes various sets of characteristics, including characteristics pertaining to interior, exterior, additional information, including mortgage rate, pricing and tax information, and remarks. Within each of these sets of characteristics, further specifics can be specified, such as, for an interior, type, style, bedrooms, bathrooms, and so on. The database  can be searched by specifying these individual characteristics.","The PCD  is a special purpose, programmed digital computing device consisting of a CPU, the single general purpose RAM, and limited peripheral devices, including a communications port and user interfacing means, such as a data input interface and display. Typically, these devices are highly portable and are designed for handheld use. The primary difference between a conventional computer system and a PCD is the storage subsystem: to conserve on battery life, size and weight, a single general purpose RAM is used for substantially all program code and data storage, instead of using non-volatile secondary storage. The RAM can include conventional dynamic and static access memory devices, as well as flash memory and related electronic integrated circuit storage technologies, as would be recognized by one skilled in the art. In the described embodiment, the PCD  is a personal data assistant (PDA), such as the Palm III connected organizer, or any similar member of the Palm connected organizer family, manufactured by 3Com Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif. An exemplary wireless modem is the Ricochet modem, provided along with the Ricochet mobile Internet access service, by Metricom, Inc., Los Gatos, Calif. An alternate PDA that has in integral wireless modem is the Palm VII connected organizer, also manufactured by 3Com Corporation. A cellular telephone modem adapter suitable for use with a Palm III connected organizer is the Snap-On GSM Modem Adapter, manufactured by Option International, Leuven, Belgium.","The PCD  could also be a handheld personal computer (HPC) running the Windows CE operating system, such as the Cassiopeia HPC, manufactured by Casio Computer Company Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; the Compaq Aero 8000 HPC, manufactured by Compaq Computer, Houston, Tex.; and the Jornada HPC, manufactured by the Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif. Other types of personal computing devices are feasible.","Finally, the PCD  could be incorporated as part of the new generation of cellular telephones, known as Smart Phones and similar devices, which integrate the functionality of a PDA with the features of a cellular telephone. The PDQ telephone, manufactured by Qualcomm, San Diego, Calif., in particular incorporates the Palm operating system and connected organizer into a cellular telephone. These types of devices export an application programming interface (API) for interfacing telephony features with client functionality. Thus, the remote client  can be loaded and executed using one of these cellular telephones and the database server  interactively accessed through the wireless connection afforded by the cellular telephone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 3"],"b":["7","5","5","5","9","9","5","5","5","6","6","6","6","6","6","11","9","5","5","5"],"i":["a","b","c ","a","b","c ","a","b","c","a","b","c ","a","b","c "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1A","FIG. 13"],"b":["26","27","7","29","28","28","9","27","12","31","30","29","25"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1A"],"b":["11","8","11","10","9"]},"The remote client  consists of three primary modules: session manager , search method , and display method .
