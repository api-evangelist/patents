title: Automated determination of website structure
abstract: Techniques are described for automatically determining the structure of multiple related Web pages based at least in part on human-supplied information, such as in at least some situations by automated operations of a website structure determination system to determine a common structure of at least some Web pages of a target Website of interest. In at least some such situations, the techniques include identifying structural elements or other structural locations within the common structure of multiple related Web pages that correspond to one or more types of information of interest. Once such structural locations are identified for one or more types of information of interest, information of those types may then be automatically retrieved from various Web pages of the target Website using those identified structural locations, even if those Web pages have not been previously manually reviewed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The Internet comprises a vast number of computers and computer networks that are interconnected through communication links, with information being exchanged using various services such as electronic mail and the World Wide Web (also referred to as the \u201cWeb\u201d). In addition to providing access to information, the Web has become a medium that is used to search for, shop for and order items (such as products, services and\/or information) that are for purchase, rent, lease, license, trade, evaluation, sampling, subscription to, etc. In many circumstances, a user can visit the Web site of a Web merchant (or a \u201cWeb store\u201d) or otherwise interact with an online retailer or electronic marketplace that provides one or more items, such as to view information about the items, give an instruction to place an order for one or more items, and provide information needed to complete the purchase (e.g., payment and shipping information). The Web merchant then fulfills the order by providing the ordered items to the indicated recipient, such as by providing product items that have been ordered through physical distribution channels (e.g., shipment via a governmental postal service or private common carrier) or electronically (e.g., via download over the Internet, such as for digital music or videos) as appropriate. Ordered service items may similarly be provided electronically (e.g., providing email service) or physically (e.g., performing cleaning services at the purchaser's house).","The widespread popularity of the Web has also provided additional opportunities for computers to inter-communicate in various programmatic manners. For example, there is growing use of the Web to provide so-called \u201cWeb services,\u201d which typically involve the programmatic interaction of remote applications to exchange information via defined APIs (\u201capplication program interfaces\u201d), or the like. Web services may allow heterogeneous applications and computers to interact, and can be defined and implemented using a variety of underlying protocols and techniques. For example, some Web service implementations return data in XML (\u201ceXtensible Markup Language\u201d) format using HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d) in response to a Web service invocation request specified as a URI (\u201cUniform Resource Identifier\u201d), such as a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) that includes a specified operation and one or more query parameters. In other implementations, additional underlying protocols are used for various purposes, such as SOAP (\u201cSimple Object Access Protocol\u201d) for standard message exchange, WSDL (\u201cWeb Services Description Language\u201d) for description of service invocations, and UDDI (\u201cUniversal Description, Discovery, and Integration service\u201d) for discovery of available services.","Techniques are described for automatically determining the structure of multiple related Web pages based at least in part on human-supplied information, such as in at least some embodiments by automated operations of a website structure determination system, as discussed in greater detail below. In at least some such embodiments, multiple Web pages of a particular target Website share a common structure, and the techniques include identifying structural elements or other structural locations within the common structure that correspond to one or more types of information of interest. Once such structural locations are identified for one or more types of information of interest, information of those types may then be automatically retrieved from various Web pages of the target Website using those identified structural locations, even if those Web pages have not been previously manually reviewed, such as to retrieve information from a Web page a single time so that the retrieved information may be used in one or more manners, to retrieve information periodically or otherwise repeatedly from a particular Web page if that information can change (e.g., to track any such changes), etc.","In at least some embodiments and situations, the identification of one or more locations in the structure of one or more Web pages that correspond to one or more types of information of interest is based at least in part on human-supplied information. For example, the visual representation of a displayed Web page may be provided to one or more humans, along with a request to specify or identify one or more types of information of interest in the visual representation in one or more manners. Once such identified information is received from the human(s), that identified information may be used to analyze an underlying textual document that represents the displayed Web page, such as to map the identified information from the human(s) to particular structural locations within the underlying textual document, such as to identify particular structural elements of the underlying textual document that store or otherwise represent the identified information supplied by the human(s). In this manner, the automated analysis of the underlying textual document may identify particular structural locations of the one or more types of information of interest, thus enabling information of those same types to be automatically retrieved from other Web pages that share common structural elements with the displayed Web page.","As one illustrative example, the target Website may correspond to an online retailer that offers numerous products of one or more categories, with each product having a distinct Web page at the target Website that includes detailed information about that product. Some or all of the products may further share one or more common attributes of interest, and information about those particular attributes may be stored in the same locations within their respective Web pages\u2014such attributes of interest may include, for example, one or more of weight, size, color, current availability, price, product category, corresponding image, textual description, etc. A textual document representing the Web page for one of those products may then be retrieved, such as a document formatted using HTML (\u201cHyperText Markup Language\u201d), XHTML (\u201ceXtensible HTML\u201d), XML (\u201cExtensible Markup Language\u201d), etc. A visual representation of the textual document may then be generated (e.g., by rendering or otherwise displaying the textual document within a Web browser or other application), and a human may be asked to identify a particular type of information of interest in that visual representation, such as the value of a particular attribute of interest. For example, if the attribute of interest is weight of the product, the human may be asked to enter into a user-editable text box the numeric weight value of the product that is shown in the visual representation of the displayed Web page, or may instead identify the weight attribute's value in the visual representation in other manners, as discussed below. Once the weight attribute's value is available to an embodiment of the automated website structure determination system, the corresponding structure within the Web page's underlying representation that corresponds to that value may be automatically identified in various manners by the automated website structure determination system, such as by searching the original textual document representing the Web page or a related structural representation of the Web page for the weight attribute's value and identifying the structure encompassing it\u2014the related structural representation of the Web page may, for example, be a DOM (\u201cDocument Object Model\u201d) that represents objects corresponding to particular aspects within the original textual document for the Web page, or may instead have other formats. After the structural location for a product's weight attribute is identified in one or more products' Web pages of the target Website, the weight value for some or all of the other products available from the target Website may be automatically retrieved by the automated website structure determination system embodiment by automatically extracting that information from the Web pages of those products based on using that structural location. Alternatively, if the attribute of interest was a value that may change over time, such as an indication of whether or not a product is currently available (e.g., currently in stock), the Web page for a particular product may be repeatedly retrieved and analyzed in order to track the changing current availability of that particular product over time.","As another illustrative example, the target Website may be an online dictionary that provides definitions for numerous words, with each word having a distinct Web page (e.g., a Web page dynamically generated from an underlying database) that includes various information about that word. The Web page for each word may include various common attributes, such as a pronunciation guide, one or more types of speech, one or more synonyms, one or more alternative spellings, a historical origin, etc. In a similar manner to that described for the online retailer example, one or more humans may supply information about the particular values of an attribute of interest for one or more particular words, and that information may be used by an embodiment of the automated website structure determination system to determine a corresponding structural location for that attribute of interest in the target Website's Web pages, thus enabling information about that attribute to be automatically retrieved for other words of interest that were not manually reviewed by one or more humans. It will be appreciated that similar techniques may be applied to a wide variety of types of Websites, Web pages and attributes of interest.","As previously noted, various types of textual documents or other structural representations may be used to represent the structure of a Web page, including a DOM representation in at least some embodiments. Furthermore, the structure of a Web page may include a variety of types of structural elements. For example, a non-exclusive list of some types of structural elements that may be part of at least some types of Web pages includes the following: an anchor, a button, a canvas, a div element, a form, a frame, a heading, an image, various types of input elements, a label, a link, a list, a paragraph, a script, a span element, a table, a title, etc. As will be understand, many elements may hierarchically include other elements and\/or be included in other elements, such as a table element being composed of various columns, rows and cells, a form element including text and user-selectable input controls, an HTML element for a Web page containing all other elements of the Web page, etc. In addition, a structural representation of a Web page may be accessed and\/or analyzed in various manners in various embodiments, including using APIs (\u201capplication programming interfaces\u201d) specific to particular representations (e.g., JavaScript and other DOM scripting for DOM representations), as well as tools such as XPath (\u201cXML Path Language\u201d), XQuery, XSLT (\u201ceXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations\u201d), etc.","In addition, various types of information may be gathered from humans in various manners from the visual representation of a displayed Web page, and may be used as part of the analysis of the structural representation of the Web page in various manners. For example, as previously noted, a user may be asked in some embodiments and situations to type or otherwise enter a textual representation of particular information of interest that is shown in a visual representation, and a textual document or other structural representation of the Web page may then be searched for corresponding text. In some embodiments and situations, if the human is viewing the visual representation as an image, the human may click on or otherwise select one or more points that represent the location of the particular information of interest, and corresponding information may be extracted from the image (e.g., by using optical character recognition on the selected area; by maintaining a mapping of information included in the visual representation to corresponding locations in the image, such as if the image is generated from a textual representation of the Web page; etc.). In addition, in at least some embodiments, some additional text or other information near the particular information of interest may also be specified by the human and similarly used to identify the corresponding particular information of the interest in the structural representation of the Web page, such as to use text surrounding an attribute value in the visual representation to disambiguate multiple occurrences of that attribute value in the structural representation. Such additional text or other information could, for example, also be textually entered by the human, or instead could be specified in other manners (e.g., by dragging or otherwise placing a box or other shape around the displayed particular information of interest and optionally around additional surrounding text or other displayed information, such as if the visual representation is presented as an image and if image selection or editing tools are available to the human, and with optical character recognition optionally used to extract particular text from the user-selected area). Alternatively, if the human is viewing the visual representation as a rendered Web page rather than an image and if the particular information of interest is a user-selectable link or other control, the human may specify that particular information by selecting it (e.g., clicking on it), if information about the selected element is available to the automated website structure determination system or other system with which the human is interacting\u2014in such situations, the corresponding structural element to the displayed element selected by the user may be directly detectable (e.g., in a manner analogous to a visual debugger), and\/or the displayed element selected by the human may be used as part of the analysis of the structural representation in one or more of the manners discussed above. Accordingly, information may be gathered from humans in various manners in various embodiments from the visual representation of a displayed Web page, as discussed in further detail below with respect to  and elsewhere.","Furthermore, information may be obtained from humans in various manners in various embodiments. For example, in order to gather information from one or more humans about an indicated type of information of interest in one or more Web pages, a group of one or more related tasks may be created in some embodiments that each include a request to review one or more displayed Web page visual representations to identify one or more indicated types of information of interest, and those multiple tasks may then be made available to one or more human users for performance. After the results are received from the human performance of the tasks, that human-supplied information may then be used in various manners, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","To facilitate the performance of such tasks (also referred to herein as \u201cWeb page information identification tasks\u201d), the automated website structure determination system may in some embodiments interact with one or more external task fulfillment systems via which the tasks are performed, while in other embodiments the automated website structure determination system may instead directly interact with one or more human users to effect the performance of Web page information identification tasks (e.g., if the automated website structure determination system is integrated with or otherwise associated with a task fulfillment system). Such a task fulfillment system may, for example, facilitate interactions between task requesters who have tasks available to be performed and task performer users who are available to perform tasks, such as interactions that involve human task performer users performing tasks supplied by task requesters. In at least some embodiments, at least some of the tasks to be performed via such a task fulfillment system are human performance tasks that use cognitive and other mental skills of human task performer users, such as to employ judgment, perception and\/or reasoning skills of the human task performer users. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, at least some tasks may be fee-based tasks that each have an associated fee to be paid to one or more task performer users for successful performance of the task, and at least some tasks may further have various restrictions and other criteria associated with performance of the task (e.g., preferred or required qualifications of human task performer users who perform the task)\u2014in such embodiments, the automated website structure determination system may pay fees for performance of submitted Web page information identification tasks and\/or specify various criteria related to performance of submitted Web page information identification tasks.","Thus, in at least some embodiments, an electronic task fulfillment system acts as an intermediary to allow task requesters and task performer users to interact, and facilitates the performance of Web page information identification tasks by human task performer users. In particular, in some embodiments, one or more computing systems providing the task fulfillment system act as an intermediary to allow task requesters to programmatically request (e.g., via programmatic invocations of one or more APIs of the task fulfillment system by application programs of the task requesters) that tasks be performed by human task performers and to receive corresponding results after the tasks are performed (e.g., as responses to the programmatic invocations), thus providing a form of artificial artificial intelligence to task requesters' application programs. Similarly, human task performer users may access the task fulfillment system (e.g., in a programmatic or interactive manner) to obtain information about available tasks that they may perform and to provide the results of task performance after the completion of tasks that they are assigned. By enabling large numbers of unaffiliated or otherwise unrelated task requesters and task performers to interact via the intermediary task fulfillment system in this manner, free-market mechanisms mediated by the Internet or other public computer networks may be used to programmatically harness the collective intelligence of a mutable ensemble of unrelated human task performers. Additional details related to the function and operation of various embodiments of task fulfillment systems, such as a task fulfillment facilitator system embodiment, are included in pending commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/990,949, filed Nov. 16, 2004 and entitled \u201cProviding an Electronic Marketplace to Facilitate Human Performance of Programmatically Submitted Tasks;\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","105","100"]},"The task fulfillment system  may be implemented in various ways in various embodiments, such as in the form of a software system executing on one or more programmed or otherwise configured computing systems or devices (e.g., in a distributed manner, such as on a peer-to-peer or grid network), although such computing systems or devices are not shown in this example. Furthermore, while not illustrated in this example, data may be stored across multiple alternative storage partitions on multiple alternative computing nodes in some embodiments. In addition, the types of tasks to be performed may have various forms in various embodiments. For example, there is a large class of tasks which computers and application programs cannot easily automatically perform, but which humans can typically easily perform, referred to herein as \u201chuman performance tasks.\u201d In at least some embodiments, the task fulfillment system  may facilitate the submission and performance of such human performance tasks, including Web page information identification tasks submitted by the automated website structure determination system . The ability of humans to perform such tasks is due at least in part to various cognitive and other mental capabilities of humans that are not easily encoded in automated programs, such as the ability to use human judgment to form opinions, to perform abstract or common-sense reasoning, to perform various discernment and perception tasks (e.g., visual and aural pattern recognition, such as based on experience), to use cultural awareness and emotional intelligence, and to perform various other everyday yet highly complex kinds of perception, cognition, reasoning and thinking. In addition, related tasks may in some embodiments be grouped together or otherwise handled in a consistent manner, such as a group of multiple Web page information identification tasks that are part of analyzing a single target Website.","In the example of , the task fulfillment system  includes a task information data repository , task performance results information data repository , and a user information data repository . In this example, various task requesters may supply information about tasks that are available to be performed by task performer users , including one or more optional task requesters  whose computing systems may interact with one or more computing systems of the task fulfillment system  to submit tasks that are not related to automated Website structure determination efforts.","The Automated Website Structure Determination System  may also supply Web page information identification tasks and\/or other tasks to the task fulfillment system , and may also be implemented in various ways in various embodiments, such as in the form of a software system executing on one or more programmed or otherwise configured computing systems or devices (not shown). In particular, in this example, the Automated Website Structure Determination System  receives information about one or more third-party target Websites  of interest (e.g., from a human operator of the system , not shown), and optionally performs automated programmatic interactions  over one or more intervening networks (not shown) with computing systems (not shown) that serve those target Websites in order to obtain one or more Web pages for each of those target Websites. The Automated Website Structure Determination System  in this example then performs automated programmatic interactions  over one or more intervening networks (not shown) with the programmed computing systems that provide the task fulfillment system  in order to submit one or more Web page information identification tasks for each of the target Websites. As previously noted, the Web page information identification tasks may display information to and gather information from human users in various manners. For example, if the system  has retrieved one or more Web pages from a target Website, a submitted task may include a visual representation of one of those Web pages, such as in the form of an image or in the form of an underlying textual representation that causes the visual representation to be generated when the task is displayed to a human user (e.g., by including the textual representation as part of a Web page to be rendered for display to the human user for the task, such as in a frame or other portion of the displayed information). Alternatively, in some embodiments, the system  could include a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) or other reference to a Web page of the target Website in the submitted task, such that the referenced Web page is retrieved  from the target Website when the task is displayed to a human user, and optionally without the system  having previously downloaded that Web page. Various of the human task performer users  may interact  with the task fulfillment system  to obtain tasks (including Web page information identification tasks) and to, after performing the tasks, supply task performance results to the task fulfillment system . After Web page information identification tasks are completed, the results of the task performance are supplied  to the Automated Website Structure Determination System  (whether as requested by the system  to pull those results from the system  and\/or as proactively sent by the system  to push those results to the system ). The Automated Website Structure Determination System  may then perform additional activities in automatically determining the structure of the one or more target Websites, including to optionally retrieve additional information from the target Website(s) (e.g., via one or more additional interactions ) by using automatically determined structural location information.","As previously noted, various task requesters  other than the Automated Website Structure Determination System  may optionally interact with the task fulfillment system  in order to supply various types of tasks that are available to be performed by task performer users , as well as to perform other related activities, although in some embodiments only Web page information identification tasks may be allowed if the task fulfillment system  is acting as a dedicated part of the Automated Website Structure Determination System . In the illustrated example, in addition to supplying tasks, a task requester  may interact with the task fulfillment system  to obtain results from the performance by one or more task performer users  of previously supplied tasks, to obtain information about an account of the task requester (e.g., information about financial payments made to other users for performing fee-based tasks supplied by the task requester, information about previously specified preferences, etc.), to search for information about tasks and\/or about task performer users who are available to perform tasks, to specify types of qualifications that task performer users may need to perform supplied tasks, etc. The task requesters  may take various forms, such as a user who interactively accesses the system  (e.g., via a GUI, or graphical user interface, displayed on a computing system of the task requester user, not shown, such as a GUI based on Web pages provided by the system  and\/or based on execution of a client-side application on the computing system), or a software application that is programmatically interacting with the system  (e.g., via an API of the system , not shown) on behalf of a related task requester user or other entity. The Automated Website Structure Determination System  may also optionally perform some or all such activities in its role as a task requester interacting with the task fulfillment system .","When a task requester supplies information about one or more tasks (e.g., when the Automated Website Structure Determination System  supplies Web page information identification tasks), the task fulfillment system  stores the task-related data in the task information data repository , which may then be made available to task performer users  to perform those tasks in a manner specified by the task requester, or as otherwise determined by the task fulfillment system . The supplied information for a task may include a variety of types of information, including one or more pieces of data to be reviewed (e.g., one or more Web pages or portions thereof), other details related to the task (e.g., other types of information to be analyzed, a question to be answered, etc.), one or more qualifications of any task performer user who performs the task, one or more geographical locations associated with the task, one or more capabilities and\/or other current characteristics of one or more devices to be used as part of performing the task, one or more criteria related to task performance (e.g., deadlines for completion, format of results from task performance, etc.), one or more associated rewards (e.g., monetary payments) to be provided to one or more task performer users who successfully perform the task, etc.","The task fulfillment system  also provides various functionality related to the performance of tasks by task performer users . For example, when a task performer user requests information about available tasks (e.g., as part of a search or browse request), the task fulfillment system  provides task-related data obtained from the task information data repository . In addition, when a task performer user requests to perform (or is assigned for performance) a particular task, the task fulfillment system  stores a temporary association between the task performer user and the task (e.g., in the task performance results information data repository ). Then, when the task performer user has completed performance of the task, such as by providing task results for the performed task to the task fulfillment system , the task fulfillment system  stores the task results in the task performance results information data repository . The task fulfillment system  may also perform other related functions, such as notifying a task requester of the task results and\/or completion of the performed task, facilitating a reward for performing the task (e.g., by crediting an account associated with the task performer or initiating a funds transfer to provide a monetary payment for a fee-based task), etc.","The task fulfillment system  also provides various functionality related to the management of various users, such as users associated with task requesters (including the Automated Website Structure Determination System ) and task performer users . For example, such users may register with the task fulfillment system  by providing identifying information (e.g., name, address, telephone number(s), email addresses, etc.), possibly accompanied by various user preference information and\/or payment information that may be used to facilitate payments between task requesters and task performer users for the performance of tasks. Such user-related information may be stored by the task fulfillment system  in the user information data repository , and the task fulfillment system  may further in some embodiments store various user-related information in the repository  (e.g., information about previously interactions between the system and the user, such as to reflect aggregate information about previous task performance for task performer users). In addition, task performer users  may also in at least some embodiments obtain qualifications that may be utilized for purposes of matching task performer users with appropriate tasks, with such qualification information also being stored in the user information data repository .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["200","250","252","253","254","255","258","258","258","258","265","260","260","256","257","251","259","200","200","205"],"i":["a","b","c","a"]},"In the example of , various of the information displayed in the visual representation  may correspond to information that is of a type of interest in a particular situation, and which each has a corresponding structural element in an underlying representation (not shown) of the Web page. For example, the value for any of the attributes -, -,  and  of the product may represent a type of information of interest for an embodiment of the automated website structure determination system, such that the automated website structure determination system may generate one or more Web page information identification tasks to obtain human-supplied information corresponding to the value of one or more of those attributes, and may subsequently used the corresponding obtained human-supplied information to automatically identify corresponding structural elements in an underlying textual representation of the Web page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["240","250","240","240","242","244","202","204","206"]},"The example user interface  also includes a task section  that provides various details about the available Web page information identification task to be performed, including task details (e.g., task requester information, associated reward for performance, task expiration date, etc.) and a task description that includes instructions specific to performing the illustrated Web page information identification task. In this example, the task section  further includes a visual representation of some or all of a Web page of interest, related image , and user input control . For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the visual representation is provided so that the user may identify values and\/or locations of one or more types of information of interest, with a similar image being illustrated in this example to further assist the user in identifying the information of interest, although in other embodiments the example image may not be provided. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, the visual representation may be provided in various manners in various embodiments, including as an image, as an interactive Web page (e.g., as part of a frame or other sub-element within the task section ), etc. After reviewing the visual representation , the user may provide results of the performance in one or more manners, such as by using various user input controls provided for that purpose. In particular, in this example, the type of information of interest corresponds to the product weight attribute of , and one possibility for obtaining user input involves the user typing the value for that attribute into text box (i.e., to type \u201812 ounces\u2019 or \u201812\u2019 in this example, as shown in ). The user could also interact with the visual representation in one or more manners to identify the information of interest in some embodiments, whether in addition to or instead of using the text box , such as by clicking on the visual display of the product weight attribute in the visual representation (as shown in ), by highlighting the area of the product weight attribute and optionally surrounding text (e.g., the product ID and\/or the product size ) in the visual representation , etc., as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. After performing the Web page information identification task, the user may submit the results of the performance or cancel the performance by selecting controls or , respectively.","Although  illustrates an example of a Web page information identification task that requests a task performer to identify information of interest from a visual representation of a Web page, Web page information identification tasks may be presented and performed in various other ways in various other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the automated website structure determination system may supply multiple possible values for the information of interest (e.g., \u2018productid1A001\u2019, \u201812\u2019, \u2018ounces\u2019, \u20188.1\u2019, \u20185.2\u2019, \u20181.1\u2019, etc., if the automated website structure determination system is able to determine that the product weight value is an alphanumeric value within the product details  section of the Web page), from which the task performer user may select at least one, such as by using selection boxes, text boxes, drop-down lists, radio buttons, etc. As another example, the automated website structure determination system may supply a likely or expected value of the information of interest that is automatically determined, with the task performer user being asked to confirm that the supplied value is correct or not. In addition, in some embodiments, the visual representation that is displayed to the human task performer user may be only a portion of the Web page, such as to correspond to the product details  section of the Web page if that section is automatically determined as containing the information of interest. Moreover, in other embodiments, the task provided may ask the human task performer user to identify multiple values for one or more indicated types of information of interest in one or more displayed visual representations of one or more Web pages. Furthermore, while not illustrated here, the user may be able to provide other types of results in some embodiments, such as to indicate a degree of certainty of the user or a degree of likelihood of the identified information (e.g., by selecting from an enumerated scale with multiple options). In addition, the human task performer user may be asked to supply information in multiple stages of the task, such as to first highlight a portion of the displayed visual representation, and then to select or verify particular text that is generated from optical character recognition processing of that highlighted portion. It will be appreciated that various other alternatives are available in displaying and obtaining information from a user, and that the details of the examples in  are provided for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the described techniques.","In addition, in at least some embodiments, the automated website structure determination system may perform various types of processing of a visual representation to be reviewed by humans before that review occurs. For example, for visual representations that include image and\/or video data, various types of image manipulation processing may be performed in at least some situations, such as one or more of the following: color correction or other color modification; brightening and other contrast changes; sharpening; cropping; noise removal; etc. Similar types of processing may be performed for audio data and other types of media data that may be included as part of or in place of a visual representation in at least some embodiments and situations. In addition, images and other media within a visual representation may be of various formats, including GIF, BMP, JPEG, RAW, PNG, PDF, SWF, SVG, MPEG, etc., and may be generated in various ways. In other embodiments, one or more visual representations may instead be provided to a user in a manner that is not part of a user interface, such as data sent to the user for display or other review in a manner selected by the user (e.g., on a selected device using a selected image viewer or other media player), by sending a URL to a user to enable the user to manually initiate a corresponding display in a Web browser or other program on the user's client device, etc. Furthermore, a visual representation may be manipulated in other manners in order to prepare it for human review in at least some embodiments, such as by making determinations and corresponding modifications with respect to the size or other characteristics of data within a visual representation, including to be of a size to correspond to a certain amount of subject matter (e.g., a certain screen area size or portion of a Web page), to correspond to a screen resolution that is expected for computing devices of the human users, etc.","In addition, determinations may be made regarding various other factors that affect Web page information identification tasks, such as the following: the number of Web page visual representations to be reviewed in each Web page information identification task; the number of distinct human users to independently perform each Web page information identification task (e.g., 1, 5, etc.); the threshold for determining when human-supplied information about a type of information of interest in a Web page's visual representation is sufficiently reliable to identify a corresponding structural location or element in an underlying representation of the Web page (e.g., based on a quantity of distinct human users who each identify the same information value in a particular visual representation, based on a quantity of different related Web pages in which the same structural location or element is identified as corresponding to a particular indicated type of information of interest based on supplied human input, etc.); the types of further use of the structural elements or locations that are determined to correspond to an indicated type of information of interest (e.g., to provide the determined structural elements or locations to other users for further review, such as experts or other higher-qualified users who have specialized capabilities for such further review); etc.","In addition, embodiments of the automated website structure determination system may perform various other actions in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the automated website structure determination system may perform an automated analysis of some visual representations, such as before human review of those visual representations in order to assist the human review (e.g., by providing one or more possible candidates for the information of interest, to restrict the portion of the visual representation that is shown to a subset that is most likely to include the information of interest, etc.), and\/or after human review of those visual representations to confirm or supplement the results of the human review. In addition, some embodiments of the automated website structure determination system may prioritize or otherwise select a subset of the available Web page visual representations for review in various ways, such as based on automated analysis of those visual representations, on those Web pages corresponding to a subset of the total Website that is most likely to be relevant to the information of interest (e.g., to product-specific Web pages from an online retailer rather than other Web pages from the online retailer that include other types of information), etc. In addition, while in some embodiments any human users are allowed to participate in the human review of the visual representations and are treated in a uniform manner with respect to such review, in other embodiments various information about the human users may be used in various ways (e.g., to restrict performance of some or all Web page information identification tasks to only certain human users, such as those having specified qualifications; to prioritize the review activities of some human users, such as to allow the human users with the highest qualifications and\/or most relevant experience to review the tasks with the highest priority visual representations and\/or to perform further review or confirmation for visual representations that have already been reviewed by other human users; to use information about particular human users when assessing results received from those human users, such as to give greater weight to information identifications if the corresponding human users are highly rated with respect to relevant experience, qualifications and\/or diligence; etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","340","390","370","360","350","354","340","354","300","345","330","300","305","310","320","330","311","312","313","315","350","351","352","356","353","360","370","390"]},"In this illustrated embodiment, the automated website structure determination system  is executing in the memory , and in at least some embodiments includes software instructions that when executed by the CPU  programs the server computing system  to perform some or all of the described techniques, such as when the automated website structure determination system  represents a software implementation of the Automated Website Structure Determination System  described with reference to .

The information received may have various forms in various embodiments, such as to initiate a new analysis of a target Website and\/or to update an ongoing analysis of a target Website. The received information may in various situations include overview instructions or other information related to the analysis of the target Website, such as, for example, one or more indicated types of information of interest, a subset of one or more particular Web pages at the target Website that include the one or more indicated types of information of interest, a template or definition of the Web page information identification tasks to be performed for the target Website, one or more particular Web pages at the target Website to use for the generated Web page information identification tasks, information about an overall monetary budget to use for the performance of the Web page information identification tasks or of individual fees to pay human task performer users for some or all of the Web page information identification tasks, any qualifications that are preferred or required for human users who perform the Web page information identification tasks, one or more minimum thresholds to assess when a determined structural element or other structural location corresponding to an indicated type of information of interest is sufficiently reliable, whether multiple levels of review of one or more visual representations of displayed Web pages are to be performed and if so in what manner, whether a human review is to be performed of an initial determination of a structural element or other structural location corresponding to an indicated type of information of interest and if so in what manner, etc. In other embodiments, some or all of those types of overview information may instead be automatically determined by the routine based in part on other information about the analysis effort, or instead in a default manner.","In the example embodiment, the routine then continues to block  to determine whether the information received in block  indicates a new target Website to be analyzed. If so, the routine continues to block  to retrieve at least some of the Web pages of the target Website for use in generating one or more Web page information identification tasks, unless such Web pages are supplied as part of the information received in block . The routine then continues to block  to generate one or more Web page information identification tasks that each involves identifying information of one or more indicated types of interest on at least one of the retrieved Web pages, and then submits the generated tasks to a remote task fulfillment system for performance. The generation of the tasks may be based on corresponding overview information received in block , or instead using a default task template. The Web page information identification task previously discussed with respect to  provides one illustrative example of such a generated task. In block , the results are then received of human performance of at least one of the submitted tasks, such as after a period of time has passed to allow for the human performance (e.g., after a matter of seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc., based on the speed at which the human task performer users of the task fulfillment system perform the submitted tasks).","After block , the routine continues to block  to analyze the underlying structural representations of the one or more Web pages whose visual representations were reviewed in the received task performance results, in order to determine particular structural elements or other structural locations that correspond to the information of interest. The routine further determines in block  if sufficient human-supplied information has been received for a minimum level of reliability in the determination of the structural locations of interest, such as based on a specified minimum quantity of one or more humans who provide the same information for a given submitted task, based on a specified minimum quantity of one or more different Web pages whose analysis results in the same determined location for a given type of information of interest, etc. In some embodiments, different groups of Web pages of a target Website may store different types of information, and\/or may store a given type of information of interest in different structural locations, and if so the automated analysis of block  may further attempt to identify the groups of Web pages that share common structure corresponding to the information of interest\u2014such a further automated analysis may be performed in various manners, such as by using data mining techniques to identify patterns of related structural locations for different types of Web pages, by using information about the hierarchical structure or other structure of the target Website, by obtaining and using supplemental information from an operator or other user (e.g., a user who supplied information received in block ), etc. If it is then determined in block  that sufficient information is not yet available, the routine returns to block  in the illustrated embodiment to perform additional analysis of one or more Web pages of the target Website (e.g., additional analysis of different Web pages that have not yet been analyzed, additional analysis of the same Web pages, etc.).","If it is instead determined in block  that sufficient information is available to reliably determine the one or more structural locations corresponding to the indicated information of interest of one or more indicated types for at least some of the Web pages of the target Website, the routine continues to block  to automatically obtain additional information of interest of those indicated types from one or more of those Web pages of the target Website, such as by automatically retrieving those Web pages, using the determined structural locations to identify the information of interest that is stored in those Web pages, extracting the identified information of interest, and optionally storing that extracted information and\/or providing that extracted information to one or more designated recipients (e.g., a user who supplied information received in block ).

If the routine identifies the sender as authorized in block , or if an authorization determination is not performed, the routine continues to block  to determine whether the received indication is a request to submit one or more tasks, such as from an embodiment of the automated website structure determination system to submit one or more Web page information identification tasks, or from another task requester to submit another type of task. If so, the routine continues to block  to store task information received in block , including any specified task performance criteria related to task performance, information about any associated rewards for performance of the task, any associated information to be analyzed or manipulated as part of the task, etc. The routine then continues to block  to determine whether to perform automated matching to identify task performer users who are appropriate to perform the task, such as based on the type of task submitted (e.g., a type of Web page information identification task) and\/or an explicit request by the submitter of the task, although in other embodiments such automated matching functionality may not be provided.

In block , the routine then determines whether to automatically validate the task results, such as based on whether a task requester has specified that the results for the task are to be validated. If so, the routine continues to block  to automatically validate task results. Validating task results may be performed in various ways, such as type checking the task results (e.g., by determining whether the task result comprises an integer or other type of data), range checking the task results (e.g., by determining whether a task result is within a particular value range), etc.","After block , or if it is instead determined in block  not to validate the task results, the routine continues to block .
