title: Method and system for configuration management database software license compliance
abstract: A software license engine allows an enterprise to model software license contracts and evaluate deployment of software for compliance with the software license contracts. Deployment of software products in the enterprise is modeled in a configuration management database. The software license engine maintains a license database for connecting software license contracts with software deployment modeled by the configuration management database. Users of the software license engine may use license types that are predefined in the software license engine or may define custom license types. The software license engine may indicate compliance or non-compliance with the software license contracts.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/165,505 entitled \u201cA Method and System for Configuration Management Database Software License Compliance\u201d filed Mar. 31, 2009 and which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.","This disclosure relates generally to the field of ITIL\u00ae-based (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs). (ITIL is a registered trademark of The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury acting through The Office of Government Commerce and Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, United Kingdom.) ITIL-based CMDBs are emerging as a prominent technology for Enterprise Management Software.","The usefulness of these CMDBs is dependent on the quality, reliability, and security of the data stored in them. A CMDB often contains data about managed resources known as Configuration Items (CIs). ITIL version 3 defines a CI as \u201cAny Component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT Service. Information about each CI is recorded in a Configuration Record within the Configuration Management System and is maintained throughout its Lifecycle by Configuration Management. CIs are under the control of Change Management. CIs typically include IT Services, hardware, software, buildings, people, and formal documentation such as Process documentation and [Service Level Agreements].\u201d The CMDB serves as a point of integration between various IT management processes. Data from multiple sources often needs to be managed directly or by reference in commercial CMDBs.","One kind of CI that may be managed in a CMDB is a software asset. Organizations can acquire software in different manners. Software can be built for a specific purpose within the company. Software can be purchased from a software vendor or outsourcer. Software can be acquired through an acquisition or merger between companies, or between departments within a single company. Software asset management is a core component of an overall asset management policy. IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) in the Software Asset Management Book defines software asset management as \u201call of the infrastructure and processes necessary for the effective management, control and protection of the software assets within an organization, throughout all stages of their lifecycle.\u201d ITIL indicates that the following processes make up the holistic approach to software asset management:","Overall management processes\u2014The management processes surrounding the other software assets management processes. The overall management processes are related to change management.","Core asset management processes\u2014Identification of software assets, including maintaining this information in the configuration management database (CMDB).","Logistic processes\u2014Control of the software asset lifecycle. These processes include procurement, deployment, and end of life.","Verification and compliance processes\u2014Verification and compliance of software asset management policies and procedures.","Relationship management processes\u2014Software contract management.","Conventional CMDBs, however, do not provide adequate capability for that an enterprise is in compliance with the terms of its software license contracts.","In one embodiment, a method is disclosed. The method comprises storing a first model of deployment of a software product in a configuration management database (CMDB); storing a second model of a software license contract for the software product in a license database; and evaluating compliance of the software license contract. Evaluating compliance comprises connecting the first model and the second model; comparing the first model and the second model; and generating an exception indication if the act of comparing the first model and the second model indicates non-compliance with the software license contract.","In another embodiment, a system is disclosed. The system comprises a server computer, which comprises a processor; a configuration database, coupled to the processor; a license database, coupled to the processor; and a program store, coupled to the processor, on which is stored instructions for the processor, wherein the instructions cause the processor to perform the method disclosed above.","In yet another embodiment, a computer readable medium is disclosed. The computer readable medium stores instructions for a programmable control device that cause the programmable control device to perform the method disclosed above.","In yet another embodiment, a networked computer system is disclosed. The networked computer system comprises a plurality of computers on which software products are deployed; and one or more configuration management database computers, communicatively coupled to the plurality of computers, programmed to perform the method disclosed above.","Various embodiments disclosed herein provide the ability to use a CMDB to monitor and verify software license compliance in an enterprise. Using a variety of rules related to different license types, a license engine may associate license certificates with software contracts, and evaluate compliance with some of the terms of those contracts. When a non-compliance event is discovered, the enterprise may take appropriate action to bring the software assets represented by the CIs in the CMDB into compliance with the license contracts under which the software was acquired.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structure and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention.

This information may comprise connection details, to allow the license engine  to connect the license certificate to CIs. The information may also include compliance information. For example, the license engine  when creating a per copy license certificate may ask how many licenses were purchased. For a site license, the license engine may ask the identity of the location for which the license was purchased. For a per copy per device license, the license engine  may ask how many licenses were purchased and how many copies per device are allowed under each license. Other questions may be asked depending typically on the license type. The additional information supplied in response to those questions may be included in the license certificate as it is stored in the license datastore .","In one embodiment, script-based rules may be created for additional custom license types to represent complex license entitlements, allowing a user of the license engine  to add and configure new license types without changes to the code of the license engine . For example, a license type may be created with rules for an application that executes in a virtual machine, where the rules are based on the number of physical processors on the physical machine. Because of the relationships available from the CMDB datastore , the license model for this license type may navigate back to the physical hardware to understand the number of processors when checking compliance.","In one embodiment, license certificates may be grouped into certificate groups. Certificate groups consolidate the tracking of license certificates. A master certificate is grouped with individual child license certificates. The CIs may be attached to the master certificates. License allocation numbers are attached to the child license certificates. For example, under the same software contract, 200 licenses for Microsoft Word are purchased. Later, 100 more licenses are purchased. Two CIs are created in the CMDB , one for each license purchase. In this example, it does not matter which CI is attached to a specific license certificate. For compliance, it only matters that the licensee does not exceed 300 Microsoft Word instances for the contract. By grouping license certificates and attaching the CIs to a master certificate for the group, the licensee may gain flexibility in how the license certificates are applied. On the master certificate, in one embodiment, the sequence to which license certificates are allocated to matching CIs may be specified. When the first license in the sequence is fully used, the License Engine may apply CIs to the next license certificate. As a result, one or more of the last certificates in the sequence may be out of compliance, while earlier certificates may be in compliance.","Certificate groups may also help avoid unnecessary warnings in some embodiments. Consider the preceding Microsoft Word license example. In one embodiment, the license engine  may provide warning indications when a license certificate is nearly completely applied. If the license certificates are not grouped, in such an embodiment, for example, the license engine  may generate a warning when 190 CIs are attached to the first license certificate. Although there is another license certificate that is valid for 100 instances, the first certificate would be approaching the maximum usage. If, however, the certificates are grouped, for compliance checks, that is equivalent to having one certificate for 300 instances and a warning may be generated only when the last certificate in the sequence approaches being completely allocated.","When a certificate expires, the license engine  may check for compliance in one embodiment. If there are enough licenses remaining in the group in other certificates, the license engine  may not generate a warning or non-compliance indication. If a license certificate is not part of a group, when it expires, all the related CIs are out of compliance.","Returning to , after the license certificates are created, then in block , the license engine  is run.

In block , if any CIs are not connected to license certificates by the correlation rules, or if the license engine  determines that multiple license certificates would match to a CI, then in block  any desired exception processing may be performed.","In block , compliance rules may be evaluated to determine whether each of the software CIs complies with the terms of the software contract. In block , if any CI is not in compliance, then any desired exception processing may be performed.","Exception processing as performed in blocks  and  in one embodiment may be simply producing an error message or report indicating the exception. The exception may indicate a non-compliance condition. In one embodiment, additional exceptions may be triggered when a software license contract is in compliance but is within a window of near non-compliance, such as when nearly all of the purchased licenses have been deployed. Such warning indications may allow preventative measures to be taken before a non-compliance condition exists.","In other embodiments, more sophisticated exception processing may be performed. For example, in one embodiment, a noncompliance exception indicating that more instances of a particular software are deployed than are licensed may automatically trigger a request to purchase sufficient additional license to bring the enterprise  back into compliance. In another embodiment, the same situation may trigger an analysis to attempt to determine which, if any, of the existing instances of the software may exceed the need of the enterprise  need for the software, and in a further embodiment, may trigger the removal of a software package from one or more computer systems .","In one embodiment, a compliance exception may be generated at multiple levels. The multiple levels may be defined as desired by the person creating the compliance rules, but typically relate to how much the particular CI is out of compliance. For example, if a software contract acquires 100 licenses for a particular software package, and the license engine  discovers that 101 licenses are in use, a compliance rule may trigger a Breach Level  exception, but if the license engine  discovered that 110 licenses are in use, a Breach Level  exception may be signaled. In one embodiment, up to three levels of non-compliance exceptions may be signaled by the license engine .","In one embodiment, compliance results may be rolled up to consolidate compliance reporting at higher levels than a single contract. For example, in such an embodiment compliance results may be reported for the entire organization or for a particular software product or vendor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 6-15","FIG. 6"],"b":["250","600","610","620","622","630","632","620","650","640","634","636","622","610","642","652","250","670","660","260","610","610","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","660","620","622","610","630","650","640","650","642","636","642","652","610","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","660","632","650","640","630","650","640","634","650","642","636","652","642","620","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","660","610","910","912","630","632","634","910","636","912","610","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIGS. 10-15","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","660","650","640","630","632","654","644","634","652","642","636","660","250","610","610","650","654","652"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1100","660","610","640","642","650","654","640","652","642","660","610","660"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 5"],"b":["1200","660","250","610","660","670","650","654","640","644","250","652","642","636","622","250","540","260","652"]},"Example  in  illustrates a per copy license contract  in which two licenses were purchased for company .
