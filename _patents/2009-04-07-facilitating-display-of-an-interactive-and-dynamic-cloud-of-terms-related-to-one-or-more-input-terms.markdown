{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/124,018, entitled \u201cAn Interactive and Dynamic Cloud of Terms Related to an Input of One or More Terms,\u201d filed Apr. 11, 2008, by Yannis Labrou et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to the field of lexicographical analysis and more specifically to facilitating display of an interactive and dynamic cloud of terms related to one or more input terms.","Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) may be used to display results of a search. A user may enter a search query into a GUI, and the GUI may display search results for the query. In certain situations, GUIs might not provide adequate guidance for constructing searches.","In accordance with the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with previous techniques for facilitating display of output terms related to input terms may be reduced or eliminated.","According to certain embodiments, facilitating display of terms includes facilitating display of a graphical user interface. One or more first input terms entered into a user entry window of the graphical user interface are received. One or more first output terms related to the first input terms are determined. Display of a first graphical cloud comprising the first output terms is facilitated. The first input terms are modified to yield one or more second input terms. One or more second output terms related to the second input terms are determined. Display of a second graphical cloud comprising the second output terms is facilitated.","Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a cloud may display one or more output terms related to one or more input terms. The output terms may have graphical features (such as font size) that indicate the degree of relatedness between the output terms and the input terms. Another technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a user action may update the terms of the cloud. For example, a user may select a term in order to add the term to the input terms resulting in an updated set of output terms displayed in the cloud.","Certain embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.","Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to  of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"In the illustrated embodiment, system  includes a client  configured to display a graphical user interface (GUI)  and a server . Server  includes an interface (IF) , logic , and a memory . Logic  includes a processor  and applications  such as a relatedness engine  and a GUI facilitator . Memory  stores terms  and applications .","Client  may be any suitable device configured to display GUI . Client  may include a computer with a display, a television, a mobile device (such as a personal data assistant or a cell phone), computerized goggles, or other suitable device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["24","56","24","50","44","52","54","56","44","50","54"]},"The terms of cloud  may be arranged in any suitable order, such as in alphabetical order or in order of relatedness. The terms may have any suitable graphical features, such as any suitable font, font size, font color, underlining, bolding, or italicizing. Graphical features of a term may also include a sound that accompanies moving a cursor over the term or selecting the term.","In particular embodiments, a graphical feature of a term indicates the degree of relatedness of that term to input terms . For example, a larger font size may indicate a higher degree of relatedness. The font size may be determined from relatedness in any suitable manner. As an example, the font size may be calculated by normalizing values associated with the relatedness rankings of the terms, and converting the values to a font size. As another example, the font size may be calculated by ranking the terms by relatedness and assigning a predetermined number of terms to each font size.","In particular embodiments, cloud  may include one or more graphical elements that a user may utilize to produce a user action that modifies the input terms and results in updated output terms displayed in cloud . Examples of graphical elements include a link, a slide bar, or a radio button that a user may select, slide, or click, respectively. In particular embodiments, cloud  may provide a handle so output terms  may pass programmatically to a module, a webpage, a form, an application programming interface (API), or an application. In particular embodiments, cloud  may be implemented as JavaScript embedded in a website, such as a company website, or as an add-on to a web browser. A JavaScript code or the web browser add-on may include a call to relatedness engine  via interface  for identifying related terms.","Cloud  may be used in any suitable process, such as a search process, a tagging process, or a recommendation process. In a search process, output terms  of cloud  may be used as the input to a search engine query or another system or application offering a query interface.","In a tagging process, one or more output terms  may be used to annotate content (documents, parts of documents, images, videos, audio, news articles, etc.) with tags. Attempting to tag content may activate cloud . Terms may be selected from cloud  to tag the content.","In a recommendation process, one or more output terms  may be used as input for the invocation of an application. For example, if cloud  displays websites (or links to websites), the user may select a website to open the website. If cloud  displays songs (or links to song files), the user may select a song to play the song. GUI  is described in more detail with reference to server .","Referring back to , a term  may be a word or a phrase that denotes itself or an object by reference. For example, a term  may denote itself as \u201ctree\u201d may denote the concept of a tree in multiple senses. Examples of terms  that denote objects by reference include a webpage (the object) denoted by its title (the term), a summary of its contents (the term) or a phrase that describes its content (the term); a recipe (the object) denoted by its title (the term); a user (the object) denoted by a username (the term); a song or other multimedia object (the object) denoted by its title (the term); an artist (the object) denoted by the artist's name (the term); a document (the object) denoted by its title or authors (the term); and a movie (the object) denoted by its title (the term).","In the illustrated embodiment, system  includes interface , logic , and memory . Interface  receives input, sends output, processes the input and\/or output, and\/or performs other suitable operation. Interface  may comprise hardware and\/or software.","Logic  performs the operations of the component, for example, executes instructions to generate output from input. In particular embodiments, logic  facilitates display of GUI  and receives input terms  entered into user entry window  of GUI  to initiate a search. Logic  determines output terms  related to input terms  and facilitates display of a graphical cloud  of GUI , where cloud  comprises output terms .","In the illustrated embodiment, logic  includes a processor  and applications  such as GUI facilitator  and relatedness engine . GUI facilitator  facilitates display of GUI . In particular embodiments, GUI facilitator  may send instructions on whether a specific website should display cloud  and\/or instructions about the general look and feel of cloud .","Cloud  may pop up (or appear) or pop down (or disappear) in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments, cloud  may pop up when, for example, a cursor moves into user entry field  or other designated area or when the user device moves in a particular translating and\/or rotating movement. Cloud  may disappear or fade away when, for example, the cursor moves outside of cloud  or field , a predetermined amount of user inaction time has passed, the user device moves in a particular translating and\/or rotating movement, or a user action, such as clicking a close button or icon, has occurred.","In particular embodiments, cloud  may pop up when a cursor moves over (and perhaps stays on) an object, such as a word, link, or other object in a document, application, or webpage. In the embodiments, cloud  may accept a first input programmatically and display output terms  related to or derived from the object. An output term  may be selected to formulate a query to submit to another module, web page, form, API, application, or search engine.","In particular embodiments, cloud  is interactive, that is, a user may perform a user action to interact with cloud . Examples of user actions include clicking, dragging, or otherwise selecting a term; and entering, modifying, or removing a term in a field. Other examples of user actions include movement of the user device in a predetermined manner (translating and\/or rotating the device) by the user, or selection of a part of the device (a keyboard or pad button or soft key) by the user. In particular embodiments, if the cursor is moved over a term, the term may change a graphical feature (for example, color), indicating that the term may be selected for a particular action (for example, removal).","In particular embodiments, cloud  is dynamic, that is, cloud  may update in response to a user action. For example, cloud  may update the terms, the graphical features (such as font size) of the terms, or other information.","In particular embodiments, a term may be added to or removed or excluded from input terms  of cloud  in response to a user action or other action (for example, programmatically passing a term from another application, module, or interface as input to cloud ). For example, a user action may cause an input term to be updated. Updating the input term leads to a call to relatedness engines  to receive updated output terms. Cloud  is then updated with the updated output terms.","In particular embodiments, cloud  may be updated with new output terms  related to existing input terms . For example, the new output terms  may be identified by returning deeper terms in the present domain, where \u201cdeeper\u201d may mean more specialized, less general, and\/or less common. As another example, the new output terms  may be identified by determining relatedness according to a different domain (which, for example, may be a set of cloud-associated predefined domains).","An input term  may be removed from cloud  in any suitable manner. For example, a term may be removed by deleting the term from a field. As another example, a term may be removed by moving a cursor over the term, causing the term to change a graphical feature (for example, change to red or struck-through font) indicating that the term will be removed if selected, and then selecting the term. As another example, a term may be removed by moving the cursor over the term and double-clicking on the term.","An input term  may be removed from a search query in any suitable manner. For example, a term may be removed by adding the term to the query in the negative, e.g., in the form \u201cand not [term].\u201d As another example, a term may be removed by right clicking or single clicking and holding until there is a graphical feature change (such as a change in color or activation of a sound) indicating that the word is in a negative state, and then selecting the term.","Other suitable user actions may be performed to yield particular responses. In certain embodiments, clicking on different parts of a term may initiate addition or removal of the term. For example, clicking on the left side initiates addition, and clicking on the right side initiates negation (or vice-versa). In certain embodiments, clicking on terms in different regions of cloud  or in different clouds  may initiate addition or removal of the term. For example, clicking on a term in a cloud designated for adding terms initiates addition, and clicking on a term in a cloud designated for removing terms initiates removal.","In particular embodiments, for example, when GUI  is implemented in a mobile device, user actions that reduce the need for typing may be implemented. As an example, cloud  may appear or disappear or otherwise updated based movement, such as translation, rotation, and\/or other gesture, of the user device. In certain cases, detecting a first type of movement makes cloud  appear, and detecting a second type of movement makes cloud  disappear. As another example, cloud  may be enabled in a webpage as determined by a \u201cbrowser detect\u201d targeted to mobile devices. As another example, keyboard or pad button or soft key that may bring up cloud  in the context of an application or browser.","Relatedness engine  determines relatedness among terms. Relatedness may be defined in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments, relatedness may be derived according to affinity. Any suitable definition of affinity may be used, for example:","1. Basic Affinity","a. The basic affinity (A) between terms A and B may be defined as the ratio of the number of co-occurrence contexts that include both terms A and B over the number of co-occurrence contexts that include either of the terms A or B:\n\n()=|or \n","Two terms may co-occur if they each appear at least once within the same co-occurrence context or \u201ccontainers\u201d. Examples of co-occurrence contexts include a document and a paragraph. The following is a list of example containers and example corresponding term types:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Container or co-occurrence",{}]},{"entry":[{},"context","Term"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Webpage","Word or phrase"]},{"entry":[{},"Document","Word or phrase"]},{"entry":[{},"Recipe","Ingredient"]},{"entry":[{},"Web session","Webpage"]},{"entry":[{},"Communities a user is member","Community or social group"]},{"entry":[{},"of",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Movie collection of a user","Movie"]},{"entry":[{},"Music collection of a user","Song or artist"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"b. The basic affinity (A) between terms A and B may be defined as the ratio of the number of co-occurrence contexts that include both terms A and B over the maximum of either the number of co-occurrence contexts that include A or the number of co-occurrence contexts that include B:\n\n()=||\/max(||)\n\n2. Directional Affinity\n","The directional affinity (DAff) between terms A and B may be defined as the conditional probability of observing B, given that A was observed in a co-occurrence context:\n\n()=|\n\nThat is, directional affinity may be the number of co-occurrence contexts that include both terms A and B, over the number of co-occurrence contexts that include term A. Generally, DAff(A,B) differs from DAff(B,A).\n\n3. Differential Directional Affinity\n","The differential directional affinity (DiffDAff) between terms A and B may be defined as the directional affinity between terms A and B minus a factor that accounts for the common-ness of the term B in the corpus. The common-ness of the term B in the corpus may be a statistical value over the basic affinity or directional affinity values of the term B towards the other terms in the corpus. In particular embodiment, the common-ness of the term B in a corpus may be the average affinity (AA) of term B, which yields the following definition of differential directional affinity:\n\n()=()\u2212()\n\nThe average affinity (AA), or average directional affinity, of a term B may be defined as:\n\n()=AVERAGE()\n\nThat is, average affinity may be the average of the directional affinities of a term B over the other terms in the co-occurrence contexts.\n","In particular embodiments, the affinities between terms may be used to construct a weighted directed graph of terms, in which the weight of the directed edge between terms denotes their absolute or relative proximity with respect to a domain. The graphs may be derived from collocation of terms in a single container or across one or more collections of multiple containers. For example, particular embodiments may use a collection of documents (containers) in a particular domain and the collocation of words or phrases (terms) in each document to create a weighted directed graph of terms, in which the weights denote the proximity between terms in the domain.","In particular embodiments, a domain may be vertical. Examples of vertical domains include domains associated with particular topics such as patents, medical information, financial information, telecommunications, recipes, etc. A domain may encompass one or more particular media types. Examples of media types include images, videos, movies, news, scientific articles, advertisements, etc. A domain may encompass one or more particular contexts. Examples of contexts include web sites, documents, collections, etc. A domain may relate to one or more particular users. Examples of such domains include one or more web sessions of the users, navigation histories of the users, one or more preferences of the users, data (such as e-mail) related to the users, one or more queries from the users to one or more search engines, and\/or other domain.","Relatedness may be determined in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments, the relatedness may be determined according to any suitable calculation. An example of a calculation may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/368,689, titled, \u201cDetermining Words Related to a Given Set of Words,\u201d filed 10 Feb. 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference. The calculation operates on a directed weighted graph of terms indicating the proximity of the terms. The calculation uses the input terms to the cloud as input. The output of the calculation is used as the output terms displayed in cloud . In particular embodiments, the relatedness may be determined by computing the relatedness of possible terms in a domain to at least a subset of the most recent input terms  of cloud , and returning the terms with the highest relatedness to input terms .","In particular embodiments, output terms  may be determined from user search queries. In the embodiments, queries with related terms may be determined. Queries that include input terms  may be ranked, for example, by their decreasing use frequency and then matched. A predetermined amount of the top ranked queries may be selected as queries with related terms.","In particular embodiments, term relatedness in reference to a specific domain or combination of domains does not limit the utility in a search, tagging, or recommendation process to that domain or combination of domains. For example, although relatedness may have been defined in reference to a domain of pharmaceutical patents, the terms may be used in a search process in a domain of news stories.","Logic  may include hardware, software, and\/or other logic. Logic  may be encoded in one or more tangible media and may perform operations when executed by a computer. Certain logic , such as processor , may manage the operation of a component. Examples of processor  include one or more computers, one or more microprocessors, one or more applications, and\/or other logic.","In particular embodiments, the operations of the embodiments may be performed by one or more computer readable media encoded with a computer program, software, computer executable instructions, and\/or instructions capable of being executed by a computer. In particular embodiments, the operations of the embodiments may be performed by one or more computer readable media storing, embodied with, and\/or encoded with a computer program and\/or having a stored and\/or an encoded computer program.","A memory stores information. A memory may comprise one or more tangible, computer-readable, and\/or computer-executable storage medium. Examples of memory include computer memory (for example, Random Access Memory (RAM) or Read Only Memory (ROM)), mass storage media (for example, a hard disk), removable storage media (for example, a Compact Disk (CD) or a Digital Video Disk (DVD)), database and\/or network storage (for example, a server), and\/or other computer-readable medium.","Modifications, additions, or omissions may be made to system  without departing from the scope of the invention. The components of system  may be integrated or separated. Moreover, the operations of system  may be performed by more, fewer, or other components. Additionally, operations of system  may be performed using any suitable logic comprising software, hardware, and\/or other logic.
