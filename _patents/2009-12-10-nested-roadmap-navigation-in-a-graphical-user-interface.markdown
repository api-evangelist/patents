title: Nested roadmap navigation in a graphical user interface
abstract: Systems and methods for nested roadmap information navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) where a sequence of items is generated and stored in a memory of a computer system. The sequence of items includes at least one compound item. A number of user interface (UI) elements are displayed in a GUI screen, wherein each UI element represents an item of the sequence of items, and wherein the UI elements are ordered according to the sequence of items. The displayed UI elements include a UI element representing a compound item of the sequence of items. The compound item could be selected as a currently active item. The UI element representing the selected compound item can gradually expand to display one or more new UI elements representing component items subordinate to the compound item. The first of the component items is automatically selected as a currently active item.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of the invention relates generally to data processing and digital processing systems. More specifically, the invention is related to presentation of information and navigation in a graphical user interface.","Generally, modern computer applications, including business applications (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) system applications, customer relationship management system (CRM) applications, etc.), implement graphical user interfaces to interact with users. The growing complexity of the functionality embedded in such applications, and the abundance of managed data present a significant challenge for the application developers to design efficient and detailed user interfaces within the limited space of display devices. Usually, users have to scroll and switch between a multitude of screens in their interaction with the applications to perform various tasks and to achieve desired results. In such a complex interface environment, it may be necessary to maintain user's attention to the task by tracking the work accomplished so far and keeping up-to-date plan about the next actions.","Many business applications implement wizards or other types of techniques to guide users during execution of sequences of tasks of a complex process. The tasks to be executed are displayed successively one after another in a graphical user interface (GUI). The execution of one task invokes an interface for execution of a next task. Often, a roadmap is displayed within the GUI to help users keep track of a task flow while accomplishing a complex process. Such roadmaps could be described as plans that contain tasks and dependencies for accomplishment of complex processes. Roadmaps help users to navigate between tasks, inform the users for the executed tasks and the forthcoming tasks, provide additional information associated with the tasks, etc.","Occasionally, the various types of roadmaps that are displayed in GUIs cannot show all tasks of a process within a single screen. Some business processes involve the execution of compound tasks consisting of one or more subordinate tasks. In such cases, the relevant roadmaps need to be displayed as dynamic tree-like structures that could change depending on user input. The navigation through a GUI roadmap with compound elements is necessary to achieve an overview of the tasks and the existing dependencies of a process.","The implementation of roadmaps in graphical user interfaces provides significant advantage to application users during execution of business processes or various system procedures. The roadmaps and other similar GUI tools offer guidance and additional information to facilitate the accomplishment of a particular action. However, users often have to scroll through roadmap controls and navigate between numerous screens to get the necessary information for accomplishment of a particular task, because the relevant data is not summarized in a single screen. This navigation or scrolling could cause inefficiency and uncertainty in user's actions. Thus, the overall user performance could be harmed, as well as the objective and subjective perception for usability of an application GUI.","Various systems and methods for nested roadmap information navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) are described herein. A sequence of items including at least one compound item is generated and stored in a memory of a computer system. A number of user interface (UI) elements are displayed in a GUI screen, wherein each UI element represents an item of the sequence of items, and wherein the UI elements are ordered according to the sequence. The displayed UI elements include a UI element representing a compound item from the sequence of items. The compound item could be selected as a currently active item. The UI element representing a selected compound item gradually expands to include in the GUI screen one or more new UI elements representing component items. The component items are subordinate to the selected compound item. One of the component items is automatically selected as a currently active item.","The displayed UI elements are automatically scrolled to move the UI element representing the currently active item at a focal position within the GUI screen area. When the UI elements scroll in one direction, a new UI element could be gradually brought into the GUI screen from the direction of scrolling. Furthermore, the scrolling could gradually remove a UI element in the opposite direction of the screen.","These and other benefits and features of embodiments of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, presented in connection with the following drawings.","Embodiments of techniques for nested roadmap navigation in a graphical user interface (GUI) are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention.

Tags \u201croadMap\u201d and \u201croadMapItem\u201d have attributes that could specify the roadmap and roadmap item display and behavior. For example, attribute \u201cstate\u201d could characterize an active, e.g., current, item or step of the roadmap; an inactive step that could be selected; and a disabled step. A user cannot select or jump to a disabled item to execute a task associated with the item before a condition is satisfied, e.g., a prior action is executed. Further, \u201ctext\u201d attribute provides a label or a title for a roadmap item or step. Attribute \u201ctooltip\u201d provides a text that describes an item. Tooltip text could appear in the GUI when a user moves a pointer over a graphical element that displays the item. Attribute \u201conClick\u201d is used to specify an event that will be triggered when a user clicks on a graphical element with a mouse input device. Another attribute, \u201chasDynamicSubLevels\u201d, defines whether an item is a compound item or not. Other attributes could be used to define an item as a component item subordinate to a particular compound item. An item could be defined as a compound item even if there are no subordinate component items defined for it. Attribute \u201chasDynamicSubLevels\u201d could be omitted and component items could be directly defined in the body of the compound program object.","According to one embodiment of the invention, Component items could be dynamically generated and associated with a compound item based on the exact process execution flow and user input. One group of component items could replace another group of component items associated with a particular compound item. Some of the component items subordinate to a compound item could be also compound items. Thus, the roadmap could be defined as a nested tree-like structure that could be dynamically updated.","The enlisted attributes are only examples. Other attributes with different names and properties could be defined in another embodiment of the invention. Similarly, an \u201conSelect\u201d attribute may specify an action that a computer system executes when an item is selected. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other approaches to define roadmap items and to assign tasks to the items could be implemented. Different development technologies and libraries of other vendors could be utilized to generate a sequence of items in broad sense.","At , a number of similar graphical elements are displayed in a specified screen area of a GUI. In this document, a graphical element means an object presented on a display device rendering a GUI. In other words, in this document, a graphical element means a user interface (UI) element. Each of the displayed graphical elements represents an item of the sequence of items stored in the memory. In one embodiment of the invention, the displayed graphical elements represent wholly or partially the sequence of items. The sequence of items could be regarded as a roadmap for accomplishing a particular business process by executing the tasks associated to the items from the sequence. The GUI provides information and guidance to assist a user during the accomplishment of the process by displaying the graphical elements corresponding to roadmap items and the assigned tasks. Thus, the user is able to monitor work progress, e.g., to review already executed tasks and to browse the upcoming steps.","Often, the number of items in the sequence is greater than the number of the displayed graphical elements within a single screen. The generated sequence usually includes a considerable number of items, and if too many graphical elements are displayed in a single screen, users could get confused and disoriented. The displayed graphical elements provide details regarding the corresponding items and the assigned tasks, according to one embodiment of the invention. The details could include information for the names of the tasks, descriptions or instructions for execution, statuses of the items, the order of the items, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, an efficient GUI displays between five and ten items from the sequence of items in a single screen by using corresponding graphical elements. A compound graphical element could be illustrated in the GUI screen by displaying a modified graphical element corresponding to the compound item, according to one embodiment of the invention.","In a case where the displayed graphical elements are fewer than the items in the generated sequence, the GUI could provide scrolling functionality. Thus, a scrolling is requested to change the set of the displayed items in the screen area and show one or more new graphical elements representing one or more new items from the sequence. The direction where the new graphical elements appear is the direction of scrolling, and it could be specified in the scrolling request. The scrolling could be requested by a user directly in the GUI by utilizing various input devices, including a keyboard, a mouse, a touch screen, etc. For example, scrolling could be requested by using arrows keys of a keyboard; or by moving a mouse pointer over a specific GUI control or area, with or without clicking on a mouse button, or rotating a scroll wheel or a scroll ball. Additionally, scrolling could be requested by a system process in response to a specific event, for example, in response to accomplishment of a task execution.","According to one embodiment of the invention, the scrolling in a requested direction is possible only if there is a next item in the sequence of items to be displayed by a graphical element from the direction of scrolling. Respectively, a check is performed to determine whether such next item exists. If next item to be displayed at the requested direction of scrolling exists, GUI could animate a gradual movement of the graphical elements in a direction opposite to the direction of scrolling. The animated gradual movement creates a visual effect for a smooth, e.g., without perceptible jumps, shift or flow of the displayed graphical elements towards the edge of the GUI screen that is opposite to the direction of scrolling. The result of the smooth animation is a user perception for continuing movement along the roadmap of items. As a consequence of this movement, a new graphical element representing the next item may appears from the direction of scrolling, and is gradually included in the display screen with the pace of the animated movement. The perception for \u201cgradually\u201d or \u201cgradual\u201d move of the displayed graphical elements could be created by fast continuous change of the contents of the GUI screen. The appearance of the displayed graphical objects changes by a fraction at a time commensurate with the size of a pixel, imperceptible for a human eye at the speed of change.","A GUI screen allows the display of a limited number of graphical elements. Respectively, including a new graphical element from one direction could result in excluding an existing graphical element in opposite direction during the smooth movement along the roadmap. Accordingly, an existing graphical element may be gradually excluded from the roadmap screen area depending on factors like the number of currently displayed graphical elements, the distribution of the graphical elements in the screen, the continuation of the animated smooth movement, etc.","The animation effect for a gradual movement along the roadmap could be further strengthened by additional visual effects. In one embodiment of the invention, the new graphical elements appear in emerging mode in the screen. The emerging mode could be characterized by visual effects, including gradual shift from different levels of transparency to opacity, or gradually changing the contours of the new graphical elements from dimmed to rich colors. The new graphical elements emerge during smooth animated movement, while or after being gradually included in the screen area. Similar to the visual effect of emerging, the exclusion of old elements from the screen area could be strengthened with applying a fading mode to create a visual effect opposite to the effect created with applying the emerging mode. When fading, old graphical elements could gradually change its appearance from opacity to different levels of transparency, or the contours of the fading graphical elements could lighten or dissolve from rich to washy colors.","Process  continues at  with selecting an item as an item of interest or as a currently active item. There are different ways to select an item as a currently active item. For example, a user could use a keyboard, a mouse, or some other input device to directly click on a graphical element representing the item, and thus selecting the item. In another example, a user may click on a button or enter data in another screen area of the GUI that could lead to an item selection. Alternatively, an item could be selected without a user action, as a result of a system event. One of ordinary skill in the art may recognize a number of other possible ways to receive a selection or assign interest to a particular item from the sequence of items stored in a system memory. If displayed, graphical element representing the currently active item could be modified to indicate the selection. The modification of the graphical element could include different visual effects, e.g., change of element's borders, change of colors, change of size, etc.","At , a check is performed to determine whether the selected item is a compound item. If the selected item is a compound item, at , one or more component items are identified as subordinate to the currently active compound item. In one embodiment of the invention, the subordinate component items could be dynamically generated when the compound item is selected. Alternatively, different component items could be dynamically generated and associated with a compound item in correspondence with a system event or a user input regarding an execution of a task assigned to an item from the sequence of items. In a most simple scenario, the subordinate component items are predefined together with their parent compound items.","When a component item is selected, and one or more component items are identified, the graphical element representing the compound item starts to expand gradually at . In one embodiment of the invention, a smooth animation visual effect creates a user perception of gradual expansion of the graphical element along the displayed roadmap to open space within the graphical element to display new graphical elements that are subordinate to the selected compound item. The expansion of the graphical element leads to the gradual inclusion of one or more new graphical elements. The new graphical elements are evenly distributed in the gap created within the expanded UI element. The new graphical elements could appear within the expanding graphical element in emerging mode. The expansion of one graphical element could cause gradual movement of one or more neighboring graphical elements. Furthermore, some of the graphical elements could be gradually removed from view when there is not enough space to preserve the even distribution between the displayed graphical elements.","After the graphical element corresponding to the selected item is expanded to include one or more new graphical elements representing the subordinate items, process  returns to  to select a new item as currently active. When the check at  confirms that the selected item is not a compound item, a task assigned to the selected item is executed at , according to one embodiment of the invention. The task that is executed could be one of a series of tasks associated with an underlying business process. The tasks associated with the business process could be assigned to different items from the sequence of items. The actions of steps from  to  are repeated until, at , all tasks of the underlying business process are confirmed to have been executed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","290","201","200","230","231","239","231","231","236","237","239","230","231","239","230","230","200"]},"Graphical elements  to  are displayed within GUI screen area  on a display coupled to memory . Graphical elements  to  are labeled with numbers and letters to illustrate that a number of P items from sequence of items  to  are displayed in screen area . Usually, the number of P elements displayed represents a sub-set of the sequence of M items. Each of graphical elements  to  corresponds to a separate item from sequence of items  to . According to one embodiment of the invention, consecutive graphical elements  to  correspond to a P number of consecutive items from the sequence of M items  to  stored in memory . As illustrated, graphical elements  to  are connected by line  to resemble a roadmap wherein each graphical element represents a particular task or activity assigned to the corresponding item.","A user could scroll along the displayed roadmap in order to review all items from the sequence of items, no more than P number of items at a time.

At , a set of the sequence of items is displayed in a GUI screen area by corresponding graphical elements. Usually, when a user executes a task assigned or related to an item of the sequence of items, it is convenient to have a ready access to as much of the relevant information for the item as possible. According to one embodiment of the invention, intelligent and efficient information navigation in a GUI could automatically scroll displayed graphical elements to show a particular item of interest within a specified focal position of the screen area. Thus, a user will always have an overview of the currently active item and its neighboring items in the sequence of items.

When, at , the selected item is confirmed as not being a compound item, process  continues at  with specifying a focal position in the GUI screen area. This could be a preliminary action performed at an earlier stage during development or setup of an application or of the GUI. If action  is omitted then a default focal position could be automatically assigned. The focal position could be specified using different terms. For example, the size and location of the focal position could be defined proportioned to the GUI screen area dimensions.

For convenience, roadmap area  automatically opens nested structures of roadmap  and scrolls to place a graphical element corresponding to the currently active item within focal area . Thus, the user will have an overview and a guidance of the underlying process, including the current task, the level of the current task within the tree-like nested structure of the sequence of items, the recently accomplished tasks and the forthcoming tasks. The intelligent automatic scrolling saves the users unnecessary scrolling requests. The users could use GUI controls to request scrolling of the displayed graphical elements in the roadmap screen area to review any item from the sequence of items. When the GUI focus is changed to task work area  from another area, the set of displayed items (e.g., their corresponding graphical elements) scroll automatically to place the graphical element corresponding to the currently active item within focal area .","In one embodiment of the invention, the user could accomplish the task assigned to the currently active item using the interface displayed in task work area . When the task assigned to the currently active item is accomplished, a next item from the sequence of items is selected automatically as currently active item. When the next selected item is a compound item, the selection is shifted automatically to an item subordinate to the compound item. The component items subordinate to the compound item could be generated or identified when the compound item is selected as currently active.","The graphical elements in roadmap area  scroll and expand automatically towards the next currently active item to move the corresponding graphical element in focal area . Task work area  displays the interface corresponding to the task assigned to the next currently active item. The user could scroll the displayed graphical elements and directly select an item, e.g., by clicking on the corresponding graphical element. Thus, the user could jump to execute a task or edit a previous execution of a task without being faithful to the order of the sequence. However, in various embodiments, one or more of the items may not be selectable for execution out of order. If there is no next item to be automatically selected, the underlying process associated with the sequence of item is reported as being accomplished.","GUI  further includes label area  and toolbar area , according to various embodiments of the invention. Information associated with one or more of the graphical elements are displayed in the label area . The information in label area  could provide data that is helpful for the user during the execution of the tasks assigned to the items from the sequence of items. For example, label area  could include the names of the tasks assigned to the displayed graphical elements. Label area could also show information regarding the order in the sequence of the items that are displayed with corresponding graphical objects, tooltips, instructions regarding the assigned actions, etc. Label area  could be adjacent to, or even intersect with roadmap area . Toolbar area  provides access to one or more commands pertinent to the items displayed in roadmap area , or pertinent to the interface displayed in task work area . According to one embodiment of the invention, toolbar area  displays one or more command options selectable by a user in order to initiate a desired action.
