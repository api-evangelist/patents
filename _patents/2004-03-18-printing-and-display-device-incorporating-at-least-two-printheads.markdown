These will be replaced by the corresponding application numbers when available.","Flat panel displays are known. A popular technology presently in use is the Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), which comprises an array of liquid crystal pixel elements driven by respective thin film transistors. In each element, liquid crystal is sandwiched between glass plates. A backlight is positioned behind the LCD layer relative to a position from which the display will be viewed. A polarizing screen is placed between the backlight and the LCD layer, and another polarizing screen is positioned on the other side of the LCD layer. The polarizing screens are orientated to be orthogonally polarizing with respect to each other.","Using the corresponding TFT to alter a voltage applied to the liquid crystal element causes a change in its crystalline structure that correspondingly alters the polarization of light passing through the element from the backlight. This change in polarization causes a corresponding change in the amount of light transmitted through the polarizing screens and LCD element.","Multiple colors are dealt with by providing each pixel with multiple LCD pixel elements (usually red, green and blue) that can individually be controlled for each pixel, thereby allowing various color combinations.","The design and operation of TFT LCD screens is well known to those skilled in the art and so is not described in more detail in this document.","Typically, flat panel displays, including TFT LCD displays, are more expensive than Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) display of comparable performance. However, the relative lightness and compactness of flat panel displays (particularly in terms of front to back depth) make them particularly suitable for situations where a small footprint is desirable. They are ubiquitous in laptop computers, and have come down in price sufficiently for them to be attractive to many desktop computer users. The relatively shallow front to back depth means that the display can be pushed back further from the user than would be possible with a CRT in many situations, thereby allowing better viewing comfort. Flat panel displays also enable a user to utilize considerably smaller areas than would be possible with an equivalent CRT display, which can be important in situations where a wall, partition or divider is located close to a work area in which the display is to be situated.","Often, computer users wish to print a hard copy of documents, images, web pages and the like. Usually, a printer is provided as a peripheral device that can be connected to the computer using a suitable cable. Alternatively, the computer can be connected via a Local Area Network (LAN) or other communications network. Printers can be bulky, and tend to take up additional space in a user's work area. Where space is at a premium, such printers can be intrusive or at least inconvenient. In many cases where a flat panel display is selected, space is already at a premium, so printers can exacerbate the problem.","In one aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising: a flat panel display for displaying images from a computer, and a printer, the printer including a printhead for printing onto the paper.","In a second aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising: a flat panel display for displaying images from a computer, a stand for holding the flat panel display in an operative position; and a printer, the printer including a printhead for printing onto paper; wherein the stand includes at least one receptacle configured to accept at least one replaceable ink cartridge for supplying ink to the printer.","In a third aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising: a data connection for receiving print data from a computer; a flat panel display for displaying images received from a computer; a printer, the printer including a printhead for printing onto paper on the basis of the print data; and a data connection hub configured to allow connection of at least one data-receiving device to the printing and display device, enabling the data-receiving device to receive data from the computer.","In a fourth aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising:\n\n","In a fifth aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising:\n\n","In a sixth aspect the present invention provides a printing and display device comprising:\n\n","In a seventh aspect the present invention provides a printer configured to receive documents to be printed from a computer system, the printer including an interface, and being configured to:\n\n","The invention will be more fully understood from the following description of an embodiment of a printing and display device that incorporates an exemplified form of the invention. The description is provided with reference to the accompanying drawings.","As shown in , in the preferred embodiment, the printing aspect of the invention is embodied in an A4\/Letter printer  that prints documents supplied by a computer system . The computer system  is programmed to perform various steps involved in printing a document, including receiving the document (step ), buffering it (step ) and rasterizing it (step ), and then compressing it (step ) for transmission to the printer .","The compressed, multi-layer page image is buffered (step ) upon receipt in the printer , then expanded (step ). The expanded contone layer is dithered (step ) and then the black layer from the expansion step is composited over the dithered contone layer (step ). Coded data can also be rendered (step ) to form an additional layer, to be printed (in the preferred form) using an infrared ink that is substantially invisible to the human eye. The black, dithered contone and infrared layers are combined (step ) to form a page that is supplied to a printhead for printing (step ). In the preferred embodiment, the printhead is a bi-lithic printhead configured to print in 6 colors in a pagewidth format, although the design can be adapted to print using any desired number of colors, and can be monolithic or require multiple substrates depending upon implementation.","The preferred embodiment divides printer data into a high-resolution bi-level mask layer for text and line art and a medium-resolution contone color image layer for images or background colors. Optionally, colored text can be supported by the addition of a medium-to-high-resolution contone texture layer for texturing text and line art with color data taken from an image or from flat colors. The preferred printing architecture, elements of which are described in more detail below, generalises these contone layers by representing them in abstract \u201cimage\u201d and \u201ctexture\u201d layers which can refer to either image data or flat color data. This division of data into layers based on content follows the base mode Mixed Raster Content (MRC) model specified in ITU-T.44. Like the MRC base mode, the preferred printing architecture makes compromises in some cases when data to be printed overlap. In particular, in the preferred form all overlaps are reduced to a 3-layer representation in a process (collision resolution) embodying the compromises explicitly.","As shown in , the central data structure for the preferred printing architecture is a generalised representation of the three layers, called a page element. A page element can be used to represent units ranging from single rendered elements emerging from a rendering engine up to an entire band of a print job.  shows a simplified UML diagram of a page element . Conceptually, the bi-level symbol region selects between the two color sources, as described in more detail below.","Printing Architecture","A more detailed description of the printing architecture will now be described with reference to . It will be appreciated that the components of the architecture  shown in  will typically be device dependent, in that they process the data into a form required by a software or hardware component further downstream.","In , a renderer  exists outside of the more general printer system pipeline. Its purpose is to render files to be printed and deliver rendered elements to the data receiver  of the pipeline, using an API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) exposed by the data receiver  for that purpose. The rendered elements are delivered in order according to the painter's algorithm, which is well known to those skilled in the art of image processing. The data passed in through the API is converted by the data receiver  into lists of dictionaries and page elements for processing in later stages.","A collision resolver  accepts the simple page elements created by the data receiver and creates a fully opaque \u201cresolved\u201d page element for each intersection of a new element with the background and any elements already present. Fundamentally, the collision resolver guarantees that the entire page is tiled with opaque elements.","A stripper  divides a band of data into horizontally overlapping pieces. This need only be performed in the case where relatively wide or fast printers use multiple parallel devices in order to achieve the required output dot-rate. In such cases, each horizontally overlapping piece is fed into a corresponding device downstream. Where such data division is not required, the stripper  can be omitted.","Different printing configurations will require different configurations of layers for delivery to the downstream hardware. A layer reorganiser  converts 3-layer page elements to the appropriate 2- or 3-layer form for the specific configuration. Again, there may be cases in which this function is not required, in which case the layer organiser can be omitted.","A contone combiner  combines and clips the image and texture layers of all page elements in a strip into single image and texture layers, as required by downstream hardware.","A color converter  transforms the contone planes of all page elements from the input color space to a device-specific color space (which is usually CMYK).","A mask combiner  performs the same operation on the mask layer as the contone combiner performs on the contone layers. All elements are clipped to a strip boundary and drawn into a single mask buffer.","A densitometer  measures the density of the current page as a percentage of total possible density. This operation is necessary only in low-end printers with power supplies that may not be able to handle a fully dense page at full speed.","A contone compressor  compresses the contone layers of all page elements in order to reduce downstream memory and\/or transmission bandwidth requirements.","A mask formatter  converts the mask layer of page elements, which may be represented as regions of placed symbol references, into the form expected by a downstream mask decompressor.","A size limiter  ensures that all size limitations, for bands and for entire pages, are adhered to, by either dividing bands into smaller bands or by recompressing the data, repeating until the constraint is satisfied.","If data is to be transmitted to the printer between pipeline stages, a serialised form of the data structures is generated (in serialiser ), transmitted, then deserialised (in deserialiser ).","Within the printer, a distributor  converts data from a proprietary representation into a hardware-specific representation and ensures that the data for each strip is sent to the correct hardware device whilst observing any constraints or requirements on data transmission to these devices. The distributor distributes the converted data to an appropriate one of a plurality of pipelines . The pipelines are identical to each other, and in essence provide decompression, scaling and dot compositing functions to generate a set of printable dot outputs.","Each pipeline  includes a buffer  for receiving the data. A contone decompressor  decompresses the color contone planes, and a mask decompressor  decompresses the monotone (text) layer. Contone and mask scalers  and  scale the decompressed contone and mask planes respectively, to take into account the size of the medium onto which the page is to be printed.","The scaled contone planes are then dithered by ditherer . In the preferred form, a stochastic dispersed-dot dither is used. Unlike a clustered-dot (or amplitude-modulated) dither, a dispersed-dot (or frequency-modulated) dither reproduces high spatial frequencies (i.e. image detail) almost to the limits of the dot resolution, while simultaneously reproducing lower spatial frequencies to their full color depth, when spatially integrated by the eye. A stochastic dither matrix is carefully designed to be relatively free of objectionable low-frequency patterns when tiled across the image. As such, its size typically exceeds the minimum size required to support a particular number of intensity levels (e.g. 16\u00d716\u00d78 bits for 257 intensity levels).","The dithered planes are then composited in a dot compositor  on a dot-by-dot basis to provide dot data suitable for printing. This data is forwarded to data distribution and drive circuitry , which in turn distributes the data to the correct nozzle actuators , which in turn cause ink to be ejected from the correct nozzles  at the correct time. This process is described in more detail below.","The architecture  includes a mainly software-based computer system portion prior to the serialiser , and a mainly hardware-based printer portion that is located within a printer remote from the computer system, which includes everything from the deserialiser  onwards. It will be appreciated, however, that the indicated division between computer system and printer is somewhat arbitrary, and various components can be placed on different sides of the divide without substantially altering the operation of the architecture as a whole. It will also be appreciated that some of the components in the architecture  can be handled in hardware or software remotely from the main computer system and printer. For example, rather than relying on the general-purpose processor of a personal computer, some of the components in the architecture can be accelerated using dedicated hardware.","SoPEC Device","In the preferred form, the hardware pipelines  are embodied in a Small Office Home Office Printer Engine Controller (SoPEC), as shown in  and described in more detail below. The printer preferably also includes one or more system on a chip (SoC) components, as well as the print engine pipeline control application specific logic, configured to perform some or all of the functions described above in relation to the printing pipeline.","As shown in , from the highest point of view a SoPEC device consists of 3 distinct subsystems: a Central Processing Unit (CPU) subsystem , a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) subsystem  and a Print Engine Pipeline (PEP) subsystem .","The CPU subsystem  includes a CPU  that controls and configures all aspects of the other subsystems. It provides general support for interfacing and synchronizing the external printer with the internal print engine. It also controls the low-speed communication to QA chips (which are described elsewhere in this specification). The CPU subsystem  also contains various peripherals to aid the CPU, such as General Purpose Input Output (GPIO, which includes motor control), an Interrupt Controller Unit (ICU), LSS Master and general timers. The Serial Communications Block (SCB) on the CPU subsystem provides a full speed USB1.1 interface to the host as well as an Inter SoPEC Interface (ISI) to other SoPEC devices (not shown).","The DRAM subsystem  accepts requests from the CPU, Serial Communications Block (SCB) and blocks within the PEP subsystem. The DRAM subsystem , and in particular the DRAM Interface Unit (DIU), arbitrates the various requests and determines which request should win access to the DRAM. The DIU arbitrates based on configured parameters, to allow sufficient access to DRAM for all requestors. The DIU also hides the implementation specifics of the DRAM such as page size, number of banks and refresh rates.","The Print Engine Pipeline (PEP) subsystem  accepts compressed pages from DRAM and renders them to bi-level dots for a given print line destined for a printhead interface that communicates directly with up to 2 segments of a bi-lithic printhead. The first stage of the page expansion pipeline is the Contone Decoder Unit (CDU), Lossless Bi-level Decoder (LBD) and Tag Encoder (TE). The CDU expands the JPEG-compressed contone (typically CMYK) layers, the LBD expands the compressed bi-level layer (typically K), and the TE encodes Netpage tags for later rendering (typically in IR or K ink). The output from the first stage is a set of buffers: the Contone FIFO unit (CFU), the Spot FIFO Unit (SFU), and the Tag FIFO Unit (TFU). The CFU and SFU buffers are implemented in DRAM.","The second stage is the Halftone Compositor Unit (HCU), which dithers the contone layer and composites position tags and the bi-level spot layer over the resulting bi-level dithered layer.","A number of compositing options can be implemented, depending upon the printhead with which the SoPEC device is used. Up to 6 channels of bi-level data are produced from this stage, although not all channels may be present on the printhead. For example, the printhead may be CMY only, with K pushed into the CMY channels and IR ignored. Alternatively, the encoded tags may be printed in K if IR ink is not available (or for testing purposes).","In the third stage, a Dead Nozzle Compensator (DNC) compensates for dead nozzles in the printhead by color redundancy and error diffusing of dead nozzle data into surrounding dots.","The resultant bi-level 6 channel dot-data (typically CMYK, Infrared, Fixative) is buffered and written to a set of line buffers stored in DRAM via a Dotline Writer Unit (DWU).","Finally, the dot-data is loaded back from DRAM, and passed to the printhead interface via a dot FIFO. The dot FIFO accepts data from a Line Loader Unit (LLU) at the system clock rate pclk), while the PrintHead Interface (PHI) removes data from the FIFO and sends it to the printhead at a rate of \u2154 times the system clock rate.","In the preferred form, the DRAM is 2.5 Mbytes in size, of which about 2 Mbytes are available for compressed page store data. A compressed page is received in two or more bands, with a number of bands stored in memory. As a band of the page is consumed by the PEP subsystem  for printing, a new band can be downloaded. The new band may be for the current page or the next page.","Using banding it is possible to begin printing a page before the complete compressed page is downloaded, but care must be taken to ensure that data is always available for printing or a buffer under-run may occur.","The embedded USB 1.1 device accepts compressed page data and control commands from the host PC, and facilitates the data transfer to either the DRAM (or to another SoPEC device in multi-SoPEC systems, as described below).","Multiple SoPEC devices can be used in alternative embodiments, and can perform different functions depending upon the particular implementation. For example, in some cases a SoPEC device can be used simply for its onboard DRAM, while another SoPEC device attends to the various decompression and formatting functions described above. This can reduce the chance of buffer under-run, which can happen in the event that the printer commences printing a page prior to all the data for that page being received and the rest of the data is not received in time. Adding an extra SoPEC device for its memory buffering capabilities doubles the amount of data that can be buffered, even if none of the other capabilities of the additional chip are utilized.","Each SoPEC system can have several quality assurance (QA) devices designed to cooperate with each other to ensure the quality of the printer mechanics, the quality of the ink supply so the printhead nozzles will not be damaged during prints, and the quality of the software to ensure printheads and mechanics are not damaged.","Normally, each printing SoPEC will have an associated printer QA, which stores information printer attributes such as maximum print speed. An ink cartridge for use with the system will also contain an ink QA chip, which stores cartridge information such as the amount of ink remaining. The printhead also has a QA chip, configured to act as a ROM (effectively as an EEPROM) that stores printhead-specific information such as dead nozzle mapping and printhead characteristics. The CPU in the SoPEC device can optionally load and run program code from a QA Chip that effectively acts as a serial EEPROM. Finally, the CPU in the SoPEC device runs a logical QA chip (ie, a software QA chip).","Usually, all QA chips in the system are physically identical, with only the contents of flash memory differentiating one from the other.","Each SoPEC device has two LSS system buses that can communicate with QA devices for system authentication and ink usage accounting. A large number of QA devices can be used per bus and their position in the system is unrestricted with the exception that printer QA and ink QA devices should be on separate LSS busses.","In use, the logical QA communicates with the ink QA to determine remaining ink. The reply from the ink QA is authenticated with reference to the printer QA. The verification from the printer QA is itself authenticated by the logical QA, thereby indirectly adding an additional authentication level to the reply from the ink QA.","Data passed between the QA chips, other than the printhead QA, is authenticated by way of digital signatures. In the preferred embodiment, HMAC-SHA1 authentication is used for data, and RSA is used for program code, although other schemes could be used instead.","A single SoPEC device can control two bi-lithic printheads and up to six color channels. Six channels of colored ink are the expected maximum in a consumer SOHO, or office bi-lithic printing environment, and include:\n\n","Because the bi-lithic printer is capable of printing so fast, a fixative may be required to enable the ink to dry before the page touches the page already printed. Otherwise ink may bleed between pages. In relatively low-speed printing environments the fixative may not be required.","In the preferred form, the SoPEC device is color space agnostic. Although it can accept contone data as CMYX or RGBX, where X is an optional 4th channel, it also can accept contone data in any print color space. Additionally, SoPEC provides a mechanism for arbitrary mapping of input channels to output channels, including combining dots for ink optimization and generation of channels based on any number of other channels. However, inputs are typically CMYK for contone input, K for the bi-level input, and the optional Netpage tag dots are typically rendered to an infrared layer. A fixative channel is typically generated for fast printing applications.","In the preferred form, the SoPEC device is also resolution agnostic. It merely provides a mapping between input resolutions and output resolutions by means of scale factors. The expected output resolution for the preferred embodiment is 1600 dpi, but SoPEC actually has no knowledge of the physical resolution of the Bi-lithic printhead.","In the preferred form, the SoPEC device is page-length agnostic. Successive pages are typically split into bands and downloaded into the page store as each band of information is consumed.","The following three tables show the constituents of each of the three distinct subsystems which make up the SoPEC device. In particular, each of the columns provide the unit acronym, the unit name and a description of the functions performed by each unit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0143"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Unit",{},{}]},{"entry":["Subsystem","Acronym","Unit Name","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["DRAM","DIU","DRAM interface unit","Provides interface for"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"DRAM read and write"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"access for the various"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"SoPEC units, CPU and"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the SCB block.

Typically, the printhead ICs can vary in size from 2 inches to 8 inches, so several combinations can be used to produce, say, an A4 pagewidth printhead. For example two printhead ICs of 7 and 3 inches, 2 and 4 inches, or 5 and 5 inches could be used to create an A4 printhead (the notation is 7:3). Similarly 6 and 4 (6:4) or 5 and 5 (5:5) combinations can be used. An A3 printhead can be constructed from 8 and 6-inch printhead integrated circuits, for example. For photographic printing, particularly in camera, smaller printheads can be used. It will also be appreciated that a single printhead integrated circuit, or more than two such circuits, can also be used to achieve the required printhead width.","A preferred printhead embodiment will now be described with reference to . As best shown in  and , a printhead  takes the form of an elongate unit. As best shown in , the components of the printhead  include a support member , a flexible PCB , an ink distribution molding , an ink distribution plate , a MEMS printhead comprising first and second printhead integrated circuits (ICs)  and , and busbars .","The support member  is can be formed from any suitable material, such as metal or plastic, and can be extruded, molded or formed in any other way. The support member  should be strong enough to hold the other components in the appropriate alignment relative to each other whilst stiffening and strengthening the printhead as a whole.","The flexible PCB extends the length of the printhead  and includes first and second electrical connectors  and . The electrical connectors  and  correspond with the flexible connectors  shown . The electrical connectors include contact areas  and  that, in use, are positioned in contact with corresponding output connectors (not shown) from the SoPEC chip  (). Data from the SoPEC chip  passes along the electrical connectors  and , and is distributed to respective ends of the first and second printhead ICs  and .","As shown in , the ink distribution molding  includes a plurality of elongate conduits  that distribute fluids (ie, colored inks, infrared ink and fixative) and pressurized air from the air pump along the length of the printhead  (). Sets of fluid apertures  () disposed along the length of the ink distribution molding  distribute the fluids and air from the conduits  to the ink distribution plate . The fluids and air are supplied via nozzles  formed on a plug  (), which plugs into a corresponding socket (not shown) in the printer.","The distribution plate  is a multi-layer construction configured to take fluids provided locally from the fluid apertures  and distribute them through smaller distribution apertures  into the printhead ICs  and  (as shown in ).","The printhead ICs  and  are positioned end to end, and are held in contact with the distribution plate  so that ink from the smaller distribution apertures  can be fed into corresponding apertures (not shown) in the printhead ICs  and .","The busbars  are relatively high-capacity conductors positioned to provide drive current to the actuators of the printhead nozzles (described in detail below). As best shown in , the busbars  are retained in position at one end by a socket , and at both ends by wrap-around wings  of the flexible PCB . The busbars also help hold the printhead ICs  in position, as best shown in ,  and .","As shown best in ,  and , when assembled, the flexible PCB  is effectively wrapped around the other components, thereby holding them in contact with each other. Notwithstanding this binding effect, the support member  provides a major proportion of the required stiffness and strength of the printhead  as a whole.","Printhead CMOS","Turning now to , a preferred embodiment of the printhead  (comprising printhead ICs  and ) will be described.

Status and other operational information about the nozzle array core  is communicated back to the nozzle control logic via another link , which is also provided on the electrical connector .","The nozzle array core  is shown in more detail in . In , it will be seen that the nozzle array core comprises an array of nozzle columns . The array includes a fire\/select shift register  and up to 6 color channels, each of which is represented by a corresponding dot shift register .","As shown in , the fire\/select shift register  includes forward path fire shift register , a reverse path fire shift register  and a select shift register . Each dot shift register  includes an odd dot shift register  and an even dot shift register . The odd and even dot shift registers  and  are connected at one end such that data is clocked through the odd shift register  in one direction, then through the even shift register  in the reverse direction. The output of all but the final even dot shift register is fed to one input of a multiplexer . This input of the multiplexer is selected by a signal (corescan) during post-production testing. In normal operation, the corescan signal selects dot data input Dot[x] supplied to the other input of the multiplexer . This causes Dot[x] for each color to be supplied to the respective dot shift registers .","A single column N will now be described with reference to . In the embodiment shown, the column N includes 12 data values, comprising an odd data value  and an even data value  for each of the six dot shift registers. Column N also includes an odd fire value  from the forward fire shift register  and an even fire value  from the reverse fire shift register , which are supplied as inputs to a multiplexer . The output of the multiplexer  is controlled by the select value  in the select shift register . When the select value is zero, the odd fire value is output, and when the select value is one, the even fire value is output.","Each of the odd and even data values  and  is provided as an input to corresponding odd and even dot latches  and  respectively.","Each dot latch and its associated data value form a unit cell, such as unit cell . A unit cell is shown in more detail in . The dot latch  is a D-type flip-flop that accepts the output of the data value , which is held by a D-type flip-flop  forming an element of the odd dot shift register . The data input to the flip-flop  is provided from the output of a previous element in the odd dot shift register (unless the element under consideration is the first element in the shift register, in which case its input is the Dot[x] value). Data is clocked from the output of flip-flop  into latch  upon receipt of a negative pulse provided on LsyncL.","The output of latch  is provided as one of the inputs to a three-input AND gate . Other inputs to the AND gate  are the Fr signal. (from the output of multiplexer ) and a pulse profile signal Pr. The firing time of a nozzle is controlled by the pulse profile signal Pr, and can be, for example, lengthened to take into account a low voltage condition that arises due to low battery (in a battery-powered embodiment). This is to ensure that a relatively consistent amount of ink is efficiently ejected from each nozzle as it is fired. In the embodiment described, the profile signal Pr is the same for each dot shift register, which provides a balance between complexity, cost and performance. However, in other embodiments, the Pr signal can be applied globally (ie, is the same for all nozzles), or can be individually tailored to each unit cell or even to each nozzle.","Once the data is loaded into the latch , the fire enable Fr and pulse profile Pr signals are applied to the AND gate , combining to the trigger the nozzle to eject a dot of ink for each latch  that contains a logic 1.","The signals for each nozzle channel are summarized in the following table:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0166"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Direction","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["d","Input","Input dot pattern to shift register bit"]},{"entry":["q","Output","Output dot pattern from shift register bit"]},{"entry":["SrClk","Input","Shift register clock in\u2014d is captured on rising edge"]},{"entry":[{},{},"of this clock"]},{"entry":["LsyncL","Input","Fire enable\u2014needs to be asserted for nozzle to fire"]},{"entry":["Pr","Input","Profile\u2014needs to be asserted for nozzle to fire"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As shown in , the fire signals Fr are routed on a diagonal, to enable firing of one color in the current column, the next color in the following column, and so on.

The design and construction of latches is well known to those skilled in the art of integrated circuit engineering and design, and so will not be described in detail in this document.","The combined printhead ICs define a printhead having 13824 nozzles per color. Therefore, in the case where the printhead ICs  and  are equal in length, each of them includes 6912 nozzles per color. The circuitry supporting each nozzle is the same, but the pairing of nozzles happens due to physical positioning of the MEMS nozzles; odd and even nozzles are not actually on the same horizontal line","Power and ground are provided via pads disposed along the length of the printhead ICs. The pads are connected to busbars  using conductive adhesive, as described above.","Printhead Nozzles and Actuators","The preferred printhead nozzle arrangement, comprising a nozzle and corresponding actuator, will now be described with reference to .  shows an array of the nozzle arrangements  formed on a silicon substrate . The nozzle arrangements are identical, but in the preferred embodiment, different nozzle arrangements are fed with different colored inks and fixative. It will be noted that rows of the nozzle arrangements  are staggered with respect to each other, allowing closer spacing of ink dots during printing than would be possible with a single row of nozzles. The multiple rows also allow for redundancy (if desired), thereby allowing for a predetermined failure rate per nozzle.","Each nozzle arrangement  is the product of an integrated circuit fabrication technique. In particular, the nozzle arrangement  defines a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS).","For clarity and ease of description, the construction and operation of a single nozzle arrangement  will be described with reference to .","Each of the ink jet printhead chips ,  includes a silicon wafer substrate . 0.35 Micron 1 P4M 12 volt CMOS microprocessing circuitry is positioned on the silicon wafer substrate .","A silicon dioxide (or alternatively glass) layer  is positioned on the wafer substrate . The silicon dioxide layer  defines CMOS dielectric layers. CMOS top-level metal defines a pair of aligned aluminium electrode contact layers  positioned on the silicon dioxide layer . Both the silicon wafer substrate  and the silicon dioxide layer  are etched to define an ink inlet channel  having a generally circular cross section (in plan). An aluminium diffusion barrier  of CMOS metal 1, CMOS metal \u2154 and CMOS top level metal is positioned in the silicon dioxide layer  about the ink inlet channel . The diffusion barrier  serves to inhibit the diffusion of hydroxyl ions through CMOS oxide layers of the drive circuitry layer .","A passivation layer in the form of a layer of silicon nitride  is positioned over the aluminium contact layers  and the silicon dioxide layer . Each portion of the passivation layer  positioned over the contact layers  has an opening  defined therein to provide access to the contacts .","The nozzle arrangement  includes a nozzle chamber  defined by an annular nozzle wall , which terminates in a nozzle rim  that is circular in plan. The ink inlet channel  is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber . At a lower end of the nozzle wall, there is disposed a moving rim , that includes a moving seal lip . An encircling wall  surrounds the movable nozzle, and includes a stationary seal lip  that, when the nozzle is at rest as shown in , is adjacent the moving rim . A fluidic seal  is formed due to the surface tension of ink trapped between the stationary seal lip  and the moving seal lip . This prevents leakage of ink from the chamber whilst providing a low resistance coupling between the encircling wall  and the nozzle wall .","As best shown in , a plurality of radially extending recesses  is defined in the roof  about the nozzle rim . The recesses  serve to contain radial ink flow as a result of ink escaping past the nozzle rim .","The nozzle wall  forms part of a lever arrangement that is mounted to a carrier  having a generally U-shaped profile with a base  attached to the layer  of silicon nitride.","The lever arrangement also includes a lever arm  that extends from the nozzle walls and incorporates a lateral stiffening beam . The lever arm  is attached to a pair of passive beams , formed from titanium nitride (TiN) and positioned on either side of the nozzle arrangement, as best shown in . The other ends of the passive beams  are attached to the carrier .","The lever arm  is also attached to an actuator beam , which is formed from TiN. It will be noted that this attachment to the actuator beam is made at a point a small but critical distance higher than the attachments to the passive beam .","As best shown in , the actuator beam  is substantially U-shaped in plan, defining a current path between the electrode  and an opposite electrode . Each of the electrodes  and  are electrically connected to respective points in the contact layer  (shown in ). As well as being electrically coupled via the contacts , the actuator beam is also mechanically anchored to anchor . The anchor  is configured to constrain motion of the actuator beam  to the left of  when the nozzle arrangement is in operation.","The TiN in the actuator beam  is conductive, but has a high enough electrical resistance that it undergoes self-heating when a current is passed between the electrodes  and . No current flows through the passive beams , so they do not expand.","In use, the device at rest is filled with ink  () that defines a meniscus  under the influence of surface tension. The ink is retained in the chamber  by the meniscus, and will not generally leak out in the absence of some other physical influence.","As shown in , to fire ink from the nozzle, a current is passed between the contacts  and , passing through the actuator beam . The self-heating of the beam  due to its resistance causes the beam to expand. The dimensions and design of the actuator beam  mean that the majority of the expansion in a horizontal direction with respect to . The expansion is constrained to the left by the anchor , so the end of the actuator beam  adjacent the lever arm  is impelled to the right.","The relative horizontal inflexibility of the passive beams  prevents them from allowing much horizontal movement with respect to the lever arm . However, the relative displacement of the attachment points of the passive beams and actuator beam respectively to the lever arm causes a twisting movement that causes the lever arm  to move generally downwards. The movement is effectively a pivoting or hinging motion. However, the absence of a true pivot point means that the rotation is about a pivot region defined by bending of the passive beams .","The downward movement (and slight rotation) of the lever arm  is amplified by the distance of the nozzle wall  from the passive beams . The downward movement of the nozzle walls and roof causes a pressure increase within the chamber , causing the meniscus to bulge as shown in . It will be noted that the surface tension of the ink means the fluid seal  is stretched by this motion without allowing ink to leak out.","As shown in , at the appropriate time, the drive current is stopped and the actuator beam  quickly cools and contracts. The contraction causes the lever arm to commence its return to the quiescent position, which in turn causes a reduction in pressure in the chamber . The interplay of the momentum of the bulging ink and its inherent surface tension, and the negative pressure caused by the upward movement of the nozzle chamber  causes thinning, and ultimately snapping, of the bulging meniscus to define an ink drop  that continues upwards until it contacts adjacent print media.","Immediately after the drop  detaches, the meniscus forms the concave shape shown in . Surface tension causes the pressure in the chamber  to remain relatively low until ink has been sucked upwards through the inlet , which returns the nozzle arrangement and the ink to the quiescent situation shown in .","As best shown in , the nozzle arrangement also incorporates a test mechanism that can be used both post-manufacture and periodically after the printhead is installed. The test mechanism includes a pair of contacts  that are connected to test circuitry (not shown). A bridging contact  is provided on a finger  that extends from the lever arm . Because the bridging contact  is on the opposite side of the passive beams , actuation of the nozzle causes the priding contact to move upwardly, into contact with the contacts . Test circuitry can be used to confirm that actuation causes this closing of the circuit formed by the contacts  and . If the circuit closed appropriately, it can generally be assumed that the nozzle is operative.","Flat Panel Display Device with Integrated Printer","A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in . Referring particularly to , a flat panel display unit  includes a flat panel display  that is supported on a stand . The present invention primarily applies to flat panel displays where a viewable size of the flat panel display exceeds 40 cm measured along a diagonal of the flat panel display. The stand  includes a base portion , which supports an arm  to which a housing  for the display  is hingedly connected. Various control buttons  are provided on the display unit , for controlling display functions such as contrast, brightness, color temperature and the like.","The display unit  incorporates a page-width printer (described below) that accepts, in the preferred embodiments shown in , single sheets of standard A4 or US Letter paper . A curved paper guide  causes paper exiting the printer to be directed away from the base  of the display unit , as best shown in .","The sub-components that comprise the display unit  are shown in exploded view in . A mounting plate  is hingedly mounted to the arm  and attached to a rear cover molding  formed from a plastics material. The cover molding is perforated to allow convective air currents to cool the electronic circuitry inside the display unit .","A metallic radio frequency interference and electromagnetic interference (RFI\/EMI) shield  fits inside the concave side of the rear cover molding . The shield  screens the various circuitry elements from external radiation, whilst reducing any radiation generated by the circuitry being transmitted from the display unit . The shield  takes the form of a cage with cooling holes that allow ventilation of the circuitry. An additional shield  covers the printhead (described below in relation to ).","The various electronic, mechanical and electromechanical components that comprise the printer are mounted on interconnected printed circuit boards (PCBs) , as best shown in . The PCBs  include a printhead PCB , an analog converter PCB , a backlight inverter PCB , and a power supply unit (PSU) . The PSU  supplies power at appropriate voltage and current to the various other PCBs via wiring .","Turning to , the printhead PCB forms part of a print engine assembly . The print engine assembly  also includes paper feed rollers , a platen  for supporting paper as it is fed past the printhead, an air pump  for supplying pressurized air to the printhead, a flexible connector  for supplying data from the print engine chips on the print engine PCB to the printhead, an ink delivery bus , and a print engine controller (SoPEC) chip . The feed rollers  are driven by a paper drive motor  and drive assembly .","As shown in  (in which the platen and feed rollers are removed for clarity), the print engine assembly  also includes support metalwork  for mounting the various components, copper busbars  for supplying power from the power leads  to the printheads, and flexible paper guide fingers . Ink channel moldings  route ink from the ink delivery bus , which also includes electrical contacts  that enable communication between an ink cartridge (described below) and the print engine assembly. It will be noted that the present embodiment includes two printhead segments  and  of equal length that together form a pagewidth printhead. As described earlier in this document,","Referring back to , a metal paper chute  is provided to guide paper behind the display and down to the printhead. A metal chassis  is provided to support the display , which is surrounded and protected by a plastic front bezel molding . A menu PCB  holds the menu buttons  and associated status LEDs.","As best shown in , the display unit  is provided with power via a mains cord  and associated mains plug . The mains plug  is inserted into mains socket , which is shown in  with the mains plug  removed. The mains socket  is hard-wired into the PSU .","A video input cable  and associated video plug  supply video data from a computer. The video plug  is inserted into a video socket , which is shown in  with the video plug  removed for clarity.","A data connection in the form of a USB 2 link is provided by way of a data cable  and associated data plug . The plug  is inserted into a USB 2 compliant data socket , which is shown in  with the data plug  removed for clarity.","As shown in  an ink cartridge  containing the various inks required for operation of the printer releasably engages the ink delivery bus  via an aperture  () formed in the rear molding . The cartridge is preferably held in position by an interference fit, although a positive retaining mechanism such as a clip can be supplied in alternative embodiments. As best shown in , the ink delivery bus  includes a plurality of fluid ports  that engage with corresponding fluid outputs (not shown) formed in the cartridge. In the embodiment shown, each fluid port  includes a hollow needle  that penetrates a seal (not shown) in the corresponding fluid output. The seal can be an annular resilient seal with a frangible membrane, or simply a frangible membrane that self-seals around the needle  as the cartridge  is inserted into an operative position.","The cartridge  contains the inks necessary for its use with the printer. The various possible combinations of colored inks (such as CMY), black ink, infrared ink and a fixative are described elsewhere in this document. The cartridge  also includes a QA (\u201cQuestion-Answer\u201d) chip that is configured to store information accessible by the SoPEC chip , such as ink levels remaining (preferably on a per-ink basis), types of ink contained in the cartridge, security data for ensuring the cartridge is compliant with the printer's needs and any other data that might be useful for the operation of the printer based on the particular cartridge inserted. The QA chip is electrically connected to a set of contacts (not shown) that operatively engage the electrical contacts  on an edge of the ink delivery bus . The electrical contacts allow information to be read from the QA chip in the cartridge  as required. This can be when the cartridge is first inserted, and possibly periodically thereafter. In the preferred embodiment, the SoPEC chip  can also write back to the cartridge. Typically, this will involve determining the amount of ink used and then updating the QA chip in the cartridge.","A number of other elements of the display unit  not shown in other Figures are shown in . It will be noted that the flat panel display  is preferably a Thin Film Transistor (TFT) Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). However, it will be understood that the particular technology employed in the flat panel display  is not critical to the invention. The flat panel display  can therefore be of any other type, including those using Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), Field Emission Display (FED) and Plasma Display Panel (PDP) technologies.","As shown in  the display unit includes row drivers  and column drivers  that are provided with input signals by an image processor  located on the analog converter PCB . The image processor receives display data from a personal computer (not shown) via the video socket . The fluorescent backlight inverter PCB  drives a fluorescent backlight .","The USB input  () provides data in accordance with the USB 2 protocol to the SoPEC chip . The image processor  can also provide data to the SoPEC chip , as described in detail below.","Operation of the display unit will now be described with reference to . Display data is received from a personal computer, or other suitable video data source, via the video input socket . The display data is provided to the image processor , which processes and converts it into a format suitable for supply to the row drivers  and column drivers . These drive the various TFTs required to display the image on the flat panel display . The fluorescent backlight  provides illumination from behind the TFTs, thereby enhancing visibility of images displayed. Various display settings, such as contrast, brightness and resolution, can be altered by a user via the controls .","The USB input socket  accepts USB formatted data from a connected personal computer, such as personal computer  in . It will be appreciated that this data can come from any other suitable source, such as a network connection or any other data communication link.","Upon receipt, the data is forwarded via an internal USB link to the printhead PCB  and the SoPEC chip . The data is decompressed and formatted in accordance with the steps shown in , using the hardware  described in relation to . The formatted data is forwarded from the SoPEC chip  to the Memjet printheads  and . The data is then printed onto the paper  as it is driven past the printheads.","In the preferred embodiment, the print button  () can be used to generate a printout of the presently displayed image. This enables a printout of the screen to be taken without the need to use a mouse, keyboard or other control device associated with the personal computer .","The invention has a number of advantages over the prior art. The combination of a printer and flat panel display saves a considerable amount of room compared to a separate display and printer combination. The printed matter, in the preferred embodiment, is ejected right in front of the user, unlike the case with prior art printers which are, for the most part, too bulky to be placed directly in front of the user.","In the particularly preferred embodiment described, the pagewidth nature of the printer and its relatively compact dimensions compared with inkjet and laser printers respectively mean that high quality printing can be provided without substantially increasing the size of the flat panel display casing. Given that a major advantage of flat panel displays is their compactness, this can be considered a major feature of the preferred embodiment. With the use of a pagewidth printhead, there is less vibration than with a reciprocating inkjet printhead, resulting in a more stable image for a user viewing the display whilst printing.","An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in , in which like numerals indicate features corresponding to those described in relation to the embodiment of . The embodiment of  is a duplex printer, which includes a pair printheads  and . The printheads are preferably of the same construction as the single printhead, each comprising two printhead segments. In the preferred embodiment, each of the printheads  and  has its own associated SoPEC device.","In operation, the embodiment of  prints onto both sides of the paper  as it is fed between the printheads  and .","A further embodiment is shown in , in which like numerals indicate features corresponding to those described in relation to the embodiment of . The embodiment includes a multi-sheet feeder  that enables a single sheet at a time to be taken from a stack of paper and fed past the printhead. The feeder  is best shown in , and includes a paper stop  that holds a stack of paper  in position. The preferred capacity of the stack  is about 50 sheets, although other capacities can be used. A flexible shim  extends across the top of the paper stop , terminating in an edge adjacent and below a pickup roller . The pickup roller  is generally circular in cross-section, but incorporates a flat portion .","In use, the paper stack  is loaded such that it rest on the flexible shim , which is in turn supported by the paper stop . The pickup roller  is positioned rotationally such that the flat portion  () is aligned with the nearest piece of paper in the stack. The pickup roller  is then rotated clockwise (relative to ), until the rounded portion engages the piece of paper. As this happens, friction between the paper and the roller increases, causing a downward force on the paper. The flexible shim  causes the sheet of paper to be separated from the stack  and driven downwards towards the feed rollers . As the paper engages the feed rollers, the flat spot rotates back into the position shown in , which reduces the friction between the pickup roller and the paper, thereby enabling the feed rollers to push the paper past the printhead.","It will be appreciated that any other known paper feeding mechanisms can be employed for taking a single sheet from a stack and feeding it for printing. It will also be appreciated that a duplex printhead arrangement such as that shown in  can also be employed with a multi-sheet feed mechanism.","Another embodiment is shown in , in which the sockets ,  and  are positioned in the base portion  of the display unit.

By active document we mean the document displayed in the active application's top-most window.","When the Print button is incorporated in a printer, it is important that the button initiates printing to that printer. When the Print button is incorporated in a display, it is reasonable for it to initiate printing to the default printer, which may or may not be configured to be the in-panel printer.","Windows Printing Background","There is no single standard way under Microsoft Windows to programmatically instruct the active application to print its active document to the default or to a designated printer. However, there are several mechanisms which may be exploited, covering most application types.","Although not explored here, comparable mechanisms exists under other operating systems and windowing systems, including Apple MacOS, Unix, X Windows, Linux etc. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to use with any particular hardware, operating system or software combination.","Printing User Interface","Most Microsoft Windows applications, as a matter of convention, provide a fairly standard printing user interface. This consists of: (a) a Print option on the File menu, usually accessible via the two keyboard sequences ALT,F,P and CTRL+P, which displays a print dialog to print the current document; and (b) a Print tool on the toolbar (shown as a printer icon) which prints the current document to the default printer without displaying the print dialog. Dialog-less direct printing has no standard keyboard shortcut.","If the active application is receptive to a keyboard sequence in this way, then a client application can instruct it to print by queuing the appropriate keyboard events (using the keybd_event or SendInput SDK functions) or by queuing the appropriate keyboard messages (using the AttachThreadInput, GetFocus, and PostMessage SDK functions).","Direct printing can be simulated by appending a carriage-return to the keyboard sequence, causing the print dialog to be completed without further user input.","Automation","Some Windows applications, including Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel, expose an Automation interface (formerly known as OLE Automation), which allows them to be controlled by a separate application. For example, Word (like many other Microsoft applications) exposes a PrintOut method which can be invoked on the active document to print the document directly. A client application can discover an open Word document and print it in this way. The application can designate a particular printer by assigning the name of the printer to Word's ActivePrinter property prior to invoking the PrintOut method. Automation servers such as Office applications register running instances of themselves in the Running Object Table (ROT). Multi-instance applications (such as Excel and some versions of Word) are only able to create a single application entry in the ROT. However, multi-instance applications typically also register each of their open documents separately in the ROT, allowing the client application to find the application instance corresponding to a particular document via the document's entry in the ROT.","The client application can iterate through the ROT, attach to each server application of interest in turn, and identify whether the application is associated with the foreground window. If the server application is associated with the foreground window (as identified by the GetForegroundWindow SDK function), then the client application can invoke the application's PrintOut method (or equivalent) to print the active document In the case of a single-instance application (such as PowerPoint), the client application attaches to the server application directly via the ROT entry. In the case of a multi-instance application (such as Excel), the client application attaches to the server application via a document entry in the ROT.","The Windows SDK provides standard functions for obtaining a pointer to the ROT and iterating through it. Application and document entries in the ROT are easily recognised since each entry is associated with a class-specific programmatic identifier. For example, a Word application has the programmatic identifier \u201cWord.Application.x\u201d (where x indicates the application version), and a Word document has the identifier \u201cWord.Document.y\u201d (where y indicates the document version). An application entry in the ROT conventionally includes the application's class identifier in its name, from which the corresponding programmatic identifier can be obtained via the Windows registry. A document entry in the ROT allows its programmatic identifier to be discovered via the class identifier associated with the document's persistence interface.","Because there are several ways to programmatically instruct the current application to print its active document to the default or to a designated printer, and because no single way is optimal for all applications, support for a \u201cPrint\u201d button is best provided (in this embodiment) by invoking the mechanism most appropriate to the current application according to the current application's type.","In its simplest form, this consists of first trying to find the active application in the ROT, specifying the target printer by setting the active application's ActivePrinter property, and invoking the active application's PrintOut method. If the active application is not found in the ROT, then the fallback consists of queuing the standard print-invocation keyboard sequence (i.e. Control key down, P key down, P key up, Control key up, CR key down, CR key up).","In a more sophisticated implementation, a table of applications is created which lists the mechanism most appropriate to each application type, i.e. Automation versus keyboard sequence, and exact application properties and methods to use, or exact keyboard sequence to send. Automation server applications are identified by their programmatic identifiers, while conventional applications are identified by their names. For example, Word is identified by its programmatic identifier \u201cWord.Application.x\u201d, while Notepad is identified by its name \u201cNotepad\u201d. It is straightforward to identify the foreground window (via the GetForegroundWindow SDK function) and extract the name of the corresponding active application from the window's title (via the GetWindowText SDK function).","The \u201cPrint\u201d button can be a physical momentary switch or it can be simulated via another interface on the printer (or FPD) such as a touch-sensitive display. In any case, when the user presses the print button, an event is relayed to a background application on the PC which invokes the corresponding printing function as described above. The background application may already be executing, i.e. awaiting events, or it may be activated by the user's act of pressing the \u201cPrint\u201d button. The button event can be relayed by the control software in the printer, via the printer's communications interface and its printer driver, and thence to the background application. Alternatively can be relayed via its own communications interface and driver, in which case the driver and the background application may be one and the same. For example, the print button can be provided in the form of a separate Universal Serial Bus (USB) device on the USB bus, but may share the physical USB connection between the printer (or FPD) and the PC.","In the preferred embodiment, the background application is capable of handling the \u201cPrint\u201d buttons of multiple devices. To allow it to distinguish multiple buttons, each button event in this embodiment uniquely identifies its originating button. An event may include a unique identifier associated with the printer in which the button is embedded, or a unique identifier associated with the button itself, retrieved from non-volatile storage attached to the button.","In cases where the target printer can be selected by setting the active server application's ActivePrinter property, the background application must know which printer name to specify. Since it may be difficult for the background application to know the name of the printer associated with a particular \u201cPrint\u201d button it is servicing, it is useful to allow the user to associate a printer with each button, indexed by the button's unique identifier. If a button is pressed which has no associated printer, then the background application can determine how many printers are configured on the PC. If there is only one printer, then the application has no need to specify a printer since the one printer must be the default printer. If there are several printers, then the application can prompt the user to select one, and can then record the association between the selected printer and the button. It is straightforward for the background application to enumerate the available printers using the EnumPrinters SDK function.","Various exemplary, non-limiting aspects of the invention are foreshadowed in the following numbered paragraphs:"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 24"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 27"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIGS. 35(","FIG. 33"],"i":["a","d"],"b":"35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIGS. 36 and 37","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 38","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 38"],"b":["45","45"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 40","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 41","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 42","FIG. 33"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 38"],"b":["49","49"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 45","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 46"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 47","FIG. 46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 48","FIG. 57"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 49","FIG. 48","FIG. 48"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 50","FIG. 46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0086"},"figref":["FIG. 51","FIG. 50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIG. 52","FIG. 46","FIG. 47"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 53","FIG. 46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0089"},"figref":["FIG. 54","FIG. 46"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 55","FIG. 46"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
