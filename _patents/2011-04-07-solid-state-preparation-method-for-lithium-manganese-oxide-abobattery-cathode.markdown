{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","The present disclosure relates generally to the field of electrochemical power sources and, more particularly, to rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion batteries using manganese-based materials as a positive electrode.","Perhaps the most popular battery chemistries that have hit the consumer market recently are lithium-based systems. Lithium batteries use high valence metal oxide materials, which are reduced during the electrochemical reaction. This reaction in rechargeable lithium and rechargeable lithium ion batteries must be fully reversible in order to have a commercially viable cell. These electrochemical systems include manganese-based lithium metal oxides configured in lithium, lithium ion, and lithium polymer electrochemical cells. Common reversible metal oxide materials used in lithium batteries include LiMnO, LiMnO, LiCoO, LiNiO, and LiNiCoO.","Today, rechargeable lithium batteries are used in portable electronic devices including cellular phones and laptop computers. Future uses of rechargeable lithium battery systems are targeted at applications related to electronic vehicles and pairing with fuel cells to produce high-energy systems with excellent pulse capabilities. Lithium batteries have the flexibility of being packaged into either cylindrical or prismatic cell designs; this feature makes them applicable to almost any portable electronic system where battery volume is a concern.","The benefits of lithium battery systems include high specific energy (Wh\/kg) and high energy density (Wh\/l). Lithium electrochemical systems produce a relatively high nominal voltage between 3.0 and 4.75 volts. Lithium electrochemical systems can operate between 3.0 and 4.35 volts or between 2.0 and 3.5 volts. Additionally, lithium electrochemical systems have excellent charge retention due to a low self-discharge rate.","Manganese dioxide (MnO) based materials are attractive for use as a cathode material in lithium electrochemical systems. MnO2 is attractive because of its high energy density and low material cost. MnOis an active material which creates a skeletal structure that allows lithium cations to fill vacancies and voids within the structure. Ideally, this structure does not change with cycling; altering of this crystal structure may cause capacity fading. Additionally, the MnOactive material exists in different forms. These forms include a lithiated spinel (LiMnO) and its different structures are denoted by \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03bb. In lithium electrochemical cells, the active material is bound to an aluminum current collector with either Teflon or pVdF mixed with conductive carbon. The conductive carbon serves as an aid for electron transfer.","Capacity fading is a major problem for rechargeable lithium cells. Capacity fading is the loss of cycle capacity in a cell over the life of an electrochemical system, limiting the practical number of cycles that may be used. In lithium battery systems, capacity fading is often attributed to the degradation of the active cathode material. This cyclic capacity loss is a result of both changes in composition and crystal structure of the active cathode material. Additionally, throughout the life of a cell, parasitic side reactions occur between chemical species of all cell components. Methods of reducing this effect include modifying the crystal structure and\/or composition of the active material.","Capacity fading associated with the cathode material has also been linked to the fracture of active material and the dissociation or disconnection of the fractured active material from the electrode. Fractures are caused by mechanical stress-strain of MnOcrystal structures during cycling of the cell. Stress-strain forces act on the crystal structures as a result of repeated phase transitions. These stress-strain forces are due to the insertion and extraction of lithium in the cathode lattice. This frequent conversion in geometry and dimension of the crystal lattice creates a significant mechanical strain on the cathode. This mechanical strain is believed to electrically disconnect active material from the electrode through fracture. Additional external forces including elevated temperatures also promote cathode fracture; and structural vibrations increase with temperature, resulting in the disconnection of the fractured active material from the electrode.","Another major cause of capacity fading in manganese-based cathodes is the dissolution of manganese into the electrolyte. Through a series of chemical reactions, manganese (Mn) is removed from the cathode and dissolved into the electrolyte, resulting in a decrease of active material in the cathode. Manganese dissolution is linked to reactions with the electrolyte and, more importantly, the impurities dissolved within the electrolyte. Many of these reactions are linked to the water content of the electrolyte and the presence of hydrofluoric acid (HF). The products of parasitic reactions are phase transitions of the MnOstructure, which results in the formation of MnOand MnO.","Manganese dioxide (MnO) provides a skeletal background for lithium intercalation during cycling of a lithium electrochemical cell. When fully charged, manganese particles have a meta-stable 4+ valence state. This meta-stable 4+ valence state allows for the attraction and intercalation of lithium cations into the lattice structure. As lithium cations fill the skeleton crystal structure during discharge, the crystal structure of the active material changes. Charging of the cell removes these lithium cations from the cathode, again altering the crystal structure. Ideally, this is a completely efficient and reversible process, but realistically, continuous crystal structure changes lead to phase transitions that can create problems. As a result of these phase changes, unwanted crystal structures develop that are either too stable for electrochemical reactions or block the insertion\/extraction paths of lithium cations into the cathode material. This general phenomenon is regarded as the major contributor to capacity fading.","MnOexists in several phases or crystal structures and are referred to by the following prefixes: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03bb. \u03b1-MnOis the most stable MnOstructure. \u03b1-MnOis one-dimensional and the lattice contains both one by one and two by two channels for lithium insertion\/extraction. \u03b2-MnOis a tetragonal structure with the lattice containing one by one channels for lithium insertion\/extraction. \u03b3-MnOis also one-dimensional, existing in both hexagonal or orthorhombic crystal structures with a lattice that contains one by two channels for lithium insertion\/extraction. Because of their stability \u03b1-MnO, \u03b2-MnO, and \u03b3-MnOare not considered rechargeable. However, cycling of lithium into the \u03b1-MnO, \u03b2-MnO, and \u03b3-MnOlattice can be achieved with rigid stoichiometric control.","Conventionally, \u03bb-MnOis considered the preferred MnObased cathode material for rechargeable lithium electrochemical systems. \u03bb-MnOis created through the delithiation of LiMnOABOspinel. The \u03bb-MnOcrystal structure is maintained through both the charge and discharge of the LiMnOspinel. The maintenance of the \u03bb-MnOstructure during insertion and extraction of lithium in the LiMnOspinel makes it an attractive couple with lithium for rechargeable electrochemical systems. The \u03bb-MnOcrystal structure is a three dimensional cubic array. This crystal structure promotes mechanical stability and adequate pathways for lithium insertion\/extraction. Degradation of the \u03bb-MnOcrystal structure forming \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3-MnOcrystals and other MnOphases reduces the capacity of the cathode material.","As lithium intercalates, the size and orientation of the crystal structures change. In LiMnOspinel materials, when 0.05<x<1, the crystal structure is cubic (\u03bb-MnO). When 1<x<1.8, the structure of LiMnO(no longer a ABOspinel) is tetragonal. Additionally, when x<0.05, phase transition to the more stable \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 MnOcan occur. Continued charge and discharge promotes the transformation of the cubic crystal structure to other cubic, tetragonal, and monoclinic phases. Tetragonal and monoclinic crystal structures may become inactive leading to the loss of active cathode material. Voltage control, maintaining 0.05<x<1, allows for the mitigation of the formation of unwanted crystal structures.","When the potential of the lithium\/LiMnOelectrochemical system is maintained between 3.0 and 4.25 volts, the cubic phase is maintained. When the potential of the system drops below 3.0 volts, the LiMnOcathode material undergoes a phase change from cubic to tetragonal. When the potential of the system increases above 4.25 volts, the LiMnOcathode material becomes stripped of the lithium component and undergoes a phase change from cubic (\u03bb-MnO) to the more stable \u03b1, \u03b2 and\/or \u03b3 MnO.","Other phase transitions that lead to capacity fading include the formation of MnOand MnO. The MnOand MnOformations result from the liberation of oxygen in the MnOand MnOstructures. The valence state of manganese in these structures is 3+ or less. This lower valence state creates a stable crystal structure that is not conducive to lithium intercalation and, therefore, not rechargeable. As more MnOand MnOare formed, less MnOand MnOremain and the usefulness of the cathode decreases.","Thus, one of the disadvantages of conventional lithium manganese-based ABOspinel materials is the limited cycle life and limited rate capability for lithium electrochemical systems. Furthermore, this problem is a major obstacle for rechargeable lithium battery technology. An additional limiting factor for lithium manganese-based ABOspinel materials is the time required to process the raw materials and synthesize the desired product; conventional methods require multiple mixing, grinding and calcining steps, which take a time period of days to complete.","The present disclosure resolves the aforementioned problems associated with conventional processes for preparing lithium manganese-based ABOspinel material. By introducing fluorine into the starting material mixture, the synthesis process time of lithium manganese-based ABOspinel materials is dramatically reduced. In contrast to conventional preparation methods, the addition of fluorine in the formulation and fabrication process reduces the processing time by at least an order of magnitude. While conventional preparation methods take from 48 to 72 hours, the preparation method according to the present disclosure may take less than 4 hours. In addition, the preparation method according to the present disclosure is performed at relatively low temperatures, affording better control and high yield rates by minimizing temperature gradients within the mixture during processing. Furthermore, the cycle life of the lithium cells fabricated using the present spinel material is significantly longer than cells fabricated using conventional lithium manganese-based ABOspinel materials.","According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a stable lithium manganese-based ABOspinel material is synthesized using a fluorine-modified process and produces a LiMnOcathode material that may be employed as a positive electrode for lithium and lithium ion rechargeable electrochemical cells and batteries. The general formula for the material is LiMnO(F), where x\u22481 and the reversible region for x for the Li\/LiMnOelectrochemical couple ranges from 0.05 to 1.9 and y ranges from 0.005 to 0.70.","In one embodiment, a method of preparing a fluorine-modified lithium manganese-based ABOspinel cathode material includes mixing a fluorine-containing lithium organic salt, a manganese compound, and a lithium compound to produce a homogenous mixture; and calcining the homogenous mixture for a time period no greater than 4 hours at a temperature of at least 350\u00b0 C.","Another embodiment of the present disclosure is a fluorine-modified lithium manganese-based ABOspinel cathode material prepared using the aforementioned process. In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a lithium electrochemical cell includes an anode and a cathode including the present fluorine-modified lithium manganese-based ABOspinel cathode material.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"sub":["x","2","4 "],"b":"100"},"Suitable fluorine-containing lithium organic salts include, but are not limited to, lithium trifluoroacetate (LiCFO), lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiCFSO), lithium perfluoroorganoacetate, and lithium perfluoroorganosulfonate.

In Step S, the mixture is then mixed in a random orbit mixer mill to ensure a homogeneous mixture of the raw materials. Alternatively, other suitable milling systems include stirred media mills and low amplitude vibration mills. Alternatively, step S can be removed from the process, if the raw materials are homogenously mixed during step S. For example, the materials can be homogenously mixed in a ball mill during step S.","In Step S, the mixture is calcined in a furnace at 600\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Alternatively, suitable calcination temperatures and calcinations times range from 350\u00b0 C. to 800\u00b0 C. (for from 1 to 4 hours), from 400\u00b0 C. to 600\u00b0 C.
