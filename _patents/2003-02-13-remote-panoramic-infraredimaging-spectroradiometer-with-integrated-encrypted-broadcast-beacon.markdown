{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, licensed, and used by or for the U.S. Government.","The following description relates in general to the fields of vibrational spectroscopy, spectroradiometry, and Mueller matrix photopolarimetry. In particular, this invention relates to the fusion in a single integrated device of a panoramic chemical imaging sensor that monitors a surrounding infrared panorama for absorption or emission spectra characteristic of various chemical species in order to detect the presence of a chemical cloud, together with a photopolarimeter communicator to broadcast an encrypted signal of its findings modulated and directed by elements that are shared with the chemical imaging sensor.","A variety of research projects are involved in design and development of systems for rapid and reliable detection of chemical and biological warfare agents in the field. One such effort, initiated by the U.S. Army in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Service Wide Area Detection (JSWAD) program, is PANSPEC (short for panoramic-imaging spectroradiometer). Various aspects of PANSPEC systems and designs are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,503 issued to Carrieri, on Jan. 13, 1998 (\u201c'503 patent\u201d), U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,710 issued to Carrieri, on May 19, 2000 (\u201c'710 patent\u201d) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,408 issued to Carrieri, et al., on May 14, 2002 (\u201c'408 patent\u201d). The '503, '710, and '408 patents are incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.","Spectral measurements of chemical clouds in the open environment require a sensor of adequate photosensitivity, spectral resolution, numerical aperture and throughput to produce a sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio for performing useful radiometric detections of such targets. Moreover, for such a device to be of practical value, it must withstand and compensate for extremes in weather, and be sufficiently robust to operate reliably in the field under a variety of adverse conditions.","In accordance with one aspect, a chemical imaging sensor collects and collimates middle infrared (MIR) radiance over an ambient-environment panoramic field of view (FOV), processes that radiance interferometrically via ultrahigh-speed solid-state birefringent photoelastic modulators (PEM), spatially images the modulated radiance onto a focal-plane array of detector elements, records the measured modulated radiance (i.e., the interferograms) and transforms the interferograms into their corresponding spectra. In accordance with another aspect, the data is processed in parallel using a Fourier transform to yield spectral information. In accordance with another aspect, the chemical imaging sensor analyzes the spectra for the presence of infrared absorption\/emission bands characteristic of one or more targeted analytes. In accordance with another aspect, the system performs the analysis via a neural network. In accordance with another aspect, the focal plane array detector provides a matrix of ndetector elements matched to the size and spatial resolution of the imaged panorama. In accordance with another aspect, spectral information is obtained for each detector element individually, and data from the imaged field as a whole is processed to yield information concerning movement of analytes in the FOV.","In accordance with another aspect, data concerning the analyte is photopolarimetrically relayed into the sensor's panoramic object space via a beacon modulated by a binary Mueller matrix encryption scheme. In accordance with another aspect, the beacon includes an infrared laser that is directed back, at least in part, through system optics shared with the interferometer, to provide an omnidirectional broadcast of the data. In accordance with another aspect, the photopolarimetrically-relayed data includes identity, location, and heading information for analytes. As an active photonics communicator, the sensor utilizes the same PEM optics comprising its passive interferometer component, but the middle PEM is driven in a distinctly different manner such that the instrument becomes a photopolarimeter to an integrated infrared laser continuous-wave beam source. The active photonics communicator, with its advantage of no moving parts and full electro-optical control, modulates the sensor's active carrier beam with encoded binary Mueller matrix elements by driving the middle PEM such that it alternately presents \u00bd and \u00bc waveplates to the active carrier beam. The modulated beam is then directed back through the system optics where it is projected out into the sensor's panoramic object space thus providing an omnidirectional communications capability for the identification and tracking of a chemical vapor threat detected by the interferometer at the focal plane array.","In accordance with another aspect, vignetting of images and stray light analyses are performed to improve image quality. In accordance with another aspect, compensation is provided to account for changes in ambient environment such as temperature, humidity and pressure. In one example, the compensation includes enclosing one or more elements of the system in an evacuated or partially evacuated chamber. In another example, the compensation includes providing a protective index-matched hydrophobic coating. In yet another example, the compensation includes modeling the fluctuations in environmental parameters and providing a compensation model.","In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention, as claimed, may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbered elements refer to like elements throughout. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied in methods and devices. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102"],"sub":"2-3 "},"System  includes a collector  to gather and direct light from a panorama within certain predefined ranges of azimuth and elevation. In the example of , the field of view is bounded by a polar angle of \u03b8=45 degrees and the panorama encompasses the entire surroundings, i.e., 360 degrees. In other embodiments of the invention different polar angles may limit the field of view but the azimuth angle will generally always span the full 360 degrees. Collector  includes a primary convex hyperboloid mirror  and a secondary concave hyperboloid mirror  aligned on a common vertical axis . Convex hyperboloid mirror  and secondary concave hyperboloid mirror  are separated such that the far foci of both mirrors are coincident.","The optical elements of the system  are housed within a protective chamber  which serves to isolate the sensor from dirt and dust and protect the optics from misalignment that may occur due to changes in pressure, temperature, humidity. The top portion of protective chamber  includes a hemispherical Germanium shell , which is optimized to minimize aberrations and facilitate the transmission of middle infrared radiance from the panorama. Germanium shell  may also include a thin protective index-matched hydrophobic coating  to protect system components from changes in ambient humidity.","Light (MIR) passing through Germanium shell  is reflected by primary convex hyperboloid mirror  to secondary concave hyperboloid mirror . Secondary concave hyperboloid mirror  reflects the light back in the direction of primary mirror  and through an axial opening  in primary mirror . Axial opening  may also include a system stop , such as an iris, to adjust the amount of light entering system . The light from axial opening  next passes through a collimator  which aligns the light rays in a direction parallel to vertical axis . Collimator  is a Schwarzchild collimator and includes a first spherical mirror  that reflects the light received from opening  to a second spherical mirror  that reflects collimated light back through an axial opening  of first spherical mirror . A correction lens may be included at axial opening .","The collimated light emerging from axial opening  proceeds downward in a direction parallel to the axis  to a series of optical elements that make up the shared interferometer\/photopolarimeter optics . Interferometer\/photopolarimeter  is comprised of a first linear polarizer  having successive surfaces P, a first photo-elastic modulator PEM , having successive surfaces M, a second PEM  having successive surfaces M, a third PEM  having successive surfaces M, and a second polarizer  having successive surfaces P, which acts as a linear polarizer when the apparatus operates in the passive interferometer mode.","Interferometer\/photopolarimeter  operates on the principle of stress- birefringence. In the embodiment of , interferometer\/photopolarimeter  is entirely solid state with no motors, servo mechanisms or rotating or vibrating optical elements, and can operate at substantially greater speed and precision than mechanically-based devices which is essential in order to detect, identify and track rapidly moving and potentially lethal chemical clouds in sufficient time to respond effectively. Moreover, solid-state construction is less susceptible to problems in the field than devices that have moving parts. The PEMs , , and  in the embodiment of  are made of flat, cleaved, ZnSe crystals (ZnSe is the most developed PEM material in the middle infrared range), as shown in ) and (), and specified in Table 1 as surfaces \u2013. ZnSe crystals are stress birefringent materials. In a stress birefringent crystal such as ZnSe, the index of refraction in one plane is changed in response to a mechanical stress directed along that plane while the index of refraction in an orthogonal plane remains unchanged. Linear polarized waves with a polarization plane parallel to the plane in which the index of refraction is altered will be retarded when the crystal is compressed, and will be advanced when the material is relaxed. Linear polarized waves with a polarization plane orthogonal to the contraction direction are not influenced. Piezoelectric transducers bonded to opposite, parallel, planar surfaces of the ZnSe crystal ends introduce the mechanical stresses in PEMs , , and . Application of a time varying periodic electric field to the piezoelectric transducers causes the crystals to compress-then-relax, thereby oscillating the refractive index quantity in the crystal plane along its extraordinary axis, further causing an oscillating phase contrast in the electric field traversing that direction along the extraordinary axis relative to an orthogonal field component traveling concurrently along the ordinary axis of the crystal.","All optics of interferometer\/photopolarimeter  are antireflection-coated to yield MIR transmissions exceeding 0.95. In this example, PEMs ,  and  are commercially available ZnSe modulators that produce spectra approximately 20 cm, (wavenumbers) in resolution, a generally adequate resolution to detect the fundamentally broad MIR vibration bands of relatively large nerve agent molecules. The birefringence quantity in the modulating crystals of the interferometer is directly proportional to resolution of its spectral content from the interferogram output. Hence, to measure detail in the more narrow structural bands of chemical warfare agent compounds of lesser molecular weight (i.e., the blood agents HCN, CNCI, . . . etc) either the interferometer must accommodate additional ZnSe PEMs for added birefringence, or crystalline materials with a stronger birefringence property (i.e., increased phase retardation when stressed) need to replace the ZnSe windows.","The crystal elements of PEMs ,  and  are compressed-then-relaxed at their natural mechanical resonance frequency \u03c9 by the piezoelectric transducer elements T. This action causes an oscillating phase difference (due to relative optical path differences) in two mutually coherent sets of infrared electromagnetic field waves that are perpendicular to each other. One electric field component is made to vibrate along the crystal's \u201cfast\u201d axis (ordinary component, E) whereupon its phase character is constant on transmission through the crystal. The other, perpendicular, component lies along the crystal's \u201cslow\u201d axis (extraordinary component, E) and possesses an oscillating retardation or phase delay, \u03b4 in response to the mechanical compressions induced by the piezoelectric transducer elements T. Accordingly, \u03b4=67 cos \u03c9t, where \u03b4is the maximum amplitude of phase retardation induced by the ZnSe crystal via transducer element T and \u03c9 is the natural mechanical resonance frequency of the crystal. These orthogonal components combine at the back surface of each crystal, sweeping a continuum of polarization states in the electric field vector at its exit boundary (modulating Stokes vector), and thereby producing a temporal (t) intensity output signal by the interferometer optical system in the functional form of I(\u03bd,t:\u03c9,\u03c9,\u03c9)\u221d|E+E|called an interferogram. This interferogram data record is modulated at the MIR energy (\u03bd) with fundamental and overtone frequencies (\u03c9,\u03c9,\u03c9) of the respective driven optics of PEMs ,  and . This form of modulation is a manifestation of the piezoelectric tensor T operating on opposite ends of the PEM crystals called stress birefringence: a generator of the interferogram voltage waveform I. PEM interferometry is analogous to Michelson interferometry, however, in PEM interferometry, phase retardation is accomplished electro-optically via stress-birefringent crystals whereas Michelson interferometry requires an oscillating mirror or inertial spinning prism phase-shifter.","After the incident light has passed through the various elements of the shared interferometer\/photopolarimeter optics  it is focused by imager  onto a focal plane array  of photo detectors having a surface FPA. Imager  includes four lenses arranged in a doublet with a first lens  having successive surfaces L, a second lens  having successive surfaces L, a third lens  having successive surfaces L, and a fourth lens  having successive surfaces L. The focal plane array  is made from mercury- cadmium-tellurium (HgCdTe) pixel detector elements. The doublet lenses of imager  are made from zinc selenium germanium ZnSeGe optimized for minimum aberration and maximum resolution of a distant chemical cloud object imaged from panoramic object space.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 2(","i":["a","b"],"b":["2","129","136","142","148","130","158","162","162","162","180","182","184","162","100","62","100","162","180"],"sup":"2 "},"These interferogram data records are simultaneously analyzed at  into infrared spectra and compared with known data by a pattern recognition operation  multiplexed to this architecture. The pattern recognition operation  performs pattern recognition of absorption or emission band moieties from one or a group of pixels as the chemical cloud intercepts, proceeds through, and exits the sensor FOV. In one embodiment the pattern recognition operation  comprises a neural network such as the neural network system described in the '408 patent, incorporated herein by reference.","Following an absorption\/emission vibrational spectrum match by the pattern recognition operation  a signal such as an alarm  is provided to alert users of the presence of a chemical or biological hazard. Post-processing functions such as a spatial mapping of the chemical gas and instructions on dealing with toxic properties associated with the detected chemical may also be provided.","The imager  and focal plane array  illustrated in  are also specified as lens surfaces - in Table 1, with the focal plane array surface FPAlying just beyond lens surface . These parameters have been optimized based on the following: (I) input fields \u03b8={(0, \u00b137\u00b0), (0, \u00b142\u00b0), . . .

A major performance metric of the TA is peak Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) over the MIR wavelengths of 8\u201312 \u03bcm. In performing a TA, variances are placed on optimized parameters defining the geometry of system optics, and on irregularities in their decentration and indices of refraction. The fabrication parameters under test include: radius of curvature, thickness, and conic constant; while the alignment parameters include: lateral translation, air space, tilt, spin and roll. Thickness of back focus (i.e., location of the focal plane array, surface , Table 1) was the compensator surface used in this TA. This compensator surface parameter is a sort of \u2018relief valve\u2019 diagnostic of the TA, easing overly constraining tolerances on the critical optics most sensitive to change in the MTF metric. Thus, a small air gap between surface  of lens  and focal plane array  can be provided in the final assembly stage of manufacturing the sensor of . Variances on all of the general parameters mentioned above were loosely set in an initial run of the TA, so as to insure that the optical system could be manufactured within these relatively loose specifications. The initial TA run produced a list of worst offender optics, i.e., the optics with perturbations that contribute most to image degradation and negative system performance. In succeeding TA trial runs, variances on these worst offender optics were systematically tightened (usually halved) ad fin, until the MTF metric set in the TA (set to yield an acceptable image quality) was approached and met, and in some cases, exceeded.","The TA initially proceeded along these lines of assigned variances on all single and paired optics: \u00b10.1% radius of curvature, \u00b10.001 inch on thickness and airspace, \u00b110.1% conic constant, \u00bc wave surface error, \u00b10.001 inch vertical-horizontal decentration, \u00b10.001 inch back focal distance, and \u00b150 arc-second vertical-horizontal tilt. Under the above tolerances, a sensitivity test was performed for: a test wavelength of 10.6 \u03bcm; a MTF nominal spatial frequency test value of 40 line-pairs per millimeter; a sampling of conjugate image rays over a 128\u00d7128 grid of averaged tangential and sagittal rays launched from and over the EP; and a sum total of 20 Monte Carlo simulations. (A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate image performance by simultaneously perturbing all optics tagged for this TA.) The sensitivity resulted in an image performance of mean MTF=0.37\u00b10.012 (standard deviation) for the following five worst offender optics: [30, TFRN, 0.025]; [32, TFRN, 1.000]; [2, TSTY, \u22120.025]; [2, TSTY, +0.025]; [30, TSTX, 0.100]; where the entries in brackets are the optic surface number of Table 1, the tolerance operand (TFRN=curvature in fringes, TSTY[X]=horizontal[vertical] tilt in degree), and the tolerance quantity, respectively. Tightest tolerances (of most concern to an optics fabricator) appeared to reside in curvature and tilt of the imager doublets (\u00b11 fringe, \u00b10.100\u00b0), tilt of the collector Ge dome (\u00b10.025 deg), and tilt of the collector-collimator conic mirrors (\u00b10.025\u00b0), in that order. Clear panoramic imagery may be expected, provided that fabrication and mounting specifications are maintained or exceeded. Fabricating the system to less critical specifications on the remainder optics would then follow.","Operating the system  continuously in the open atmosphere introduces several challenges regarding the maintenance of good image performance. They include diurnal swings of refractive index in ZnSe and Ge optics and the expansion\/contraction of optical materials (and their mounts) as environmental pressure and temperature states fluctuate. These phenomena can be modeled in a manner similar to the tolerance-sensitivity analysis mentioned above. However, if the inner volume from dome  to focal plane array  is placed in enclosure  that provides a stable atmosphere, partial vacuum or vacuum, then undesired image-degrading effects brought on by changing atmospheric conditions may be improved. Finally, a thin protective index-matched hydrophobic coating  on the outside surface of dome  will improve operation in an ambient environment of high relative humidity.","Various system deficiencies are not well modeled by the computer sequential ray- tracing (SRT) procedure used to design the system parameters of Table 1. For example, the SRT method ignores rays that undergo total internal reflection (TIR); where a ray totally reflects at a surface boundary separating more-dense and less-dense media, provided that ray is incident to the surface from the more-dense side and beyond a critical angle. Generally, the SRT method is invalid for tracking multiple ray-paths, as when a ray splits and undergoes multiple reflections at an interface whereby that surface, and possibly several other surfaces of the optical system, become illuminated in a nonsequential order. Moreover, SRT cannot be applied to the problem of diffuse scattering and blackbody (or colored body) emittance, as rays tend to liberate from an optically rough irradiation zone in a uniform Lambertian-like angular distribution. The image performance of an optical system is potentially compromised by such phenomena. Therefore, nonsequential ray paths traversing the system must be tracked for the benefit of analyzing stray light (i.e., the indirect and undesired scattering\/emission of light) and ghost imaging (via TIR, scattering, and\/or multiple reflections from PEM windows, polarizer plates, and lens surface components) at its focal plane array . Baffle structures to intercept stray light may be positioned in optical systems based on nonsequential ray-tracing (NSRT) analysis and identification of stray light source paths. Nonsequential ray-tracing analysis can also identify optical surfaces requiring a high transmission (antireflection) coating layer(s) that would effectively attenuate or eliminate ghost images at or in the neighborhood of the image plane.","A nonsequential ray-tracing model was used to globally track rays undergoing TIR, multiply reflections, and\/or diffuse scattering in this model design.  illustrates an example of the nonsequential ray-tracing model system. The sequential optical surfaces \u2013 of Table 1 were converted into a nonsequential ray-tracing optical components group. Next, cylindrical enclosure  was added to the model enclosing these interferometer-imager-focal plane array nonsequential ray-tracing receiver optical elements as described above. Enclosure  was modeled to include a reflective Lambertian inner surface (a value of 0.55 was used for the scatter function with a selection of 5 scattered rays), 18.5 mm inner radius, and 520 mm length starting at surface  and extending just beyond the focal plane array , surface , Table 1. A disk illumination source  was included in the model at the opposite end of enclosure  from focal plane array , aligned on axis and directing collimated light down the full volume of the enclosure encompassing the nonsequential ray-tracing receiver optics group. Disk illumination source  simulates the collimation function of Schwarzchild optics, surface \u2013, Table 1). Finally, a nonsequential ray-tracing absorbing detector of 2.25 mmsurface area and composed of 100\u00d7100 pixel elements was positioned at the exact focal plane array location to model the focal plane array .","In the simulation, 10random rays were traced through the model system.  shows tracking of 5 such random rays launched from the disk illumination source through the linear interferometer-imager-focal plane array optical system. In this illustration, TIR occurs between the polarizing element surfaces - as well as at the final lens surface  of lens , where the latter TIR ray gets scattered at the wall of enclosure  and eventually exits the enclosure  to the left. Two results of tracing 10random rays from disk source to nonsequential ray-tracing detector are shown in ) and (). The disk source is unobstructed in ), while ) shows the effect of eclipsing the illumination source with an obstacle of diameter equal to that of the Schwarzchild collimator's secondary spherical mirror, surface  of Table 1. This obscuration blocks all direct ray-paths from illumination source  to focal plane array . A comparison between ) and ) indicates that the system  is practically free of stray light. Thus, although a stray-light baffle structure could be included it should not be needed.","Ghost images appear primarily as multiple-path light reflections by one or several of the doublet lens surfaces \u2013, Table 1. With two-layered antireflection coatings placed on all imager lens surfaces, a ghost image analysis was conducted on the receiver nonsequential ray-tracing interferometer-imager-focal plane array optical group. A nearest ghost image of a real surface object (with pupil), with appreciable intensity, was found to be present at a location of \u221247.35 mm (left, on-axis) from the focal plane array . This is sufficiently removed from the focal plane array , and provides positive assurance that the system specified in Table 1 is removed of ghost imaging interference.","The photonics communication feature or active broadcast beacon of the system  enables rapid communication of sensor data to a variety of receivers. Information is optically transmitted to all points in the panorama that are within reasonable range in the following manner. A thin beam of collimated light exiting laser  is first expanded at telescopic lens system - to increase the diameter of the laser beam to that of the collimated radiant beam (directed by the Schwarzchid collimation optics to the FPA, in the spectroradiometer mode). That collimated beam is directed along the axis  to polarizer . The polarizer  linearly polarizes the collimated beam received along the axis  and directs it upward along the axis  to the PEM . As the collimated light passes through PEM  its amplitude and phase is changed by modulation provided by the controller  to PEM  so that the instrument as shown in ) now acts as a photopolarimeter.","As a photopolarimeter, the end PEMs  and  (Mand M) modulate in exactly the same way as when the system operates in its passive interferometer mode, while the middle PEM optic =(\u03bb\/2|\u03bb\/4) is now driven into alternate half-waveplate  (\u03bb\/2) and quarter-waveplate (\u03bb\/4) states. The particular photopolarimeter configuration of , with optical elements of order [P, M|M, P], as they are fixed in that relative orientation, produces a polarogram that carries 8 of 16 Mueller matrix elements of  in the laser beam exiting the dome . (This waveform is similar to the interferogram data records of the ambient MIR radiant field produced at the focal plane array , when the device operates as a passive spectroradiometer). Specifically, four exact orientations of the end paired-optics of ) produce the matrix elements  as depicted in Tables 3\u20136, and described as follows.","A number of different orientations of the axes of the optical elements of combined interferometer\/photopolarimeter  are possible. The particular orientation will determine which elements of the Muller matrix are used for photopolarimeter communication. Four cases (A, B, C, and D) are examined in Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6. For example, in Table 3 (case A), orientations of the photopolarimeter optics of polarizer , PEM , PEM  and polarizer  are vertical, \u221245\u00b0, +45\u00b0, and vertical, respectively, relative to optical axis . In this configuration communication takes place over the Mmatrix element. In Table 4 orientations of those same elements are vertical, \u221245\u00b0, vertical, and \u221245\u00b0, enabling binary communications over the  and  elements. Tables 5 and 6 likewise examine two other possible orientations.","In one embodiment, the laser  of system  is of the waveguide cavity design variety, producing a continuous-wave COsource beam operating on the (hot) P20 line at 10.6 \u03bcm wavelength, 10-50 watts beam power. This waveguide laser source was chosen because the technology is mature (high beam spatial mode stability and relatively short coherence length) and beam power is sufficiently large (the beam is made to spread over a rather large- volume FOV) so that long-range detection is made possible over a wide solid angle in panoramic object space. (Along with beam intensity, range at which the beacon light is detected depends on atmospheric transmission, infrared sensitivity of the detector element used in the remote receiver, gain of that detector's amplifiers and other electronics factors.) Other laser sources may also be employed. For example, an infrared laser based on solid-state diode technology, can replace the waveguide COsystem with less bulk, cooling requirements, and power consumption. However, range of the beacon will be reduced because of reduced beam intensity available for transmission.

I(\u03c9, (\u03c9) is the polarogram's Fourier expansion representing primary circular frequencies (\u03c9, \u03c9) of Mand M, respectively, and their overtones (n\u03c9, m\u03c9). It is referred to as the ac component of the polarogram. The amplitude coefficient of each frequency component of order two or less in I(\u03c9, \u03c9) is C, as these dominant harmonics are grouped in the first summation term to the right in Equation 6. These terms comprise a zero, product of two (zero and first order coefficients), and product of three (zero, first and second order coefficients) Bessel function factors whose arguments have a fixed retardation \u03c9=2.404 rad, and a factor that is one of eight Mueller matrix elements \u03c8of the waveplates =(\u03bb\/2|\u03bb\/4). All higher harmonics beyond second order are grouped in the second summation term to the right in Equation 6. This equation, therefore, represents an infinite series expansion in terms of all primary and overtone modulation frequencies, namely, the sums and differences of all integral multiples of the frequencies of PEMs  and , which can range between 10\u2013100 KHz for ZnSe, and are typically offset \u02dc2 KHz. Those frequencies in I(\u03c9, \u03c9) that are 2order (in C) and below are locked into as the dominant intensities of the Fourier components. In other words, the second summation of Equation 6 is dropped, since these harmonics monotonically reduce intensity of the Mueller matrix coefficients, tagged by their respective PEM overtones, below signal-to-noise levels of those HgCdTe pixel elements comprising the focal plane array . Determination of the Mueller elements of Equations 2 and 3 is thus equivalent to the measurement of those amplitudes of the corresponding frequency components of Equation 6 that lock into their respective matrix elements as shown in Tables 3-6. In one example, this measurement is accomplished with an electronic circuit of analog multipliers and filters. Digital signal processing may also be used in other examples. The circuit will accept sum and difference reference modulation frequencies, one at the driving frequency and the other at twice the driving frequency of Mand M. For example, to generate reference frequency (2\u03c9+\u03c9) necessary for lock-in measurement of the [3,4] element of , Table 4, both 2\u03c9and \u03c9signals from the PEM controller  (cos 2\u03c9t and cos \u03c9t) are input to a multiplier circuit, which generates an output of \u00bd{cos(2\u03c9\u2212\u03c9)t+cos(2\u03c9+\u03c9)t}. A high-Q filter located at the output end of this multiplier circuit will subsequently transmit the desired overtone while suppressing the other.","A complete set of primary and overtone frequencies shown in Tables 3-6 is generated in this manner, from combinations of \u03c9, \u03c9, 2\u03c9, and 2\u03c9outputs by the multiplier circuit. These reference frequency waveforms are input to their respective lock-in amplification (LIA) circuit channels, one per reference frequency with a total of eight LIA circuits. The other LIA circuit input is the amplified polarogram signal (Equation 6), as detected from the active laser carrier beam, via a remote receiver. The LIA multiplies this polarogram data record together with all individual reference frequencies (see above), producing a voltage output signal that is proportional to the amplitude of the polarogram, at that particular reference frequency, times a phase factor. This signal is proportional to the binary Mueller matrix elements  as shown in Tables 3\u20136 (with proportionality constant C). It is these binary elemental signals from which decoding of the source beam encryption is established. In particular, it is the binary states of the fourth-quadrant elements [\u22121,0], [0,\u22121], [0,1], and [\u22121,0] that are of interest here for beam encoding purposes.","An optical receiver staring at, and within the FOV of the photopolarimeter system, is thereby capable of measuring this encryption if properly equipped with the appropriate telescope, infrared detector, amplifier, and phase-sensitive electronics as described above. For example, if the system optics [P, M|M, P] are orientated as [+45\u00b0, vertical | vertical, \u221245\u00b0] (Table 5) and a remote aircraft, lying within its FOV and staring at the beacon, locks into element [\u22121,0] and its compliment element [0,\u22121].","After a focal plane array 162 pixel group reveals spectral identification of a noxious vapor target over timeframe \u03c4, the system changes into its photonics communications mode and transmits a binary code in its laser carrier beam through the one or more Mueller matrix channels. For example in Table 5 (Case C) configuration, a communications would take place over the 2\u03c9\u22122\u03c9channel (the  measurement). A properly encrypted binary sequence gathered by a suitable receiver will decode data concerning the analyte and its movement. This data may include the heading of the vapor cloud by encoding those coordinates in pixels of the focal plane array  that produced the analyte spectrum\u2014via the interferometer in the passive spectroscopy measurement timeframe \u03c4. Physical properties of the cloud analyte such as molecular weight, nomenclature, toxicity, . . . etc, can follow in some encoded sequence of  bits. In addition, in the example in Table 5, a simultaneous conformation of these data bits would reside over the complimentary channel \u03c9+2\u03c9(the measurement) and serve, for instance, as a check for parity errors in the encryption.","The system of the present invention provides a simple lens configuration with good image performance for spectroscopic operation and in which practical tolerances of optics, vignetting, ghost imaging, and stray light were analyzed for the benefit of preserving that good image quality for continuous operations of long duration. To maintain good image performance as the sensor operates continually in an environment of changing pressure and temperature the sensor may be enclosed within a cylindrical sleeve, encompassing internal optics and structural supports, and placing the cylindrical volume under a vacuum, partial vacuum or stable pressure and equipped with temperature stabilizing elements to provide heating and cooling as necessary. As an active photonics communicator, the beacon facilitates an omnidirectional alert of conditions presented by a chemical vapor threat. The location and heading of that threat may be communicated into the environment over a wide-angle field-of- view via a carrier beam such as a laser, modulated with binary encrypted Mueller matrix-element encoding by a photopolarimeter comprising one or more photoelastic modulator elements.","A number of embodiments of the invention defined by the following claims have been described.
