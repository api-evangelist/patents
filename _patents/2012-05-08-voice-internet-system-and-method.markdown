Field","The present disclosure generally relates to voice activated Web based infrastructure (Speech Portal) which accepts spoken input from a variety of devices, including desktop and laptop computers, tablets, smart phones, standard mobile phones, and ordinary hard-wired telephones.","2. Description of Related Art","Web browsing is a term used to define a method of user navigation through a series of internet based content. The content may take the form of still images, moving images, video or audio to name a few. Web browsing typically is accomplished by a user through a manual process of pointing a cursor from a computer \u201cmouse\u201d and clicking on a graphical user element. The user may also tap a screen to browse. The result of clicking or tapping an element is for a web page to be rendered on a display to the user, such as a still image, moving image, video or audio.","Voice recognition is a term used to define a method of controlling a computer by use of an audio signal, namely human speech. A voice recognizer records digital samples of the speech signal, processes the digital samples, and maps the characteristics of the processed digital samples to a known template is mapped to an event or action. For example, a voice recognizer may translate the word \u201ccall\u201d into a transmission on a cellular phone. The word \u201ccall\u201d can be defined as a CallWord.","Before domain names, there were only IP addresses. And before CallWords there were only phone numbers. A CallWord performs similar functionality as a domain name. It makes it easier for users to remember how to place a call or initiate computer actions. The caller only needs to speak the CallWord of the person or business they want to get connected instead of having to remember, look up or dial a phone number. Acquiring a CallWord is similar to acquiring an internet domain name. The registrant visits a registration portal, searches to see if the CallWord they want is available and if it is, completes the registration by paying a fee. Then the registrant may login and access a website to configure the CallWords.","Web browsing may be accomplished through use of a voice recognition front-end processor. A series of web pages may be navigated by using speech instead of clicking or tapping a graphical user element. The navigation is limited by the stored templates.","There exists a need for a speech based navigation scheme to be dynamic such that a first user may create a custom template or \u201cCallWord\u201d which can be subsequently used by other users to navigate a series of web pages.","There also exists a need for an interactive rendering of images, moving images, video, or audio based on a speech based navigation scheme wherein a user may be asked to speak a CallWord based on a specific web page.","There also exists a need to allow our users to navigate pages that are enabled by content providers with a unique visual interface that eliminates confusion with recovery prompts by allowing them to see in a visual manner what all their choices are at every level.","Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by using a voice activated Web based infrastructure that accepts spoken input from a variety of devices.","In one embodiment, a method of directing an internet browsing session comprises activating a first web page by a user, establishing an audio overlay control channel, rendering a user interaction control layer, rendering a first host audio content based on the first active web page, activating a second web page by a user based selection of an action in the user interaction control layer, and rendering a second host audio content based on the second activated web page.","In another embodiment, a method of establishing an internet based connection comprises activating a first web page by a user, rendering a first multimedia content based on the first activated web page, rendering a first host command list based on the first activated web page, activating a second web page by a recognized speech utterance, wherein the recognized speech utterance is based on the first host command list, and rendering a second multimedia content based on the second activated web page.","Voice Internet\u2014Voice Activated Web System","The Voice Internet is a system and method is that is comprised of an integrated suite of telephonic, internet, financial and speech-activated applications which marry the ubiquity of voice driven communications with the distribution and interactive capabilities of the Internet.","The infrastructure and user tools provide end users with a new, integrated voice and visual experience while accessing the Internet, creating a de facto hybrid, unified media blending content delivery over Internet Protocol (IP), telephony (both traditional and Voice Over Internet Protocol\u2014VoIP), and even terrestrial and satellite radio. These interactive voice controls include interactive recorded prompts, grammars and voice activated Web Page states.","The purpose behind TVI is to introduce an alternative user experience to Internet browsing and navigation, leveraging voice-driven commands and speech prompts in lieu of mouse clicks, touch screens or other forms of interface devices and methods. All of the technology can be accessed via landlines or mobile phones, mobile applications on smart phones and tablets, and with VoIP clients from an Internet connected computer equipped with a microphone (either built-in or external) and speakers.","The system is essentially a collection of interlinked menus and speech driven technology applications that were designed to be ultimately configured by the systems users using SAAS web configuration tools.","The system is departmentalized as follows in this document\n\n","Voice Internet Services can be accessed through a series of voice portals by dialing into it including the use of 800-555-5555, or by accessing with a smart phone application or by visiting a web portal that is supported by a Voice Internet VoIP client.","Voice Internet's system is comprised of the following components:\n\n","The system was designed to provide a network of interlinked entry points, exit points, routing applications, automated actions and monetization processes that form a contained financial and communications ecosystem. Voice Internet participants can financially benefit by use of our system.  offers a top level perspective view of the system.","CallWords\u2014Speech DNS Registrar","CallWords are the main control mechanism and navigation points of the Voice Internet system. They are essentially a unique, user designated \u201ckeyword,\u201d short phrase or Voice Internet domain name, registered by a user\/advertiser (individual or business entity) that is spoken by a caller to trigger a specific event in TVI's online speech portal. CallWords are available both on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis as well as on a local, regional and national level to enable TVI to monetize the use of specific keywords or phrases through different advertisers if they do not elect to bid for exclusive use of a word on a national level. Once a keyword, short phrase or Voice Internet domain name is set up, a caller simply places a phone call to a designated number (which may be either a local call or a toll-free call, depending on what the advertising party has chosen) and is connected to a voice activated utility application. Depending on what action the CallWord is designed to trigger, the end user may have the option of: requesting that a paperless coupon be emailed; being connected to a designated phone number provided by the advertiser; being forwarded to an automated survey; or virtually any other automated or human-driven interaction that the advertiser might want. Users with Web access utilizing CallWords can even initiate a Web page transfer in which the advertiser's Website or other designated Internet domain loads automatically within the framework of the Voice Internet portal, thus requiring no additional input from the user aside from voice commands.  shows an exemplary embodiment of an Internet based portal display of a CallWords product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0107"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The CallWord can be either registered as a primary top-level primary listing, or as a sub-domain CallWord. When a caller enters the CallWords portal and speaks the CallWord registered by the user, the system automatically makes the connection, transfers to a hosted speech application or invokes an action, eliminating the need for the user to know, look up or remember telephone numbers or other access computer access points.","CallWords are a form of Voice Enabled Domain Names. They are essentially a word or a sequence of words that are placed into a specific directory and are registered to one unique user. The user is able to configure the word to perform an action. When a visitor or caller speaks the word, the action assigned to it is initiated and will follow the configuration assigned to the action the CallWord was pointed to. CallWords are designed to allow users of Voice Internet to register words that can place calls or perform specific actions. NOTE: Although one of the functions that CallWords delivers is similar to a voice dialer, the concept of CallWords provides users many other options. The notion of having a permanent registration of a spoken utterance capable of initiating multiple actions and be publically available is an advantageous feature of the present invention.","Before domain names, there were only IP addresses. And before CallWords there were only phone numbers. A CallWord performs the same functionality as a domain name. It makes it easier for users to remember how to place a call or initiate computer actions. The caller only needs to speak the CallWord of the person or business they want to get connected instead of having to remember, look up or dial a phone number. Getting a CallWord is very much like getting an internet domain name. The registrant visits a registration portal, searches to see if the CallWord they want is available and if it is, completes the registration by paying a fee. Then the registrant may login and access a website to configure the CallWords.","In an exemplary embodiment, a CallWord may be registered and configured as follows:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, from any phone, a caller may dial an access number (800-555-5555) to the voice portal. The user then navigates to the appropriate directory and speaks the CallWord they wish to invoke. In an exemplary embodiment, a user may access a CallWord from a mobile phone (e.g. Android or iPhone) as shown in  and as described in the following procedure:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, a user may access a CallWord from a computer with a Voice Internet VoIP client installed as shown in  and as described in the following procedure:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, a CallWord is added to Voice Internet's System as shown in  and as described in the following procedure:\n\n","In an exemplary embodiment, a call is completed with a CallWord as shown in  and as described in the following procedure:\n\n","A CallWord may also be configured to initiate many actions other than a call connection.","An action may consist of an initiated phone call that forms a communication connection between the user and another party.\n\n","Voice Activated Coupon Delivery is a concept which leverages the popularity of discounts among consumers with the ease of a phone call, delivering a highly targeted potential customer to an advertiser which maximizes the efficiency from a marketing standpoint. This component associates an end user's caller identification and user profile in order to immediately deliver requested information or to purchase a certificate over the phone; if the caller has a known user profile which is detected by the system, the system will enable the caller to speak a CallWord and request that an email be sent to them; and if an email is delivered to the caller, it contains a link to a Website or specific Internet landing page which enables the advertiser to track the identity of the requesting party. In the event that a caller does not have an existing Voice Internet user account, they are transferred to a live call center where an account is established (e.g. only an email and phone number may be required) in order to process the purchase. An exemplary embodiment of a voice activated coupon delivery system is shown in .","These are special use CallWords designed to allow a user to say it to fetch a deal coupon to their computer or mobile device or push a web page or document to another person, computer or mobile device.","The same underlying technology of our system will be deployed in a manner to make this function work.","There are several iterations of the technology.","In all cases, it is required that the user has an account in the system and has either downloaded our VoIP client, mobile application or has registered and verified their name, email address and phone number with our system and that this information is readily available to us at the time the request comes in.","For example, a radio host can say on air that callers should call in with their phones and say \u201c\u201d CallWord to get the deal information emailed to them. Or if they have the mobile application they access the \u201cdeal\u201d category and say the CallWord of the deal they want. Finally, a request can be made from a computer that has the VI VoIP Voice toolbar installed by selecting the deal category and saying the appropriate CallWord.","In an exemplary embodiment, a deal is fetched using a CallWord as shown in  and as described in the following procedure:\n\n","If instead of saying the name of a company the user says \u201cgo to\u201d or \u201cgo to\u201d followed by the name of a recognized city or category (e.g.: \u201cLos Angeles\u201d or \u201cTravel\u201d), the main portal application will transfer control to another speech application that will provide directory service facilities for the requested category. From there, the user can select the person or company they'd like to call or the action to be taken.","This GoTo \u201cDomain\u201d strategy modeled after the .com and .net Internet domains, eliminates the barrier of oversaturated grammars, enabling Call Words to populate millions of utterances while maintaining an extremely high degree of accuracy.","Main Portal","Calls to the main portal are services by a suite of 3 speech applications:\n\n","As was previously described, this application responds to callers that dial 800-555-5555 or enters the portal on a VoIP client, and serves as the entry point for accessing both the public voice extranet, the private voice intranet, or the Voice Internet Web.","The following dialog illustrates the interaction between a caller and the application when the user responds to the main prompt with the name of a company that has registered a top-level CallWord:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0183"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"(call arrives from 800-555-5555) or from VoIP Client on computer or"},{"entry":"mobile device"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["System","Welcome to call words.

The customer could also have configured their endpoint to transfer control from the main portal speech application to an auto attendant, or otherspeech application. Or Scenario ) The customer has chosen to be part of a market search action.","Also note that instead of responding with a recognized top-level CallWord, the caller could have also chosen to respond with \u201cmain menu\u201d or \u201cgo to shortcuts\u201d to access 2level directory services, or \u201clogin\u201d to authenticate themselves to the system and access their personal assistant. These scenarios are presented in later sections.","The dialog flow corresponding to the main portal application is illustrated in : The main purpose of this application is to provide direct access to top-level or to serve as a gateway to other speech applications or actions by supporting \u201ctransfer to different directory\u201d commands.","The grammar associated with this dialog, not counting confirmation grammars and commands, is one that supports a choice of \u201cCall Words\u201d (utterances) that have been purchased by CallWords customers. This grammar, which is relatively simple architecturally (basically a large <one-of> in SRGS terms), is automatically updated whenever a new or existing CallWords service customer purchases a new CallWord to associate with their account.","In practice, two grammar resources will be used to process CallWord recognition:\n\n","This approach allows leverages speech engine grammar caching to achieve the best recognition performance possible, while still allowing new CallWords to be instantly deployed. Each night at 3 A.M., newly registered CallWords will be automatically merged into the primary static grammar, precompiled, and redeployed.","Note that the web-based interface that customers use to register new CallWords with the system are subjected to both lexical analysis (to avoid CallWord duplication) and phonetic analysis (to avoid adding ambiguity to the system by allowing new CallWords that are phonetically \u201cclose\u201d to existing CallWords). Only new CallWords that pass these two tests will be added to the system, becoming instantly available as part of the dynamic grammar described above, and then compiled into the static grammar the next evening.","For business reasons, top-level CallWord selection is always confirmed explicitly. Recognizer confidence scores are not considered. Several commands are also supported during the main dialog, and generally fall into 3 categories:","These utterances result in context-sensitive information being played to the caller. Once the information has been played, control remains in the dialog. Supported utterances include:\n\n","These commands, with the exception of more info, are supported globally in every CallWords speech application.","These utterances allow the caller to navigate both locally within the dialog as well as globally (accessing other speech applications). Supported utterances include:\n\n","Whenever a caller responds to the main portal prompt by saying \u201cgo to shortcuts\u201d without also specifying a domain (e.g.: \u201cLos Angeles\u201d), control is transferred to this application. From here, the caller is prompted to specify the name of a city or category (domain) they would like to search.","The following dialog illustrates user\/system interaction when the user responds to the main CallWords prompt by triggering a globally available navigation command by saying \u201cgo to\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0208"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"(call arrives at 800-555-5555)"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["System","Welcome to call words toll-free connections.

This section will only discuss the operation of the \u201cgo to\u201d domain locator. A more detailed discussion of directory service application follows in the next section of this document.","The dialog flow supported by the domain locator application is illustrated in . Whenever a caller responds to the main portal prompt by saying \u201cgo to\u201d without also specifying a domain (e.g.: \u201cLos Angeles\u201d), control is transferred to this application. From here, the caller is prompted to specify the name of a city or category (domain) they would like to search. The primary grammar used for this application is one that supports a choice of utterances, each of which identify a domain recognized as part of the CallWords service. Domains are organized both by city (e.g.: \u201cLos Angeles\u201d) and by category (e.g.: \u201cairlines\u201d). In many cases, more than one utterance will map onto the same domain. For example, \u201crestaurants\u201d and \u201cdining\u201d might both correspond to the same searchable domain.","Unlike the main portal application, this application will use confidence scores reported by the recognizer to confirm user input. For recognition results reported with a confidence of 0.90 or greater, confirmation will be skipped. For recognition results reported to the application with a confidence score that is less than 0.90, a specialized \u201cyes\/no\u201d grammar that supports 3 kinds of responses will be used:\n\n","The first two scenarios are standard.

Prior to this invention, web browsing and search functionality completely depended on the user's ability to navigate the web and intuitively make decisions on which URL's to enter into the browser's address bar, queries to search engine or impulsive decisions to click on links or banners. This invention allows the user to engage into an interactive dialogue with the host to as a control mechanism to navigate the web. An Example of how a host guided browsing session works is shown in .","Current methods of searching the internet require the user to enter a search term, review the results and then make one or more selections to visit web pages that are discovered by means of the internet search. Often results from a particular search query can be in the thousands or even millions. Viewers are often overwhelmed by the number of available choices and may only choose to follow one or several links to view the pages associated with the search result.","After they visit the page that was linked to the result, the viewer is left to their own means and to view content displayed on the resulting website to either make a decisions to take an conversion action such as a purchase or place a phone call to the business operating the website.","However there are many people who prefer to be guided to a website or referred to a company by someone they know and trust. The concept of celebrity referrals is not new. There is a term call the \u201cOpera Effect\u201d which refers to the phenomena of a mass sale of a product after she endorses it during her broadcasts. The same principals apply to a lesser degree to any endorsement of a product or service or by any celebrity.","Host guided browsing will create a user experience where a host can be selected to help guide the view through an interactive chain of results. The viewer simply interacts with the host by speaking or clicking on choices that are made available to them during their browsing session.","A host can be in the form of audio or a video format, and can be portrayed by a celebrity, a music star, a \u201ctalk radio\u201d show host, or a non-famous personality who can provide expertise on any subject material. It can also be am animated character.","As the view interfaces with the host, a variety of resulting actions can occur, For example, the host might ask the viewer what subject they are interested in finding out a about. After the viewer answers the question, the invention will fetch another page and the host will continue to interact with the viewer. This adds a sense of continuity to the browsing experience as well as enabling the host to provide an audio or visual narrative of what the viewer is seeing on the page that is being visited. Additionally, supporting images can be introduced, overlaid and interfaced with on the base layer website.","The base layer website is contained in an iframe so the viewer remains on the original URL they visited during the entire session.","Another example of a user interaction could be a call connection that is placed upon the users request, or an internet chat session started.","Additionally, the session could introduce a purchase function into the call, place a product into a shopping cart and allow the views to make a purchase, all by using voice commands during their dialogue with the system.","There are other iterations of how the technology can work, for example an \u201cinteractive web radio show\u201d where the host provides accompanying visual along with their narrative. As pages are viewed and advertiser's websites are visited, a tracking system has also been developed to charge advertiser for page views and endorsements made by the hosts.","The system is programmed by an interface provided to content providers who can create their own unique browsing sessions, add their own audio and video content and programs links to webpages they wish to include in their host guided programs.","Yet another form of guided browsing included the concept of a voice activated \u201cdeal search\u201d component of the system. In this format, advertisers place business profiles and promotional deals into the database via a web interface and the program will deliver these results based on parameters entered into the system by advertisers.","The invention is designed to operate on several computer platforms including windows, OSX, and Linux and on Mobile device systems such as iOS (Apple) Android and on Windows based devices.","Many carriers do not permit VoIP applications to operate on their devices, to permit the operation of our system, we have developed yet another invention that allows a separate voice\/audio channel to run in parallel with a host guided browsing session. Because telephonic voice communication is prohibited on the VoIP circuit, a separate device such as a cell phone could be used in conjunction with a tablet. The voice input to the system would come from the phone and the audio visual output would be streamed back into the visual device from the cloud.","The invention is compromised of the following components\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0247"},"figref":"FIG. 20","ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0041","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0041-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0042","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

The viewer simply talks to the video that is playing in their browser on an application on their smart phone.  shows an interactive session with a user with the following procedure:\n\n","Instead of a Multimedia audio file being played in the multimedia layer, a primary video clip is immediately played and a set of alternative secondary videos clips are loaded into the client's memory cache. In order to provide a seamless transition between videos, it is necessary to load a full set of video clips instead of just the primary video. If this is not done, there is a resulting delay between the time of the request and the play, while the subsequent video is streamed or loaded to the browser. The result is that the viewing experience is interrupted.","The preloading process needs to transpire while the primary video is playing. This process insures that when the viewer says or clicks on a selection in the user interface layer, the requested video is immediately made available to the viewer to provide a real time interactive experience.","To provide a seamless user experience the system will use HTML5 to preload all of the subsequent alternative clips that will play after the user verbalizes a response.","Since all the clips are already loaded in the client computer, the selected clip will immediately interrupt the playing of the current clip and start playing the subsequent clip. This can happen simultaneously while a new web page is be loaded. The effect to the end user will be that of a perceive intelligence as if the video actually understood what was said by the user.  shows an exemplary embodiment of a detailed interactive session with a user is accomplished with procedure as follows:\n\n","Radio Interactive Programming is an integrated\/hybrid media experience which enables users to listen to radio delivered audio content (either via the Web or over the airwaves) and then interact with the corresponding online version of the radio program using speech recognition technology. This enables radio stations to deliver a truly multi-sensory experience; as the end user listens to the broadcast, they can utilize their voice to interact with the radio program's host and the content which is served to accompany the broadcast with voice direction commands, affecting a similar result as clicking a link on the Internet with a mouse. Radio Interactive Programming is unique in that it can be used by a radio station, broadcast network or individual radio program host to deliver additional content (beyond the audio) to listeners; it creates an alternative revenue source for traditional media (i.e. independent radio stations and syndicates) by providing additional means of delivering advertising and marketing messages; it can be utilized to deliver expanded content about a specific product or service; it can be utilized to generate a call from a radio listener to a paying advertiser, which is directly measurable; and it can be used to invoke a voice search program to locate a local resource, which is especially important for soliciting local advertisers on nationally broadcast programs. The technology for radio active programming is described in  relating to host guided browsing.","Voice Front Voice Activated Virtual Routing Utility","This application provides a completely customizable answering service.

The push application allows the CallWords customer to use speech commands (\u201cpush\u201d) to cause selected content to be displayed in the browser of the person they're talking to over the phone. The content might be pushed \u201cby reference\u201d (i.e., sending just a URL), causing the contact's browser to display a different web page; or the content might be pushed \u201cby value\u201d (for example, pushing a photo or other document to the browser).

During the course of interacting with an application, the user exclusively uses a one to one ratio of voice channels and speech ports. Furthermore one or more long distance channels are also in use during the call. CallWords has developed a solution for this problem by developing a technology which allows calls to be received by a local or VoIP switch, and then establish an active bridge to a centrally located resource center to perform the speech recognition function. At the completion of the speech session, the resource center is dropped, out of band signaling data is passed back to the original via TCP\/IP, and the original local switch completes the call. A passive resource connection is maintained during the call, enabling the caller to bridge back to the originating speech resource at any time by simply pressing ** or ## on a phone or on a control in a speech application or in a Voice Control Panel on the web. This process significantly reduces the cost of speech application deployment and at the same time enables an in-call speech media resource","SOSO (Speech On\/Speech Off)","This technology is provided to alter the state of the user experience to allow for conversation during playback without barging into the speech recognizer. The state of the \u201clistening\u201d will change as the dialogue progresses to allow normal conversation to occur while interacting with the system. The listening technology will only be enabled during specific segments of the program.","Customizable Wake-Up Words with a Customizable Reply Prompt.","When a user configures their account they will be able to choose one or more wake up words that the speech recognizer will listen for; all other words it hears will be discarded until it is \u201cwoken up.\u201d Upon hearing the \u201cwake up\u201d word, the system will respond with the user created response to the wake up word. For example, the user may say, \u201cHey, computer,\u201d and the response may be, \u201cI'm here, John.\u201d The user can choose to configure both the grammar and also load in the appropriate multimedia audio file. This may be done with video resources as well.","Speech API","TVI Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) consists of programming code that can be embedded into any HTML scripting environment to enable a third-party Website with this API implemented to support TVI's suite of speech-activated controls."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The aspects and the attendant advantages of the embodiments described herein will become more readily apparent by reference to the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 13(A)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 13(B)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 19(A)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 19(B)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 22(A)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 22(B)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 28A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 28(B)"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 33"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 34"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 35"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 36"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 37"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 38"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 39"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
