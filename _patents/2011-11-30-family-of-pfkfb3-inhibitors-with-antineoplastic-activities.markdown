Glycolysis has a dual role, to degrade sugars to generate energy (ATP) and to provide building blocks for synthetic reactions. The rate of conversion of glucose into pyruvate is regulated to meet these two major cellular needs. In particular, enzymes such as hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, which catalyze irreversible reactions in the glycolytic process, are regulated as control points in glycolysis.","In 1930, Warburg pointed out that tumors have a high rate of anaerobic glycolysis and do not show a decreased glycolytic rate even at relatively high oxygen concentrations. This loss of regulatory control (i.e., the Pasteur effect) has come to be called the Warburg effect. Since then, subsequent studies have consistently corroborated the inherent nature of cancer to involve: a) rapid consumption of glucose; b) robust glycolytic activity (see Maublant et al., 85, 935-950 (1998)); c) rapid cell proliferation (see Chesney et al., 96, 3047-3052 (1999)); d) production and accumulation of lactic acid (see Baggetto, 74, 959-974 (1992)); and e) a low extracellular pH with depleted glucose levels circumscribing the perimeter of the tumor. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20060035981.","Due to cancer cells' metabolic shift to increased glycolytic flux for energy and production of macromolecule precursors, inhibition of glycolysis has emerged as a potential targeted anti-neoplastic strategy. Over the past several decades, various small molecules have been identified as possessing anti-tumor characteristics by acting through inhibition of the glycolytic pathway. Two in particular, 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), both of which target hexokinase, have been demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxicity towards transformed cells with mitochondrial respiratory defects or under hypoxia. See Xu et al., 65, 613-621 (2005); Lui et al., 40, 5542-5547 (2001); and Maher et al., 53, 116-122 (2004). The anti-neoplastic agent Imatinib (i.e., Gleevec\u00ae, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Incorporation, East Hanover, N.J., United States of America) has also been demonstrated to suppress hexokinase.","There remains a need for additional anti-cancer therapeutics, particularly those which target neoplastic cells via mechanisms related to the increased glycolytic flux associated with cancers. There also remains a need for additional methods of screening compounds to determine their ability to inhibit the enzymes associated with glycolysis.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of inhibiting 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), the method comprising contacting PFKFB3 with an inhibitory compound.

Increased glycolysis is achieved by a variety of factors including: a) substrate availability, b) expression of metabolic enzymes necessary for glycolytic flux, and c) levels of allosteric activators and inhibitors that act on particular points within the pathway. For example, it is thought that increased expression of glucose transporters, such as GLUT1, provide the excess supply of glucose needed to sustain an elevated glycolytic rate, while key rate-limiting enzymes such as hexokinase and phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) have been revealed to be upregulated in neoplastic cells. See Vora et al., 45(7), 2993-3001 (1985); Macheda et al., 202(3), 654-662 (2005); and Mathupala et al., 25(34), 4777-4786 (2006). Lastly, allosteric regulators of the glycolytic enzymes play a large role in the flux of glucose, primarily at the first irreversible, committed rate limiting step involving PFK1. See Van Schaftingen, et al., 78(6), 3483-3486 (1981).","PFK1 activity has been observed to be increased in tumor cell lines, as well as in primary tumor tissues. Further, the introduction of oncogenic ras or src into Rat-1 fibroblasts or chick-embryo fibroblasts, respectively, results in higher PFK-1 activity. See Hennipman et al., 8(5), 251-263 (1987); Kole, et al., 286(2), 586-590 (1991); and Sanchez-Martinez and Aragon, 409(1), 86-90 (1997). However, the higher level of activation of PFK1 within the transformed cells was not due to greater protein expression, but was found to be due to increased production of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP). See Kole, et al., 286(2), 586-590 (1991). Identified in the early 1980's, F2,6BP was found to be a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, capable of relieving the inhibitory effects of ATP by shifting the conformational equilibrium of PFK1 from a low to a high affinity state for its substrate, fructose-6-phosphate. See Van Schaftingen, et al., 192(3), 887-895 (1980); Van Schaftingen, et al., 192(3), 897-901 (1980); and Van Schaftingen, et al., 78(6), 3483-3486 (1981). Therefore, upregulation of F2,6BP levels allows for neoplastic tissues to maintain high glycolytic output even in the presence of high energy production (i.e., physiological ATP levels).  illustrates how oncogenic ras is believed to increase the expression and activity of PFKFB3 in neoplastic cells, thereby leading to enhanced F2,6BP production, the activation of rate-limiting PFK-1, and ultimately, higher glycolytic flux and increased production of macromolecules including RNA, DNA, amino acids (AAs), and fatty acids.","F2,6BP levels within the cell are maintained by a family of bi-functional enzymes termed 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase\/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFK-2\/FBPases), and are encoded by four genes PFKFB1-4. PFKFB1, 2, and 4 are reported to be expressed within the liver\/muscle, kidney\/heart, and testes, respectively, and exhibit equal kinase to phosphatase activity. An inducible isoform of PFK-2 (reported as iPFK2, placental PFK2, ubiquitous PFK2, and PGR1) encoded by the PFKFB3 gene has been shown to be upregulated via mitogenic, inflammatory, and hypoxic stimuli, and displays a kinase to phosphatase ratio of 740:1 due to a point mutation within the phosphatase domain.","PFKFB3 has been observed to be over-expressed in many types of neoplastic tissues including: colon, prostate, lung, breast, pancreas, and ovary. See Atsumi, et al., 62, 5881-5887 (2002). The addition of oncogenic ras to immortalized mouse fibroblasts results in increased PFKFB3 expression, suggesting that PFKFB3 may be a vital component necessary for neoplastic transformation. Chesney and coworkers have demonstrated a suppression of K562 leukemia xenografts in athymic mice using anti-sense oligonucleotides against PFKFB3, while also observing a decrease in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is a precursor to nucleotide biosynthesis. In heterozygous PFKFB3 (+\/\u2212) mouse fibroblasts subsequently immortalized and transformed with human telomerase, Large T antigen, and oncogenic H-ras, F2,6BP production is reduced and glycolytic flux of glucose to lactate is suppressed. More importantly, lower levels of PFKFB3 in ras-transformed fibroblasts resulted in a loss of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and a marked reduction in in vivo growth of tumors in athymic mice. See Telang et al., 25, 7225-7234 (2006). Separately, siRNA suppression of PFKFB3 in A549 lung carcinoma cells also caused a decrease in F2,6BP, and a loss in soft agar colony formation.","Disclosed herein for the first time is the observation that selectively targeting PFKFB3 with small molecule inhibitors is a strategy for novel anti-cancer therapeutics.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of inhibiting PFKFB3, the method comprising contacting PFKFB3 with an inhibitory compound.

When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent, which is physiologically acceptable, can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline.","Other pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared from the water-insoluble compounds disclosed herein, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the formulation will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound or salt thereof. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.","Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the active compound, the active compound will be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol-free. When the active compound of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer that forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes that are produced can be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques.","The liposomal formulations comprising the active compounds disclosed herein can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate, which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.","Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of a desired compound described herein or a salt thereof, or a plurality of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulation can be placed in a small chamber and nebulized.

The liquid droplets or solid particles should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. Most preferably, the size of the solid particles or droplets will be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. The compounds can be administered via an aerosol suspension of respirable particles in a manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","When the pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid, the formulation will comprise a water-soluble active compound in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant can be present, which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.","As indicated, both water-soluble and water-insoluble active compounds are provided. As used herein, the term \u201cwater-soluble\u201d is meant to define any composition that is soluble in water in an amount of about 50 mg\/mL, or greater. Also, as used herein, the term \u201cwater-insoluble\u201d is meant to define any composition that has a solubility in water of less than about 20 mg\/mL. In some embodiments, water-soluble compounds or salts can be desirable whereas in other embodiments water-insoluble compounds or salts likewise can be desirable.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides methods and compositions for inhibiting cell proliferation. In particular, the presently disclosed subject matter provides methods of interfering PFKFB3 activity and disrupting glycolytic flux. By disrupting glycolytic activity, proliferation of the cell ceases and, in some cases, apoptosis is triggered. Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of treating diseases, including cancer, involving undesirable glycolytic activity, and\/or undesirable cell proliferation.","In some embodiments, the methods for inhibiting cell proliferation or treating a cancer comprise administering to a subject in need thereof an active compound as described herein. These active compounds, as set forth above, include the compounds of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IV), (V), (VI), and (VII), their corresponding prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds and prodrugs.

In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IV), (V), (VI), or (VII) can be delivered regionally to a particular affected region or regions of the subject's body. In some embodiments, wherein such treatment is considered more suitable, the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IV), (V), (VI), or (VII) can be administered systemically. For example, the compound can be administered orally or intravenously.","In addition, it will be appreciated that therapeutic benefits for the treatment of cancer can be realized by combining treatment with a PFKFB3 inhibitor compound or other compound of the presently disclosed subject matter with one or more additional anti-cancer agents or treatments. The choice of such combinations will depend on various factors including, but not limited to, the type of disease, the age and general health of the subject, the aggressiveness of disease progression, and the ability of the subject to tolerate the agents that comprise the combination. For example, the PFKFB3 inhibitor compound can be combined with other agents and therapeutic regimens that are effective at reducing tumor size (e.g., radiation, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal treatments, and or gene therapy). Further, in some embodiments, it can be desirable to combine the PFKFB3 inhibitor compound with one or more agents that treat the side effects of a disease or the side effects of one of the therapeutic agents, e.g., providing the subject with an analgesic, or agents effective to stimulate the subject's own immune response (e.g., colony stimulating factor).","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed methods and compounds can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy and\/or radiation focused on aerobic, fast-growing cells, which we will here refer to collectively and individually as \u201caerobic treatment.\u201d In some embodiments, the use of the presently disclosed PFKFB3 inhibitors will add to the efficacy of cancer treatment by selectively killing the anaerobically slow-growing tumor cells found at the inner core of solid tumors, which are usually the most resistant and consequently the most difficult to eradicate using aerobic treatments.","Thus, a variety of chemical compounds, also described as \u201canti-neoplastic\u201d agents or \u201cchemotherapeutic agents\u201d can be used in combination with one or more of the PFKFB3 inhibitor compounds of the presently described subject matter. Such compounds include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA or RNA synthesis, DNA base analogs, topoisomerase inhibitors, anti-angiogenesis agents, and telomerase inhibitors or telomeric DNA binding compounds.

Additional protein synthesis inhibitors include modeccin, neomycin, norvaline, pactamycin, paromomycine, puromycin, ricin, shiga toxin, showdomycin, sparsomycin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, thiostrepton, and trimethoprim. Inhibitors of DNA synthesis, including alkylating agents such as dimethyl sulfate, mitomycin C, nitrogen and sulfur mustards, intercalating agents, such as acridine dyes, actinomycins, adriamycin, anthracenes, benzopyrene, ethidium bromide, propidium diiodide-intertwining, and agents, such as distamycin and netropsin, also can be combined with compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter in pharmaceutical compositions. Topoisomerase inhibitors, such as coumermycin, nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and oxolinic acid, inhibitors of cell division, including colcemide, colchicine, vinblastine, and vincristine; and RNA synthesis inhibitors including actinomycin D, \u03b1-amanitine and other fungal amatoxins, cordycepin (3\u2032-deoxyadenosine), dichlororibofuranosyl benzimidazole, rifampicine, streptovaricin, and streptolydigin also can be combined with the PFKFB3 inhibitor compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter to provide a suitable cancer treatment.","Thus, current chemotherapeutic agents that can be used in a combination treatment with a PFKFB3 inhibitor of the presently disclosed subject matter include, adrimycin, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), etoposide, camptothecin, actinomycin-D, mitomycin, cisplatin, hydrogen peroxide, carboplatin, procarbazine, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan, chjlorambucil, bisulfan, nitrosurea, dactinomycin, duanorubicin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicomycin, tamoxifen, taxol, transplatimun, vinblastin, and methotrexate, and the like.","Combination treatments involving a PFKFB3 inhibitor compound and another therapeutic agent, such as another chemotherapeutic agent can be achieved by contacting cells with the PFKFB3 inhibitor and the other agent at the same time. Such combination treatments can be achieved by contacting the cell with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents, or by contacting the cell with two distinct compositions or formulations, at the same time, wherein one composition includes the PFKFB3 inhibitor and the other includes the other agent.","Alternatively, treatment with the PFKFB3 inhibitor compound can precede or follow treatment with the other agent by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the other agent and the PFKFB3 inhibitor therapy are applied separately to the cell, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the agent and the PFKFB3 inhibitor treatment would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell. In such instances, it is provided that one would contact the cell with both modalities within about 12-24 hours of each other and, optionally, within about 6-12 hours of each other. In some situations, it can be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, however, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations. Also, under some circumstances, more than one administration of either the PFKFB3 inhibitor or of the other agent will be desired.","In another embodiment, a PFKFB3 inhibitor compound of the presently disclosed subject matter or another anti-cancer compound being used in combination with the PFKFB3 inhibitor is either combined with or covalently bound to a cytotoxic agent bound to a targeting agent, such as a monoclonal antibody (e.g., a murine or humanized monoclonal antibody). It will be appreciated that the latter combination can allow the introduction of cytotoxic agents into cancer cells with greater specificity. Thus, the active form of the cytotoxic agent (i.e., the free form) will be present only in cells targeted by the antibody.","Additional cancer treatments also can be used in combination with administration of a PFKFB3 inhibitor compound. For example, a PFKFB3 inhibitor compound of the presently disclosed subject matter can be used as part of a treatment course further involving attempts to surgically remove part or all of a cancerous growth. For instance, a PFKFB3 inhibitor of the presently disclosed subject matter can be administered after surgical treatment of a subject to treat any remaining neoplastic or metastasized cells. Treatment with a PFKFB3 inhibitory agent of the presently disclosed subject matter also can precede surgery, in an effort to shrink the size of a tumor to reduce the amount of tissue to be excised, thereby making the surgery less invasive and traumatic.","Treating cancer with a PFKFB3 inhibitor agent of the presently disclosed subject matter can further include one or more treatment courses with a radiotherapeutic agent to induce DNA damage. Radiotherapeutic agents, include, for example, gamma irradiation, X-rays, UV-irradiation, microwaves, electronic emissions, radioisotopes, and the like. Therapy can be achieved by irradiating the localized tumor site with the above-described forms of radiation.","A combination therapy also can involve immunotherapy directed at tumor antigen markers that are found on the surface of tumor cells. Treatment of a cancer with a PFKFB3 inhibitor of the presently disclosed subject matter can further be combined with a gene therapy based treatment, targeted towards oncogenes and\/or cell cycle controlling genes, such as p53, p16, p21, Rb, APC, DCC, NF-1, NF-2, BRCA2, FHIT, WT-1, MEN-I, MEN-II, BRCA1, VHL, FCC, MCC, ras, myc, neu, raf, erb, src, fms, jun, trk, ret, gsp, hst, bcl, and abl, which are often mutated versions of their normal cellular couterparts in cancerous tissues.","The PFKFB3 inhibitor compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter can be tested to measure their ability to inhibit growth of cancer cells, to induce apoptosis of the cancer cells, to reduce tumor burden, and to inhibit metastases. For example, one can measure cell growth according to the MTT assay. Growth assays as measured by the MTT assay are well known in the art. In the MTT assay, cancer cells are incubated with various concentrations of anti-cancer compound, and cell viability is determined by monitoring the formation of a colored formazan salt of the tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Other known assays for measuring cell death and or cell proliferation can also be employed.","In vivo testing can be performed using a mouse xenograft model, for example, in which OVCAR-5 tumor cells are grafted onto nude mice, in which mice treated with a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IV), (V), (VI), or (VII) are expected to have tumor masses that, on average, increase for a period following initial dosing, but will shrink in mass with continuing treatment. In contrast, mice treated with a control (e.g., DMSO) are expected to have tumor masses that continue to increase. Additional methods of measuring the anti-neoplastic effects of the presently disclosed compounds are described further, hereinbelow, in the Examples.","The presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of screening compounds for their ability to interfere with (e.g., inhibit or competitively inhibit) PFKFB3. In particular, the method comprises providing a three-dimensional model of PFKFB3, including the F6P binding pocket of PFKFB3; providing a three-dimensional model of a compound (e.g., a small molecule); and screening the compound for its ability to interact with one or more solvent accessible sites in the F6P binding pocket of the PFKFB3 model. In some embodiments, the method can be performed using a computer (i.e., in silico). In some embodiments, the method can include providing the three-dimensional models of a plurality of compounds (i.e., a library or database of compounds) and screening each compound individually and then comparing the ability of an individual compound to interact with the F6P binding pocket with the abilities of the other compounds in the plurality of compounds.","Thus, in one aspect, the method of screening compounds generally includes computationally evaluating the potential of a selected chemical entity or entities to associate with the computational model of the F6P binding pocket of PFKFB3. For example, this method can include the steps of (a) employing a computational approach to perform a fitting operation between the selected chemical entity or entities and the F6P binding pocket of PFKFB3; and (b) analyzing the results of the fitting operation to quantify the association between the chemical entity or entities and the binding pocket. In some embodiments, a molecule or library of molecules can be tested for binding affinity with the F6P binding pocket of PFKFB3 using visual inspection or using computer-aided docking experiments.","In some embodiments, the computational model of PFKFB3 can be derived from known X-ray structures of PFKFB3 isozymes. For example, a model of PFKFB3 can be derived by aligning the residue sequence of PFKFB3 with homologous sequences of the human liver PFKFB1 and rat testes PFKFB4 isozymes. The crystal structure of PFKFB3 itself has also been described. See Kim et al., 281 (5) 2939-2944 (2006).","The term \u201cbinding pocket\u201d refers to a region of a molecule or molecular complex, that as a result of its shape, favorably associates with another chemical entity (e.g., F6P or an inhibitor). The term \u201cpocket\u201d includes, but is not limited to, a cleft, channel or site. The shape of a binding pocket may be largely pre-formed before binding of a chemical entity, may be formed simultaneously with binding of a chemical entity, or may be formed by the binding of another chemical entity to a different binding pocket of the molecule, which in turn induces a change in shape of the binding pocket.","The term \u201cdocking\u201d refers to orienting, rotating, translating a chemical entity in the binding pocket, domain, molecule or molecular complex or portion thereof based on distance geometry or energy. Docking can be performed by distance geometry methods that find sets of atoms of a chemical entity that match sets of sphere centers of the binding pocket, domain, molecule or molecular complex or portion thereof. See Meng et al., 4, 505-524 (1992). Sphere centers are generated by providing an extra radius of a given length from the atoms (excluding hydrogen atoms) in the binding pocket, domain, molecule or molecular complex or portion thereof. Real-time interaction energy calculations, energy minimizations or rigid-body minimizations (see Gschwend et al., 9:175-186 (1996)) can be performed while orienting the chemical entity to facilitate docking. For example, interactive docking experiments can be designed to follow the path of least resistance. If the user in an interactive docking experiment makes a move to increase the energy, the system will resist that move. However, if that user makes a move to decrease energy, the system will favor that move by increased responsiveness. (Cohen, et al., 33, 889-894 (1990)). Docking can also be performed by combining a Monte Carlo search technique with rapid energy evaluation using molecular affinity potentials. See Goodsell and Olson, 8, 195-202 (1990). Software programs that carry out docking functions include, but are not limited to, MATCHMOL (see Cory, et al., 2, 39 (1984)); MOLFIT (see Redington, 16, 217 (1992)) and DOCK (see Meng et al., supra).","The term \u201cgenerating a three-dimensional structure\u201d or \u201cgenerating a three-dimensional representation\u201d refers to converting the lists of structure coordinates into structural models or graphical representation in three-dimensional space. This can be achieved through commercially or publicly available software. A model of a three-dimensional structure of a molecule or molecular complex can thus be constructed on a computer screen by a computer that is given the structure coordinates and that comprises the correct software. The three-dimensional structure can be displayed or used to perform computer modeling or fitting operations. In addition, the structure coordinates themselves, without the displayed model, may be used to perform computer-based modeling and fitting operations.","In some embodiments, the ability of a compound to interact with a binding pocket or solvent accessible surface can be quantified. The term \u201ccontact score\u201d refers to a measure of shape complementarity between the chemical entity and binding pocket, which is correlated with an RMSD value obtained from a least square superimposition between all or part of the atoms of the chemical entity and all or part of the atoms of the ligand bound in the binding pocket. The docking process can be facilitated by the contact score or RMSD values. For example, if the chemical entity moves to an orientation with high RMSD, the system will resist the motion. A set of orientations of a chemical entity can be ranked by contact score. A lower RMSD value will give a higher contact score. See Meng et al. 4, 505-524 (1992).","The term \u201croot mean square deviation\u201d or \u201cRMSD\u201d means the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the mean. It is a way to express the deviation or variation from a trend or object.","The term \u201cstructure coordinates\u201d refers to Cartesian coordinates derived from mathematical equations related to the patterns obtained on diffraction of a monochromatic beam of X-rays by the atoms (scattering centers) of a protein or protein complex in crystal form. The diffraction data are used to calculate an electron density map of the repeating unit of the crystal. The electron density maps are then used to establish the positions of the individual atoms of the molecule or molecular complex.","As will be understood by one of skill in the art in view of the presently disclosed subject matter, a variety of small molecule (i.e., compounds having a molecular weight of 1000 atomic mass units (amu) or less, 750 amu or less or of 500 amu or less) libraries are available for computational screening methods. Chemical structure databases which may be used include, but are not limited to, ACD (Molecular Designs Ltd, now Elsevier MDL, San Ramon, Calif., United States of America), NCI (National Cancer Institute, Fredrick, Md., United States of America), CCDC (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, Cambridge, United Kingdom), CAST (Chemical Abstract Service, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America), Maybridge (Maybridge Chemical Company Ltd, Tintagel, United Kingdom), Aldrich (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.), and the Directory of Natural Products (Chapman & Hall, London, United Kingdom).","Computer programs such as CONCORD (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, Mo., United States of America) or DB-Converter (Molecular Simulations Ltd., San Leandro, Calif., United States of America) can be used to convert a data set represented in two dimensions to one represented in three dimensions. Programs suitable for searching three-dimensional databases to identify molecules bearing a desired pharmacophore include: MACCS-3D and ISIS\/3D (Molecular Design Ltd., now Elsevier MDL, San Ramon, Calif., United States of America), ChemDBS-3D (Chemical Design Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom), and Sybyl\/3 DB Unity (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, Mo., United States of America). As used herein, a \u201cpharmacophore\u201d or a \u201cpharmacophoric pattern\u201d is a geometric arrangement of features of a chemical entity that are believed to be important for binding.","Compounds can also be screened for their ability to inhibit PFKFB3 using cell-based screening methods. Thus, in some embodiments, compounds can be screened for their ability to arrest cell proliferation and\/or lactate production in cells expressing PFKFB3. In some embodiments, compounds can be screened using a cell-based screening method to further verify the PFKFB3 inhibitory ability of a compound previously identified via an in silico screening method.","Statistical significance for the growth inhibition, lactate production, and in vivo studies between control and 3PO treatment was determined by a two-sample t-test using Graph Pad Prism Version 3.0 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif., United States of America). A p-value<0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.","Computational modeling was carried out using a Silicon Graphics Array (71\u00d7R12000 and R140000 processors with over 1 TB storage), a 32P R14000 500 MHz Origin 2000 server and a 2P R12000 300 MHz OCTANE graphics workstation (SGI, Sunnyvale, Calif., United States of America). The PFKFB3 homology model used the X-ray structures of the rat testes PFKFB4 (PDB code 1BIF) isozyme as a structural template. An alignment was generated using ClustalW. See Chenna et al., 31, 3497-3500 (2003). Four homology models were generated using Modeller (see Sali and Blundell, 234, 779-815 (1993)) and the structure that best reproduced the PFKFB3 binding site (see Chesney et al., 96, 3047-3052 (1999) and Bertrand et al., 254, 490-496 (1998)) was selected for further use. The residues essential to ligand binding and protein activity for PFKFB3 (see Chesney et al., 96, 3047-3052 (1999) and Bertrand et al., 254, 490-496 (1998)) were correlated to equivalent residue numbers in the consensus structure. The model was read into InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif., United States of America) and three of the essential residues, Arg 66, Tyr 161, and Thr 94, were selected as the centroid target for the virtual screening runs.

For example, the chalcones and aza-chalcones can be prepared by condensing the appropriate aryl aldehyde and aryl ketone followed by dehydration (i.e., loss of HO) to form an enone. The condensation can be catalyzed by either acid or base. In some embodiments, a benzaldehyde, substituted benzaldehyde or aza-analogue thereof can be mixed with an acetophenone, a substituted acetophenone, or an aza analogue thereof in the presence of a base (e.g., an aqueous solution of NaOH) at a suitable temperature for a period of time (e.g., minutes, one to several hours, one or more days).

Briefly, bacterial pellets were washed once in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., United States of America) and resuspended in 2 mL per pellet gram weight of lysis buffer with the addition of 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg\/mL lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., United States of America). The bacterial mixture was then sonicated 8 times for 10 seconds, and supernatant was obtained through centrifugation. Lysate was incubated for 1 hour with 3 mL of 50% Ni-NTA and the mixture was loaded onto a Poly-Prep chromatography column (BioRad, Hercules, Calif., United States of America). Beads were washed with 15 mL of 6\u00d7 His wash buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail, and PFKFB3 was eluted with 1.5 mL of elution buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. For further purification, elution fractions were dialyzed for 16 hours against a 20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) buffer, and subjected to gel filtration via Sephadex S200 columns (Amersham, Piscataway, N.J., United States of America).","PFKFB3 Enzymatic Assays:","PFKFB3 activity was measured by an enzyme-coupled kinetics assay incorporating pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as previously described. See Bucher and Pfleiderer, 1, 435-440 (1955). The assay measures NADH consumption spectrophotometrically as a loss of absorption at 340 nm with stoichiometry of 1 mol ATP: 1 mol NADH consumed. Assays were carried out in 96 well plates at 37\u00b0 in 200 \u03bcL final volume containing 1XPFKFB3 reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 \u03bcM EDTA, 5 mM KHPO; pH=7.4), 420 \u03bcM phophoenolpyruvate (PEP), 5 mM ATP, 400 \u03bcM NADH, 613 units of pyruvate kinase (PK), 1092 units of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increasing concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate (40-400 \u03bcM), and 15 \u03bcg of purified PFKFB3. Control reactions for the enzyme assays received active PFKFB3 without F6P. For compound 1 inhibition, reactions were incubated in the presence of either 60 \u03bcM, 100 \u03bcM, or 150 \u03bcM of the inhibitor. Control reactions for compound 1 inhibition contained increasing amounts of 1 without addition of PFKFB3. Assays were measured using a BioTek POWERWAVE\u2122 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, Vt., United States of America) in kinetics mode over 15 minute periods to determine kinetic rate of PFKFB3. The enzyme kinetics module for SigmaPlot\u00ae 9.0 (SYSTAT Software, Inc., San Jose, Calif., United States of America) was used to calculate the kinetic parameters for PFKFB3 and 1 inhibition (V, K, and K). The Vis expressed in specific activity of PFKFB3 as nmol F6P\u00d7min\u00d7mg. Kand Kvalues are expressed in \u03bcM for F6P or 1, respectively. The data represented are the mean\u00b1STD from triplicate measurements from two independent experiments.","As shown in , the Lineweaver-Burke double reciprocal plot reveals that 1 inhibits PFKFB3 activity through a mixed inhibition mechanism, both competitively and non-competitively. Incubation with 1 results in a significant dose-dependent decrease in PFKFB3 enzyme activity at lower concentrations of F6P. However, this inhibition is overcome by increasing amounts of F6P, suggesting that there is competition between 1 and F6P for the PFKFB3 binding site. From these studies, enzyme kinetics parameters were calculated for PFKFB3 activity and compound 1 inhibition. The specific activity of recombinant PFKFB3 was found to be 277\u00b19 nmol F6P\u00d7min\u00d7mg, and the Kfor F6P was determined to be 97 \u03bcM. See . The Kfor 1 was measured to be 25\u00b19 \u03bcM, which is an approximately four-fold decrease compared to the Kfor F6P. These studies confirm that 1 is in fact an inhibitor of PFKFB3 activity primarily through competition with F6P, and that molecular targeting of enzyme substrate binding sites for competitive inhibitors is a sound method for identifying anti-neoplastic therapies.","Generation of FLAG-PFKFB3 Construct for Mammalian Expression:","FLAG-PFKFB3 containing the complete PFKFB3 coding sequence and FLAG-epitope at its N-terminus was subcloned into the BamHI\/HindIII restriction sites within the retroviral Tet response vector pRevTRE (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif., United States of America). Recombinant retrovirus was produced by Lipofectamine-mediated (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., United States of America) transfection of the pRevTRE-FLAG-PFKFB3 construct into PT67 packaging cell lines. To create Jurkat cell lines that have stably integrated and express inducible FLAG-PFKFB3, the cells were infected with recombinant retrovirus containing FLAG-PFKFB3, and stable clones were selected in the presence of 400 \u03bcg\/mL hygromycin (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif., United States of America).","Cell Culture:","The K562, HL-60, MDA-MB231, and melanoma (CRL-11174) human cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American Tissue Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., United States of America). HeLa, A549, Lewis Lung Carcinoma, MDA-MB231, and melanoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, United States of America) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, United States of America) and 50 \u03bcg\/mL gentamicin sulfate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., United States of America). The HL-60, K562, and Jurkat cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, United States of America) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 \u03bcg\/mL gentamicin sulfate. The primary Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial (NHBE) cells and cells that were immortalized with human telomerase (ht) and large T antigen (LT) and transformed with mutated ras (ht\/LT\/ras cells) were cultured in Bronchial Epithelial Cell Basal Growth Medium (Cambrex, Walkersville, Md., United States of America) supplemented with 52 \u03bcg\/mL bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL hydrocortisone, 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL human epidermal growth factor, 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL epinephrine, 10 \u03bcg\/mL transferrin, 5 \u03bcg\/mL insulin, 0.1 ng\/mL retinoic acid, 6.5 ng\/mL triiodothyronine, 50 \u03bcg\/mL gentamycin, and 50 ng\/mL amphotericin-B (SingleQuots, Cambrex, Walkersville, Md., United States of America).

Cell cycle analysis was performed using Vybrant DyeCycle Orange stain (Molecular Probes-Invitrogen, Eugene, Oreg., United States of America) according to the manufacturer's protocol.","In Vitro Growth Inhibition:","All cell lines were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/well in the appropriate medium. For suspension cells, increasing concentrations of 1 were added immediately to the medium, whereas, compound 1 treatment was initiated the following day for adherent cell lines. For dose-dependent studies, compound 1 was added in increasing concentrations for 36 hours. For time-dependent studies, 10 \u03bcM of compound 1 was added at time 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 36 hours. For PFKFB3 overexpression studies, Jurkat cells containing the FLAG-PFKFB3 expression vector or a control plasmid were induced by addition of doxycycline (1 \u03bcg\/mL; Clontech, Mountain View, Calif., United States of America) 24 hours prior to incubation with compound 1.","Cells were collected 48 hours post-treatment, and cell number and viability were determined by trypan blue exclusion. ICvalues were calculated as the compound 1 concentration needed for 50% of vehicle treated cell growth. The data represented are the mean\u00b1STD from triplicate measurements from three independent experiments.","Lactate Measurements:","1\u00d710Jurkat cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 1. At desired time points, media samples were collected and lactate levels were measured using a lactate oxidase based colorimetric assay read at 540 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trinity, St. Louis, Mo., United States of America) and normalized to protein concentration.","Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate Assay:","Jurkat cells were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/mL and immediately incubated with 10 \u03bcM compound 1 for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 36 hours. F2,6BP assays were performed as previously described. See Van Shaftingen et al., 129, 191-195 (1982).","2-Deoxy-glucose Uptake:","Jurkat cells were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/mL in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 \u03bcg\/mL gentamicin sulfate. Cells were immediately treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 \u03bcM compound 1 for up to 36 hours, then placed in glucose free RPMI medium for 30 minutes. C-2-DG (0.25 \u03bcCi\/mL; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., United States of America) was added for 60 more minutes. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold, glucose-free RPMI. Cell lysates were collected in 500 \u03bcL of 0.1% SDS, and scintillation counts (cpm) were measured on 400 \u03bcL of lysate. Counts were normalized to protein concentration. Data represent mean\u00b1STD from duplicate measurements from two independent experiments.","Whole Cell ATP:","Jurkat cells were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/mL and incubated with 10 \u03bcM compound 1 for various time points. ATP levels were determined using an ATP determination kit from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen (Eugene, Oreg., United States of America) according to the manufacturer's protocol.","NAD+ and NADH Levels:","Jurkat cells were plated at 1\u00d710cells\/mL and immediately incubated with 10 \u03bcM compound 1 for 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 36 hours. NAD+ and NADH levels were measured using the EnzyChrom NAD+\/NADH assay kit from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, Calif., United States of America) according to the maufacturer's protocol.","NMR:","Jurkat cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 \u03bcM compound 1 in the presence of C-glucose for 36 hours. Equal numbers of cells were pelleted, washed twice with cold PBS to remove remaining medium, pelleted a final time and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cold pellet was extracted with 10% ice-cold TCA twice, followed by lyophilization. The dried extract was redissolved in 0.35 mL DO and placed in a 5 mm Shigemi tube. NMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T on a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., United States of America) at 20\u00b0 C. using a 90\u00b0 excitation pulse. 2-Dimensional TOCSY and HSQC experiments were conducted. Metabolites were assigned based on their H and C chemical shifts and TOCSY connectivity pattern. Metabolites were quantified by integration in the TOCSY experiment.","Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis:","Protein extraction and Western blots were performed as previously described. See Telanq et al., 25, 7225-7234 (2006). Blots were probed for PFKFB3, stripped and re-probed for \u03b2-actin utilizing anti-PFKFB3 (Abjent, Inc., San Diego, Calif., United States of America) and anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., United States of America).","Results:","Without being bound to any one particular theory, assuming that increased glycolytic flux is necessary for transformed cell proliferation, the inhibition of PFKFB3 should selectively target tumor cell growth. Transformed NHBE cells (ht\/LT\/ras) were more sensitive to 1 than the genetically matched primary cells. See . The primary NHBE cells demonstrated no significant susceptibility to 1 incubation, even at the highest concentration tested (33 \u03bcM). However, treatment of the transformed cells with 1 was cytostatic at concentrations below 1 \u03bcM, and completely cytotoxic at approximately 10 \u03bcM. The ICfor 1 against the NHBE-ht\/LT\/ras cells was determined to be 1.5 \u03bcM. Thus, compound 1 appears to provide a ten-fold greater potenct than other inhibitors of glycolysis, 2-DG and 3-BrPA which have effective at concentrations of low mM to 1000, respectively.","The effect of 1 on transformed cells, including lines originating from both solid tumors and hematologically derived disease, was further examined by calculating the ICof 1 for various tumor cells. The leukemia lines exhibited increased sensitivity (average about 7-fold) to treatment with 1 compared to the adherent cell lines. See . The ICvalues for the K562, Jurkat, and HL-60 leukemia cells were determined to be 3.2, 1.4, and 4.5 respectively. There was a greater ICvariability in the adherent cell lines. Two lung carcinoma models, human A549 and mouse LLC, revealed ICvalues of 24 and 19 \u03bcM, while HeLa cervical cancer cells had a calculated ICvalue of 24 \u03bcM. The MDA-MB231 breast adenocarcinoma cells seemed to be especially sensitive to treatment with 1 compared to the other solid tumor derived cell lines, with a calculated ICof 4.7 \u03bcM. Lastly, a melanoma line had an ICvalue of 15 \u03bcM. Thus, it appears that 1 is an anti-neoplastic compound with an ability to selectively target tumor cell proliferation.","Incubation with 1 results in a dose-dependent decrease in the proliferation of Jurkat T cell leukemia cells. See . As little as 0.3 \u03bcM 3PO caused a decrease in cell proliferation and 10 \u03bcM 3PO completely inhibited proliferation over 36 hours. See . The suppression of cell proliferation appeared to be the result of a G\/M phase cell cycle arrest as determined by propidium iodide staining. See . The effects of 10 \u03bcM 1 on Fru-2,6-BP production, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, and lactate secretion were also investigated. See . Both 2-DG uptake and Fru-2,6-BP were markedly reduced within 4 hours of exposure. These metabolic changes were followed by a decrease in lactate secretion (see ; 8 hrs), NADH (see ; 16 hrs), NAD+ (see ; 24 hrs) and ATP (see ; 24 hrs). Direct glycolytic flux to lactate was suppressed by pulsing the Jurkat cells with fully-labeled C-glucose during exposure to 1 and examining the fate of the C atoms by NMR spectroscopy. See .","Without being bound to any one theory, the observations that 1 decreases intracellular Fru-2,6-BP, 2-DG uptake, and lactate secretion prior to G\/M phase arrest provide substantial corollary support for the hypothesis that 1 inhibits cellular proliferation through disruption of energetic and anabolic metabolism. The G\/M arrest caused by 1 can be secondary to the high requirement for ATP during the G\/M phase of the cell cycle as has been previously observed in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. See Sweet and Singh, 55, 5164-5167 (1995). NMR spectroscopic tracking of C-glucose revealed suppression of glycolytic flux into lactate but not alanine. Alanine and lactate share the same pyruvate pool but glucose-derived lactate production can be especially affected by inhibition of glycolysis since lactate dehydrogenase requires a ready supply of NADH, a product of glycolytic flux through glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.","One of the most difficult challenges of new anti-neoplastic therapies is in situ target validation. To address this question, two different cell lines with varying levels of PFKFB3 expression were studied. If PFKFB3 is the true target of 1, then the cells which have decreased expression of the enzyme should be more susceptible to treatment with 1, or vice versa. Therefore, PFKFB3 haplo-insufficient (+\/\u2212) fibroblasts were immortalized with human telomerase (ht) and large T antigen (LT), and then transformed them with expression of mutated ras (PFKFB3+\/\u2212ht\/LT\/ras). These fibroblasts have been shown to have approximately 50% of PFKFB3 expression and lower F2,6BP production. The +\/\u2212ht\/LT\/ras transformed cells and their wild-type genetic matched counterparts (+\/+ht\/LT\/ras) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 1.","As shown in , PFKFB3+\/\u2212LT\/ras transformed fibroblasts express decreased PFKFB3 protein and low intracellular F2,6BP compared to wild-type counterparts. The F2,6BP concentration in the wild type cells was 60.3\u00b13.7 pmol\/mg, while in the PFKFB3+\/\u2212LT\/ras transformed fibroblasts the F2,6BP concentration was 10.3\u00b11.5 pmol\/mg. As shown in , the PFKFB3 heterozygous fibroblasts were more sensitive to treatment with 1 than the wild-type transformed cells. The calculated ICvalue for the +\/\u2212fibroblasts (26 \u03bcM) was determined to be approximately two-fold less than the ICvalue for the +\/+fibroblasts (49 \u03bcM).","Conversely, over-expression of PFKFB3 should protect the cell from the diminished cellular proliferation effects of incubation with 1. PFKFB3 levels were manipulated in Jurkat cells under the influence of a doxycycline responsive PFKFB3 Tet-ON system. Addition of doxycycline allows for the increased expression of PFKFB3 compared to doxycyline treated control Jurkat cells with no PFKFB3 expression vector. Ectopic expression of PFKFB3 protein increased F2,6BP concentration. As shown in , F2,6BP concentration in the +PFKFB3 cells was 38.1\u00b13.4 pmol\/mg, while in the control cells, the concentration of F2,6BP was 9.2\u00b10.95 pmol\/mg. Both cell types were incubated with increasing concentrations of 1, and as predicted, over-expression of PFKFB3 rescues Jurkat cells from the effects of the inhibitor (). The ICvalues for PFKFB3 over-expressing cells was determined to be 19.3 \u03bcM, while Jurkat cells expressing unaltered PFKFB3 levels was calculated as 8.9 \u03bcM. Together, these studies demonstrate that by controlling the expression of PFKB3, the cellular inhibitory effects of 1 can be altered, suggesting that PFKFB3 is the valid in situ target of 1.","Exponentially growing MDA-MB231 and HL-60 cells were collected in appropriate medium, washed twice and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 20\u00d710cells\/mL. Cells were then mixed 1:1 with Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Mass., United States of America), and 0.1 mL of cell suspension was injected subcutaneously (1\u00d710cells) into female Balb\/c nude mice (20 g). Exponentially growing Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were collected, washed twice, and resuspended in PBS (1\u00d710\/mL). C57Blk\/6 female mice (20 g) were injected subcutaneously with 1\u00d710cells in 0.1 mL volume. Body weight and tumor growth were monitored daily throughout the study. Tumor masses were determined by measurement with Vernier calipers using the formula: mass (mg)=[width (mm)\u00d7length (mm)]\/2. See Taetle et al., 71, 297-304 (1987). Mice with established tumors (between 130 mg-190 mg) were randomized into vehicle control or compound 1 treated groups. Vehicle control groups received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 50 \u03bcL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while treated groups received i.p. injections of 0.07 mg\/g 1 in 50 \u03bcL DMSO at the indicated time points.","Results:","Toxicity studies of 1 found that the highest tolerated dose producing no phenotypic side effects was intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 0.07 mg\/g in DMSO. The first tumor model tested consisted of mouse Lewis Lung Carcinoma xenografts grown in C57\/Blk6 mice. For this study, mice were given IP injections of either DMSO or the calculated dose of 1 once daily for the duration of the study (14 days). As illustrated in , administration of 1 significantly suppresses the growth of Lewis Lung Carcinoma xenografts by 73% compared to the DMSO control group. Separately, MDA-MB231 human breast adenocarcinoma tumors were established in Balb\/c nude mice. In this model, the frequency of the dose was decreased to determine whether reduced treatment would yield the same efficacy as seen in the Lewis Lung Carcinoma model. For both DMSO (control) and compound 1 treatment groups, mice were given a cyclical regiment of three daily injections followed by three days of no treatment. Total inhibition of xenograft growth of MDA-MB231 cells was observed compared to the DMSO controls () with a maximum inhibition of 66%. The third in vivo model comprised HL-60 leukemia cell xenografts in Balb\/c nude mice. The treatment schedule was further reduced to include a regiment of two sequential daily injections followed by seven consecutive days of no injections. As demonstrated in , treatment with compound 1, even in limited dosing, significantly inhibited HL-60 tumor growth by upwards of 74% compared to DMSO controls. Furthermore, the efficacy of the second dosing regiment is visible on the proliferation curve by the reduction in growth seen after treatment on day 9. The effects of 1 on the Lewis Lung Carcinoma and HL-60 xenograft models appear to be cytostatic since no regression in tumor growth was evident. However, the MDA-MB231 model suggests that compound 1 inhibition encompasses both an early cytotoxic effect, leading to initial tumor regression, followed by cytostatic properties as seen in the other two models. Together, these data support compound 1 as a potential anti-neoplastic agent for its ability to reduce in vivo tumor proliferation.","The ability of compounds 2-7 to inhibit PFKFB3 activity in vitro was determined using the enzymatic assay methods described above in Example 2. Treatment with 150 \u03bcM compound 2 caused the kinetic rate of PFKFB3 to be reduced 39.8% compared to treatment with vehicle (EtOH). See . The inhibitory effects of compounds 3-7 compared to vehicle (DMSO) treatment are compared in . Compound 4 reduced PFKFB3 the most, by over 80%.","The toxicity of compounds 2-7 toward various transformed cell lines was assessed as described hereinabove in Example 3. Compound 2 displayed dose-dependent cellular toxicity in two types of leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and K562 cells. See .

When the xenografts were measured to have a mass of between 150 and 180 mg, the mice were split into two groups. One group was injected i.p. with 0.07 mg\/g of compound 1. The other group was used as a control and injected i.p. with 50 \u03bcL DMSO. Four hours post-injection, tumors were removed and homogenized in equal volumes of 0.1 M and 0.05 M NaOH. F2,6BP assays were performed as previously described. See Van Shaftingen et al., 129, 191-195 (1982). Compound 1 treatment significantly reduced F2,6BP production in the tumor xenografts compared to vehicle control. F2,6BP concentration in the compound 1-treated mouse xenografts was 8.5\u00b11.7 pmol\/mg, while in the control mouse xenografts' F2,6BP concentration was 13.1\u00b11.9 pmol\/mg.","To further study the effects of compound 1, glucose uptake in compound 1-treated mice was studied using micro-positron emission tomography (micro-Pet). Lewis lung carcinoma xenograft bearing mice were given an i.p. injection of 50 \u03bcL of DMSO or of 0.07 mg\/g compound 1 in DMSO. Thirty minutes after this first injection, each mouse was injected i.p. with 2-(F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (F-2-DG; 150 \u03bcCurie, 100 \u03bcL in HO). After another 15 minutes, the mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen and transferred to a R-4 Rodent Scanner Micro-PET (CTI Concorde Microsystems, Inc.; Knoxville, Tenn., United States of America). Three mice from each group (i.e., compound 1 treated or control) were studied.  shows micro-PET images taken of a representative compound 1-treated mouse and a representative control group mouse.","As shown in , compound 1 treatment significantly diminished F-2-DG uptake within the xenograft as compared to the control group mouse. A difference in cardiac F-2-DG uptake was also observed between the compound 1-treated and control group mice. Echocardiograms were performed as described in Dawn et al., 102, 3766-3771 (2005). Echocardiographic examination of cardiac function in the mice revealed no acute changes in ejection fraction (Control (Vehicle): 69%\u00b14%; Compound 1: 71%\u00b16%). Thus the difference in cardiac glucose uptake does not appear to be the result of cardiotoxicity of compound 1. Overall, it appears that 1 targets PFK2 activity in vivo resulting in a reduced glycolytic phenotype.","Transgenic MMTV-Neu Breast Tumor mice develop breast adenocarcinomas within 3-4 months of birth and rely on the transgenic expression of oncogenic Neu under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter\/enhancer. These mice more closely mimic human cancer relative to xenograft models as a result of the insidious nature of their tumor growth and the lack of artifact caused by tissue culture conditions.","To determine the effects of compound 1 on transgenic MMTV-Neu breast tumor mice, the relative tumor frequency and bulk in the transgenic mice was determined after 4 months and the mice were randomized into two groups with equal tumor burden. One group of mice were administered compound 1 daily in repeating cycles of 3 days on, 3 days off (0.07 mg\/gm in DMSO; intraperitoneal administration; see arrows; until tumor mass exceeds 10% of body mass). Control mice were injected with vehicle control (DMSO alone). Tumor masses were determined according to the following established formula: mass (mg)=(width, mm\u00d7length, m)\/2.

described herein to kill or inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells was measured using either the MTT assay, the Alamar Blue assay, or the Cell Titer Glow\u00ae assay using 48 or 72 hours exposure. Results for different cancer cell lines are shown in the Tables 4 and 5 below and demonstrate that these compounds inhibit cancer cell proliferation at low nanomolar concentrations across many types of cancer cell lines. The procedures are briefly described below. Cells of the desired tumor cell line were plated at 2\u00d710cells\/ml in 96 well plates. Twice the indicated concentrations of the compounds of the invention were added to cells the following day in an equal volume of media. 72 hours later, cells were lysed and subjected to ATP determination using the CellTiter Glo-Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Experiments were done in triplicate. When using the MTT assay or the Alamar blue assay, the experimental conditions are essentially similar; at the end of the incubation period, 20 microl of the MTT solution is added per well and the samples are incubated for an additional four hours, rinsed and the absorbance at 570 nm measured. Results for the inhibition of cells proliferation are reported as IC50 as commonly done (the concentration leading to a 50% inhibition of proliferation of the cell population) and are listed in the Tables below. Table 4 lists the IC50 for the compounds of the invention in several cell lines including Jurkat, Calu-6, NCI-H82, U937, or NCI-H1437 cancer cell lines.

Surprisingly, results show that the solubility of compounds of the invention, despite some structural similarities to PFK-015, have enhanced solubility profiles that enable treating cancer patients via parenteral administration. The increase in solubility when comparing the effect of chemical substituents is unpredictable and surprising if one compares the solubility values of PFK-070 to PFK-091 and PFK-070 to PFK-141 and 145 in a dosing solution that could be used to treat cancer patients (See Table 8A below). Briefly, selected compounds of the invention are dissolved in a small volume of the solvents\/excipients of interest (Cremophor, or Cremophor:etoh or Tween80:etoh) at room temperature and diluted 1:9 in saline and left at room temperature for over 8 or 24 hours. Both the physical (absence of a precipitate) and the chemical stability (less than 5% degradation) of the solutions are measured (observation and HPLC after filtration). Studies using Cremophor and D5W (5% glucose in water for injection) or Tween 80 with either Saline or D5W lead to comparable results in solubility and similar differences between PFK-015 and the compounds of the invention.","Furthermore, the solution stability of the compounds was investigated and it was discovered that, in normal conditions, they lack the appropriate solution stability as they undergo a rapid photoisomerization; this lack of solution stability is such that methods to prevent these compounds from reacting in solutions are necessary if these compounds are to be used as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer patients. Surprisingly, this lack of solution stability was not previously appreciated; the use of amber or dark glass containers, amber IV bags and tubings, or amber over-pouches, limits the UV-visible

Blood samples were collected at different intervals. Plasma samples were extracted and analyzed using an LC-MS\/MS method. Similar protocols were used for the rats (Sprague Dawley rats) or dogs (beagles) PK studies; in the case of dogs PK studies, the number of animals per group was three.

Several tumor models were used in these studies (the Lewis Lung Carcinoma or LLC model, the human glioblastoma xenograft U87MG tumor model, or the murine CT26 colon cancer model). The experimental protocol for the U87MG study is described below. Subsequent to subcutaneous inoculation of tumor cells, tumors started to develop and once tumors reached the desired volume of 150-200 mmon average, treatment was initiated. Tumor volume was monitored in both groups and the average for both the control and treatment groups three times a week as well as body weights.","Briefly, athymic nude mice at 7-8 weeks of age were used for the study. Mice were housed in microisolator housing, with food and water provided as libitum, and quarantined for 4 days prior to the initiation of the study. U87MG cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. Cells at 80% confluence were harvested using 0.25% trypsin\/EDTA solution, washed once with PBS and resuspended in a mixture of serum-free medium\/Matrigel (1:1 by volume) at a density of 3\u00d710cells\/100 \u03bcl. 4 groups of 10 mice each were used in that experiment. U87MG cells suspended in 100 \u03bcl of a mixture of medium\/Matrigel (1:1) were subcutaneously implanted in the right flank region. Animals were monitored for tumor growth daily after cell implantation. When tumor volumes reached approximately 150 mm3, mice were randomized into 2 groups of 8 mice each using only mice having tumor volumes closest to the mean value. Tumor volumes were measured using the formula V=L\u00d7W\u00d7H\u00d7\u03c0\/6, where L and W represent the longer and shorter diameters of the tumor and H represents the height of the tumor. Treatment began following randomization. ACT-PFK-092 was administered IP at a dose of 20 mg\/kg on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Animals were observed for possible toxic effect from the drug treatment. Body weights were recorded and showed that the compounds were very well tolerated.
