Flow control device  includes a housing  containing various measuring components and a control panel , although the measuring components may be exterior of housing . Measuring components include, but are not limited to temperature sensors ,  and pressure sensors , , and may also include mass sensors (not shown) or sensors to measure other fluid parameters. In one embodiment, flow control device  is secured to a manifold  to which is also secured a filter housing  and a manifold  for filtering pressurized fluid flow through flow control device .","In one embodiment, pressure and\/or temperature sensors may be combined into a single device.","As used herein, the term \u201cmeasuring pressure\u201d in the context of measuring pressure at each of two locations, is intended to include a pressure measurement at a first location and a differential pressure measurement between the first and second locations.","As further shown in , a pressurized fluid  from a pressurized fluid source, such as a chamber  of known volume, is directed through a passageway  formed in manifold  upon the opening of a valve . Pressure sensor  is immediately adjacent to and in fluid communication with pressurized fluid  via passageway  bridging passageway  and sensor . Similarly, one leg of differential pressure sensor  is in fluid communication with pressurized fluid  via passageway  bridging passageway  and pressure sensor . In one embodiment, a bypass outlet  is in fluid communication with passageway  to further direct pressurized fluid , if desired. Pressurized fluid  is further directed through passageway  and then passageway  before flowing into filter housing  and then through filter element or filter  to remove particulates entrained in pressurized fluid .","After passing through filter , pressurized fluid  becomes filtered fluid . Upon passing through filter , filtered fluid  is then directed through passageway . The other leg of differential pressure sensor  is in fluid communication with filtered fluid  via passageway  bridging passageway  and differential pressure sensor  so that differential pressure sensor  measures the difference in pressure between pressurized fluid  and filtered fluid . In one embodiment, a bypass outlet  is in fluid communication with passageway  to further direct filtered fluid , if desired. Filtered fluid  is further directed through passageway  in fluid communication with passageway , which fluid referred to as pressurized fluid . For ease of description and convenience, the pressure value or magnitude as sensed by pressure sensor  is referred to as P and the pressure value or magnitude as sensed by the one leg of pressure sensor  in communication with passageway , which is pressurized fluid , is P. The pressure value P refers to the backpressure downstream in fluid system . It is to be understood that while pressurized fluid  (P) is shown in  upstream of filter  and pressurized fluid  (P), and that the pressure value or magnitude of pressurized fluid  (P) is greater than the pressure value or magnitude of pressurized fluid  (P), both the pressure magnitudes and thus, directions of travel of the pressurized fluids, may be reversed.","As further shown in , flow control device  operates as follows. After valve  is opened, pressure values or magnitudes of pressurized fluid  (P) from chamber  are sensed or measured by pressure sensor  at predetermined time intervals, while differential pressure values or magnitudes between pressurized fluid  (P) and pressurized fluid  (P) are substantially simultaneously sensed or measured. For convenience, this differential pressure corresponding to locations of pressurized fluids ,  disposed on opposite sides of filter  is referred to in  as \u0394P. Similarly, temperature values corresponding to positions in close proximity of pressurized fluids  (P),  (P), if required, are sensed or measured by temperature sensors ,  (T, T) at predetermined time intervals substantially simultaneously as the pressurized fluid measurements.","Once the temperature\/pressure measurements are performed, the pressure sensors ,  and temperature sensors ,  transmit signals corresponding to those measurements to an amplifier\/converter  to amplify and\/or convert the signals from analog to digital form, if required. In one embodiment, signals  from other devices (not shown) permitting mass flow measurement, such as precision mass measurement devices or a mass spectrometer, may be transmitted to amplifier\/converter  to amplify and\/or convert the signals  from analog to digital form, if required.","After the various signals, e.g., P, \u0394P, T, T, are transmitted from amplifier\/converter  to microprocessor , and saved in a storage device , such as an EEPROM, various calculations are performed as is known in the art, such as volumetric fluid flow from chamber  over time versus differential pressure, for example by application of Equation 7 to yield a filter permeability constant (e.g., see Kof ). Once the filter permeability constant value K is calculated, it may be stored and\/or compared to previously stored filter permeability constant values in storage device . In one embodiment, a time reference corresponding to each calculated filter permeability constant value K is saved and compared in order to determine when subsequent filter permeability calculations should be performed, based on historical data. That is, over time, filter permeability values K, i.e., the slopes of the curves shown in , decrease. , which is a graphical representation of the life cycle of a filter, further shows an operational region  and a \u201creplacement recommended\u201d region . For example, filter permeability curve Kcorresponds to an initial filter permeability curve, such as when the filter is new and substantially unclogged or uncontaminated with particulates. A significant portion of the filter permeability curve Kis contained in the operational region  of . However, a significant portion of the filter permeability curve K3 i.e., the third calibration of the filter, is contained in the replacement recommended region , and is near the end of its operating life. Due to the accumulation of data in storage device , trends relating to filter life are identified, seeking a balance between minimizing the number of filter monitoring cycles, which can result in shut-down of portions of fluid system , and probability of operating filters in a replacement recommended region , or filter failure.","It is appreciated that electrical power required to operate components of flow control device may be provided by an electrical power source , which includes, but is not limited to, a power grid, batteries or other sources. Additionally, in one embodiment, a transceiver  may receive and exchange information such as from a digital bus, which may be transmitted over power lines or other wired or wireless devices and\/or techniques.","In order to minimize or eliminate shut-down of a portion of fluid system  while a filter  is being replaced, flow control device  may include multiple modules  (only one shown in ). In one embodiment, multiple modules  are disposed in a parallel flow arrangement, such that one module  may be maintained in fluid communication with the fluid system  while the other modules  are selectably isolated, such as by use of valving arrangements (not shown) to replace filters  or to perform a filter monitoring cycle without disturbing operation of the fluid system. In one embodiment, module  includes a filter housing  (and filter ), manifolds ,  and corresponding sensors , , , , although the sensors may have multiple leads, with the leads corresponding to the operating module remaining on-line being active. Therefore, in another embodiment of module , the only components include a filter housing  (and filter ), associated manifolds ,  and sensor leads.","As shown in , which is otherwise similar to , filter housing  abuts and is in fluid communication with pressure sensors , . As a result, manifolds ,  from  are not required. A removable cap  abuts filter housing  and filter  and is in fluid communication with both filter  and one leg of differential pressure sensor  by virtue of tee passageway . Upon removal of cap , filter  can be replaced. Pressurized fluid  (P) is provided directly into filter housing , the volume between filter  and the inner surfaces of filter housing  defining a chamber  being a known volume in one embodiment. An optional bypass  can be used to evacuate pressurized fluid  in fluid housing .","It is to be understood that the filter permeability K decreases over time in response to becoming gradually more clogged, and must therefore be monitored, as the equations must account for the change in filter permeability to provide accurate information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["68","45","70","66","46","44","76"]},"The following steps are followed to monitor or re-calibrate the filter permeability K as follows.\n\n","It is to be understood that in one embodiment of flow control device  where the filter  is not substantially contaminated or clogged and fluid viscosity is sufficiently low, such as less than about 100 centipoise and exhibiting Newtonian behavior, i.e., substantially devoid of shear thinning or thickening, the flow control device  can obtain an inferential value of the viscosity of the fluid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["68","45","70","66","46","44","76"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["1) Valve  is opened and valve  is closed, until a maximum, stable pressure value is achieved therebetween.","2) Valve  is closed and valve  opened, permitting pressurized fluid in chamber  to become filtered fluid  flowing through filter  until the differential pressure measured by differential pressure sensor  is substantially zero.
