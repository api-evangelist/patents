No. 60\/946,873, filed Jun. 28, 2007, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference.","The CBreceptor is one of the most abundant neuromodulatory receptors in the brain, and is expressed at high levels in the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia (e.g., Wilson et al., 2002, vol. 296, 678-682). Selective CBreceptor antagonists, for example pyrazole derivatives such as rimonabant (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,984), can be used to treat various conditions, such as obesity and metabolic syndrome (e.g., Bensaid et al., 2003 vol. 63, no. 4, pp. 908-914; Trillou et al., 2002 vol. 284, R345-R353; Kirkham, 2002 vol. 284, R343-R344), neuroinflammatory disorders (e.g., Adam, et al., 2002, vol. 12, no. 10, 1475-1489; U.S. Pat. No. 6,642,258), cognitive disorders and psychosis (e.g., Adam et al., 2002, vol. 12, pp. 1475-1489), addiction (e.g., smoking cessation; U.S. Patent Publ. 2003\/0087933), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Lange et al., 2004, vol. 47, 627-643) and cardiovascular conditions (e.g., Porter et al., 2001 vol. 90, 45-60; Sanofi-Aventis Publication, Bear Stearns Conference, New York, Sep. 14, 2004, pages 19-24).","There now exists extensive pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the use of CB1 receptor antagonists\/inverse agonists for the treatment of obesity.","Preparations of marijuana () have been used for over 5000 years for both medicinal and recreational purposes. The major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana has been identified as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), one of a member of over 60 related cannabinoid compounds isolated from this plant. It has been demonstrated that delta-9-THC exerts its effects via agonist interaction with cannabinoid (CB) receptors. So far, two cannabinoid receptor subtypes have been characterised (CBand CB). The CBreceptor subtype is found predominantly in the central nervous system, and to a lesser extent in the peripheral nervous system and various peripheral organs. The CBreceptor subtype is found predominantly in lymphoid tissues and cells. To date, three endogenous agonists (endocannabinoids) have been identified which interact with both CBand CBreceptors (anandamide, 2-arachidonyl glycerol and noladin ether).","Genetically obese rats and mice exhibit markedly elevated endocannabinoid levels in brain regions associated with ingestive behaviour (Di Marzo et al. 2001 Nature 410: 822-825). Furthermore, increased levels of endocannabinoids are observed upon the fasting of normal, lean animals (Kirkham et al., British Journal of Pharmacology 2002, 136(4) 550-557).","Exogenous application of endocannabinoids leads to the same physiological effects observed with delta-9-THC treatment, including appetite stimulation (Jamshida et al., British Journal of Pharmacology 2001, 134: 1151-1 154), analgesia, hypolocomotion, hypothermia, and catalepsy.","CB(CB\u2212\/\u2212) and CB(CB\u2212\/\u2212) receptor knockout mice have been used to elucidate the specific role of the two cannabinoid receptor subtypes. Furthermore, for ligands such as delta-9-THC which act as agonists at both receptors, these mice have allowed identification of which receptor subtype is mediating specific physiological effects. CB\u2212\/\u2212, but not CB\u2212\/\u2212, mice are resistant to the behavioural effects of agonists such as delta-9-THC. CB\u2212\/\u2212 animals have also been shown to be resistant to both the body weight gain associated with chronic high fat diet exposure, and the appetite-stimulating effects of acute food deprivation.","These findings suggest a clear role for both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid receptor agonists in increasing food intake and body weight via selective activation of the CBreceptor subtype.","The therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been extensively reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 1998, 8, 3010-313; Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2000, 10, 1529-1538; Trends in Pharm. Sci. 2000, 2 1, 218-224; Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2002, 12(10), 1475-1489).","At least one compound (SR-14171 6A; Rimonabant) characterised as a CBreceptor antagonist\/inverse agonist is known to be in clinical trials for the treatment of obesity.","Clinical trials with the CBreceptor antagonist rimonabant have also observed an antidiabetic action that exceeds that accounted for by weight loss alone (Scheen A. J., et al., Lancet, 2006 in press). CBreceptor mRNA is located on \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells in the Islets of Langerhans and it has been reported that CBreceptor agonists reduce insulin release from pancreatic beta cells in vitro in response to a glucose load (Juan-Pico et al, Cell Calcium, 39, (2006), 155-162). Consistent with this, Bermudez-Siva et al., (Eur J Pharmacol., 531 (2006), 282-284) have reported that CBreceptor agonists increase glucose intolerance following ip injection of a glucose load to rats. This effect was reversed by a CBreceptor antagonist that increased glucose tolerance in the test when given alone. Thus, the action of rimonabant may be due to a direct action on the pancreas. It is also possible that CBreceptor antagonists affect insulin sensitivity indirectly via an action on adiponectin (Chandran et al., Diabetes care, 26, (2003), 2442-2450) which is elevated by CBreceptor antagonists (Cota et al., J Clin Invest., 112 (2003), 423-431; Bensaid et al., Mol Pharmacol., 63 (2003, 908-914). Indeed, it has been reported that endocannabinoid levels are enhanced in the pancreas and adipose tissue of obese and diabetic mice and in the plasma and adipose tissue of obese or type 2 diabetic patients (Matias et al., J Clin Endocrinol and Metab., 9 1 (2006), 3171-3180) suggesting a possible causal role of elevated cannabinoid tone in the onset of type 2 diabetes.","However, there is still a need for improved cannabinoid agents, particularly selective CB receptor antagonists, with fewer side-effects and improved efficacy.","WO 95125443, U.S. Pat.

Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, 5(1), article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I.R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).","The compounds of Formula (I) form salts that are also within the scope of this invention.

Also, those of ordinary skill In the art will recognize any compounds of the present invention that may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls). Such atropisomers are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column.","Compounds of Formula (I), and salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether).

Tritiated (i.e., H) and carbon-14 (i.e., C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.

Non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. For saturation studies, concentrations of H-CP55,940 ranging from 0.1-5 nM were incubated with membranes in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM CP55,940. Assays were terminated after incubation for 1 \u00bd hours by rapid filtration onto 0.3% polyethylenamine treated GF\/C filterplates using a BRANDEL cell harvester. The plates were dried and MICROSCINT scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a TOPCOUNT scintillation counter.","The dissociation constant (K) of H-CP55,940 at the CBand CBreceptor were determined by plotting specific binding at each concentration of radioligand, and analysis by non-linear regression. For competition studies, the concentration of each drug that inhibited 50 percent of H-CP55,940 binding (IC) was determined by non-linear regression analysis of the radioligand displacement curves. Affinity constants (K) were calculated using the equation derived by Cheng and Prusoff (1973), defined as: IC\/1+[conc. ligand\/K].","GTP\u03b3S Binding Protocol","The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP\u03b3S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate (GTP) is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right, with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose-response curve of the agonist.","Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist. The membranes were then pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound for 30 minutes to determine if they were capable of stimulating phosphorylation alone. Increasing concentrations of the non-selective cannabinoid agonist WIN55,122 were then added in the presence or absence of each concentration of test compound. The assay was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To complete the assay, S-GTP\u03b3S was added and the assay incubated for another 30 minutes. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration onto 10 mM sodium phosphate-treated GF\/C filterplates using a Brandel cell harvester. The plates were dried and Microscint scintillation cocktail was added, after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a Topcount scintillation counter.","The stimulation of S-GTP\u03b3S binding as a function of the concentration of the agonist WIN55,122, in the absence and presence of test compound, was plotted and the ECdetermined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. A Schild analysis of the rightward shift in the dose response curve of WIN55,122 in the presence of test compound was determined by plotting the concentration of test compound against the negative log of the dose ratio [1-(ECagonist+test compound\/EC50 of agonist alone)]. A linear regression analysis yields the Kb, defined as the X-intercept of the linear equation.","The following compounds of Formula (I) shown in Table 23, below, were prepared according to one or more methods reported above.
