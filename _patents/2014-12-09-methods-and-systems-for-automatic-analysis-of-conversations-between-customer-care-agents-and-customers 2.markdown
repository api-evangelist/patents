{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The presently disclosed embodiments relate to customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and more particularly to methods and systems for automatically analyzing conversations between social CRM agents and customers.","Customer Relationship Management (CRM) relates to various models and technologies for managing a company's relationships with its existing, past, and future customers. Some related art CRM systems automate, organize, and synchronize marketing, sales, customer service, and technical support. Customer engagement can be a critical component of social CRM solutions, wherein customer care agents contact customers via social media, and resolve their issues by engaging in asynchronous conversations with the customers. Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers to share their opinions and experiences with a company, products and services. The social media is a platform that connects millions of users together, and allows them to exchange and share common interests, topics or events. These platforms had been developed for private usage among users, and later emerged as a new communication and marketing vector for the companies. Social media has grown at a consistent rate, and has become very relevant in the context of brand information.","Related art CRM solutions\/systems provide a mechanism for the customer care agents to engage in conversations with customers to address their issues via telephone calls. Two new communication channels that were later used by CRM teams include synchronous online chat and emails provided by social media. CRM solutions need to constantly monitor the conversations, mainly for two components of the conversation, in order to provide an effective engagement. First, the status of the issue (issue status tracking) that is relevant to the conversation relates to customer satisfaction. Second, the nature of the dialogues (dialogue act tracking) engaged in by the agents relate to the effectiveness of the customer care agents and the conversation.","The issue status tracking is significant because interaction between a customer and a customer care agent takes place over a long period of time, during which the agent needs to return to the issues multiple times and address the customer's concern. Since one agent is usually involved with thousands of users at the same time, the agent needs to return to only the open issues. The agent should not spend time checking the resolved issues. Given the large number of customers and their data, it is important that the process of figuring out which issues are open and which are closed is automated. The dialogue act problem is important because it determines the nature of the dialogue that agents engage in with the customer. For example, the dialogue can be a simple greeting message, an acknowledgement, or a more involved statement that addresses the issue in a technical way. This dialogue act component helps CRM solutions to determine the effectiveness of the customer care agents and of conversations.","Typically, machine learning methods, such as supervised classification techniques, are employed to analyze these conversations that can track and measure effectiveness of these conversations in terms of issue resolution (issue status) and the nature of the dialogues that customer care agents engage in (i.e., dialogue act). However, due to the very sparse and informal nature of these social media conversations, existing machine learning techniques are not very accurate in terms of detecting issues status and dialogue act.","Usually, to determine the status of an issue, a supervised machine learning based technique is employed to learn a model from the issues whose statuses are already identified, and the statuses of the incoming issues are identified based using the learnt model. Similarly, a model (separate from the issues tracking model) is learned to address the dialogue act problem. However, intuitively, these two tasks are closely related, and they share similarities in feature space, i.e., most of the issues that are resolved end with customer thanking for agent's help. Therefore, it makes more sense to learn these two tasks simultaneously. That is, labels assigned to issue resolution task (or status issue task) can help to learn a better model for dialogue act task (or nature of the conversation task), and vice versa. In this disclosure, a multi-task learning method is disclosed, which learns from such two tasks that share features, simultaneously, and show that the learning of two tasks simultaneously can improve the accuracy for both tasks.","An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for automatically analyzing conversations between multiple users. The method includes receiving, by a data collecting module, a training dataset having a natural language text sequence including a number of sentences of a conversation between the users. Each of the sentences includes a number of words.

Some examples of a channel include a phone line, a cellular phone link, an RF link, a network interface, a local or wide area network, and other communications channels. What is important is that the various computers and peripherals can interact to perform various document services.","The computing system  further includes input\/output devices  such as a keyboard and a mouse that enables a user to enter data and instructions into the computing system , a display device that enables the user to view the available information, and a printer that enables the user to print any data for his reference. Alternatively, input\/output devices  may include a touch sensitive display that enables a user to enter data and instructions into the computing system  as well as to view the available information.","In this document, the terms \u201ccomputer program product\u201d and \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d may be used generally to refer to media such as, for example, the memory , the storage device , the storage unit , or signal(s) on the channel . These and other forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor  for execution. Such instructions, generally referred to as \u201ccomputer program code\u201d (which may be grouped in the form of computer programs or other groupings), when executed, enable computing system  to perform features or functions of embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.","In an embodiment where the elements are implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer-readable medium and loaded into the computing system  using, for example, removable storage drive , the drive  or the communications interface . The control logic (in this example, software instructions or computer program code), when executed by processor , causes processor  to perform the functions of the disclosed subject matter as described herein.","An aspect of the present disclosure allows real-time computation of content based metrics for the conversation that happen between the customer care agent(s) and the customer(s) (or users).","Another aspect of the present disclosure, not only exploits the label dependency factor but also learns the multiple tasks simultaneously by explicitly sharing the parameters corresponding to the label dependency factor. In the proposed methods, one model is learnt for each task. Each model may include a set of factors for its own task with one additional factor for the label dependency part. The parameters corresponding to the label dependency factor is common among all tasks.","A yet another aspect of the present disclosure provides an unshared version model where there is no parameter sharing but only label dependency is there.","A further aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for learning from shared tasks for sequence labeling tasks.","In an embodiment, the determined value of the parameters is evaluated. The values may be evaluated by comparing the results of the disclosed systems (or models) with state of the art baselines and report results. Accuracy may be used as a metric for evaluation. Further, a test dataset may be used for evaluating the accuracy of the values of the parameters or labeling. Accuracy may be defined as fraction of correctly labeled tokens\/sentences in sequence present in bigrams present in the test set.","It will be understood that the modules and the databases referred to in the previous sections are not necessarily utilized together in a single conversation analysis system. Rather, these modules are merely exemplary of the various modules that may be implemented within a conversation analysis system. Further, it will be understood that the conversation analysis module may include more modules than the ones described in this disclosure without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","It will be appreciated that several of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations, or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art, which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
