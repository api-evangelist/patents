No. 10\/645,821, filed Aug. 20, 2003.","The invention generally relates to printers that have embedded functionality for printing multimedia data.","A printer in a computer system typically is seen as handling the mechanics of physically outputting information on a medium, typically paper. The printer is somewhat of a passive participant in the computer system. Printers handle a bit of higher level control for controlling printing such as keeping a queue of documents to be printed, indicating the toner is low, or providing an out-of-paper message. Printers do not typically provide any assistance with processing actual content for printing on an output medium.","Knowledge workers are now making increasing use of multimedia data, particularly in reports and presentations. The multimedia data typically includes time based data sometimes also referred to as time based media, examples of which include audio clips, animations, and video clips. A computer, typically a desktop computer or a laptop, connected to the printer via a network interface or a direct connection, has to have the necessary hardware and\/or software for modifying the multimedia content for printing, formatting that content for a desired medium, and selecting the desired medium upon which to imprint the content. If users at different computers in a network desire to perform multimedia content processing functions and output to different media, the different computers each have to have the appropriate hardware and\/or software. Furthermore, their computers have to handle the computational load required for multimedia content processing and for supporting specific formats for storing and printing multimedia content.","It is desirable to offload at least part of the computational load to an intelligent printer that can perform multimedia content processing, particularly for time-based data, such as editing and content formatting independently from a computer to which it is connected. It is desirable also that the printer provides a variety of output media options. It is also desirable that the printer can provide storage for the various forms of output media for example in a multimedia content database. A printer that can independently maintain a multimedia database provides streamlined storage of the multimedia content.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a printer with an embedded multimedia server. One embodiment of the printer with an embedded multimedia server comprises a chassis for housing a print engine, a multimedia server, a non-volatile storage device for storing a database of multimedia content, and a user input device accessible on the printer chassis. In this embodiment, the print engine controls printing to a plurality of media storage forms, including removable storage media forms. The print engine is coupled to at least one media holder and is communicatively coupled to the multimedia server. The user interface device is communicatively coupled to the multimedia server. The multimedia server is communicatively coupled to at least one media content interface through which it receives multimedia content from one or more media content sources. This embodiment can further comprise a display accessible on the printer chassis and communicatively coupled to the multimedia server for displaying data under the control of the server.","In one instance, the multimedia server also includes a multimedia database manager which is communicatively coupled to the non-volatile storage medium storing the database. In another instance, there is at least one network interface communicatively coupled to the multimedia server which includes a web server. In another example, the multimedia server further comprises a web browser which displays data on the display accessible on the printer chassis.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for processing multimedia content for use in a printer with an embedded multimedia server. One embodiment of such a method in accordance with the present invention comprises performing multimedia content processing, and outputting a content selection based on criteria. Another embodiment of a method in accordance with the present invention further comprises generating an index document for the content selection based on criteria. Another method embodiment further comprises monitoring time based multimedia content based on criteria.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","100","102","140","106","104","108","114","116","152","102","148","102","136","102","150","102","142","102"]},"The print engine  is communicatively coupled to the multimedia server  on the motherboard  in this embodiment. The print engine  includes a processor , which can be a general purpose computer processor, a local memory , and at least one media form reader\/writer , examples of which include a DVD reader\/writer, a CD reader\/writer, a SD reader\/writer, an audio cassette reader\/writer, a videocassette reader\/writer, a floppy disk reader\/writer, a ZIP disk reader\/writer, a flash card reader\/writer, a micro-drive reader\/writer, and a memory stick reader\/writer. Other examples of media forms that may be read or written to are paper, plastic sheets, magnetic strips, or any other suitable type of removable storage media devices. In this embodiment, selected content to be printed is downloaded to the local memory  by the multimedia server  to the print engine . In another embodiment, the multimedia server  can be accessed by a media content interface  for transferring content data. For example, the media content interface  can include a broadband network interface through which an external computing device  such as a laptop or personal digital assistant (PDA) receives or sends time-based media data. In this example, the at least one removable storage medium holder  is controlled by the print engine  for the printing processing. For example, the print engine  controls the positioning of a medium for reading and writing. Examples of a removable media holder  are a tray or bandolier configured for holding one or more forms of removable storage media.","The display  accessible on the printer chassis is communicatively coupled to the multimedia server  for displaying data under its control. In another embodiment, the display  is also communicatively coupled to the print engine  for displaying data under its control as well. The user input device  is communicatively coupled to the multimedia server  for receiving input which can indicate user preferences and criteria for content based processing. The input device  can include one or more of the following examples: a pointing device, buttons, a touch screen, a speech recognition system with a microphone, a keypad, or a keyboard or any other suitable input device. In another example, the device  is also communicatively coupled to the print engine  to receive user input directed to controlling the printing process such as the number of copies. In another example, the multimedia server  can handle all user input.","The multimedia server  can be implemented in hardware, software, firmware or a combination of both. Preferably, software associated with multimedia server  is executed on a separate processor from the processor  within the print engine . Again, a general purpose computer processor can be used. The multimedia server  performs multimedia content processing, and manages the database  of multimedia content. The multimedia server  is communicatively coupled to receive content data for different types of media in different formats, particularly time-based multimedia content data, from media content sources  via at least one media content interface . Additionally, the multimedia server  can send content data for different types of media in different formats, particularly time-based multimedia content data, to media content recipients  via at least one media content interface . Preferably, the media content interface  includes a broadband network interface. One example of multimedia content processing that the server  can perform is receiving content data in one format, and converting it to another format for output on a removable storage medium, storage in another form in the database , or for relaying over a media content interface , for example, a network interface to another storage location. For example, if the printer  receives information from a Bluetooth device, like an Anoto pen, the server  saves the data in a portable document format (PDF) in the database  or relays it as a PDF over a network interface  to another storage location for downloading later on the user's home computer. Such a relay function could be very useful for Bluetooth video cameras, cell phones with cameras that also have Bluetooth interfaces, and any other Bluetooth-enabled device. Relaying of data can be done for a batch re-transmission of stored recorded data, as controlled by a touch panel interface  on the printer, or for a live re-transmission as data is being recorded.","In the illustrated embodiment, the multimedia server  comprises a media content presenter , examples of which include software capable of displaying fixed content such as text, a photo, or a diagram on the display , software and\/or hardware for playing video data on the display  or software and\/or hardware for playing audio data through the speaker .","The media content interface  can be designed to accommodate various formats for multimedia data including time-based data. Because of the great variety of types and formats of media data, the media content interface  may take any number of forms. The following are some illustrative examples of different media content interfaces . In particular implementations, the printer  may have only one or only a subset of these types of interfaces. One example is a network interface for receiving data over a network, for example a computer network (e.g., internal company network or the Internet, or a computer connection relaying data originating from other content capture sources such as cellular telephones, a TV receiver, or a satellite, or a GPS receiver.) The interface may comprise a port for connecting a device using a connection type such as USB, serial, FireWire, SCSI, IDE, RJ11, optical, composite video, component video, or S-video or any other suitable connection type. A media content interface can also include a frame grabber for accessing data from a composite video source. In another example, a transcoder may also be used for accessing data from a composite video source. In one example, the transcoder is implemented in hardware that converts an MPEG-2 file to a streamable format in real-time. An example of such hardware is the Via Technologies MPEG encoding chip provided in the Abocom HA2500 Multimedia Gateway. The same transcoding function could be provided in software. Another example of an interface , includes an NTSC converter for converting to digital form data from a VGA port. Another example of an interface  includes an analog to digital converter for transforming analog voice signals from a microphone to a digital format, for example a streaming format. An analog to digital converter could also be used to convert an image directly from a video recorder into a digital format. In another example, the interface  may comprise a media processing system for converting, encoding and compressing raw video data.","In another example, the interface  may comprise a USB port for receiving data from a pen-based data capture system and a pen capture module. In one embodiment, the pen capture module includes ultrasonic pen capture hardware and the multimedia server  includes logic to interface with the ultrasonic pen capture system. An example of an ultrasonic pen capture system is one provided by InkLink.","Another embodiment of the interface  may include one or more wireless communication interfaces, examples of which may include RF interface(s) such as Bluetooth, 802.11 standards, 802.15 standards, 802.16 standards, satellite communications, and cellular network communications such as 3G and 4G and GPRS. Another wireless example is an infrared (IR) interface.","For more examples of media content interfaces, see U.S. patent application entitled \u201cPrinter Having Embedded Functionality for Printing Time-Based Media,\u201d filed Mar. 30, 2004 application Ser. No. 10\/814,931 which has been incorporated by reference in its entirety.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","168","168","136","116","168","104","116"]},"For more examples of embedded data capture devices, see U.S. patent application entitled \u201cPrinter Having Embedded Functionality for Printing Time-Based Media,\u201d filed Mar. 30, 2004 application Ser.

Its event handler  can be implemented in one example as an application programming interface (API) which receives notifications (e.g. in the form of messages) from the other software portions or interfaces indicating the occurrence of an event. For example, the user interface software  processes input from the user input device  or input from display , which may include a touch screen or have a pointing device such as a mouse or stylus attached to it. The user interface software  forwards the input to the event handler  which forwards it to the software portion(s) to which it applies. Furthermore, the user interface software , updates the display in accordance instructions or data received from another software portion, for example, the web browser  in the web server . In another example, the scheduling software  notifies the event handler  that a designated time for printing a content selection has been reached or soon will be. The event handler  notifies the database manager  which in turn retrieves the content selection into local memory , and the control unit  sends a message to the print engine  which in turn prints the content selection on the designated medium at the designated time.","The database manager  stores and retrieves content selections as well as creates meta-data associated with each content selection to identify it or maintain instructions associated with it. An example of a content selection is a video file, an audio file, or a text file.","The application(s)  can be user created applications.","The content indexing portion  generates a content index document that can be printed as a paper document. The index document can also be printed on other tangible media such as transparency sheets for overhead projectors, film, slides, canvass, glass, stickers, or any other medium that accepts such markings. A paper representation is easy to browse by a user. The information contained in the content index document can take various forms based on criteria established by a user or an application. Examples of information that can be represented in a content index document are an inventory of one or more categories of content selections stored in the database  or in the local memory  for the multimedia server , detected events, a time line of events, the location of key data in the content or information about a transaction (e.g. a relay transmission between a source and a recipient) regarding the content. In one example, an index document includes portions of multimedia content such as audio clips or video clips printed on the paper. Other identifying information can also be included examples of which are titles, names of participants, times, event detected (e.g. door opened.), or size of content selection or portion. In another example, a bar code is included for each clip indicating to a multimedia player reading the content selection the location of the clip on the medium. In one example, bar codes can be provided that fully encode the digital contents of the full resolution key frame. In another example, the bar codes can provide a link to a version stored off-line. A paper document with video images is often called a video paper document. A paper document with audio images is often called an audio paper document. Various examples of index documents, in particular audio paper and video paper are illustrated in the Video Paper patent applications.","The web server  provides content to a web browser , or any other remote web browser across a network and access for hosts on the World Wide Web or the Internet for the multimedia server . A user may access external websites by indicating selections via the display  or the input device  in conjunction with the display  which may be forwarded to the server  or to some other server of the Internet.","The streaming server  interacts with digital data to be input to format it in a streaming format for display under the control of the player . The streaming server  can also perform tasks such as monitoring streamed data based on criteria. Examples of criteria include event detection or the elapsing of a time period.","The multimedia content editing portion  performs tasks such as segmenting a clip from an audio or a video content selection as well as text editing capabilities or adding sounds or images to a content selection.","The multimedia correlation portion  performs tasks such as correlating video content to audio content based on a criteria such as a time period, a location, a participant or other criteria.","The multimedia format transformation portion  performs tasks related to transforming content in one format to another format. For example, a portion of text can be converted from html to speech in a streaming audio format or voice XML. Similarly, data from a satellite transmission can be represented on a streaming format for printing to a DVD.","The multimedia compression portion  performs services such as compressing content for storage in the database or printing on a removable storage medium (SD) and subsequently decompressing content for playback on the player  for example.","The multimedia content recognition software portion  performs recognition functions for various forms of media. For example, for audio content, it can apply voice matching methods such as voice signatures, and speech recognition methods. For handwritten text, it can include handwriting recognition methods. For video, it may, for example, employ scene or face recognition methods.","The multimedia content searching software portion  performs searching functions for multimedia content. For example, it can perform text searching. Similarly, voice signatures can be searched as well as recognized sounds or faces or other recognized visual images.","The following figures illustrate embodiments of methods for multimedia content processing by an embedded multimedia server in a printer in accordance with the present invention. For illustrative purposes only, the method embodiments illustrated are discussed in the context of the system embodiments of  and\/or .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["104","302","306","104","308","308","154","150","104","116","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["210","402","116","210","148","100","404","210","406","408","414","232","112","112","204","116","158","150","210","148","158","110","202","218","108","413","415","413","208","418"]},"Responsive to user input indicating  a preferred print medium, the multimedia server  transfers the content selection in a format suitable for that print medium to the print engine (e.g. to local memory ) which prints  the content selection on the indicated preferred medium. If user input does not indicate a preferred medium, the multimedia server  transfers the content selection in a format suitable for the default print medium to the print engine which prints  the content selection on the default medium suitable for the type of content. In the case of the song catalog, examples of the print medium that can be used are a CD or cassette. In the case of a video or a movie, examples of the print medium that can be used are a DVD or videocassette. In the case of the photos, examples of the print medium that can be used are paper or a memory stick. In one example, the database of content selections can be updated through a network interface  by downloading from a web site via the web server  for instance. These examples illustrate that this printer could be very useful in a walk-up kiosk as can be found in a convenience store. In another example, the database is communicatively coupled to an internal database (e.g. of company recorded meetings). Additionally, in the example of an embedded digital photo catalog, a user can select pictures for printing or generate an index document of photos without having to turn on a separate computer networked to the printer. For example, if every time a user prints a jpeg image, the printer automatically or under control of the print dialog box, saves a copy of the jpeg on the printer, she can build a personal photo archive and peruse the archive without turning on her desktop computer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["112","502","208","504","112","112","158","168","136","202","228","218","504","208"]},"In another embodiment, the multimedia server  acts to monitor interactions with an external computer such as a desktop PC to which it is connected. For example, the video cable from the PC goes to the printer  first where the signal is split with one copy going to the PC and another copy to screen capture hardware  (e.g. VGA). A PC interaction monitoring application  does a differencing between successive frames and saves frames with a difference that exceeds a threshold on secondary storage  in the printer. This offloads such processing from the PC, thereby improving responsiveness and user experience, and provides an easily browsable record of a user's activities during the day. The user can choose to print selected frames, hence the relationship to the printer. Print outs can be generated on demand by pressing a button on the printer's console (e.g. ), a dialog box on the client PC  or on the printer's display , or at times indicated by scheduling software . This printer  can be set to produce video files by selecting a frame every predetermined number of seconds irrespective of the content difference. This lets a user watch a replay of what he did. It can also be effectively compressed by the multimedia compression software  since the differences between frames are minor. Also, the video can be edited with video editing software . Video paper can be generated from the video files.","In another example, user interaction with a keyboard can be determined. In one example, assuming the user has a wireless keyboard and the printer has a wireless keyboard interface . A hardware tap into the signals emitted by the keyboard is provided. This tap records everything a user types. Each key click is recorded together with the time stamp when it was received. A timeline representation for a user's activities is constructed that can be printed out or displayed. The display is controlled by a parameter that gives a time gap figure. That is, key clicks less than the threshold are displayed adjacent to one another. Exceeding the threshold inserts a carriage return in the display. Thus if a user types a normal document, the timeline would look similar to that document. But if they frequently stop for phone calls or chatting, the gaps in the time line would indicate that. This display would be a productivity-monitoring tool. It would also be a useful index that could be searched with a full text search engine and would help answer questions like \u201cwhen did I type this paragraph?\u201d or \u201cwhen did I revise it?\u201d The time information could be correlated with information from other sources, such as the VGA screen capture, to see what the user had displayed on their screen when they typed or revised that paragraph.","In another example, additional software could be installed on the user's PC  that transmits via a network interface  or another wired or wireless interface  identifiers for files opened, applications invoked, URL's browsed and the names and locations of files sent to the printer. The content indexing software  or the PC interaction application  can create a document displaying this information that can be displayed or printed out.","In another example, the server  has a video camera interface  such as a frame grabber that receives composite video signals. The camera monitors activities nearby the printer and saves key frames or video clips in a file on an internal buffer store  when activity exceeds a threshold. This threshold can be defined by the difference between successive key frames or by a measure applied to clips extracted from a video stream. For example a clip length parameter (e.g., 30 seconds) is defined. A separate clip is saved automatically every 30 seconds by the video capture hardware . That file is closed and the clip capture proceeds. A signal is sent to a daemon process (e.g. ) that inspects the most recently captured clip and determines whether it should be saved. The daemon could be scheduled so that it wakes up N hours after the clip is captured. This allows a user to see everything that happened, even if no motion was detected. The monitoring application  can incorporate a decay factor (which the scheduling software  can track) so that initially it keeps everything. Then it deletes clips with no motion at all. And as time goes on it deletes clips with greater and greater motion. Eventually, the clips left show the main activities during that time period, for example, two people standing around the printer fighting over what printout they're supposed to get. In a desktop printer, initially this would delete clips that show no one in the office. Then it would delete clips that show the user sitting at a PC typing (small motion), then it would delete the user moving to pick up the phone. Eventually the clips left show visitors walking in and out of an office. This technology could be used as a burglar-monitoring tool. This system could output video paper that shows key frames with significant events detected by this system and bar codes that point to the video clips.","In another example, the printer can listen to what happens around it. The printer  has an audio capture interface (e.g. microphone  or connector for a microphone , and an audio card .) The data is recorded on the printer and time stamped so it can be retrieved by time from the printer , for example from the internal web server  in the printer . In a workgroup setting, this function can record conversations around the printer. It can also record sounds like that made by someone grabbing a printout from the output tray. In a desktop printer, this capability would let the printer monitor conversations in an office between the occupant and visitors or between the occupant and people he talks with on the phone. It could also be programmed to recognize key clicks, phone rings, and the noise made by the printer when it generates paper. The printer could generate an audio or video paper printout that summarizes the audio it captures.","In another example, the printer  can monitor the phone numbers called and received as well as record the telephone calls themselves. The printer  can be equipped with a RJ-11 pass-through  (2 connectors\u2014one for line-in and the other to the desktop phone.)\u2014This allows the printer to tap a phone call, record numbers called, and numbers supplied by caller-id. If audio capture hardware (e.g. microphone  and audio to digital converter ) is also present, this capability lets the printer record phone calls. The printer could provide the beep tone that notifies callers they are being recorded. In any case, this printer  could produce a phone log showing the times when calls were placed, their duration, the phone numbers, and bar codes that point to the recorded conversations.","Of course, any of these PC interaction monitoring functions can be combined and their data correlated on a content index document such as a video or audio paper document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["218","618","620"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIGS. 7 and 8","b":"202"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Consider an example in which the printer  receives time based content data of a video recorded using a 360 degree meeting recorder plus multi-channel audio inputs. The control unit  retrieves  the video recorded with the 360 degree input and a multi-channel audio input. A meeting recorder application  invokes the multimedia content recognition  which applies  speech recognition method(s) to the audio input to determine which participant is the speaker. Additionally, either the meeting recorder application  or the recognition software  can apply  sound localization method(s) based on the audio input and the 360 degree input to determine which participant is the speaker.","Based on the timeline of the video, and the results from the speech recognition and sound localization methods, the meeting application  invokes the content editing software  to segment  the video into clip(s) in which each clip illustrates a time period when a different person begins speaking.

Consider the example in which the printer  has VGA-to-NTSC conversion hardware  and audio capture capabilities , . A user plugs a laptop into one side of the printer and plugs a projector into the other. The printer  captures video frames as fast as presentation capture software  compares or has them compared to the most recently captured frame, and retains those frames that are different. A parallel audio track is also saved. This presentation capture capability could also be used in a desktop printer to record a presentation made on a PC connected to the printer. For example, someone practicing a presentation would be a potential user. It could also be used to record activities on a PC during a critical time, e.g., while developing code. Off-loading these functions to the printer significantly reduces the computational load on the PC. The content indexing software  creates a video paper representation that shows the frames and\/or bar codes that allow the user to replay the audio associated with the frames. The printer can serve the audio itself or it can be written to a digital medium like an SD disk that can be played from a cell phone or a PDA. The audio could also be written to a 2D bar code. Packaging these functions in the printer provides a convenient and easy-to-use a presentation recorder.","In another version, the printer receives video of people nearby a printer. In this example, a user is giving a presentation near the printer or working on his or her PC. This adds significant information to the recording. The data is saved on the printer. Key frames are chosen from the video stream and added to the video paper printout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","104","148","148","100"]},"The multimedia server  receives events  and directs them to the appropriate software portion for performing an associated action . The multimedia server  receives  a document identified for printing. The server searches the document for references to online content. URL's are examples of references used for this example. The server  extracts  each URL from the document, and the web server  retrieves  content from each URL. The multimedia server  constructs  a printable representation of the retrieved content for each URL and associates  each printable representation with a respective display identifier suitable for display on the embedded printer display . Responsive to the event that the document associated with a set of retrieved content has been selected , the multimedia server  displays  the display identifier(s) associated with the document on the embedded printer display . Responsive to an associated display identifier having been selected , the multimedia server  directs the print engine  to print  a printable representation of the retrieved content on an indicated medium. Responsive to an indication that the associated document is no longer available , the multimedia server  updates the display  to remove  the document from the displayed list of documents in the output tray.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},"Again, the multimedia server  receives events  and directs them to the appropriate software portion for performing an associated action . Responsive to receiving a request for Calibration , the multimedia server  calibrates  or directs the print engine  to calibrate  the scale of output tray to the weight of a number of units of output media. Responsive, to receiving  an indicator of a document beginning printing to the output tray, the print engine  determines  the weight change in the output tray, and associates  the weight change as the weight of the document. The multimedia server is notified that the associated document is in the output tray, and it sets  a timer for a timeout window for pickup of the document. Responsive to receiving  an indicator of decrease in weight of the output media in the output tray, software executed by either the print engine  or the server  determines  which document identified as in the tray has the closest weight, and the multimedia server  displays  the display identifier(s) of retrieved content from any URLs in the determined document. Responsive to the timeout window elapsing , the multimedia server removes  the document from displayed list of documents in the output tray.","In another embodiment, the printer  provides an embedded text-to-speech system. This provides an aid for the visually impaired, for example a TTS capability. The user interface  can include a button requesting that a text document be read in an audio form. In another embodiment, the printer  includes a microphone  for receiving speech commands requesting the reading of a document in audio form. Text to speech software can generate an audio version of the document which is transmitted to the speaker . A user who prints a text file or web page can walk up to a printer and listen to the contents of the file while it is being printed or previewed. The output of this system could also be previewed in a print dialog box. In another example, the multimedia server  delivers the audio version to a networked external computer .","In another embodiment, the text to speech software can read a summary of a document either while standing in front of the printer or at a networked computer before deciding to generate a paper printout. The output of this system could also be previewed in a print dialog box.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Persons skilled in the relevant art can appreciate that many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings.
