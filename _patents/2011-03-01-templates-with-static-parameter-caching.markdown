{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["User interface displays, such as displays of web pages, (or portions thereof) are often constructed from templates. Arguments may be provided to the templates via various carriers. In the context of templates for web pages, as an example, the carriers include uniform resource locator (URL) parameters, cookie values, and hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) POST variables. In some situations, it is desirable to provide a single standalone link as a reference to a fully constructed instance of a template, where the template and its arguments are already combined. Such a reference may require a way of providing parameters for generating the constructed instance of a template. One conventional way of providing parameters for template construction includes appending parameters to a URL. URLs, however, by their nature lack an ability to specify cookie or POST values. In addition, there exist situations where it is desirable to distinguish the template arguments from the fully constructed template instance, such as in situations where the template arguments can be used in other templates.","Various ways of providing arguments for templates exhibit various disadvantages. The use of URLs to provide template arguments, for example, is affected by limitations regarding browser capabilities. Many browser applications have limits on the size of URLs, thereby creating size limitations for arguments appended to URLs. If the arguments for a template have a collective size exceeding that which is allowed by a browser, providing the arguments can become a complex endeavor. In addition, the use of URLs for providing template arguments can adversely impact user experience. In some instances, for example, users may want to provide URLs to other users. One way of doing this is to cut and paste a URL into a document, such as an electronic mail message, that can be transferred to another user. A URL with multiple appended parameters may be unsightly and may occupy a substantial amount of space in a document. In addition to all of this, the various conventional ways of providing arguments for templates often require servers to combine template arguments with templates, thereby requiring the servers to utilize their own resources for template construction and, therefore, significantly decreasing the servers' ability to respond to other requests. These and other disadvantages may be overcome by various embodiments of the present disclosure.","Techniques described and suggested herein include systems and methods for providing content to users, as well as approaches to arranging, selecting, and\/or displaying that content. In an embodiment, at least one template and one or more arguments for the template are provided to a client device or other appropriate system or component. The template and one or more arguments may be provided, for example, as part of a process of providing content to a browser to enable the browser to display a web page. The browser may request a web page at a URL, where the URL contains a link to the template and one or more links to arguments for the template. The template may be used to construct a display of the whole web page or for a portion of the web page, such as an advertisement or other content to be displayed or otherwise provided concurrently with content of the web page. While the present disclosure utilizes web pages for the purpose of illustration, templates and arguments for the templates for any appropriate type of electronic interface may be provided in accordance with the various embodiments described herein for other types of content and, generally, any type of content that is constructible using templates.","In an embodiment, the template and arguments for the template are provided to a computing device (e.g., a client) in a manner that enables device to combine the template with at least some of the one or more arguments. In this manner, devices that provide the templates and arguments for the templates do not need to use some of their own resources, such as processing capacity, for the purpose of combining templates and arguments. In addition, the template and arguments for the template, in an embodiment, are provided in a cacheable manner to enable a browser, an edge cache or other server, and\/or other device to cache the template and\/or arguments for efficient future access. For example, a template may be encoded in a JavaScript file or other type of file that is provided to the client. Similarly, arguments for the template may be encoded in a JavaScript or other type of file that is provided to the client. In an embodiment, arguments for the template include information organized according to a plaintext format, such as according to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), extensible markup language (XML), and\/or comma-separated values (CSV). A file containing arguments for the template may not include any specifications for how the information should be displayed. Likewise, the template may not include any information that, when combined with one or more arguments by the client, is displayed. Further, the template may include information that, when combined with one or more arguments by the client, determine the manner in which the argument data is displayed.","Files containing templates and\/or templates containing arguments for the template may be redundantly stored in various geographic locations to enable more efficient distribution of templates and arguments for the templates. As an example, a file containing a template may be stored in one or more edge caches of a content delivery network (CDN). When client devices dispatch requests for content that makes use of templates, if the client devices do not have an appropriate template and\/or set of one or more arguments for the template already cached, the template and\/or set of one or more arguments for the template may be provided to the clients from an appropriate geographical location, such as from an edge cache that is closer than other edge caches. Templates and\/or arguments for the templates may be provided to the various geographical locations in different ways. For example, developers who develop templates and\/or arguments for the templates may, upon development, send or cause to be sent the developed templates and\/or arguments to multiple geographical locations. Templates and\/or arguments for the templates may also be stored in one or more central locations until requested from another location, such as by an edge server of a content delivery network.","The manner by which templates and\/or arguments for the templates are provided, in various embodiments, provides other advantages for at least content providers in addition to efficiency savings resulting in client combination of templates with arguments. For instance, a single template may be used with multiple sets of arguments to create multiple instances of completed templates that are different from one another. Accordingly, if a client has a template cached, when the client requests content that makes use of the template, a server providing the content may not need to send the template to the client an additional time, even if the client does not have corresponding arguments for the template cached. Further, a single template may even be used multiple times in order to present a single web page or other instance of content. Therefore, a server that provides the template may have to send to the client the template a fewer number of times than the number of times the template is used by the client.","Similarly, because, in an embodiment, templates and arguments for the template are sent to a client as separate units of content, if the client has a set of arguments for a template cached, when the client requests content that makes use of the arguments, a server providing the content may not need to send arguments for the template to the client an additional time, even if the client does not have a corresponding template cached. Thus, client-side storage of templates and\/or arguments for the templates is able to reduce the amount of bandwidth used for providing template-related content and the number of requests and responses between clients and servers. Other features, variations, and advantages to the present disclosure are described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106"]},"The illustrative environment includes at least one application server  and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers, layers, or other elements, processes, or components, which may be chained or otherwise configured, which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. As used herein the term \u201cdata store\u201d refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing, accessing, and retrieving data, which may include any combination and number of data servers, databases, data storage devices, and data storage media, in any standard, distributed, or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware and software for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device, handling a majority of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server provides access control services in cooperation with the data store, and is able to generate content such as text, graphics, audio, and\/or video to be transferred to the user, which may be served to the user by the Web server in the form of HTML, XML, or another appropriate structured language in this example. The handling of all requests and responses, as well as the delivery of content between the client device  and the application server , can be handled by the Web server. It should be understood that the Web and application servers are not required and are merely example components, as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.","The data store  can include several separate data tables, databases, or other data storage mechanisms and media for storing data relating to a particular aspect. For example, the data store illustrated includes mechanisms for storing production data  and user information , which can be used to serve content for the production side. The data store also is shown to include a mechanism for storing log data , which can be used for reporting, analysis, or other such purposes. It should be understood that there can be many other aspects that may need to be stored in the data store, such as for page image information and to access right information, which can be stored in any of the above listed mechanisms as appropriate or in additional mechanisms in the data store . The data store  is operable, through logic associated therewith, to receive instructions from the application server  and obtain, update, or otherwise process data in response thereto. In one example, a user might submit a search request for a certain type of item. In this case, the data store might access the user information to verify the identity of the user, and can access the catalog detail information to obtain information about items of that type. The information then can be returned to the user, such as in a results listing on a Web page that the user is able to view via a browser on the user device . Information for a particular item of interest can be viewed in a dedicated page or window of the browser.","Each server typically will include an operating system that provides executable program instructions for the general administration and operation of that server, and typically will include a computer-readable medium storing instructions that, when executed by a processor of the server, allow the server to perform its intended functions. Suitable implementations for the operating system and general functionality of the servers are known or commercially available, and are readily implemented by persons having ordinary skill in the art, particularly in light of the disclosure herein.","The environment in one embodiment is a distributed computing environment utilizing several computer systems and components that are interconnected via communication links, using one or more computer networks or direct connections. However, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that such a system could operate equally well in a system having fewer or a greater number of components than are illustrated in . Thus, the depiction of the system  in  should be taken as being illustrative in nature, and not limiting to the scope of the disclosure.","The various embodiments further can be implemented in a wide variety of operating environments, which in some cases can include one or more user computers, computing devices, or processing devices which can be used to operate any of a number of applications. User or client devices can include any of a number of general purpose personal computers, such as desktop or laptop computers running a standard operating system, as well as cellular, wireless, and handheld devices running mobile software and capable of supporting a number of networking and messaging protocols. Such a system also can include a number of workstations running any of a variety of commercially-available operating systems and other known applications for purposes such as development and database management. These devices also can include other electronic devices, such as dummy terminals, thin-clients, gaming systems, and other devices capable of communicating via a network.","Most embodiments utilize at least one network that would be familiar to those skilled in the art for supporting communications using any of a variety of commercially-available protocols, such as TCP\/IP, OSI, FTP, UPnP, NFS, CIPS, and AppleTalk. The network can be, for example, a local area network, a wide-area network, a virtual private network, the Internet, an intranet, an extranet, a public switched telephone network, an infrared network, a wireless network, and any combination thereof.","In embodiments utilizing a Web server, the Web server can run any of a variety of server or mid-tier applications, including HTTP servers, FTP servers, CGI servers, data servers, Java servers, and business application servers. The server(s) also may be capable of executing programs or scripts in response requests from user devices, such as by executing one or more Web applications that may be implemented as one or more scripts or programs written in any programming language, such as Java\u00ae, C, C# or C++, or any scripting language, such as Perl, Python, or TCL, as well as combinations thereof. The server(s) may also include database servers, including without limitation those commercially available from Oracle\u00ae, Microsoft\u00ae, Sybase\u00ae, and IBM\u00ae.","The environment can include a variety of data stores and other memory and storage media as discussed above. These can reside in a variety of locations, such as on a storage medium local to (and\/or resident in) one or more of the computers or remote from any or all of the computers across the network. In a particular set of embodiments, the information may reside in a storage-area network (\u201cSAN\u201d) familiar to those skilled in the art. Similarly, any necessary files for performing the functions attributed to the computers, servers, or other network devices may be stored locally and\/or remotely, as appropriate. Where a system includes computerized devices, each such device can include hardware elements that may be electrically coupled via a bus, the elements including, for example, at least one central processing unit (CPU), at least one input device (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, controller, touch screen, or keypad), and at least one output device (e.g., a display device, printer, or speaker). Such a system may also include one or more storage devices, such as disk drives, optical storage devices, and solid-state storage devices such as random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d) or read-only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), as well as removable media devices, memory cards, flash cards, etc.","Such devices also can include a computer-readable storage media reader, a communications device (e.g., a modem, a network card (wireless or wired), an infrared communication device, etc.), and working memory as described above. The computer-readable storage media reader can be connected with, or configured to receive, a computer-readable storage medium, representing remote, local, fixed, and\/or removable storage devices as well as storage media for temporarily and\/or more permanently containing, storing, transmitting, and retrieving computer-readable information. The system and various devices also typically will include a number of software applications, modules, services, or other elements located within at least one working memory device, including an operating system and application programs, such as a client application or Web browser. It should be appreciated that alternate embodiments may have numerous variations from that described above. For example, customized hardware might also be used and\/or particular elements might be implemented in hardware, software (including portable software, such as applets), or both. Further, connection to other computing devices such as network input\/output devices may be employed.","Storage media and computer readable media for containing code, or portions of code, can include any appropriate media known or used in the art, including storage media and communication media, such as but not limited to volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage and\/or transmission of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data, including RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the a system device. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate other ways and\/or methods to implement the various embodiments.","The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","202","202"]},"In an embodiment, the browsers  retrieve content and cause the content to be presented to users of the browsers , such as on display screens on devices of the users. As an example, a user may type an identifier of content (such as a Uniform Resource Locator) into an interface of the browser and the browser may retrieve and cause display of the content corresponding to the identifier. Similarly, a user may select a hyperlink displayed by the browser or another application and such selection may cause the browser to retrieve and cause the display of content corresponding to the hyperlink. The browsers may also automatically retrieve and present content, such as when the browser is processing a script of already-loaded content or during modification of a content presentation, such as pursuant to asynchronous JavaScript and XML techniques.","In an embodiment, the browsers  are configured to retrieve content from various servers. For example, as shown in , the browsers are configured to retrieve content from one or more content delivery network (CDN) servers. A CDN server is a server that has (or at least has access to) a copy of a data set, at least a portion of which is stored in connection with another server. CDN servers may include data storage devices, which may be referred to as edge caches, and may also be referred to as edge servers. A CDN server may store copies of web page content that is stored in other CDN servers in order to allow distribution of the content from multiple devices.","A browser  may retrieve content from a CDN server in various ways. For example, a browser may send a request for content that specifies a particular URL that is usable to locate the requested content. The request may be received by a domain name service (DNS) server (not shown), which is a server that receives the request and responds with an identifier (such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address) of an appropriate server for retrieving the content. The DNS server may, for instance, provide the browser an identifier of the closest CDN server that it can provide the content corresponding to the URL. A DNS server may also provide identifiers of other servers, not necessarily CDN servers. In this manner, content can be distributed from multiple CDN servers using a single URL or other identifier. Thus, providers of content can provide content from multiple locations, thereby improving user experience by reducing latency and by spreading out user-generated loads over multiple systems.","In an embodiment, when a CDN server receives a request for content, the CDN server may first check whether it has the requested content and, if it does not, it may request the requested content from another server, such as a central server  that is operable to communicate with a plurality of CDN servers  in a network of CDN servers. When the CDN receives the content, the CDN server may forward the content to the user that requested the content. In addition, the CDN server may cache the content so as to be able to more quickly provide the same content when requested by the same or by other browsers. In addition to caching content upon retrieval, CDN servers may store content in other ways. For example, when content is developed, developers of the content may push content to a plurality of CDN servers to make such content immediately available. Pushing content to a CDN server may be through the server , by instructing the server  to send content to various IP addresses of the CDN servers for storage, or in other ways which may bypass the server .","The server , in an embodiment, is operable to provide content to each of the CDN servers. As noted, the server  may be configured to provide content to a CDN server responsive to a request by the CDN server, upon request of a user of the server , or in other ways. The server  may provide content to the CDN server from its own storage. The server  may also provide content (or, generally, information) in other ways. For example, the server  may have access to one or more services , which may be provided from one or more other computing devices separate from the server . A service may be any application operable to provide information to the server . The server , for instance, may request information from one of the services  and receive a response from the service. As a concrete example, as noted above, templates are often used to provide content to users. The server , for example, may request information from one of the services  in order to combine the information with the template to provide content to a user, perhaps through one of the CDN servers . As another example, the server  may be operable to provide web pages. When a web page is requested from the server , the server may request one or more advertisements from one or more of the services  in order to provide advertisements with the web page that the server provides. Services can be used for other purposes as well, such as authentication, account management, computation, and, generally, any purpose. The services  may include any service that is usable in a system for providing content to users.","The environment  provided in  is simplified for the purpose of illustration. Variations of the environment  are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For example,  shows various numbers of different components. However, various embodiments may include more or fewer components than shown in . Further  shows various components in a specific configuration. Other configurations are also considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, a browser may access more than one CDN server and\/or may access the server without requests passing through a CDN server. Further, components other than those illustrated in the figure may be included in various embodiments and other embodiments may not have every illustrated component. Generally, the environment  illustrates components of a network which may be part of a larger network, such as the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","300","300","300","300"]},"As shown in the illustrative example of , the browser interface  includes a main content portion . The main content portion , in an embodiment, may include text, video, audio, animations, and\/or other content. The main content portion  may, for instance, provide information about a certain topic, such as a particular film. Generally, the main content portion  may include any content. Further, while the main content portion is shown as a rectangular area that occupies a central portion of the display of the browser interface  for the purpose of illustration, other configurations are possible. Generally, content may take any suitable form and may be positioned in any area or collection of areas of a display.","In an embodiment, the browser interface  is shown as displaying a plurality of different advertisements. For example, the browser interface  as shown includes a plurality of banner advertisements , which may be advertisements configured to be displayed with content in a horizontally-oriented rectangle, such as in a manner displayed in the figure. Similarly, the illustrated browser interface  displays a plurality of other advertisements  on the right hand side of the main content portion . As with other portions of the examples illustrated herein, variations of that which is shown are considered within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the banner advertisements  and other advertisements  are shown as rectangles in particular positions on a web page for the purpose of illustrations, but any advertisement may have another form and\/or position. Advertisements may, for example, be superimposed on other content and may include an interface element that allows users to close (cause to disappear or shrink) an advertisement or to move an advertisement to another part of the display.","Some or all of the various components of the display illustrated in  may be composed using templates. For instance, a template may be used to construct the main content portion , the banner advertisements , and the other advertisements . A template may also be used to generate the entire display. Different templates may be used for each portion of the illustrated display. Also, the same template may be used multiple times to generate the same display. Each of the banner advertisements  may, for instance, appear different from one another, but be constructed from the same template. The different presentation of each banner advertisement may be accomplished by using different arguments for each of the banner advertisements . Similarly, each of the other advertisements  may appear different from one another, yet be constructed using the same template but with different sets of arguments for the templates.","In the specific context of a web page, to construct the display illustrated in , the browser may request the content by specifying a URL for the web page, such as the URL illustrated in the figure. Content returned in response to the request may include one or more links to templates and one or more links to arguments for the template(s). As a specific example, hypertext markup language (HTML) code may, for one of the advertisements , include code such as <script src=\u201cexample<dot>com\/mytemplate<dot>js>\u201d for the template and <script src=\u201cexample<dot>com\/mydataobject<dot>js>\u201d for a file containing one or more arguments for the template, where <dot> is replaced by the character of that name. The HTML code may include a URL that encodes links to both a template file and an argument file. In addition or as an alternative, the HTML code may include a reference to the argument file and the argument file may specify a particular template file to be used for combination with information in the argument file. For instance, the argument file may include a hyperlink or other reference to a particular template file or even a version of a particular template file. While the HTML, URLs, and other technologies and techniques are used for the purpose of illustration, the scope of the present disclosure is not limited to the specific technologies and examples of such technologies provided herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["306","400","400","400","402","402"]},"In this particular instance, other information is combined with the template , such as a title . The template  may dictate the placement of the title when combined with the template. Other information includes a content element  and an additional content element . As shown in , the background image , title , content element , and additional content element  are combined according to the template  in order to form a completed template  in which each of the background image , title , content element , and additional content element  are concurrently displayed.","In the example provided in , information for the template  includes an image and various instances of text. Other types of information may be combined with a template in addition to or as an alternative to images and text. For example, information for a template may comprise animations, audio, parameters for display of other information and\/or, generally, any type of information that may be presented to a user and\/or that may be used to affect how information is presented to a user. In addition, while  shows a certain arrangement of various types of information, variations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure. There may be, for instance, more or fewer items of information than illustrated.","While templates are useful for advertisements, templates are also useful for other types of content. , for example, shows another example of an item of content that may be generated using a template, such as a template having characteristics similar to those of the template  discussed above in connection with . In this example,  shows a display  of a content application which, for the purpose of illustration, is dedicated to movie show times. The display  may be provided to users with content, such as in a location of one of the advertisements  described above in connection with , or in any suitable location. The display  may be provided to a user, for example, visiting a web page dedicated to a particular movie, movies in general, or related subjects.","In an embodiment, a template (not shown) may be combined with information provided dynamically. As an example, various information about a user may be known or ascertainable, such as a geographical location in which the user is located. A mapping IP addresses to locations may be used to determine, based on the user's IP address, the user's location. Global positioning service (GPS) data or other techniques may also be used. When the user requests a web page onto which a display of the content application is to be presented, a server may use location information about the user to obtain information about movie show times at one or more movie theatres near the user. A server may, for instance, utilize a service, such as one of the services  described above in connection with . The server may call a service using an application programming interface (API) of the service, providing the service information identifying the user's location. The service may then reference the location in a data store, such as a database table, and return information about movie times in the user's location. This information, possibly with other information, may be combined with a template to create the display  in . As discussed above, in conventional techniques, the server or another server may combine the information and the template and provide the completed template to a device of the user for display. In an embodiment, as described in more detail below, the template and the information are sent to a device of the user and the user's device combines the information and the template.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","602","604","606","608","602","600","602","604","604","606","606","604","602","606","606","602","606","602"]},"In an embodiment, when the browser  receives the HTTP response, the browser  executes the script of the HTTP response and accordingly sends one or more HTTP requests for additional content. The additional content, in an embodiment, includes a template and\/or data for combining with the template. The browser  may, for instance, check a local cache for the template and\/or data and, if the template and\/or data is not in the local cache, make one or more HTTP requests for any of the template and\/or data that is not in the local cache. The browser may send separate requests for both a template and data for combining with the template or may request both the template and data for combining with the template in a single response.","In an embodiment, the CDN server  receives the HTTP request from the browser  and checks its own cache for the requested additional content. If the CDN server  does not have some or all of the additional requested content, the CDN server  may forward the request for additional content to the server  (or otherwise request the additional content not in the cache of the CDN server ). Similarly, if the server  receives a request for additional content, the server  may check its own cache for some or all of the requested additional content and, if all or some of the requested additional content is not in the cache of the server , the server  may request the data not in the server's cache from one or more services . For example, if the server  does not have a requested template in its cache, the server  may request a template from a template service. The request for the template may include information identifying a particular template needed to be selected from a plurality of templates. The request for the template may include information identifying a particular template needed to be selected form a plurality of templates. Similarly, if the server  does not have requested data for combining with a template in its cache, the server  may request such data from a data service that is operable to provide such data. The request for data from the data service may include information from which a proper data set may be selected, collected, and\/or generated by the data service.","In an embodiment, if the CDN server  has additional content responsive to the request(s) of the browser  for additional content, the CDN server  provides the additional content in one or more HTTP responses. Similarly, if the server  has additional content responsive to the request(s) of the browser  for additional content or if the server has obtained additional content responsive to the request of the browser , the server  provides the additional content in one or more HTTP responses.","As noted in the diagram , at any point when the browser , CDN server , and\/or server  receives additional content, the browser , CDN server , and\/or server  may cache the additional content. In this manner, if the browser, for example, needs the template and\/or the data for combining with the template at a later time, the browser may obtain the template and\/or data for combining with the template from its own cache instead of having to request the template and\/or data for combining with the template from another device and waiting for a response. Similarly, if the CDN server , for example, needs the template and\/or the data for combining with the template at a later time, such as to respond to another browser's request, the CDN server may obtain the template and\/or data for combining with the template from its own cache instead of having to request the template and\/or data for combining with the template from another device and waiting for a response. Also, if the server  needs the template and\/or the data for combining with the template at a later time, such as in a response from another CDN server or perhaps from another browser, the server may obtain the template and\/or data for combining with the template from its own cache instead of having to request the template and\/or data for combining with the template from another device and waiting for a response.","In an embodiment, when the browser  receives the requested additional content, the browser  combines the template with the data for the template in order to provide the completed content and provide the completed content to the user, such as by displaying the completed content on a display device of the user. In this manner, the CDN server  and server  do not need to use resources to combine templates with data, thereby providing an increased capability to respond to various requests and perform other operations compared to the capabilities when using traditional techniques.","The embodiment illustrated in , and other embodiments described herein and variations thereof, provide other advantages. For instance, as the browser  navigates through various instances of content (web pages, e.g.), any templates and\/or data for templates may be reused by the browser. The same template, for example, may be used to provide numerous advertisements to the user, without having to send a separate completed template to the browser for each advertisement. Similarly, the same data may be used for multiple templates, such as to provide the same advertisement to a user in various different ways, thereby potentially increasing the user's interest in the advertisement.

The request for content may be sent by a browser or other application and may have been sent in response to user input in connection with navigation among a set of documents, such as web pages. Once the request for content is received, a response is provided . The response may include script, such as JavaScript code, which enables the requestor to request additional content. A browser that receives the response, for instance, may be configured to execute instructions encoded in the response's script. The script, when executed by the browser, may cause the browser to request a template, request data for a template, and\/or request other additional content.","For example, in an embodiment, when the response with script has been provided , a request for a template may be received . The request may have been sent responsive to execution of the script by the requestor. Responsive to the request for the template, the template is provided , in accordance with an embodiment. The template may be sent to a requesting browser, for instance. When the response with script has been provided , a request for a template data may be received . Template data may be any data that may be combined with the template for presentation to a user. As with the request for the template, the request for template data may have been sent responsive to execution of the script by the requestor. Responsive to the request for the template data, the template is provided , in accordance with an embodiment. Both the template and the data for the template may be packaged as files. The files may be, for instance, JavaScript files, although other ways of arranging information of the template and template data may be used. Providing the template and\/or providing the template data may include sending the template and\/or sending the template data to a device that is operable to combine the template with at least a portion of the template data, such as a device that operates a browser, as described above. The device may then combine the template and at least a portion of the template data.","Variations of the process  are contemplated as being within the spirit of the present disclosure. As an example, for the purpose of illustration, the request for the template and the request for template data are (as well as other steps) shown as occurring concurrently, although the requests may be received in any order. In addition, as with other figures presented herein,  is provided in a simplified for the purpose of illustration and variations are considered as being within the scope of the present disclosure.
