ASSESSMENT OF THE PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY","C. EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS"],"p":["This application is a National Stage Application filed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 based on International Application No. PCT\/EP2007\/007658, filed Sep. 1, 2007, which claims priority to German Patent Application Number 102006043443.9, filed Sep. 15, 2006, the entire contents each of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The foregoing applications, and all documents cited therein and all documents cited or referenced therein, and all documents cited or referenced herein, including any U.S. or foreign patents or published patent applications, International patent applications, as well as, any non-patent literature references and any manufacturer's instructions, are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The present application relates to novel azabicyclic compounds, processes for their preparation, their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, and their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Some substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been described in recent years, such as, for example, 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1, Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., Brit. 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","Fused pyrazole derivatives are described inter alia in WO 98\/16507, WO 98\/23619, WO 00\/06567, WO 00\/06569, WO 02\/42299, WO 02\/42300, WO 02\/42301, WO 02\/42302, WO 02\/092596, WO 03\/004503 and WO 03\/095451 as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase. However, it has emerged that these compounds sometimes display disadvantages in terms of their physicochemical properties such as, for example, their solubility, or in relation to their in vivo properties, such as, for example, their behavior in the liver, their pharmacokinetic behavior, their dose-effect relation and\/or their metabolic pathway.","In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,997, WO 01\/57024, WO 03\/035005 and WO 2005\/030121 disclose various fused pyrazole derivatives for the treatment of disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and display an improved therapeutic profile by comparison with compounds known in the prior art.","The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I)\n\nL-CH-M-Q\u2003\u2003(I),\n\nin which\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"74.34mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US08309551-20121113-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["in which\n            \n            ","A, B, D and E are each CH, CRor N, with a maximum of two of the ring members A, B, D and E simultaneously being N,","Ris a substituent selected from the series halogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, trifluoromethyl, amino, (C-C)-alkoxy and trifluoromethoxy,","and","m is the number 0, 1 or 2,\n            \n            "]}},"and","Q is an unsaturated or aromatic 5- or 6-membered heterocycle having up to four heteroatoms from the series N, O and\/or S, which may be substituted up to four times, identically or differently, by radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, azido, nitro, cyano, oxo, thioxo, \u2014R, \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014R, \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014OR, \u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NRR, \u2014O\u2014(C\u2550O)\u2014R, \u2014O\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014OR, \u2014O\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NRR, \u2014S(O)\u2014R, \u2014SO\u2014OR, \u2014SO\u2014NRR, \u2014NR\u2014(C\u2550O)\u2014R, \u2014NR\u2014SO\u2014R, \u2014NR\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014OR, \u2014NR\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NRRand \u2014NR\u2014SO\u2014NRR, in which\n        \n        "]}}}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, the compounds which are encompassed by formula (I) and are of the formulae mentioned hereinafter, and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, and the compounds which are encompassed by formula (I) and are mentioned hereinafter as exemplary embodiments, and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, insofar as the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and mentioned hereinafter are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Compounds according to the invention are likewise N-oxides of the compounds of the formula (I), and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof.","The compounds according to the invention may, depending on their structure, exist in stereoisomeric forms (enantiomers, diastereomers).
