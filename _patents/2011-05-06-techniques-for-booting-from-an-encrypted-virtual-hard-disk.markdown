The booting environment (e.g., different from normal operating environment or operating system) may include at least one of a backup exec system recovery (BESR), lightsout Recovery (LOR), system reference documents (SRD), and\/other other bootable components in order to boot the client  and\/or server A.","At block , the client  and\/or the server A may be booted from the virtual hard disk . For example, an interface module  may receive a request to initiating a booting process for the client  and\/or server A. The interface module  may pass the request to initiate a booting process to the virtual hard disk access module . The virtual hard disk access module  may access the encrypted virtual hard disk  in order to boot the client  and\/or the server A in a booting environment. In a particular embodiment, the virtual hard disk access module  may access the various bootable components stored or installed on the virtual hard disk . The virtual hard disk access module  may access the booting environment in order to boot the client  and\/or the server A under the booting environment installed in the virtual hard disk .","During booting of the client  and\/or the server A in the booting environment, the virtual hard disk access module  may access and activate the encryption module  installed on the virtual hard disk . An encryption password associated with the volume of encrypted data may be provided to the encryption module . For example, the encryption application  may provide encryption metadata associated with the volume of the encrypted data to the encryption module .","At block , the encryption module  may authenticate the encryption password. The encryption module  may authenticate the encryption password against the encryption metadata stored in the volume of data. In a particular embodiment, the encryption module  may search the snapshot of the volume of data to find the encryption metadata stored therein. The encryption module  may authenticate the encryption password by comparing the encryption metadata stored within the snapshot of the volume of backup contents with the provided encryption password. The encryption module  may determine that the encryption password is authentic if the encryption metadata stored within the snapshot of the volume of backup contents matches the provided encryption password. The encryption module  may pass the authenticated encryption password to the decryption module .","At block , the encrypted volume of data may be decrypted by the decryption module . The decryption module  may utilize the authenticated encryption password to decrypt the entire volume of data stored in the virtual hard disk  in the booting environment. For example, the decryption module  may use the encryption password to decrypt the entire virtual files stored in the virtual hard disk  in the booting environment.","At block , the decrypted data may be provided to the user. For example, the user may access the entire volume of decrypted virtual hard disk  via the virtual hard disk access module . The mount module  may read the decrypted volume of data and provide one or more selected files of decrypted volume of data stored in the virtual hard disk  to the user. Also, the decrypted virtual hard disk  may be active and can be accessed in a subsequent booting operation.","At block , the method  may end.","At this point it should be noted that booting from an encrypted virtual hard disk in accordance with the present disclosure as described above typically involves the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software. For example, specific electronic components may be employed in virtual dynamic link library (DLL) module or similar or related circuitry for implementing the functions associated with booting from an encrypted virtual hard disk in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. Alternatively, one or more processors operating in accordance with instructions may implement the functions associated with booting from an encrypted virtual hard disk in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. If such is the case, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such instructions may be stored on one or more non-transitory processor readable storage media (e.g., a magnetic disk or other storage medium), or transmitted to one or more processors via one or more signals embodied in one or more carrier waves.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein. Indeed, other various embodiments of and modifications to the present disclosure, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Thus, such other embodiments and modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.
