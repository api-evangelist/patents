title: Method and system for modeling a bus for a system design incorporating one or more programmable processors
abstract: Systems and methods for modeling a bus for a system design are provided. In an embodiment, the method operates by accepting a virtual bus model, wherein the model simulates behavior for a bus master and slave device, such that the model accurately simulates the timing and behavior of the transfer of data from master to slave, and, from slave to master devices. The method routes a transaction issued by the master device to the slave device. The transaction has storage for transaction data, or a pointer to transaction data, to be transferred through the transaction. The transaction data is transferred in one or more data payloads and the sender of data sets the length of data payloads to be returned. The data payloads are sent from the sender of data to the receiver of data and may contain one or more bus data beats. This method accurately models the bus timing and behavior of the delivery of one or more data beats as one data payload.

No. 60\/886,031, filed Jan. 22, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/315,683 to Torossian et al., titled CLOCK SIMULATION SYSTEM AND METHOD, filed Dec. 20, 2005, and incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.","This application relates generally to the simulation of complex circuit designs and specifically to the efficient simulation of bus structures. This application is related to modifying a provided virtual circuit bus model for use in simulating a target processor running target software in hardware\/software simulation.","The continued need for increasingly complex electronic circuits has lead to corresponding demands for simulators that can quickly simulate, to a high degree of accuracy, the complex interactions occurring within a complex circuit. Circuits are growing more and more complex with \u201cSystem On Chip\u201d (SoC) designs implemented that contain hundreds of millions of logic circuits.","Systems on a chip (SoCs) that include programmable processors are in widespread use, and using a virtual processor model is particularly advantageous in designing such SoCs. The bus design for such circuits is often obtained as part of a pre-defined design for use in designing a SoC.","Virtual bus models for circuits containing one or more programmable processors are detailed and therefore non-trivial to design. As a result, vendors such as VaST Systems Technology Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif., provide pre-defined virtual processor models for many popular processors.","Many SoCs, however, are designed to include one or more custom, programmable processors, e.g., processors that might be similar to an available processor design, but have different word lengths, different operations, and so forth.","Various methods are currently used for the simulation of complex electronic circuits. The circuit to be simulated is normally described in a top down manner using a hardware description language (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog. VHDL is described, for example, in IEEE Computer Society \u201cIEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual\u201d N.Y., USA, June 1994, and Verilog is described, for example, in IEEE Computer Society, \u201cIEEE Standard Hardware Description Language Based on the Verilog Hardware Description Language, New York, USA, 1996, each of which are incorporated by reference herein in pertinent parts. These are commonly referred to as synthesis based approaches as the same circuit description may also be used in the generation of the physical circuit layout. As circuit complexity continues to increase, there is a trend to move away from these synthesis-based approaches to ones using higher level hardware descriptions usually based on languages such as behavioral VHDL, Verilog with behavioral extensions, C and C++. An example of such a high-level simulation language is SystemC which uses C++ as a system description language.","Once a circuit to be simulated is described in one of the above languages, simulators are available for simulating operation of the hardware device. For example, standard C++ compilers together with SystemC libraries can be used to simulate SystemC coded models. Complex circuits are often constructed using a high level language such as Verilog, SystemC, VHDL, or the like, and extensively simulated using cycle accurate simulators to verify operation. Subsequently, after satisfactory verification, the model, if coded using a synthesizable HDL, may be directly synthesized into lower level circuit designs. The model is extremely useful in allowing verification of the design and target software to proceed long before and even after the design has been implemented.","Bus structures are used in digital systems to connect processors with memory, peripheral devices, etc. There are many standard bus protocols known for bus structures, e.g., PCI and the AMBA bus protocols by ARM Holdings PLC of Cambridge, England including AMBA AHB, AMBA APB, AMBA AHB_Lite, IbBus, U-Bus, and others. There are many interconnect protocols, such as the Sun Host to PCI Bridge protocol (HPB) by Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif.","New bus protocols have become available that provide for much more complex behavior than older bus systems. Such more complex behaviors include the ability of a master device to execute several transactions at a time, and for slave devices to receive and process several transactions at a time. Furthermore, bus protocols have recently been developed for incorporating complex interconnects between devices, e.g., interconnects that include switching fabrics. In such an architecture, several master devices and several slave devices may connect to an interconnect circuit each using, for example, a bus structure that supports several transactions at once. The interconnect includes switching elements, buffers, etc., that provide for interconnecting the master devices and slave devices, including issuing and\/or processing several transactions at once.","One example of such a bus structure is the AMBA\u00ae AXI Protocol (hereinafter AXI protocol, or simply AXI) as defined, for example, in the published specification of AXI, titled \u201cAMBA\u00ae AXI Protocol Specification, V1.0, by ARM Ltd., also known as the AMBA specification.","Accordingly, there is a need for methods, systems, and computer program products for simulating bus structures. What is also needed are methods, systems, and computer program products to model such bus structures and their connections to interconnect circuits.","Some programmable processor types, however, contain many structures in common. Furthermore, programmable processors tend to fall into families that have aspects in common. Accordingly, what is needed are methods, systems, and computer program products which are able to simulate and model bus structures for system designs incorporating one or more programmable processors.","Thus there is a need for a customizable virtual bus model for system designs including one or more programmable processors, and for a method and apparatus for modifying a provided virtual bus model.","Described herein are methods, computer program products, and systems operative to model a system that incorporates a bus, e.g., to model a bus to which other device models are connectable. The bus allows a plurality of transactions at a time, e.g., concurrent read and write without arbitration, such as a bus that conforms to the AXI specification.","In one embodiment, the model provides backward compatibility with a more conventional bus. In another embodiment, the bus model is connectable to a master device model that includes a read port and a separate write port. According to an embodiment, the bus model is connectable to a slave device model that includes a read port and a separate write port. One feature of so splitting the bus model to read and write ports is to provide backward compatibility. For example, for a complex bus, having separate read and write ports provides for concurrent reads and writes with no arbitrations. When modeling with a more conventional bus, reads to the bus pass via the read port, and writes to the bus pass via the write port.","One method embodiment includes signaling of data payloads between a sender of data and a receiver of data where data within a bus transaction comprises one or more data beats. The entire sequence of data beats within the bus transaction may be broken into one or more data payloads.","In one method embodiment, the sender of data signals the availability of \u201ccommitted\u201d beats in the form of a data payload to the receiver, including the following information:","The number of \u201ccommitted\u201d beats, either directly, or indirectly as a value which may be calculated from other parameters; the data contained in these \u201ccommitted\u201d beats; the clock cycle edge at which the first \u201ccommitted\u201d beat is made available.","In one method embodiment, the receiver signals acceptance of the \u201ccommitted\u201d beats forming the data payload to the sender, including the following information: the clock edge at which the last of the \u201ccommitted\u201d beats was accepted.","In one embodiment, clock edges, e.g., clock edges of events, can be communicated via one or more of: the absolute time; a relative time ahead of some other event; a number of clock edges; and a relative number of clock edges ahead of some other event.","In another embodiment, data payloads can be communicated via a pointer to a buffer containing data, and one or more of: the offsets within the buffer of the start and end of the payload; the offset to the start of the payload within the buffer, and the number of beats in the payload; the offset to the start of the payload within the buffer, and the number of bytes in the payload.","One result of this is a method wherein a sender of a sequence of data beats can send data ahead of simulation time to a receiver of data without compromising cycle accuracy of the data. By committing to a number of data beats in the form of a data payload, and breaking up the data transfer into a sequence of data payloads, the sender of data is able to significantly improve data transfer simulation performance. In one embodiment, the sender is only allowed to \u201ccommit\u201d to a data payload if there is no circumstance which could occur which would cause the sender to \u201cde-commit\u201d one or more data beats within the payload.","In another embodiment, transmissions of data, from either a sender that is a slave device to a receiver that is a master device, e.g., as is the case for a bus read transaction, or from a sender that is a master device to a receiver that is a slave device, e.g., as in a bus write transaction, include the following.","(A) The sender decides how many data beats to commit to supply to the receiver. The deciding is in one embodiment on the basis of factors including one or more of: availability of the data, data channel, current simulation time, transaction time, total number of beats, size of data to be transferred, and the states of all pending transactions. If this number of data beats to commit is not 0, in an embodiment, the sender indicates the intention to supply the number of beats either directly in the transaction or indirectly through some other mechanism and proceeds to the marking of the data channel as busy (see step (B) below), otherwise, the sender waits for some other event to occur and repeats the deciding of this step (A).","(B) The sender marks the data channel busy.","(C) The sender indicates, either directly in the transaction or indirectly through some other mechanism, the simulated time, which may be in future simulation time, at which the first of the committed data beats is being made available.","(D) The sender either moves the committed data beats into a buffer associated with the transaction or creates an association between the transaction and the committed data beats in an existing buffer.","(E) The sender then signals the receiver, either directly through a call to the receiver's function or indirectly through some other mechanism, that the number of data beats is available.","(F) The receiver then calculates, either during the receipt of such signal from the sender, or at some later point in the execution of the simulation model, on the basis of time of availability of the data payload, current simulation time, transaction time, total number or beats in the payload, size of data to be transferred and other factors, at what point in simulation time the last of the beats within the data payload will be accepted. The receiver indicates the point in simulation time that the last of the beats with the data payload will be accepted either directly in the transaction or indirectly through some other mechanism.","(G) The receiver then signals the sender, either directly through a call to the receiver's function or indirectly through some other mechanism, the acceptance of the data payload.","(H) On receipt of such signal, and on the basis of the time at which the last data payload has been accepted, the sender marks the data channel not busy, and, if there are remaining beats to be transferred, proceeds to step (A) above.","One embodiment of the invention includes dynamic transaction event stitching between master and slave devices communicating through a transaction channel.","One embodiment of the invention includes a combination of bus decoders to provide a model of a bus that includes automatic bus routing.","One embodiment operates on a simulation platform that includes a scheduler that schedules operation of the various models.","In one embodiment, the mechanisms for specifying the interface between a master device and a slave device provide a mechanism wherein a bus is modeled such that no excess synchronization is required for any event that requires synchronization. The modeled bus is able to handle multiple simultaneous transactions, and further is able to handle multiple master devices issuing these multiple simultaneous transactions.","In another embodiment, a sender, e.g., a master device as sender, passes to a receiver, e.g., a slave device as receiver, access to functions that are the receiver's (e.g., slave's) function(s), such that the receiver, e.g., the slave, can operate, including calling such functions, thus not requiring synchronization.","These functions each provide the timing of the event they represent such that, for example, a receiver, e.g., a slave as receiver, can process the sender's event at the timing of that event without requiring synchronization between the sender, e.g., the master, and the receiver, e.g., the slave.","In this manner, embodiments of the invention provide for signaling an event in so called \u201cnegative\u201d time, i.e., before \u201cnow.\u201d For example, the invention provides for modeling a bus wherein a write data channel is allowed to issue the data for a transaction before that transaction's command and address are issued in the respective channels.","Other embodiments, aspects, features, and advantages will be clear from the description and claims provided herein.","Briefly, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/830,435, filed Jul. 30, 2007 and titled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MODIFYING A VIRTUAL PROCESSOR MODULE FOR HARDWARE\/SOFTWARE SIMULATION, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, a \u2018virtual system prototype\u2019 is a set of software instructions, e.g., a software system, that when executing (running) on a host processing system simulate a hardware\/software system that includes a processor (\u201ctarget processor\u201d) and target processor memory, with the target processor memory including instructions (\u201ctarget software\u201d) that are for execution on the target processor. By a hardware\/software system is meant a system that includes a programmable processor, and the instructions\u2014the target software\u2014for operating that target processor. A hardware\/software system, for example, may include a device, such as a mobile telephone, or a discrete component contained within a device. A hardware\/software system may also include an installation, for example a mobile telephone base station. One aspect of the invention is for a virtual system prototype to provide a highly accurate and responsive model of such hardware\/software systems, in particular a model of a bus structure. One can also develop a virtual system prototype to model the entire system, e.g., the mobile telephone together with the mobile telephone base station, and the communication pathway between them.","A virtual system prototype may be used to analyze the performance of the hardware architecture, develop and test target software, and examine the interaction between the hardware and software subsystems, before one builds the actual hardware.","Running a virtual system prototype is sometimes called hardware\/software co-design, or simply co-design.","The elements of a virtual system prototype include device models. A device model is a virtual representation\u2014a representation as software executing on the host processor system\u2014of a hardware unit that is capable of providing input to a system or of receiving output from the system, or both. Examples of device models include timers, controllers, memories, and virtual processor models. Devices may be connected by buses, and a bus is represented by a bus model. Embodiments of the present invention deal with bus models.","The models described herein are behavioral models that are timing accurate. A behavioral model provides the function of the device being modeled without necessarily providing accurate timing. Models can also be clock cycle accurate. Such a cycle accurate model is able to provide the state of the processor elements at any clock tick. For this, each clock cycle is simulated, and the model replicates the structures that are in the processor.","One of the challenges of simulating a hardware\/software system is to have timing-accurate models that execute relatively fast on the host processing system. Behavioral models that do not provide timing accuracy can be relatively fast. On the other hand, clock cycle accurate models, e.g., structural models, are either not particularly detailed in what they simulate, or run relatively slowly in order to simulate a significant number of structural elements.","The models, in particular the bus models described herein that include aspects of the present invention, provide full functionality, e.g., are full behavioral models, and further are timing accurate. For example, when combined with virtual processor models that can execute target code that is in a memory model with instruction and transaction time accuracy, providing bus transaction modeling is useful, for example, in simulating bus and other interactions with other models. However, running such models does not necessarily include simulating all clock cycles. For example, one feature of the way we simulate is that if no significant events occur for a number of clock cycles, there is no need to simulate each and every one of those clock cycles.","In the case of some virtual processor models and some devices, some methods for achieving such behavioral and timing accuracy with such speed are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,114 titled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CO-SIMULATION INCLUDING EXECUTING AN ANALYZED USER PROGRAM, U.S. Pat. No. 6,263,302 titled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CO-SIMULATION INCLUDING SIMULATING THE CACHE OF A TARGET PROCESSOR, U.S. Pat. No. 6,584,436 titled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CO-SIMULATION INCLUDING EXECUTING AN ANALYZED USER PROGRAM, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,751,583 titled HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CO-SIMULATION INCLUDING SIMULATING A TARGET PROCESSOR USING BINARY TRANSLATION. See also U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. No. 2006\/0149526 titled CLOCK SIMULATION SYSTEM AND METHOD. The contents of each patent and patent application are incorporated herein by reference.","As used herein, a virtual system prototype has no ports, external connections, or behavior. It is the top-level container for other modules. A virtual system prototype is the equivalent to what is called a test bench in a VHDL simulation system.","A virtual system prototype contains one or more virtual platforms, which in turn contain models of the actual devices or components contained within the system. All elements within the virtual system prototype are arranged in a hierarchy that generally reflects the structure of the actual hardware\/software system.","Virtual platforms are the building blocks of a virtual system prototype, and contain the underlying models of the system. A simple virtual system prototype usually includes a single virtual platform, containing one or more virtual devices; however, virtual platforms can have arbitrary complexity. Virtual platforms can include many hierarchies of subsystems, including other virtual platforms; virtual processor models that model the actual processor(s) and execute software embedded within the product, peripheral device models that emulate the functionality of the peripheral hardware devices, and interconnections. Virtual platforms can be interconnected.","In the present disclosure, a standard Bus (StdBus) protocol engine (StdBus protocol engine, SBPE) is the main component of a generic bus model that can be used for device and module interconnect. In this disclosure, the term StdBus is sometimes used without the words protocol engine, and is used to mean the generic bus model, that is, the StdBus protocol engine.","The StdBus protocol engine provides an interface to virtual processor models, peripheral device models, and memory models, and represents the standard concept of address and data phases along with associated control and timing in a bus transaction. The StdBus net can be considered to be a single net type containing all information needed for inter-communication between modules via a bus.","The StdBus protocol engine is also provided with a set of configuration parameters to allow users to control aspects such as monitoring, debugging etc.","Tasks and Callback Functions","In the example embodiments described herein, a C-Language modeling environment includes a set of functions, some of which are described herein below. Some of the primitives described herein are for tasks and for callback functions that are written in the C-language and that a user can use in building the model to implement bus structures and for other clock-scheduled event scheduling.","A distinction is made herein between a \u201ctask\u201d and a \u201ccallback function.\u201d Each of these refers to a part of a model, e.g., a function that is coded in one example using the C-language or its derivates, e.g., C++. A task herein refers to a section of an actual model. In an embodiment, when an instance of a model is set up during initialization, instances of any tasks in the model are also created. Thus, a task is a part of a coded model that operates as a separate process with its own timeline. A task can suspend operation of itself at a point in simulation time of the hardware model it is contained in, and resume operation at some future point in simulation time of that hardware model. The operation of the task thus can consume hardware simulation time.","A callback function herein refers to a section of a model that operates at a single instant in simulation time of the overall model. The section is typically coded in C-language or its derivatives. A callback function cannot suspend or resume operation of the hardware model, so a callback function exits at the same instant in simulation time at which it is invoked. A callback function may be directly invoked from a task. A callback function may also be directly invoked from a callback function. Similarly, a callback function may be scheduled to be invoked by a task, or scheduled to be invoked by a callback function.","Callback functions are in one embodiment registered at initialization time to be associated with a particular clock signal for scheduling according to one or more attributes of the clock signal. Registering is also called \u201cinstalling.\u201d When a callback function associated with a particular clock signal is registered, e.g., for later scheduling, a handle or identifier for that callback function associated with a clock signal is generated and provided as a result of the registering. The handle provides a mechanism for scheduling an event, e.g., a callback to that callback function. If that event is in reference to a clock net, the handle specifying the clock net will have been provided during registration, so the handle for the callback function implicitly includes the handle for the associated clock signal.","For example, a callback function may be scheduled by an event scheduler in the environment as a consequence of a simulation event, e.g., a logic signal or a clock signal, to which that callback function has been registered.","A task need not be registered with the system (e.g., to provide a handle for a task), since the task is part of a section of a model and separate instances of a task are generated for each instance of the section of the model.","Both tasks and callback functions can cause the event scheduler to schedule simulation events to occur. A simulation event can resume a task or invoke a callback function.","Callback functions disclosed herein provide increased flexibility and efficiency as compared to methods and systems currently in use. According to an embodiment, anything that can be implemented by a task can alternately be implemented by a callback function.","While one embodiment includes tasks and functions to provide for the modeling described herein, an alternate implementation extends Verilog or other HDL to handle clock nets and bus nets by providing native language primitives.","For the event scheduling function, and for description of clock nets and how time is specified, and further, for a description of how the scheduler is included, see U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. No. 2006\/0149526 titled CLOCK SIMULATION SYSTEM AND METHOD, incorporated herein by reference.","An example of hardware\/software simulation and modeling is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/830,435, filed Jul. 30, 2007 titled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MODIFYING A VIRTUAL PROCESSOR MODEL FOR HARDWARE\/SOFTWARE SIMULATION, which is incorporated herein by reference.","By way of example, this disclosure describes an embodiment of a standard bus (StdBus) protocol engine and its interface, when configured to operate in AXI Mode, that is, when configured to simulate the AMBI AXI bus protocol. Detailed information about the StdBus protocol engine is not provided herein, but a detailed description of the AXI interface is provided in order to explain how device models capable of communicating using the AXI protocol extensions to StdBus can be developed, according to an embodiment of the invention.","The AXI protocol is used herein only as an example. The present invention is not limited to the AXI protocol. Those in the art will understand, from the description herein, how to modify and how to build bus models that model according to other bus structures, including complex structures that allow for several transactions at once. Other bus structures include, for example, Opencore's Wishbone bus, Sonic's Silicon Backplane (Motorola, Inc.), IBM's CoreConnect, and so forth. Features described herein are applicable to point-to-point, many-to-many (i.e. the classic bus system), hierarchical buses, and\/or even switched fabrics such as crossbar buses, and how to modify the description herein for such other application would be clear to those in the art.","Furthermore, the specific implementation herein is for the modeling environment marketed by VaST Systems Technology Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and the invention is not limited to such a modeling environment.

The StdBus protocol engine can be considered as a controller of this net and handles requests to and from the models in this virtual platform.","The StdBus net can be considered as a communications pathway containing address and data, along with control and timing, information to be used in conjunction with the StdBus protocol engine.","According to an embodiment, a single AXI port is represented by a read (R) and a write (W) port, so each AXI master and slave device connects to the StdBus net using 2 separate bus ports as shown in the following diagram. Two possible bus configurations are shown in  where SBPE denotes the StdBus protocol engine","The Merged bus configuration connects both the read and write ports to a single instance of the StdBus protocol engine. The SBPE is responsible for routing the read\/write transactions issued by the master to the appropriate slave read\/write port. This is the recommended bus configuration when using StdBus AXI.","The split bus configuration uses a separate instance of the SBPE for the read and write ports.

The convention of bus master is used when a model can generate transactions to the StdBus (such as a virtual processor model) and bus slave is used when a model can receive transactions via the StdBus. In keeping to the AMBA AXI protocol, the StdBus AXI protocol does not support combined master\/slave AXI bus ports on devices.","When configured as AXI protocol, in an embodiment, the StdBus protocol engine does not perform any address decoding for timed transactions. When a master issues a timed transaction on the bus, the only transaction decoding performed by the SBPE is to determine whether to route the transaction to the slave's read or write bus port.","In one embodiment, the SBPE performs the following functions: the SBPE handles the routing of transactions generated by a master device to the appropriate slave device read or write AXI bus port; the SBPE handles registration of device decode regions by slave devices for the purpose of passing this information to master devices which may then use this information to automatically initialize and maintain their internal address decoding of transactions to the master device port. This decoding is also used internally by the SBPE for routing untimed StdBus transactions.","The SBPE also: handles the registration of slave callback functions to handle various transaction types on the bus such as read, write, and fetch etc; optionally intercepts master and slave callback functions to check for StdBus AXI protocol compliance; supports StdBus Metrix For the AXI protocol events; and supports StdBus debug transaction Tracing for the AXI protocol.","In addition to the above, in one embodiment, the StdBus AXI model implements the AXI read address, write address, read data, write data, and write response channels using master and slave callbacks embedded in each transaction.","The timed bus protocols supported by the SBPE may be separated into two groups; StdBus type 1 (StdBus1) and StdBus type 2 (StdBus2), as shown in table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Timed bus protocols supported by the SBPE"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"StdBus protocol name","StdBus protocol type"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"StdBusProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"PciProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"AhbProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"ApbProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"IBusProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"HpbProtocol","StdBus1"]},{"entry":[{},"AxiProtocol","StdBus2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In table 1, the protocol names suggest the type of protocol.

The master has set the CommandAvailableTickStamp (CATS) to indicate the time at which the transaction was initiated, or in AXI terms, the clock edge at which read command valid signal is asserted. This marks the start of the address phase.","2) If the slave cannot process the transaction at this time, for example, if it is busy with a previous transaction, then the transaction is queued. The queuing mechanism is the slave's responsibility. The slave will not receive another transaction through its read slave port until it calls pBusTransCommandUsed for this transaction.","3) When the slave is ready to process the transaction, it sets CommandUsedTickStamp (CUTS) to indicate the time at which the transaction was accepted. This marks the end of the address phase.","4) The slave calls pBusTransCommandUsed (CommandUsed) for this transaction. This, together with the CUTS, represents the sampling of the READY signal on the AXI read address channel, and indicates to the master that the channel is free, and the slave's read port is ready to accept another transaction. Slaves must not call CommandUsed until they can process another transaction on the slave's read port. Within the CommandUsed callback, the master may issue another transaction, which would be routed to the slave before the original CommandUsed function returned.","5) The slave sets pSourceBuffer to point to the data to be returned, and sets pBusTransData Used to point to the slave's DataUsed callback function.","6) The slave considers whether the (remaining) data will be delivered as one or more payloads, and sets the length of the data payload to be returned. Each payload can represent one or more data beats.","7) The slave increments DataAvailableLength by the new data payload length, updates DataAvailableTickStamp, sets Status in the transaction data structure and calls pBusTransDataAvailable. The DataAvailableTickStamp should be set to the clock edge at which the first beat in the new data payload is made available.","8) The master reads slave response (Status), reads the new data from pSourceBuffer, sets DataUsedLength=DataAvailableLength, sets DataUsedTickStamp, and calls pBusTransData Used. If no more data is to be transferred, for example, in the case of a single data payload, the transaction is now complete. Otherwise, the slave repeats Steps 6 and 7 and the master repeats Step 8 for each of the remaining payloads in the transaction.","The slave may have received another transaction from the master as soon as CommandUsed was called, that is, before the original transaction was completed. It is up to the slave to ensure that transactions are buffered or queued appropriately.","The AXI protocol allows the slave to return a different response for each beat in a read burst transaction. For example, for a burst of 4 beats, the slave may return OKAY for 3 beats, and SLVERR (indicating, \u201cslave error\u201d) for one beat. Each time the slave calls the master's DataAvailable function, it can set the Status field in the transaction data structure to indicate the desired response. If returning more than one data beat in a data payload with differing responses, the slave device should either split the data payloads according to the different responses, or return each beat as a separate payload with each response signaled individually.","In one embodiment, and as per the AXI protocol, even if an error occurs in the middle of a burst, the slave must continue with the burst until all beats have been processed. For example, if in a 16 beat transfer, an error occurs after beat 6, the slave must continue with the transfer for the remaining 10 beats (setting Status to SLVERR for each, or returning the remaining beats as one data payload of 10 beats with SLVERR set).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0274","num":"0275"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":"1100"},"Transaction  has two data payloads . It is up to the slave to determine how many data beats  form a data payload , and to return a payload  each time it invokes the master's DataAvailable function, with the following restrictions:","The start and end of each payload  must either be the start or end bytes of the transaction or at a beat-aligned boundary in-between.","The slave must limit the data payload length to correspond to the number of beats of data it can guarantee that it is capable of delivering on contiguous clock cycles. For example, if the slave needs to insert a delay between beats, it must limit each data payload  to one data beat and return each payload separately (i.e., with successive calls to pTransDataAvailable).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0278","num":"0279"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1200"]},"The process starts at step  where the Standard Bus Protocol Engine (SBPE) calls the slave device's decode function.","In step , it is determined whether the slave device is busy with a read.

Normally, for slave device accesses, caching is not enabled, so the CwfOffset field in the transaction is set to 0. For cached accesses, a VPM may set this field to a non-zero value to indicate that the first beat of a transaction is not the address of the actual transaction, but offset from the start of the transaction by CwfOffset beats. This is how a wrapping burst transaction is differentiated from an incrementing burst transaction. In this case, the first byte to be transferred is determined by CwfOffset*BeatSize.

This indicates to the master that the exclusive transfer failed.","3.19 Locked Accesses","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention applicable to the AXI protocol, locked transfers require that no other master is allowed to access the locked slave region until an unlocked transfer from the same master completes.","According to an embodiment, device models with a single slave port (one read, one write) do not require any additional processing for locked transfers (other than to pass on the locked attribute if acting as a bridge)\u2014it is up to the connected master device to ensure that the locked slave region is respected.","In accordance with an embodiment, for device models with multiple slave bus ports (e.g., multi-port bridge or interconnect devices), the device itself must ensure that the locked slave region or downstream master read\/write bus ports are not allocated to any other slave until the locked access has completed. This is achieved in one embodiment by buffering other transactions inside the device until the locked access has completed (by delaying the call to pTransCommandUsed).","Some VPM embodiments may issue locked reads and locked writes on the same bus port (e.g., the read port) when connected to a StdBus protocol net for a traditional (non-AXI) bus.","Unaligned Transfers","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the StdBus AXI protocol requires that each data payload is aligned to the start or end bytes of the transaction, or a beat boundary in-between. For example, if an AXI slave receives a transaction on an 8-byte bus, a burst write of 9 beats, where the size is 4 bytes, the start address is an odd (8n+1) Address, and the Length is 32, then, DataAvailableLength, and DataUsedLength can only take the values of 0, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31 or 32.","In such an embodiment, the transaction can still be modeled as a single data payload, or, broken into sets of individual beats, so long as the DAL and DUL use the above values, that is, they are beat-aligned.","AXI Transaction Timing","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the basis of timing within a transaction is fully described in terms of what is referred to herein as TickStamps. These TickStamps are contained within the transaction data structure passed to the slave device in the pre-registered bus access function. TickStamps may be of type tInt32, NOT tWord64 or tWord32, and their value is always relative to the clock that is driving the StdBus connection. On their own, TickStamps are meaningless, however, in accordance with an embodiment, when the \u201cnow\u201d TickStamp of the StdBus connection is subtracted from a TickStamp, the resultant tInt32 value represents the number of clock cycles by which the respective event is ahead or behind the current clock edge. According to an embodiment of the present invention, all TickStamps therefore must be changed and\/or measured, relative to the TickStamps within the transaction.","In accordance with an embodiment, the first TickStamp visible to the slave device is the CommandAvailableTickStamp, which is set by the master prior to issuing the transaction. This indicates the start of the address\/control phase of the transfer. It is up to the slave to determine when it can process the transaction, and set CommandUsedTickStamp accordingly.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, for read transactions, the slave determines the time required to deliver the read data based on the burst length, beat size, bus width etc. This value is set in DataAvailableTickStamp, and passed to the master via the pBusTransDataAvailable callback function. It is up to the slave how much data to pass each time pBusTransDataAvailable is invoked. However, the master's timing in invoking pBusTransData Used must allow for at least the number of beats in the data payload. For example, a master receiving a data payload cannot process more than a single bus width of data in one clock cycle.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for write transactions, the start of each data phase is determined by the master, who is responsible for setting DataAvailableTickStamp. The slave then determines the time required to process DataAvailableLength bytes (using the beat size, bus width etc) and sets DataUsedTickStamp as required. The slave's timing in invoking pBusTransDataUsed must allow for at least the number of beats in the data payload. For example, a slave receiving a data payload cannot process more than a single bus width of data in one clock cycle. When all data has been transferred, the slave sets ResponseAvailableTickStamp to indicate to the master the clock edge at which the slave response is asserted.","By interrogating the TickStamp values, in an embodiment, the slave device can establish when in time it is being called and knows when data is available in the case of a write. By manipulating the TickStamp values, it is able to report when data has been made available in the case of a read operation.","In one embodiment, TickStamp values should never be compared to other TickStamp values. Instead, they should be subtracted from each other and compared to 0. They have been specifically typed as tInt32 to permit the difference to produce a positive or negative result relative to the current 64 bit clock count, whilst only using 32 bit arithmetic.","Synchronization","When using one embodiment for modeling a slave device, there may be times that the read or write operation will have to be synchronized with an event which has to occur before valid data can be written or read. The following example is a situation which may occur in a modeling scenario using an embodiment of the present invention:","A master device decides to read data from a slave device register. The slave device can only provide this data if another hardware function within the device has completed. For example, in order to read an I\/O pin the data has to be returned to the master with the current value which is valid at the end of the transaction time. As the slave device is ahead of time in terms of the transaction, it must schedule a callback to itself to bring the simulation time to a valid point where the I\/O pin can be sampled. If this is the case, the slave device has the responsibility to update the NowTickStamp field within the transaction structure when the callback to itself returns, remembering that whenever control is passed from one subsystem to another, the NowTickStamp must be updated to reflect the current time in bus ticks. Time has then effectively moved on to a point where the I\/O pin can be read.","In an embodiment, synchronization can only be performed to a point in time ahead of the NowTickStamp within the transaction structure, since time cannot go backwards. Under all circumstances, when a transaction is first passed to a slave device, the CommandAvailableTickStamp (CATS), which marks the beginning of the command\/address phase, will be at or ahead of the NowTickStamp (NTS) time. If these tick stamps are not equal, that is, the transaction is ahead of current time, then, the difference (CATS-NTS) is greater than zero and indicates the number of clock ticks ahead of current time. The slave device model may want to schedule a callback to the beginning or end of the command, or, the first data phase of the transaction. This ensures that the data read or written by the slave is done at the appropriate time within the data phase of the transaction.","Data Handling","In another embodiment, data which is passed to a slave device (write) and data which is presented to a master device (read) can be handled via buffers.","For a write transaction, in an embodiment, the master merely provides a pointer (pSourceBuffer) to the data to be transferred. This may be a pointer to 8-bit data, and is stored in the bus transaction data structure. It points to the first (or only, in the case of a single byte transfer) byte in the transaction. It is the Length variable in the bus transaction data structure which informs the slave device of the (total) size of the data buffer required for the transfer. The DataUsedLength field gives the current offset into pSourceBuffer, and the number of bytes available is given by DataAvailableLength-DataUsedLength. For a write transaction, the slave device can extract the data from the buffer pointed to by pSourceBuffer and store the variable if required or take action on that data as appropriate. The data must be used prior to invoking pBusTransDataUsed.","According to an embodiment of the invention, for a read transaction a data buffer is usually either declared in the instance structure of the slave, or, allocated on the stack of the slave callback function which is to perform the read access and invoke the master's pBusTransDataAvailable callback. Unless all of the data is made available to the master in a single call to pBusTransDataAvailable, it is recommended that the slave declare the data buffer in its instance structure. As it is a read transaction, according to an embodiment, it is the responsibility of the slave device to provide the pointer to the data it is about to return, therefore the pSourceBuffer variable must be updated to reflect this. The alignment of the buffer in physical memory must match the 32-bit alignment of the accessed transaction data. For example, if the access is of Length 32 bytes and aligned to a 32 bit address, then it would be incorrect to provide a buffer pointer with an address which is not 32-bit aligned (see Buffered data Handling Alignment below).","When the slave device has processed a block of data, according to an embodiment, it must indicate to the master how much data has been processed. This is reflected in the DataAvailableLength variable for reads, or the DataUsedLength for writes, of the bus transaction data structure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0350","num":"0351"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00020","num":"00020"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["pBusCommand->DataAvailableLength += BytesProcessed;","\/\/ read"]},{"entry":"pBusCommand->DataUsedLength ="},{"entry":["pBusCommand->DataAvailableLength;","\/\/ write"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In most cases, when designing a slave interface using an embodiment of the present invention, it is necessary to buffer data in the interface itself.

Because of this, a static read buffer can be set up for the slave interface which can then be used to pass the pointer back along the transaction structure. Since in one embodiment this buffer is a tWord8 pointer the storage element should type-cast to this variable type. Even though this is a tWord8 pointer, care should be taken to ensure that this buffer is aligned on an n-byte boundary (where n is the data size of the storage element).

For checking purposes, the CUTS is initialized by the master to be equal to the CATS before the transaction is issued, indicating that the command has not yet been accepted.","According to an embodiment of the invention, for the read data channel, the slave sets the DataAvailableTickStamp (DATS), which indicates the clock edge at which the data payload is made available (corresponding to the clock edge at which valid is asserted on the read data channel for the first data beat contained within the data payload).","When the master has processed the read data, it sets DataUsedTickStamp (DUTS), which corresponds to the clock edge at which both read data valid and read data ready are sampled as asserted for the last data beat within the data payload.","In one embodiment, the write data channel works in a similar manner to the read data channel except in the reverse direction, that is, the master sets the DATS and the slave sets the DUTS.","The fifth channel is the write response channel. In another embodiment, this channel is only used for write transactions, and in this case, the slave sets the ResponseAvailableTickStamp (RATS), and the master sets the ResponseUsedTickStamp (RUTS). In AXI protocol terms the RATS corresponds to the edge at which write response valid is asserted, and, the RUTS corresponds to the edge at which both write response valid and write response ready are sampled as asserted.","Untimed Transactions","Untimed transactions are protocol independent. An AXI master device issues an untimed transaction in the same way as a StdBus1 protocol device.

Other embodiments may or may not includes these features and\/or parameters, or use other mechanisms.","5.1 Arbitration and Arbitration Reporting","In an embodiment, StdBus for AXI model supports only a single master connected to each instance of the SBPE, so the Arbitration and BusArbitrationReport parameters in one version are set to Disabled when using AXI protocol.","In another embodiment, the FixedPriorityArbitration.OverwriteDefaultPriorityIdle and FixedPriorityArbitration.OverwriteDefaultPriorityActive parameters are also ignored and should be left to the default setting (0).","5.2 Configuration of Bus Data and Address Width","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a Bus Width parameter sets the width of the data bus of the respective StdBus instance in Bytes. In one embodiment, this parameter is interrogated by the master and slave devices connected to the bus instance in order to determine their respective timing and behavior.","In another embodiment, an AddressBits parameter sets the width of the address bus of the respective StdBus instance in Bits. This parameter may be interrogated by the master and slave devices connected to the bus instance in order to determine their respective timing and behavior.","5.3 Protocol Selection and Timing","In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a BusProtocol parameter selects the bus protocol.

Because in one embodiment, Arbitration is set to Disabled for StdBus AXI, no trace is output. This is because, according to an embodiment, with Arbitration set to Disabled, no simulation time synchronization is performed by the StdBus. Each transaction is processed when it is received and only the timing values are updated. Simulation time is not advanced in relation to the transaction. Because in some embodiments, any waveform trace output is in a format that is in a linearly increasing time order, the embodiments described herein StdBus cannot effectively create values in a waveform trace file in such a format ahead or behind current time.","According to an embodiment, BusMonitoring is set to Disabled for AXI bus modeling.","5.5 Checking and Tracing","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the StdBus model is capable of checking compliance with the protocol, e.g., the AXI protocol during the simulation. This is importance for complex bus protocols such as AXI.","In one embodiment, the model is also capable of generating detailed tracing information which may be useful for debugging.","The following parameters may be used to control protocol checking and tracing within the StdBus model, and apply to the particular example embodiment described herein, e.g., using the COMET framework. Other embodiments may or may not includes these features and\/or parameters, or use other mechanisms.","WarningLevel: This parameter controls the level of warnings that are generated by the StdBus model. When set to CriticalOnly, only the most serious problems will cause a warning message to be displayed. When set to All, the StdBus model will output warnings for any inconsistent or incorrect behavior (for example, the issuing of transactions with the bus clock stopped, timing discrepancies, and other anomalies).","CheckingAndTracing.ProtocolChecking: When set to Enabled, the StdBus model intercepts master and slave callback functions to ensure that the order and timing of the callbacks is consistent with the StdBus AXI protocol. Warnings or errors are generated when non-compliant behavior is encountered (For example, bad tickstamps or callbacks out of order). Protocol checking will have an adverse effect on simulation performance, but is useful when developing a new device. When set to Disabled, no protocol checking is performed. This option may be used when the user is confident that the device is operating correctly.","CheckingAndTracing.ProtocolTracing: When set to Enabled, the StdBus model generates protocol trace information that may be useful when debugging device behavior. Tracing output may be controlled using TracingSampleRate and TracingTrigger.","CheckingAndTracing.ProtocolErrorForcesExit: When set to Enabled, a protocol error causes the simulation to exit. If this parameter is Disabled, the simulation will not exit, but a warning may be issued. This parameter is only in effect if protocol checking is enabled.","CheckingAndTracing.TracingSampleRate: This parameter determines the frequency and quantity of transaction information which is output by the bus and is only in effect if protocol tracing is also enabled. For example, if set to 1, abbreviated details of every transaction processed by the StdBus model may be displayed; if set to 2, abbreviated details of every second transaction may be displayed. Full transaction tracing is enabled by setting this parameter to 0.","CheckingAndTracing.TracingTrigger: This parameter allows the user to enable tracing at a certain point in the simulation and is only in effect if protocol tracing is also enabled. For example, if set to 100, full or abbreviated tracing (see TracingSampleRate above) is only enabled after 100 transactions have been processed by the StdBus model. Setting this parameter to 0 causes tracing to be enabled as soon as the simulation starts. From the point at which full tracing is commenced, protocol checking is also enabled regardless of the state of the ProtocolChecking parameter.","5.6 Example of Write Cycle Timing","Included herein is an example of a StdBus AXI write transaction. included are typical timing waveforms, a step-by-step analysis of the timing waveform, and an example operational flowchart including actual function calls and detailed explanations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0502","num":"0503"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"1900"},"This example assumes that the slave is not processing any other transaction when the master makes the request.

This may be less than the total transaction length if the master or slave device processes the data in multiple payloads. This value accumulates as each payload in a burst transaction is processed. When the CwfOffset field is zero, that is, the transaction is not wrapping, then the first DataAvailableLength number of bytes pointed to by pSourceBuffer are valid. When the CwfOffset field is non zero, that is, the transaction is wrapping, then the DataAvailableLength number of bytes pointed to by pSourceBuffer and offset from the start by the CwfOffset beat and wrapping through to the beginning of the buffer are valid.

If the CwfOffset field is zero, that is, the transaction is not wrapping, then DataUsedLength gives the current offset into the buffer to the next un-processed byte, and the number of unprocessed bytes available in the data payload is given by DataAvailableLength-DataUsedLength. For write transactions, data availability is automatically signaled by a master device if the DataAvailableLength is non-zero at the time at which the transaction is requested to the StdBus protocol engine.
