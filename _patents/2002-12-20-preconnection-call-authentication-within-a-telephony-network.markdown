{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to the field of telecommunications and, more particularly, to pre-connection telecommunication authentication.","2. Description of the Related Art","Business interconnectivity demands have resulted in important business information being placed within networked resources. Consequently, security mechanisms have been developed and utilized to prevent unauthorized data access while assuring access can be granted to authorized users. Conventional security mechanisms attempt to prevent hostile system penetrations after a communication link has been established between a receiving or called computing device and an originating or calling computing device. Although unauthorized users may be prevented from accessing system resources, unauthorized users can be granted the opportunity to attack or \u201chack\u201d into restricted areas using the established communication link.","Another situation where switch-level inbound call restrictions can be beneficial involves telephony privacy. Many home telephone owners, for example, can suffer from persistent, undesired telephone calls, such as the calls made by telemarketing companies. To many, such forced contacts and solicitations can be extremely annoying. Despite the annoyance, many providers of telephony services fail to provide inbound call screening mechanisms to customers. Instead, customers desiring a level of privacy have often been forced to purchase customer premise equipment (CPE) specifically designed to block or monitor calls. Such equipment can be expensive to purchase and can require substantial setup expenditures.","The invention disclosed herein provides a method and a system for pre-connection call authentication within a telephony network. In particular, the invention can perform call authorization functions before a receiving device is contacted. For example, in one embodiment, a telecommunication switch can access a network element that performs call authorization. This call authorization application can receive a connectivity request from an originating device desiring a connection to a receiving device. The call authorization application can determine if security restrictions exist against the receiving device and, if necessary, responsively send an authentication request to the originating device through a ringback channel.","The originating device can send an authentication response via a specified transmission channel over which a facsimile calling tone (FAX CNG) signal can be transmitted. This transmission channel can be called a CNG channel. Notably, both the ringback channel and the CNG channel are within the voice band (0\u20133,400 Hz) and can be utilized to convey signals before a telephony connection is established. The call authorization application can then grant or deny connectivity based upon the authentication response.","One aspect of the present invention can include a method for providing call authorization within a telephony network. The method can include receiving a telephony connectivity request for establishing a telephony voice channel between an originating device and a receiving device. Additionally, the call authorizer can access receiving device specific information, wherein the device specific information can include an authorization requirement. In a particular embodiment, the call authorizer can determine a phone number associated with the originating device and modify at least a portion of the authorization requirement responsive to the phone number.","In one embodiment, the call authorizer can transmit an authorization request to the originating device responsive to the connectivity request. In another embodiment, the call authorizer can include an encrypted key within the authorization request, wherein successful decryption of the encrypted key results in an approved authorization code that satisfies the authorization requirement. Notably, the authorization request can be conveyed through a ringback channel, having a bandwidth suitable for propagating a ringback signal. The ringback signal is an intermittent audio tone signifying to the originating device that the receiving device is ringing.","Additionally, the call authorizer can receive a digitally encoded signal specifying an authorization code from the originating device. This authorization code can be transmitted by the originating device via a CNG channel. The CNG channel can be a frequency range within a voice channel that is capable of transporting a FAX CNG signal from an originating device to the call authorizer. In one embodiment, the CNG channel can be the frequency range of 900\u20131,300 Hz. In another embodiment, once the authorization code is received by the call authorizer, the call authorizer must demodulate a carrier signal operating at a base frequency of about 1,100 Hz. In yet another embodiment, the call authorizer can decode the digitally encoded data within the authorization code. This decoding step can retrieve information encoded by toggling a frequency of about 1,100 Hz between an on and an off state. The method can determine whether the authorization code satisfies the authorization requirement and responsively provide a connection between the originating device and the receiving device.","In a particular embodiment, the method can also relay an authorized caller signal to the receiving device that contains digitally encoded information that identifies an originating party. Notably, in such an embodiment, the actual identity of an originating party, as opposed to a default party associated with the originating device, can be determined by a receiving party before a connection is established. In another embodiment, the call authorizer can receive the connectivity request and can receive the authorization code through a first connectivity channel. This first connectivity channel can be a voice channel within a telephony network. The connection being authorized by the call authorizer can, however, specify a second connectivity channel that is not within the voice channel used by the first connectivity channel. For example, in one such embodiment, the first connectivity channel can be a voice channel of a digital subscriber line, and the second connectivity channel can be a data channel of the digital subscriber line. In another embodiment, the second connectivity channel can utilize satellite broadcasts or cable to relay information to the originating device. Accordingly, such an embodiment can be used to provide television broadcasting to a satellite receiver, where such broadcasts are authorized through a telephone line connected to the satellite receiver.","Another aspect of the present invention can include a system for providing call authorization including a profile repository containing receiving device specific information. The system can also include a call authorizer communicatively linked to a telephony network and to the profile repository. The call authorizer can be configured to send and receive digitally encoded pre-connection telephony signals specifying authentication information. In one embodiment, the call authorizer can be further configured to generate a digitally encoded signal specifying an encrypted key that must be decrypted by an originating device before a telephony connection is established between the originating device and a receiving device. In another embodiment, the call authorizer can be a network element within a telephony network. In yet another embodiment, the call authorizer can be a switch independent application.","The invention disclosed herein provides a method and a system for pre-connection call authentication within a telephony network. In particular, the system provides recipient-side call authorization. The system can access a call authorizer when a connectivity request reaches a destination telephony switch, the destination telephony switch being the telecommunication node to which the receiving device connects. Thereafter, the call authorizer can prompt an originating device for an authorization code via a ringback channel. The establishment of a connection to a receiving device can be dependant on receiving an acceptable authorization code through a CNG channel. Both the ringback channel and the CNG channel can be frequency ranges within the voice band that can convey signals before a telephony connection is established.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","170","100","110","115","125","170","190","180","175","110"]},"Notably, switches, such as the originating switch  and the destination switch , can connect customer premise equipment to the telecom network . Hence, the originating switch  can connect an originating device  to the telecom network . Similarly, the destination switch  can be a node within the telecom network  communicatively linking a receiving device  to the telecom network . Since one switch can connect many telephony devices to a given network, both the originating device  and the receiving device  can be connected to the same switch. Accordingly, embodiments can exist where the originating switch  and the destination switch  are the same switch.","The telecom network  can be any series of points or nodes connected by a series of interconnection paths capable of connecting the originating switch  to the destination switch . For example, the telecom network  can be a circuit-switched network included within the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In another embodiment, portions of the telecom network  can be a commercially owned proprietary packet-switched network with Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capabilities.","The telephone line  can be a line that connects a telephony device (customer premise equipment) to the telecom network . Physically, the telephone line  can include, but is not limited to, such a medium as a twisted pair, a coaxial cable, a fiber optic line, and even a wireless transmission pathway. The telephone line  can conduct signals within a voice channel . The voice channel  can be a bandwidth segment, typically 64 kbps, utilized by a telephony network for a single voice connection. The voice channel  can operate within the voice band, wherein the voice band is the frequency range between approximately 0 and 3,400 Hz, which is sufficient bandwidth to \u201ccarry\u201d intelligible human speech. Ordinary telephone service is often restricted to the voice channel , while other services, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) service, can utilize a broader frequency range.","A CNG channel  can include a frequency range within the voice band through which an authorization code  can be transmitted. While the CNG channel  is always capable of transporting a pre-connection FAX CNG signal, the exact frequency range available within the CNG\/channel  can vary according to frequency filters having a passband at or around 1,100 Hz. For example, in one embodiment, frequencies below approximately 300 Hz and above approximately 2,400 Hz can be filtered by telephony equipment. The resulting CNG channel  can include the frequency range from approximately 300 Hz to 2,400 Hz. In another embodiment, all frequencies that deviate from the 1,100 Hz frequency (used by the FAX CNG signal according to T 0.30 protocol) by more than 200 Hz are filtered. Accordingly, the CNG channel  can include the frequency range from approximately 900 Hz to 1,300 Hz.","In one embodiment, signals within the CNG channel  can be digitally encoded by intermittently turning on and off a frequency of about 1,100 Hz, where an \u201con state\u201d can represent a digital one, and an \u201coff state\u201d can represent a digital zero, or vice versa. In an alternate embodiment, signals within the CNG channel  can utilize a modulation technique with a base frequency of about 1,100 Hz. Modulation techniques can include, but are not limited to, phase key shifting (PKS) and frequency key shifting (FKS).","The ringback channel  can include a frequency range within the voice channel  wherein at least one authorization request  can be conveyed to the originating device . The ringback channel  can be a back channel through which a ringback signal is ordinarily sent from a telephony switch to an originating device . The ringback signal is an intermittent audio tone that the originating device  receives after dialing a number, when the distant end of the circuit or the receiving device  is receiving a ringing signal. While the ringback signal is typically an analog signal, the authorization request  can be a digital signal conveyed through the ringback channel .","The call authorizer  can be an application capable of performing call authorizations for at least one receiving device . In so doing, the call authorizer  can relay authorization data to an originating device  via the ringback channel  and receive authorization data from the originating device  via the CNG channel . All conveyances of authorization data to and from the call authorizer  can occur before a connection is established between the originating device  and the receiving device . In one embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a network element that interfaces with the destination switch  through a gateway . In another embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a stand-alone solution interfacing directly with the destination switch  without utilizing gateway  as an intermediary. In yet another embodiment, the call authorizer  can be a program disposed within the destination switch .","The call authorizer  can utilize encrypted keys to determine if a connectivity request is to be granted. Any type of encryption can be used including symmetric key and public key encryption schemes. For example, the call authorizer can send an encrypted key to the originating device . This encrypted key can then be decrypted, utilizing a decryption key possessed by the originating device . The originating device  can then send an authorization code  as proof of successful decryption. Only those devices possessing an approved decryption key can construct an approved authorization code. The returned authorization code  can be utilized by the call authorizer  to determine if a connectivity request should be granted or denied.","In order to determine the necessary authorizations for a particular receiving device , the call authorizer  can access a profile repository . The profile repository  can contain receiving device specific information. In one embodiment, this information can be modified by a user of the receiving device . The profile repository  can be a data store internal or external to the call authorizer . Additionally, the profile repository  can include different authorization requirements for different originating devices. For example, in one embodiment, when the originating device  is located within the same building as the receiving device  no authorization may be necessary. Yet, authorization can be necessary within that embodiment for originating devices located outside the building in which the receiving device  is located.","While in one embodiment the call authorizer  can convey authorization data to the originating device  without assistance, in another embodiment, a ringback processor  can assist in these transmissions. The ringback processor  can be an application capable of receiving data and conveying this data as analog and digital signals over the ringback channel . The ringback channel  can be a segment of telephony bandwidth within the voice frequency range (approximately 0\u20133,400 Hz) reserved for pre-connection transmissions between a telephony switch and the originating device . Typically, an intermittent analog signal representing the ringing of a receiving device is sent along this ringback channel.","The network  can be any series of points or nodes connected by a series of interconnection paths capable of connecting destination switch  to the call authorizer  and transporting packet-switched messages between connected nodes. For example, the network  can be the Internet. Alternately, the network  can be an intranet utilized by a telecom carrier that owns the destination switch . Additionally, a gateway  can be used to interface between the call authorizer  and the destination switch . In one embodiment, the gateway  can facilitate switch independent application programming by providing a set of open network application programming interfaces (APIs). These interfaces can translate standardized telephony commands to switch specific ones. Additionally, the gateway  can function as a layer of abstraction between a telephony network and an application, providing standardized routines to ease many programming tasks.","For example, in one embodiment, the gateway  can be a Parlay gateway capable of interfacing any Parlay compliant application to a Parlay compliant telecom network . In another embodiment, the gateway  can be a software platform, such as the International Business Machines (IBM) Resource Manager, which is commercially available from International Business Machines Corporation of Armonk, N.Y., that can provide the call authorizer  value-added telephony applications and services. In yet another embodiment, the gateway  can include Java APIs for Integrated Networks (JAIN) allowing the call authorizer  to be implemented as a switch independent JAIN compliant application.","While the voice channel  can be utilized by the call authorizer  for transmitting authorization data, the connectivity channel being authorized can be a channel outside the voice channel . For example, because a digital subscriber line (DSL) can simultaneously carry both data and voice signals along an ordinary telephone line, the call authorizer  can utilize the voice channel  of the DSL line to authorize the constantly connected data channel of the DSL line. Such an arrangement can provide additional security to a DSL connection preventing unauthorized users from utilizing the bandwidth of authorized DSL subscribers.","Another example of a connectivity channel outside the voice channel being authorized by the call authorizer  can involve direct satellite television broadcasting or cable. For example, a satellite reception device can require periodic verifications through a connected telephone line  in order to receive specified satellite broadcasts. Thus, the call authorizer  can be utilized to prevent receiver units using gray market cards that spoof a receiver into granting unauthorized broadcast accesses. Such a reception device could, for example, stop functioning after not receiving a signal from the call authorizer  after a predefined period.","In operation, the originating device  can place a call to the receiving device  through the telecom network . The originating device  can send a connectivity request through the originating switch  across the telecom network  to the destination switch . Notably, when both the originating device  and the receiving device  are connected to the same switch, the connectivity request can be handled directly by that switch, which can function as both the originating switch  and the destination switch . The destination switch  can then send an authorization inquiry to the call authorizer . The call authorizer  can utilize the profile repository  to determine that an authorization code is necessary before a connection with the receiving device  is permitted.","Thereafter, the call authorizer  can construct an authorization request . This authorization request  can be conveyed to the originating device  via the ringback channel . Notably, the ringback processor  can be utilized to facilitate the transmission of the authorization request . This authorization request  can contain an encrypted key that the originating device  can decrypt. Upon decrypting the encrypted key, an authorization code  can be generated. The originating device  can transmit the authorization code  to the call authorizer  via the CNG channel . The call authorizer  can then grant or deny connectivity to the receiving device  based upon the authorization code .","It should be noted that the call authorizer  can, but need not, submit an encrypted key to the originating device . In one embodiment, the call authorizer  can utilize a password encoded within the authorization code  to determine connectivity. This password need not be based on an encryption scheme. In another embodiment, no authorization request  need be sent from the call authorizer  at all. In such an embodiment, the originating device  can submit an authorization code  to the call authorizer  at or about the time when the connectivity request is submitted or shortly thereafter. In such an embodiment, any connectivity requests sent without an accompanying authorization code  can be automatically denied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","205"]},"In step , the call authorizer can access a data storage area to determine what authorization scheme, if any, is associated with the receiving device. In one embodiment, each receiving party can individually modify the authorization scheme for any receiving devices that the receiving party possesses. Authorization schemes can vary according to a telephone number associated with a receiving device. In step , a determination can be made in reference to the authorization scheme accessed that an authorization key is required. Accordingly, some cryptography key, such as a public key, can be required before a connection to the receiving device is permitted.","In step , the call authorizer can transmit a request for a required key to the receiving device through a ringback channel. In step , an authorization code can be received through the CNG channel. Notably, the authorization code can contain a digitally encoded signature that results from the originating device decrypting the cryptography key sent within the authorization request. In certain embodiments, the original connection request sent from the originating device can include an authorization code containing either a password or a previously determined digitally encoded signature. In such an embodiment, step  can be rendered unnecessary and can be skipped by the method .","In step , the method can compare the authorization code with a desired response and determine if authorization should be granted. If the authorization code does not satisfy the requirements of the call authorizer, the method can proceed to step , where the call authorizer can signal that the connectivity request is unauthorized. In step , the authorization manager can then deny the originating device connectivity.","If the authorization code indicates authorization should be granted, however, the method can proceed to step , where the call authorizer can signal that the connectivity request is authorized. In step , the ringback processor can grant the originating device connectivity to the receiving device. Thereafter, a communication channel can be established between the two devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","300"]},"The method  can begin in step , where a destination switch receives a connectivity request from the originating device. While in many cases, the connectivity request will be for a dedicated circuit-switched voice connection, the method can operate equally as well within a packet-switched environment. In step , the method can send an authorization query to the call authorizer. The call authorizer can determine from the authorization query that additional information is needed from the originating device before authorization can be granted. Accordingly, an authorization requirement can be generated that details the necessary additional information.","In step , the authorization requirement and relevant parameters can be relayed from the call authorizer to the ringback processor. The ringback processor can generate a signal configured to prompt a user of the originating device for the necessary additional information specified by the authorization requirement. This signal generated by the ringback processor can be called an authorization request. Relevant parameters can include, but are not limited to, originating device identification parameters, receiving device parameters available to the destination switch, and special processing parameters related to the authorization requirement.","In step , the ringback processor can retrieve profile information concerning the receiving device. For example, profile information can include, but is not limited to, such information as the called telephone number, the name of the called party, capabilities of the called device, receiving device preferences, security requirements for establishing a connection, and unique connection requirements. The profile information can be located in an external data store, can be contained within the ringback processor, or can be contained within parameters passed to the ringback processor.","In step , the ringback processor can determine originating device parameters. In one embodiment, the type of authorization request can be modified according to the capabilities of an originating device. For example, if an originating device is configured to accept a digitized authorization key, such a key can be constructed and sent to the originating device. If the originating device is not configured to accept such a key, however, an analog voice signal can be generated requesting that a user of the originating device provide authorization data as specified by the authorization requirement.","In step , the ringback processor can generate an authorization request. This authorization request can include analog and\/or digital signals. In step , the ringback processor can send the authorization request to the destination switch. Thereafter, in step  the connection with the ringback processor can be terminated. In step , the ringback transmission can be relayed through the telephony network to the originating switch. Notably, if the originating device and receiving device are both connected to the same switch, step  is unnecessary. In step , the originating switch can transmit the authorization request to the originating device through a designated ringback channel. This ringback channel can be a frequency range within the voice band designated for ringback signals.","It should be appreciated that while the embodiment described in  includes a ringback processor and extensively utilized its capabilities to transmit the authorization request to the originating device, the invention does not require a separate ringback processor. Instead, the functionality attributed to the ringback processor in  can be incorporated within the call authorizer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","400","400","405"]},"In step , the originating device can determine if an encrypted key is contained within the authorization request. In step , the originating device can decrypt data contained within the authorization request as necessary. Notably, cryptography schemes such as symmetric keys and public keys can be utilized for the decryption process within method . In embodiments utilizing key encryption, the originating device can contain a decryption key capable of accessing the data from within the authorization request. In other embodiments, the authorization request can prompt the originating device for a particular code or password required by the call authorizer.","Once necessary decryption actions have been taken, the method can proceed to step , where a data signal can be responsively generated. This data signal can be the authorization code that the call authorizer has requested. In step , the method can convey this data signal across a CNG channel. Notably, the conveyance of the data signal, as well as all previously mentioned steps, can occur before a voice connection is established between the originating and receiving devices. Additionally, the CNG channel across which the data signal is conveyed can be the previously detailed frequency range centered at 1,100 Hz.","The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software.
