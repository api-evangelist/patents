No. 60\/515,598 entitled \u201cGAME OF SKILL AND CHANCE AND SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PLAYING GAMES OF SKILL AND CHANCE,\u201d filed on Oct. 29, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to games of skill and chance and, more particularly, to methods of and systems for playing games of skill and chance.","A few electronic games have the goal for a player to remove some or all of the elements on a grid of random color elements. Two such games are the \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d game provided on the Internet website gamesville.com and the \u201cPoppit!\u201d game provided on the Internet website pogo.com. The \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d game includes a 12 by 14 grid of variously colored bubbles, and extra value items are placed in some of these bubbles. During game play, a player selects and removes two or more bubbles of the same color that are touching. As bubbles are popped, lower bubbles in the same column move up. As columns are eliminated, remaining columns move together. Points are earned for each bubble popped and for each extra value item released from its bubble. A minimum number of points must be earned in a game to keep the points. If a specified number of points is accumulated over consecutive games, then a player earns an entry into a daily sweepstake.","The \u201cPoppit!\u201d game is similar to the \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d game. The \u201cPoppit!\u201d game includes a 10 by 15 grid of colored balloons. Bonus token items are located behind balloons on the grid. A player selects and removes two or more balloons of the same color that are touching. As balloons are popped, lower balloons move up. As columns are eliminated, remaining columns move together. When a hidden item is no longer covered by balloons, the item falls to the bottom of the game screen. A player gains points when all hidden items are uncovered. Additional points are earned if the screen is cleared of the remaining balloons.","There is a present and recurring need for new games of skill and chance that are easy to understand, are easy to play, and are accessible but are varied enough to maintain the interest of players.

The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention, but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.","One aspect of the present invention provides a new game that includes elements of the previously described games of skill and chance known as the \u201cPoppit!\u201d game and the \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d game. According to one aspect of the present invention, it is appreciated that there are advantages of these types of games and similar games that make these games attractive for online gaming. However, according to one aspect of the invention, it is also appreciated that disadvantages of the games \u201cPoppit!\u201d and \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d games include that the games are not wagering games and that the players are not permitted to play against each other.","Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, a player is allowed to play against another player in a \u201cPoppit\u201d or \u201cBubble-O-Matic\u201d-type game. Further, according to another aspect of the present invention, these aforementioned games of skill and chance are enabled for wagering by a player. In another aspect, upon reaching a particular state of the game (e.g., removing a selected element(s) or set of elements from the interface, or achieving a certain outcome) for one or more of the players, a player wins the game.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","102","104","104"]},"According to one embodiment of the present invention, a game of skill and chance is provided wherein the object of the game of skill and chance is to remove some or all elements on a grid. Preferably, the object of the game is to remove some elements from a group of elements or most preferably, all elements from a group of elements. The winning outcome for a game is predetermined. Elements are removed from the grid when they match the last randomly selected element from the pre-determined set of elements. The same element may be chosen any number of times during a game. In another embodiment, removal of matching elements may be performed by computer. For example, one, some, or all matching elements may be automatically removed by the computer. Preferably, the player selects which matching elements to remove from the grid. A player may have a limited time to make the selections, such as until the next element is selected from the predetermined set of elements. A player may also be limited to choosing only one or some of the elements from his grid of elements for each selected element. Selection of the selected element from the predetermined set of elements may be visually represented, for example, using a spinning reel , spinning wheel, or moving pointer.","According to some embodiments, the difficulty to win the game may increase as the number of players increase. The game difficulty may increase in numerous ways including increasing the number of elements in the predetermined set of elements, increasing the number of group of elements, or increasing the number of elements in a group of elements. The number of players may be determined at the beginning of the game, and thus the difficulty of the game may be determined at the beginning of a game. Alternatively, the number of players may be monitored as players are added and subtracted, and the difficulty of the game may be adjusted as the game proceeds in response to the number of players. In this case, a predetermined set of rules for adjusting game parameters while the game is in progress may be associated with the game. The parameters adjusted may include, for example, the number of elements in the predetermined set of elements or the number of objects in each group of objects within the grid of objects.","According to one embodiment, new elements may be added to a player's grid of elements prior to selecting the next element from the predetermined set of elements. Elements may be added following predetermined rules. An example of such a rule includes adding one random new element to each group of elements that has less than the initial number of elements in the group.","According to another embodiment, a game may finish before a winner is obtained. For example, a game may have a predetermined maximum number of element selections that may occur. To aid a player in keeping track of the number of elements selected during a game, the number of selected elements during a game may be represented to the player, such as the number of spins  in .","According to one embodiment of the invention, a game player may need to pay for playing prior to a game. For example, a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular, a game player may pay using money by debit card, credit card, check, cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively, a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines, frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person using a cashier (e.g. at a casino or a lottery outlet) or through other remote means including telephone, handheld device, kiosk, computer through the internet or other network and mail.","In one embodiment of the invention, players may subscribe to play multiple consecutive games. That is, the player pays at one time to play many consecutive games. The player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed.","According to one embodiment of the invention, players may also enter to play this or any other wagering game of skill or chance using an alternative method of entry (AMOE). AMOE is a required available method of entry that does not require a purchase to enter a sweepstake; sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes.","A common AMOE method is to have an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes send in a post card with his or her name, address or other contact information. Another AMOE method is to have an individual sign on to a free internet website and submit the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE.","According to one embodiment of the invention, it is realized that an AMOE (alternative method of entry) may be used to enter a game of skill or chance. More particularly, it is possible to develop, implement and run wagering games of skill or chance, including the inventive games described herein, with an AMOE method of entry as is usually associated with sweepstakes. An individual may enter the wagering game of chance by AMOE using the post card or the online method outlined above. The wagering game of skill or chance player entering by AMOE may also have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game in which they are entered. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of games within a given period of time, for example one game in one year or two games in one month. Other numbers of games and given periods may be any number, and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.","According to one embodiment, the game that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example, the post card AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively, the game entered may be the next starting game after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative, AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game(s) each hour, day, week or other time interval.","According to one embodiment, a game also has a predetermined payout table associated with it. The payout table may have a listing of the ways to obtain a payout and its payout amount. The payout amount for a win may depend upon but may not be rigidly determined by the odds of obtaining the predetermined winning outcome in the predetermined maximum number of selected elements; for example, the odds of obtaining the predetermined winning outcome with ten selected elements may be twice that for twenty winning cell content drawn, but the payout may be only one and one half times higher for matching the winning pattern in ten versus twenty selected elements. Thus, the payout amount may be varied, preferably increased, if the predetermined winning outcome was obtained in less than the predetermined maximum number of selected elements. For example, if the predetermined maximum number of selected elements is twenty and the payout for that is thirty credits, then if the winning outcome is obtained within the first ten drawn selected elements then the payout for obtaining that may be forty-five credits.","The payout table may also have adjustments for a player's subscription. For instance, the payout may increase if the player has a multiple game subscription, multiple card subscription, high payment per game or any combination of the three. The payout may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including frequent player credits. Of course, all payout adjustments must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.","The payout table for each game session may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session. These types of jackpots are commonly called rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be the same amount that transfers from game session to game session until it is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as additional games are played. Rolling or progressive jackpots are typically paid out for a difficult way to obtain the predetermined winning outcome, e.g. completely remove a group of elements within five selected elements.","The final payout may also be affected as to whether the game has a fixed payout for a win or whether the payout is shared. If the payout is fixed for a win, all players that obtain the predetermined winning outcome at the same time will be paid the amount listed in the payout table for the win; in this instance, each player is playing solely against the game operator. If the payout is shared, then all players that obtain the predetermined winning outcome at the same time will be paid a total of the amount listed in the payout table. Each player may receive a share of the total payout depending upon how much he or she paid for the game or any other legal criteria.","The final payout may also be affected by bonus play. Bonus play is well known in the gaming industry and works to increase some payouts by offering the chance to multiply a payout.","One or more games may proceed concurrently. Parameters of the concurrent games may be the same, similar, or different. For example, the randomly selected elements from the predetermined set of elements may be used for one or more concurrent games if the predetermined set of elements is the same for the one or more concurrent games. As a further example, the parameter of the grid of elements may be different in all the games.","Additionally, the games may run continually, i.e. one after another. When one game ends, another game will begin immediately or in a short period of time. The games may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when games begin. If game play requires four and a half (4.5) minutes to complete, then the next game may start immediately or in thirty seconds to keep to a schedule of games every five minutes at :00, :05, :10, :15, :20, :25, :30, :35, :40, :45, :50, :55 of each hour. Since the games may run continually, it may be possible that a game will have no game player playing.","A computer system may automatically choose the grid of elements for a game player. Because a computer system can both choose the grid of elements and play the game, a player need not participate or observe each game, as discussed further below.","The game player may view the game proceedings using television, wireless or line telephone with display, handheld device, kiosk, computer or in person; depending upon the viewing medium, it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while other viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information. For example, the game player may operate a computer system that has an Internet-enabled interface (e.g., using Macromedia Flash or Java) and the computer system may display streamed game information within that interface.","When the player obtains the predetermined winning outcome, he or she then informs the game operator that they have a winner. If the game player is playing the game remotely, for instance over the web or interactive television, or if the game operator is a computer system, then an electronic or voice indication method would be necessary to authenticate and verify the game player and the winning game card. Such methods are well known in the remote and electronic gaming industry. As an example, a player may click on a \u201cClaim Win!\u201d button  as shown in .","According to one embodiment, a computer system may automatically remove the matching elements on a grid of elements after a selected element is chosen from the predetermined set of elements. The game player may view the game proceedings using television, wireless or other telephone with display, handheld device, kiosk or computer; the game player may also decide not to watch. The computer system may then automatically determine when a player is a winner; such a result is automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance, the computer system may then notify the game player that he or she has won and what the winnings are after the computer has consulted the predetermined payout table described above; the computer may also determine if the winning needs to be shared with other players. The notification of winning to a game player may occur by mail, e-mail, computer web or network, telephone, television, pager, fax, kiosk or any other possible method.","When the computer system is automatically removing the matching elements on a grid of elements, the computer system may also determine the grid of elements and the associated player identity(ies) that is closest to winning after each selected element. The computer system may then display the grid of elements or the identity of the game player(s) closest to winning to all game players observing the game. The computer system may also choose to display only one or a subset of all the grids of elements or identities of players closest to winning to a particular game player observing the game.","When a winner is authenticated and verified, the computer system may then notify all game players observing the session that a win has occurred. Additionally, the computer system may display the winning player's identity or the payout. Since the game session may not end until a predetermined maximum number of selected elements are drawn, it is possible for this notification to occur several times, each time for a different player, during a game.","During the period of time between the games, a game operator may make announcements, rest, or any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system, then advertisements, sponsorships, public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted. The advertisements, etc. may also be inserted into the game display during a game.","When the computer automatically removes the matching elements on the grid of elements for the players, a game player may access information about the results of a game remotely after the game is completed. Remote access may be gained by kiosk, telephone, television, computer, handheld device or any other device or system that is appropriate. Information that may be accessed about a past game may include whether the player won or lost or what the player's payout was.","Preferably, the game and the game play are partially or fully automated using one or more computer systems. More preferably, the game and the game play are fully automated. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer, minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system may also be any multiple and combination of computer types that work together; multiple computer systems may also be needed to run the whole game. The computer system also may include input or output devices, displays, or storage units.","A computer system to run the described game may have three component systems, as shown in . One system  may handle payment, subscription and\/or AMOE by players to enter the game. Another system  may handle playing and viewing the game and the third system  may handle payouts. The game system may also be connected by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs, reservations, in-room television viewing or gambling floor kiosks. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.","The payment system may be one or many of a number of well-known systems. For example, a player may be able to pay using a telephone and talking with a call center representative that inputs player, payment and subscription information into a computer data structure using a user interface. As used herein, a \u201cdata structure\u201d is an arrangement of data defined by computer-readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system, stored on a medium associated with a computer system (e.g., in a memory, on a disk, etc.) and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as, for example, a network.

A game may have a number of predetermined items including game date and time, game length, predetermined payout table, payout type, grid of element shape, size, and grouping, predetermined winning outcome, predetermined set of elements and the predetermined maximum number of elements to be selected as well as who the players are and the exact grid of elements assigned to each.","From the predetermined maximum number elements to be selected and the set of elements, a game has the selected elements drawn by hand or by the computer system and may keep the specific draw order of the selected elements for later reference. The game also may have an associated winner(s); it is possible a game may have no winners.","The game playing and viewing system would also have a game engine. The game engine may perform functions according to process  as shown in . Using  as a guide, a game may proceed as such for a player with a grid of elements. At step , the player pays or subscribes to play a game. At , the computer selects and displays a grid of elements for the player. Next at , the computer draws the first selected element and at  shows the selected element to the player. The player then selects a matching element on the grid of elements to remove, if necessary (). If the player obtains the predetermined winning outcome at , then the player is a winner; if not, then the player continues to select matching elements until either he or she wins or time has expired to select matching elements at . When time has expired for the player to select and remove matching elements, the computer determines if the maximum number of selected elements has been attained. If yes, then the player is not a winner; if no, then new elements are added to the grid of elements at , if appropriate. The computer would then return to  and choose the next selected element.","If the player is a winner at , then the computer may proceed to notify the player that he or she is a winner as well as possibly determine the payout and notify the player also of such. The computer may also display the winning player information to all the game players. Winning player information that may be displayed includes name, city, state and country. If multiple winners occur simultaneously, all winners may be displayed at one time or sequentially. It may also be possible that winners may be selectively displayed to game players. For instance if numerous winners occur at one time, a player in Bismarck, N.Dak. may be shown only the winning player information that occurred closest to him or her, say in Pierre, S.Dak. versus some other location (e.g., Boston, Mass.).","After a player is found not to be a winner, the computer may also determine whether the player is the closest to winning if there have been no winners. Any of a number of criteria may be used for determining the player closest to winning. For example, a computer may determine that a player is the closest to winning based upon having the least number of elements left in a group or grid or the least number of colors left in a group or grid. A grid determined to be closest to winning may then be displayed to all game players.","The game play process  may include additional acts. Further, the order of the acts performed as part of process  is not limited to the order illustrated in  as the acts may be performed in other orders, and one or more of the acts of process  may be performed in series or in parallel to one or more other acts, or parts thereof.
