Enabling Mobile Devices to Interact with Networked Applications","The invention includes technology for using applications on mobile devices that interact with the Internet or with intranets. The invention enables applications available via a network or via an Internet\/intranet to download and to run on mobile devices. Consequently, the invention includes software and methods for administering a server that manages the variables relevant to a mobile device\/server environment.","The invention enables:","Mobile devices to operate in conjunction with a Web server, even when the mobile devices are not coupled directly to the PC using portable on-device servers: Web pages are loaded, viewed, cached, and deleted even when the device is not coupled to any network.","Mobile devices to operate in conjunction with the Web, Internet, or intranet via a connection mechanism and then in disconnected mode or with the Web, Internet, or intranet in wireless mode with a continuous or a discontinuous connection mechanism.","A technique for interactive connectivity between handheld computers and computer networks.","Fleet management for centrally administering information in a handheld network environment that includes, but is not limited to, user data, user groups, group channels, channel data, personal channels, commercial channels, user accounts, corporate account, software groupings, personal information management, form delivery, form management, device configuration, device databases, device contents, and devices parameters.","Obtaining updated Web pages and other network objects, for use when the mobile device is not communicating with the PC.","An example mobile device\/server environment is shown in .","1.2. Rapid Transfer of Web Pages to Mobile Devices","To improve efficiency of data exchange between mobile devices and networked content, the invention includes an improved communication protocol that collects requests and responses for network objects into a smaller number of protocol (such as HTTP) requests and responses. The server also determines the nature and the resources of the mobile device. This protocol is represented, for example, in .","Downstream, the data is encoded in a data format called content stream (tokenized version of the data) and sent to the device. The content stream format creates a tokenized codification of HTML pages that is sent to the device. (The device receives the content stream and presents the material on the device.)","The HTML page is encoded into the content stream and sent to the device. The encoding is a mapping of parent and child HTML elements and\/or resources to alphanumeric values.","The sync operation of the invention includes various synchronization processes that can collect information from the Internet to a server, and to the client. In embodiments, the usage of the term \u201csync\u201d refers to the overall operation of connecting a client to a server for the exchange, interaction, creation, and removal of data.","In one embodiment, syncing can be defined as mirroring data on a client and a server, such that the data is the same on client and server. In other embodiments, syncing can be defined as overwriting data on a client or on a server, such that the data on either a client replaces the data on a server, and vice versa.","In one embodiment, a sync operation involves a user placing a mobile device into an adapter that includes a sync button. The adapter is connected to a server. Upon pressing the sync button, the user initiates the sync operations of the invention, which include various synchronization processes (specific delivery modes). Thus, the term sync is meant to refer to the overall operation of linking a client to a server. Synchronization is meant to refer to the specific process of copying, adding, filtering, removing, updating and merging the information between a client and a server. Any number of synchronization processes can be executed during a sync.","Before being sent downstream the data is compared to the data that is known to be on the client and then the client is updated all at once in a one-up\/one-down synchronization method, which is represented in . In an embodiment, the one-up\/one-down synchronization process is disclosed in more detail in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042. The server sets the client to preemptively prepare all device information necessary during the sync. Then the server receives the set of information in a one-up fashion. The server collates the information and sends the information in a one-down fashion. This optimizes the sync's efficiency and speed. The sync process, according to embodiments of the invention, is represented in , and further described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","1.3. Optimizing Content of Web Pages for Mobile Devices","When Web content and other network objects pass through the server they are processed to minimize their size and to optimize their delivery to mobile devices: for presentation, for ease of use, for efficiency, for size, etc.","The invention uses server logic to optimize content. The server assesses the mobile device to optimize web content for the particular device. Factors that the server logic considers when performing this optimization include, but are not limited to (it is noted that the server may consider subsets of the following, depending on the application and implementation):","Dynamic memory specifications","High memory specifications","Protected Memory","Storage Memory","Database Memory","Available storage space","Screen size","User profile(s)","Color depth","Applications on device","Buttons on-device","Data markers (e.g., cookies, tokens)","Preferences","Fonts","Font specifications","Sync type","Synchronization types","Supported data types","Supported mime types","Connection\/Network profile","An example optimization process is shown in .","On the server, the graphic is optimized per the state information of the device. If the device sends down the need for the graphic on a page for a device with a display that is 27 cm wide and in grayscale, the server sends its best version of a graphic optimized for that environment.

The data processing environment  includes a server  (although only one server  is shown, in practice the data processing environment  may include a plurality of servers), one or more devices , one or more adapters , and one or more providers .","Generally, the server  maintains a collection of channels. In an embodiment, a channel comprises a collection of objects. An object is any entity that can be transferred to a client , such as but not limited to content, applications, services, images, movies, music, links, etc.","A channel includes a number of properties. At least some of these properties define the objects that the channel includes. Such properties include, but are not limited to, the following (properties of channels may vary depending on the application and\/or implementation):","A name of the channel.","A location of a root object (such as but not limited to a URL). In an embodiment, this root object is included in the channel. An indication of the number of levels below the root object, for which to include objects in the channel. For example, in an embodiment, if this property is equal to \u201c1 level,\u201d then all objects that are 1 level down from the root object (reached by traversing links in the root object), are included in the channel. If this property is equal to \u201c2 levels,\u201d then all objects that are 1 level down from the root object (reached by traversing links in the root object), and all objects that are 1 level down from those objects (reached by traversing links in those objects), are included in the channel. Embodiments of the invention allow \u201cuneven\u201d trees, where some branches of the tree extent to a greater number of levels than other branches of the tree. In other embodiments, the trees are even or balanced.","A maximum size of the channel. For example, if this is set to 500 Kbytes, then the aggregate size of the objects in the channel cannot be greater than 500 Kbytes. If the aggregate size of the objects in the channel is greater than this value, then embodiments of the invention may delete objects from the channel and\/or delete portions of objects in the channel.","An indication of which resource objects are enabled for the channel:","An indication of whether or not images are to be included in or excluded from objects in the channel; and","An indication of whether or not scripts are enabled in objects in the channel.","A refresh methodology. It is noted that the properties associated with channels may vary from implementation to implementation. Also, implementations may employ combinations of the above properties, and\/or properties in addition to the following, as will be appreciated by persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","The invention includes processes for managing channels, including but not limited to adding channels to the collection of channels maintained by the server .","The server  offers channels to clients . A user associated with or on behalf of a client  may access the server  and view the collection of channels. The client  (via the user, for example) may then select any combination of the channels in the collection. The server  maintains a list of the channels associated with each of the clients .","During a synchronization process, the server  loads a device  with the channels associated with the client . Generally, the server  does this by obtaining from providers  the objects defined by the channels, and causing those objects to be stored on the client . Thus, during the synchronization process, the server  will load the client  with the selected channels. More particularly, the server  will load the client  with the objects associated with the channels.","The client  may process and use those objects when not connected to the server . The invention enables the client  to actively interact with the objects and channels.","In one embodiment, the client A directly interacts with the server  via some transmission medium B, which may be any wired or wireless medium using any communication protocol.","In another embodiment, the client B indirectly interacts with the server  via an adapter . For example, the client B may be a mobile device (such as a Palm device) and the adapter  may be a cradle and a computer coupled to the cradle (the mobile device is inserted into the cradle). In this instance, the adapter  presents itself to the server  as a client B (via client communications module C). When the server  sends objects to the adapter , the adapter interface module  writes those objects to client B. In embodiments, adapter interface module  can be a Hot Sync\u2122 Manager, an Active Sync\u2122, etc. It is noted that the invention is not limited to any of the implementation examples discussed herein.","The components shown in  shall now be described in greater detail.","The server  includes an administration module , a database module , a user interface , a web synchronization module , a server extension module , a fleet management module , a notification module , and a server communication module . Other embodiments of server  may include a subset of these modules, and\/or may include additional modules.","The administration module  controls and manages the states of the server  and the clients . For example, the administration module  manages and controls groups of clients , permissions assigned to clients , groups, and channels. For example, the administration module  administers the users\/clients  assigned to groups, and the channels associated with users. These and additional functions performed by the administration module  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","The database module  controls access to databases associated with the server . The database module  maintains information relevant to the clients , as well as information relevant to the modules contained in the server . The database module  manages information on the collection of channels maintained by server . These and additional functions performed by the database module  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on April 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","The user interface  is, in an embodiment, a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users and clients  to access functions and modules offered by the server . More generally, the user interface  within server  provides access to server  and the modules and resources contained therein.","The invention supports various server web sites that are available through any communication medium, such as but not limited to the Internet, intranets, direct dial up links, etc. The UI  enables such web sites.","These and additional functions performed by the user interface  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","The web synchronization module  is an application\/instance of server extension module , and controls synchronization of web content to client . The invention may include other synchronization modules (which are application\/instances of server extension module ) that control synchronization of other types of objects to clients . For example, the server  may administer a calendar that may be installed on clients . The synchronization of appointments, events and\/or dates on this calendar between clients  and the server  may be performed by a calendar synchronization module. These and additional functions performed by the server extension module  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","The fleet management module  performs functions associated with fleets of clients , which are groups of clients . For example, fleet management module  may perform global or mass operations on groups (fleets) of clients , such as loading or updating an application on groups (fleets) of clients . Another example of a mass operation is retrieval of information on clients  in a fleet, such as the free memory in clients  in a fleet (this would help an organization determine if its clients  need a memory upgrade). These and additional functions performed by the fleet management module  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","The server extension interface\/module  enables modules, such as third party modules, to operate in or work with the server  (and modules contained in the server ). The server extension module  presents an API (application programming interface). Modules in the server  may operate with other devices in the server  by conforming to the server API.","For example, the web synchronization module  and the fleet management module  (as well as other types of synchronization modules, not shown in ) may interact with databases on the server  via the database module  by going through the server extension module . The web synchronization module  and the fleet management module  may not be able to interact directly with the database module  for a number of reasons. For example, they may support different data formats, or simply \u201cspeak different languages.\u201d However, they can interact via the server extension module  as well as other server modules as long as they conform to the API of the server extension module . This is true of any modules in the server , or that interact with the server .","Server communication module  enables communication between the server  and entities external to the server , such as clients , adapters , providers , work stations, etc. The server  communicates with these entities via communication mediums , which may be any type of wireless or wired communication using any protocol. It is noted that multiple server communication modules  may execute in a single server . For example, in one embodiment, server communication module  is a TCP\/IP stack. In another embodiment, server communication module  is a secure socket layer stack or a compression stack. The invention is not limited to any implementation examples discussed herein. These and additional functions performed by the server communication module  are described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000.","The notification module  sends objects to clients  beyond objects related to channels associated with clients . Such objects could be requested by client  in advance. For example, a client  could ask for a notification when an event happens, such as when a stock reaches a target price. When the event occurs, the notification module  would cause an appropriate notification(s)\/object(s) to be sent to the client . Alternatively, the notification module  may send objects to clients  without any prior explicit request from the client . For example, the notification module  might send channels to clients  when such channels are identified to be similar to those already selected by the clients . Also, the notification module  might send appropriate notifications\/objects to the clients  when such clients  receive email or faxes at the server . In embodiments, the notification module  transmits such objects to the client  immediately when the event occurs, during the next synchronization with the client , or at some other future synchronization.","An alternative representation of server  is shown in .  illustrates, for example, that messages from entities outside of server  are received by server extension interface\/module  via server communications modules . Generally, such messages represent requests for the server  to perform various functions. The server extension module  conceptually operates as a dispatcher who routes such messages to other modules contained in the server , such as web synchronization module  (who handles requests to synchronize with web content), notification module , fleet management module  (who handles fleet related requests), and\/or third party modules  (such as other synchronization modules). Thus, the invention supports modules  generated by third parties to perform various functions. Such modules  \u201cplug-in\u201d to the server  via the server extension module .","Referring again to , the devices  may be any type of data processing device. In embodiments of the invention, the devices  are mobile computing devices, although the invention is not limited to these embodiments. In such example embodiments, the devices  may include, but are not limited to, handheld computers, cellular phones, internet-enabled phones, pagers, radios, tvs, audio devices, car audio systems, recorders, text-to-speech devices, bar-code scanners, net appliances, mini-browsers, personal data assistants (PDAs), etc.","In embodiments of the invention, the devices  include software, hardware, and\/or combinations thereof related to client functionality (such client functionality is described herein). When a device  includes such software, hardware, and\/or combinations thereof, the device  is referred to herein as a client . Accordingly, it can be said that the data processing environment  includes one or more clients .","Clients  each may include a layout and rendering module , a forms module , a control module , a user interface , a client extension interface , a client interface module , a client communications module , a JavaScript\u2122 engine , and a database module . Other embodiments of clients  may include a subset of these modules, and\/or may include additional modules.","Layout and rendering module  controls the processing of data objects on client , such as the layout and rendering of data objects on client . For example, the layout portion of module  obtains information from databases of the client  (via the database manager ) and determines where such information should be rendered on the display of the client . Such information may include anything that can be rendered, such as but not limited to images, text, links, etc. The rendering portion of module  is responsible for drawing items on the display (drawing bits to the screen).

Placement of Channels on a Mobile Device","The present invention provides numerous ways in which channels may be placed on mobile devices. For example, the invention allows a user to create custom channels by manually entering information regarding a user favorite web site or selecting an automatic channel option that enables the creation of a customized channel while surfing web pages. A user may also click a quick channel button supplied by the content provider  on the content provider's web page or choose a bookmark on a web browser to enable the placement of channels on their mobile device. These methods are further described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking On Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,042.","Other methods by which channels may be placed on mobile devices include default placement, featured placement, and interactive placement. These methods are shown in flow diagrams contained herein and are described in detail below.","2.1 Default Placement of Channels on a Mobile Device","When a user registers with server  for the first time, there are no channels loaded on the user's mobile device . The present invention automatically loads some channels on the user's device  when the user registers with server . To enhance the user's initial experience with server , the present invention loads channels that correspond to the user's interest on the user's device. In an embodiment, multiple channels per a user's interest may be placed on the user's device. For example, if the user is a sports lover, multiple sports channels may be placed on the user's mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0141"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","104","104","106","104"]},"Referring now to , the process for default placement of channels begins with step , where the process immediately proceeds to step .","In step , the user registers device  with server . The registration process is further described in co-pending application entitled \u201cSystem, Method, and Computer Program Product for Enabling On-Device Servers, Offline Forms, and Dynamic Ad Tracking on Mobile Devices,\u201d Ser. No. 09\/559,964, filed on Apr. 28, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,779,942. The process proceeds to step .","In step , during the registration process a list of categories of interest are presented to the user. The categories of interest include, but are not limited to, sports, entertainment, lifestyle, travel, business, news, weather, etc. In one embodiment, the categories of interest are presented to the user using a checklist format. The process proceeds to step .","In step , the user selects the categories that are of interest to the user. In one embodiment, the user may select the categories of interest by placing a checkmark beside the category of interest. In another embodiment, the user may click on a category to select it. One skilled in the relative art(s) would know that other ways for selecting categories of interest may be implemented without departing from the scope of the invention. The process then proceeds to step .","In step , the categories of interest to the user are transmitted to server  via connection . The process then proceeds to step .","In step , server  identifies channels for default placement on the user's device . In an embodiment, server  selects channels for default placement from a subset of channels that have been paid for by content providers. Server  balances the selection of channels by attempting to match channels with the user's selected categories of interest, thereby enhancing the user's initial experience with the system. However, all of the channels chosen by server  for default placement may not come from the subset of channels that have been paid for by content providers. When necessary, server  may select other channels that coincide with the user's interest. The process then proceeds to step .","In step , during a subsequent sync, the channels selected for default placement in step  are loaded on the user's device .","2.2 Featured Placement of Channels on Mobile Devices","Server  provides other methods for selecting channels to be viewed on a user's device . A large number of channels are available to the user. For example, server  currently offers over  channels that may be placed on a user's device . With so many channels being offered by server , server  must employ creative mechanisms for enabling content provider channels to be selected by users for loading on their devices . Many of the mechanisms employed by the present invention are via editorialized content. For example, in one embodiment, the invention employs a \u201ccool channels\u201d mechanism wherein server  places channels on a \u201ccool channels\u201d list that are determined to be of a particular interest to users. Users may select channels from the \u201ccool channels\u201d list to be loaded on their devices . Other channels may be selected using statistical methods. For example, in one embodiment, server  keeps track of the number of users that subscribe to each channel offered by server , how often a user uses a channel, and how long a user allows a channel to remain on their device . Therefore, the server may select one or more channels from the channels that are heavily subscribed (according to such statistics) by users of the system. A user may also select one or more channels from channels that are heavily used by users of the system.","In one embodiment of the present invention, content providers may pay to have their channels placed on the home web page of server . With so many channels being offered by server , server  provides a mechanism for highlighting the channels in which content providers  pay server  a fee to have placed on the web page of server . These channels are referred to as featured channels.  is a flow diagram illustrating a method of operation for featured channel placement according to an embodiment of the present invention. The process begins with step , where control immediately proceeds to step .","In step , certain content providers pay server  a compensation fee to be featured on the web page of server  (such as the home page). Such content providers  may be listed using the featured channels mechanism. The compensation fee may be based, for example, on assumptions regarding the number of subscribers and impressions by such subscribers. The process proceeds to step .","In step , all channels are made available to the user via categories on the web site of server . Certain channels are highlighted as noted above. Such channels are highlighted via the \u201ccool channels\u201d mechanism, a \u201ctop 10 channels\u201d mechanism, and the \u201cfeatured channels\u201d mechanism. When a user visits the web site of server , the user may select one or more channels using any of these mechanisms. The selected channels are loaded on the user's device  during the next or a subsequent sync operation.  is a diagram illustrating an example screen shot of the featured channel and cool channel mechanisms, described above, of server .","2.3 Interactive Placement of Channels and Applications on Mobile Devices","The present invention also provides an interactive placement method for providing a user with quick access to channel information as well as other types of information. When a user accesses the client  software on their device , typically a homepage is displayed. In this embodiment, instead of a homepage, a splash page is immediately displayed when the user accesses the client  software. The splash page may list certain channels and provide information regarding those channels. For example, the splash page may list new channels, or other channels that correspond to content providers that have paid server  compensation for listing their channels in a highlighted manner, as described above. The user may then select one or more of the channels listed on the splash page. The selected channels are then loaded on the user's device  during the next or a subsequent sync operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0156"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["502","504"]},"In step , the user initiates the client program on device . The process then proceeds to step .","In step , a splash page is displayed on device . Information for the splash page was previously loaded on device  during a previous sync operation. As previously stated, the splash page lists various channels along with information about the listed channels. In one embodiment, the channels listed may be specific to the user. For example, the channels listed may be based on the user's profile relating to user interests. The process proceeds to step .","In step , the user may select one or more of the channels listed on the splash page to be loaded on device . The process proceeds to step .","In step , the channels selected by the user in step  will be loaded on device  during the next or a subsequent sync operation. Also, information regarding channels that are either listed on the splash page or to be listed on the splash page during the next iteration of the interactive operation are transmitted to client  of device  during the sync operation. In one embodiment, information to be placed on the splash page is transmitted periodically or during every sync operation.","As previously stated, other information, in addition to channels, may be displayed on the splash page. For example, the present invention may include transferring operations to device , in addition to channels. In this instance, the splash page, when displayed in step , may also list applications that a user may wish to download to device . If the user selects such an application from the list, then various forms, including multi-page forms, may be displayed by device  to obtain information regarding the user, such as the user's credit card information. An agreement regarding usage of the application may also be displayed to the user, requiring the user to accept the agreement. Alternatively, the information regarding the user may be stored on server . When the user selects an application from the list in step , the application will be downloaded to device  during the next or a subsequent sync operation. If necessary, financial information is transmitted to provider  of the application in order for provider  to be compensated for the application.","The interactive placement method, described above with reference to , operates in a wireless mode and a disconnected mode. In a wireless mode of operation, client  communicates with server  in real time via link , where link  is a wireless link. This mode of operation enables the splash page to be populated with information that is being transmitted from server  to client  in real time. Client  may also communicate with server  in real time via link , where link  is a wired connection. Alternatively, in a disconnected mode of operation, client  is operating offline. The information displayed on the splash page reflects information that was provided to client  during a previous sync operation.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the provider  and the server share the revenues generated from the applications that are downloaded to device . For example, if the user selects an application to be loaded on device  in which the provider of that application requires a fee, then a portion of the fee may be directed to server . The present invention is also applicable to other business methods that the user may perform via device  with providers  that interact with server . In such cases, revenue from such business methods may be shared between server  and content provider . It is noted that the invention facilitates such business methods being performed by client , since the information transmitted to client  enables the user to navigate through and review at the user's leisure.","2.4 Tracking Channel Information","Server  tracks information regarding the channels provided by content providers . Content providers  are allowed to view and manipulate the information tracked by server . In one embodiment, content providers  pay a fee to view and manipulate the information tracked by server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0166"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["128","602","604"]},"In step , content provider  accesses a web site provided by server  using a password protected mechanism. The process then proceeds to step .","In step , information relating to content provider  is displayed. Such information may be provided to the content provider via canned reports which content provider  may select or via user defined reports where content provider  may specify the information that it wishes to see. Information available to content provider  may include, but is not limited to, subscriber information and usage information. Subscriber information may include the number of users that are currently subscribed to the channel; the number of users that subscribed via default placement or featured placement, or via access from the subscriber's own web site; the number of users who actually use the channel, and information regarding the usage of the channel, including trend information, zip codes and other information relating to the subscribers, such as home addresses; the type of devices  used by the subscribers; etc. Usage information may include how many people actively use the channel. This information may be provided over any time period. Such information may be valuable to content providers  when viewing this information over a given time period that corresponds with some event specific to the content provider . The information may also be characterized according to the geographic location of users, including both international and domestic; devices  that the users employ, such as a Palm device or a Windows CE device; whether sever  is being accessed via phone; etc. In one embodiment, both server  and client  track information regarding channel subscribers and subscriber activities.","3.
