title: Processing method for control apparatus involves controlling job subsequent to proceeding job based on execution result acquired by executing the proceeding job
abstract: A control apparatus controls execution of a job subsequent to a preceding job based on the results of executing the preceding job when executing a plurality of jobs cooperated as job cooperation. The control apparatus holds an execution result obtained by executing the preceding job; acquires the held execution result; and controls the job subsequent to the preceding job based on the acquired execution result.

With pipeline processing, job execution result details outputted from a preceding job are connected to the input of a subsequent job.","Also, it has been proposed to apply the idea of pipeline processing to jobs executed by multiple computers on a network (e.g., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-102449).","However, the conventional job management method which connects the output of the preceding job to the input of the subsequent job using pipeline processing has the following problems. Specifically, the conventional job management method cannot be applied to the determination of a job to be executed next based on an execution result, such as failure or success, of the preceding job. Also, the execution result details of a preceding job whose execution has already been finished cannot be applied to a subsequent job.","The present invention provides a method and apparatus which can apply the execution result details of a job which has already been executed to a subsequent job.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a processing method for a control apparatus which controls execution of a job subsequent to a preceding job based on results of executing the preceding job when executing a plurality of jobs cooperated as job cooperation, the method comprising: holding an execution result obtained by executing the preceding job; acquiring the execution result held by the holding step; and controlling the job subsequent to the preceding job based on the execution result acquired by the acquiring step.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments (with reference to the attached drawings).","Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. First, cooperative device job management will be described as an embodiment of cloud computing which allows computer processing by a computer on a network to be used as a service via the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","102","103","101","102","103","104"]},"A REST interface  receives a REST Web service call and calls functions corresponding to the job A processing unit  or job B processing unit . REST is a technique for specifying a resource using a URI without using SOAP and for acquiring or setting information using HTTP or HTTPS. An HTTP server  receives an HTTP or HTTPS request and, as required, calls the REST interface .","SOAP has high expandability, but is accordingly complex to develop and requires time to verify and guarantee operation. On the other hand, REST gives a unique URI to each resource using four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This makes it necessary to use as many different URIs as there are resources, but REST is easier to develop and check for operation than SOAP. Also, whereas typical HTTP communications need to keep a connection established while waiting for a response from a process, the use of REST eliminates this need.","That is, REST allows a state of asynchronous processing to be treated as a resource, which can then be created. Thus, a response to a process request can be produced at any time (asynchronously) without synchronizing the timing of the response with the process request. That is, asynchronous processing can be performed relatively easily by describing a resource using REST. The present invention features asynchronous processing using REST for cooperative device job management and cloud computing workflow.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["201","202","203","204","209","201","204","209","203","211","203","202"]},"The external storage device  includes a hard disk (HD), flexible disk (FD), and the like.

Also, the system bus  is connected with a video controller (VC)  and disk controller (DKC) , where the video controller  controls display on a display device  such as a CRT or liquid crystal panel and the disk controller  controls access to the external storage device .

An execution result acquisition unit  is a module which interprets a REST Web service for acquisition of job execution result details and acquires the job execution result details.","The job scheduler  periodically monitors schedule information stored in the database  and starts a registered job which falls due to be executed. The registered job is started either by a Web server via HTTP or by the job starting unit  via the REST interface . In so doing, a registered-job ID is stored in a URI parameter or the text of an HTTP request. An example of a URI for job startup using a REST Web service is shown below.","https:\/\/192.168.0.12\/NDM\/ExecuteJob\/10 where \u201c192.168.0.12\u201d is the IP address of the host  on which the network device management software runs, \u201c10\u201d is the registered-job ID of the job to be started, \u201cNDM\u201d is a basic path of the network device management software, and \u201cExecuteJob\u201d is a path of the REST Web service used to give an instruction to execute the job.","However, with this alone, a third party can easily create an HTTP request for job startup. Thus, a mechanism has been introduced to guarantee that a given request has been issued by the network device management software and that the content has not been falsified. Furthermore, a URI parameter is added as required.","A job start request is passed from the HTTP server  to the REST interface . Upon determining that the request is a job start request, the REST interface  transfers processing to the job starting unit . Consequently, the job starting unit  initiates a job starting process according to the request. Also, the job starting unit  returns an executed-job ID of the registered job after the execution to the caller and the REST interface  returns value of the executed-job ID as an HTTP response to the sender of the HTTP request.","Next, UML (unified modeling language) classes of a part related to a job will be described with reference to .

The common items include a registered-job ID which uniquely identifies a registered job, a job name given to the job by the user, schedule information which specifies execution date\/time of the job, job class information (see ) about a process class which actually processes the job.","The process class is generated dynamically when a job class creation method of the registered-job information class  is called. The schedule information can be specified in the form of date\/time such as 8:30 AM on Oct. 13, 2009 or periodic execution such as 10:20 PM every Friday. On the other hand, jobs executed indirectly by the job cooperation processing unit  do not have schedule information in some cases. The registered-job information class  further includes a method for executing the job represented by the registered-job ID.","A registered-job detail information class  holds detailed information about a registered job contained, for example, in the job A processing unit  and actually executes the job. The registered-job detail information class  is prepared individually by a provider of each job. For example, different registered-job detail information classes are implemented for job A and job B. The registered-job detail information class  holds, for example, a registered-job ID and detailed information about the job associated with the registered-job ID. The detailed information about a job contains, for example, a list of identifiers which uniquely identify network devices handled by the job and a list of settings made to each of the network devices. The information is stored in the database . Furthermore, a job execution method is called to execute the job according to the detailed information. In this example, settings are delivered to the respective network devices in the list.","An executed-job information class , which implements processing of executed jobs, holds information concerning already executed jobs and common to different pieces of network device management software.
