Waveguides can rely on total internal reflection to provide high transmission characteristics. Reducing impurities in the waveguide transmission material can increase the transmission percentage. Maintaining the cross-sectional configuration of the waveguide is critical to limit transmission losses, so discontinuities in peripheral walls of waveguides are limited.","Transitioning between waveguides with different configurations and\/or materials provides a potential source for energy loss and signal degradation. A variety of waveguide couplers limit losses of the energy of the waves traversing between waveguides.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to waveguide to coplanar waveguide (CPW) transition assemblies. In some embodiments, a waveguide\/coplanar waveguide (CPW) transition assembly is adapted to transition RF signals from a waveguide to a coplanar waveguide (CPW), the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly having at least some peripheral walls (waveguide walls) and including a central waveguide transition septum having the CPW disposed therein. The waveguide\/coplanar waveguide (CPW) transition assembly may include an electronic component coupled to the CPW. Control circuitry may be operationally coupled with the electronic component. Portions of the control circuitry at least partially extend from outside of the at least some peripheral walls to within the at least some peripheral walls.","In some embodiments, an apparatus may include an RF waveguide configured to transmit RF waves; a waveguide\/coplanar waveguide (CPW) transition assembly having at least some peripheral walls and configured to transition the RF waves from the RF waveguide to a coplanar waveguide (CPW), the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly comprising a central waveguide transition septum that includes the CPW, wherein the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly is adapted to receive or transmit at least some of the RF waves from the RF waveguide to the CPW; an electronic component positioned within the peripheral walls and positioned relative to the CPW to define an electric field applied to the CPW; and control circuitry operationally coupled with the electronic component, wherein portions of the control circuitry at least partially extend from outside of the at least some peripheral walls to within the peripheral walls.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures. The figures are not drawn to scale and may be simplified for clarity. It is contemplated that elements and features of one embodiment may be beneficially incorporated in other embodiments without further recitation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","102","104","106","100","104","106","106"]},"One RF waveguide  may be operationally coupled with the CPW  to form the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly . The waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  may be considered a continuum of the RF waveguide . There should be little energy loss in the electromagnetic transmission being conveyed along the center conductor  of the CPW , also along the RF-waveguide . Certain embodiments of the RF waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  can integrate the at least one electronic component  into the RF waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  such as can be utilized for waveguide-based transmitters or waveguide-based receivers within communication systems, radar systems, or other suitable devices. As such, certain embodiments of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  can act as receivers, transmitters, and\/or even en route devices such as repeaters, multiplexers, routers, filters, modulators, etc.","Certain embodiments of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  provide a transition between the RF waveguide  and the CPW , and, optionally, from the RF waveguide  to the CPW  and back again to another RF waveguide.

Various embodiments of RF waveguides  may be shaped in a rectangular, circular, or other cross sectional shape. The RF waveguides  include one or more openings  formed through at least one of their peripheral walls  (two are shown). The openings  allow communications, data, control, information, voltage biases, or other signals to enter or exit the CPW . The openings  can be used as access to control the microelectronic components to be integrated on the CPW plane.","Certain embodiments of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  include a central waveguide transition septum  as shown in . Along the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  are some position indicators to (only , , and are shown by reference characters), in parallel alignment showing a plurality of tapered slot septa that may be provided in substantially parallel alignment with the central waveguide transition septum . Other configurations are described in greater detail below.","The electronic components  can utilize microstrip, microstrip integrated circuits (MIC), monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC), CPW, etc. or other such technologies. Embodiments provide a low-loss transition between the electronic components  and the RF waveguide , facilitate use of easily manufactured electronic components , with the RF waveguide  providing a very low loss transmission medium.","A number of electronic components can be integrated on the CPW .

This provides a CPW  having a decreasing width of a slot formed between the tapered ground planes ,  to produce a match across the frequency band, such that the slot of the waveguide would have an optimum frequency. Two openings  formed in the top and bottom peripheral walls  of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  provide a mechanism for electrically biasing and controlling the components of the central waveguide transition septum .","The electronic components  provide electric signals to various portions of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly , including the tapered ground planes  and\/or .  shows one embodiment of surface current distribution provided largely within the tapered ground planes  and  regions of the substrate CPW structure  as referenced in , such as would be provided by the electronic components  or by the waveguide .

Within this disclosure, the insertion loss is considered the loss in load power due to the insertion of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  at some point in a transmission system; expressed as the ratio of the power received at the load before insertion of the waveguide to the power received at the load after insertion of the waveguide. By comparison, return loss may be considered as the difference between forward and reflected power for the waveguide.","The simulation modeling of the waveguide\/CPW transition assembly  is derived with multiple tapered slot septa  including the openings  show better results particularly in within the bandwidth of 72-75 GHz.
