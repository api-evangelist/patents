title: System and method for controlling a camera based on processing an image captured by other camera
abstract: A device comprises a first digital camera having a first center line of sight and a second digital camera having a second center line of sight that is parallel and opposing the first camera. A method for controlling the first camera based on estimating the angular deviation between a person gaze direction and the line of sight of the first digital camera. A human face is detected in an image captured as an image file by the second digital camera, using a face detection algorithm. An angular deviation α is estimated, defined between the second center line of sight and an imaginary line from the second camera to the detected human face based on the captured image, and an angular deviation β is estimated, defined between the imaginary line from the second camera to the detected face and the human face gaze direction based on the captured image.

The display  may be connected via a video adapter for supporting the display. The display  allows a user to view, enter, and\/or edit information that is relevant to the operation of the system . An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for controlling cursor movement on the display . This cursor control  typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","The computer system  may be used for implementing the methods and techniques described herein. According to one embodiment, these methods and techniques are performed by the computer system  in response to the processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in the main memory . Such instructions may be read into the main memory from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the main memory causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the arrangement. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201cprocessor\u201d is used herein to include, but not limited to, any integrated circuit or any other electronic device (or collection of electronic devices) capable of performing an operation on at least one instruction, including, without limitation, a microprocessor (\u03bcP), a microcontroller (\u03bcC), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), or any combination thereof. A processor, such as the processor , may further be a Reduced Instruction Set Core (RISC) processor, a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) microprocessor, a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), or a CISC-based Central Processing Unit (CPU). The hardware of the processor  may be integrated onto a single substrate (e.g., silicon \u201cdie\u201d), or distributed among two or more substrates. Furthermore, various functional aspects of a processor  may be implemented solely as a software (or a firmware) associated with the processor .","The terms \u201cmemory\u201d and \u201cstorage\u201d are used interchangeably herein and refer to any physical component that can retain or store information (that can be later retrieved) such as digital data on a temporary or permanent basis, typically for use in a computer or other digital electronic device. A memory can store computer programs or any other sequence of computer readable instructions, or data, such as files, text, numbers, audio and video, as well as any other form of information represented as a string or structure of bits or bytes. The physical means of storing information may be electrostatic, ferroelectric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, chemical, electronic, electrical, or mechanical. A memory may be in a form of an Integrated Circuit (IC, a.k.a. chip or microchip). Alternatively or in addition, a memory may be in the form of a packaged functional assembly of electronic components (module). Such module may be based on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) such as PC Card according to Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) PCMCIA 2.0 standard, or a Single In-line Memory Module (SIMM) or a Dual In-line Memory Module (DIMM), standardized under the JEDEC JESD-21C standard. Further, a memory may be in the form of a separately rigidly enclosed box such as an external Hard-Disk Drive (HDD). Capacity of a memory is commonly featured in bytes (B), where the prefix \u2018K\u2019 is used to denote kilo=2=1024=1024, the prefix \u2018M\u2019 is used to denote mega=2=1024=1,048,576, the prefix \u2018G\u2019 is used to denote Giga=2=1024=1,073,741,824, and the prefix \u2018T\u2019 is used to denote tera=2=1024=1,099,511,627,776.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal. An infrared detector can receive the data carried in the infrared signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on the bus . The bus  carries the data to the main memory , from which the processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by the main memory may optionally be stored on the storage device either before or after execution by the processor .","The computer system  commonly includes a communication interface  coupled to the bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) . For example, the communication interface  may be an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another non-limiting example, the communication interface  may be a Local Area Network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. For example, Ethernet based connection based on IEEE802.3 standard may be used, such as 10\/100BaseT, 1000BaseT (gigabit Ethernet), 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GE or 10 GbE or 10 GigE per IEEE Std. 802.3ae-2002as standard), 40 Gigabit Ethernet (40 GbE), or 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100 GbE as per Ethernet standard IEEE P802.3ba). These technologies are described in Cisco Systems, Inc. Publication number 1-587005-001-3 (June 1999), \u201c\u201d, Chapter 7: \u201cEthernet Technologies\u201d, pages 7-1 to 7-38, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. In such a case, the communication interface  typically includes a LAN transceiver or a modem, such as Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) LAN91C111 10\/100 Ethernet transceiver, described in the Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) data-sheet \u201c91111 10\/100 -\u201d Data-Sheet, Rev. 15 (Feb. 20, 2004), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","An Internet Service Provider (ISP)  is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet . The Internet Service Provider  may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned. Internet services, typically provided by ISPs, include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting, and colocation. Various ISP Structures are described in Chapter 2\u201d of the book entitled: \u201c\u201d, by Robert D. Doverspike, K. K. Ramakrishnan, and Chris Chase, published 2010 (ISBN: 978-1-84882-827-8), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","An arrangement  of a computer system connected to the Internet  is shown in . A computer system or a workstation  is shown, including a main unit box , which encloses a motherboard on which the processor  and the memories , , and are typically mounted. The workstation  includes a keyboard  (corresponding to the input device ), a printer , a computer mouse (corresponding to the cursor control ), and a display  (corresponding to the display ).  illustrates various devices connected via the Internet , such as client device # , client device # , data server # , data server # , and the workstation , connected to the Internet  via the router or gateway  and the ISP .","Operating system. An Operating System (OS) is software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is an essential component of any system software in a computer system, and most application programs usually require an operating system to function. For hardware functions such as input\/output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make a system call to an OS function or be interrupted by it. Common features typically supported by operating systems include process management, interrupts handling, memory management, file system, device drivers, networking (such as TCP\/IP and UDP), and Input\/Output (I\/O) handling. Examples of popular modern operating systems include Android, BSD, iOS, Linux, OS X, QNX, Microsoft Windows, Windows Phone, and IBM z\/OS.","A camera  shown in  may be a digital still camera which converts captured image into an electric signal upon a specific control, or can be a video camera, wherein the conversion between captured images to the electronic signal is continuous (e.g., 24 frames per second). The camera  is preferably a digital camera, wherein the video or still images are converted using an electronic image sensor . The digital camera  includes a lens  (or few lenses) for focusing the received light onto the small semiconductor image sensor . The image sensor  commonly includes a panel with a matrix of tiny light-sensitive diodes (photocells), converting the image light to electric charges and then to electric signals, thus creating a video picture or a still image by recording the light intensity. Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) are commonly used as the light-sensitive diodes. Linear or area arrays of light-sensitive elements may be used, and the light sensitive sensors may support monochrome (black & white), color or both. For example, the CCD sensor KAI-2093 Image Sensor 1920 (H)\u00d71080 (V) Interline CCD Image Sensor or KAF-50100 Image Sensor 8176 (H)\u00d76132 (V) Full-Frame CCD Image Sensor can be used, available from Image Sensor Solutions, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, N.Y.","An image processor block  receives the analog signal from the image sensor . The Analog Front End (AFE) in the block  filters, amplifies, and digitizes the signal, using an analog-to-digital (A\/D) converter. The AFE further provides Correlated Double Sampling (CDS), and provides a gain control to accommodate varying illumination conditions. In the case of a CCD-based sensor , a CCD AFE (Analog Front End) component may be used between the digital image processor  and the sensor . Such an AFE may be based on VSP2560 \u2018CCD Analog Front End for Digital Cameras\u2019 from Texas Instruments Incorporated of Dallas, Tex., U.S.A. The block  further contains a digital image processor, which receives the digital data from the AFE, and processes this digital representation of the image to handle various industry-standards, and to execute various computations and algorithms. Preferably, additional image enhancements may be performed by the block  such as generating greater pixel density or adjusting color balance, contrast, and luminance. Further, the block  may perform other data management functions and processing on the raw digital image data. Commonly, the timing relationship of the vertical\/horizontal reference signals and the pixel clock are also handled in this block. Digital Media System-on-Chip device TMS320DM357 from Texas Instruments Incorporated of Dallas, Tex., U.S.A. is an example of a device implementing in a single chip (and associated circuitry) part or all of the image processor , part or all of a video compressor  and part or all of a transceiver . In addition to a lens or lens system, color filters may be placed between the imaging optics and the photosensor array  to achieve desired color manipulation.","The processing block  converts the raw data received from the photosensor array  (which can be any internal camera format, including before or after Bayer translation) into a color-corrected image in a standard image file format. The camera  further comprises a connector , and a transmitter or a transceiver  is disposed between the connector and the image processor . The transceiver  also includes isolation magnetic components (e.g. transformer-based), balancing, surge protection, and other suitable components required for providing a proper and standard interface via the connector . In the case of connecting to a wired medium, the connector  further contains protection circuitry for accommodating transients, over-voltage and lightning, and any other protection means for reducing or eliminating the damage from an unwanted signal over the wired medium. A band pass filter may also be used for passing only the required communication signals, and rejecting or stopping other signals in the described path. A transformer may be used for isolating and reducing common-mode interferences. Further a wiring driver and wiring receivers may be used in order to transmit and receive the appropriate level of signal to and from the wired medium. An equalizer may also be used in order to compensate for any frequency dependent characteristics of the wired medium.","Other image processing functions performed by the image processor  may include adjusting color balance, gamma and luminance, filtering pattern noise, filtering noise using Wiener filter, changing zoom factors, recropping, applying enhancement filters, applying smoothing filters, applying subject-dependent filters, and applying coordinate transformations. Other enhancements in the image data may include applying mathematical algorithms to generate greater pixel density or adjusting color balance, contrast and\/or luminance.","The image processing may further include an algorithm for motion detection by comparing the current image with a reference image and counting the number of different pixels, where the image sensor  or the digital camera  are assumed to be in a fixed location and thus assumed to capture the same image. Since images are naturally differ due to factors such as varying lighting, camera flicker, and CCD dark currents, pre-processing is useful to reduce the number of false positive alarms. Algorithms that are more complex are necessary to detect motion when the camera itself is moving, or when the motion of a specific object must be detected in a field containing other movement that can be ignored.","The image processing may further include video enhancement such as video denoising, image stabilization, unsharp masking, and super-resolution. Further, the image processing may include a Video Content Analysis (VCA), where the video content is analyzed to detect and determine temporal events based on multiple images, and is commonly used for entertainment, healthcare, retail, automotive, transport, home automation, safety and security. The VCA functionalities include Video Motion Detection (VIVID), video tracking, and egomotion estimation, as well as identification, behavior analysis, and other forms of situation awareness. A dynamic masking functionality involves blocking a part of the video signal based on the signal itself, for example because of privacy concerns. The egomotion estimation functionality involves the determining of the location of a camera or estimating the camera motion relative to a rigid scene, by analyzing its output signal. Motion detection is used to determine the presence of a relevant motion in the observed scene, while an object detection is used to determine the presence of a type of object or entity, for example a person or car, as well as fire and smoke detection. Similarly, face recognition and Automatic Number Plate Recognition may be used to recognize, and therefore possibly identify persons or cars. Tamper detection is used to determine whether the camera or the output signal is tampered with, and video tracking is used to determine the location of persons or objects in the video signal, possibly with regard to an external reference grid. A pattern is defined as any form in an image having discernible characteristics that provide a distinctive identity when contrasted with other forms. Pattern recognition may also be used, for ascertaining differences, as well as similarities, between patterns under observation and partitioning the patterns into appropriate categories based on these perceived differences and similarities; and may include any procedure for correctly identifying a discrete pattern, such as an alphanumeric character, as a member of a predefined pattern category. Further, the video or image processing may use, or be based on, the algorithms and techniques disclosed in the book entitled: \u201c& \u201d, edited by Al Bovik, by Academic Press, ISBN: 0-12-119790-5, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","A controller , located within the camera device or module , may be based on a discrete logic or an integrated device, such as a processor, microprocessor or microcomputer, and may include a general-purpose device or may be a special purpose processing device, such as an ASIC, PAL, PLA, PLD, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Gate Array, or other customized or programmable device. In the case of a programmable device as well as in other implementations, a memory is required. The controller  commonly includes a memory that may include a static RAM (random Access Memory), dynamic RAM, flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), or any other data storage medium. The memory may include data, programs, and\/or instructions and any other software or firmware executable by the processor. Control logic can be implemented in hardware or in software, such as a firmware stored in the memory. The controller  controls and monitors the device operation, such as initialization, configuration, interface, and commands. The term \u201cprocessor\u201d is meant to include any integrated circuit or other electronic device (or collection of devices) capable of performing an operation on at least one instruction including, without limitation, reduced instruction set core (RISC) processors, CISC microprocessors, microcontroller units (MCUs), CISC-based central processing units (CPUs), and digital signal processors (DSPs). The hardware of such devices may be integrated onto a single substrate (e.g., silicon \u201cdie\u201d), or distributed among two or more substrates. Furthermore, various functional aspects of the processor may be implemented solely as software or firmware associated with the processor.","The digital camera device or module  requires power for its described functions such as for capturing, storing, manipulating, and transmitting the image. A dedicated power source may be used such as a battery or a dedicated connection to an external power source via connector . The power supply  contains a DC\/DC converter. In another embodiment, the power supply  is power fed from the AC power supply via AC plug as the connector and a cord, and thus may include an AC\/DC converter, for converting the AC power (commonly 115 VAC\/60 Hz or 220 VAC\/50 Hz) into the required DC voltage or voltages. Such power supplies are known in the art and typically involves converting 120 or 240 volt AC supplied by a power utility company to a well-regulated lower voltage DC for electronic devices. In one embodiment, the power supply  is integrated into a single device or circuit, in order to share common circuits. Further, the power supply  may include a boost converter, such as a buck boost converter, charge pump, inverter and regulators as known in the art, as required for conversion of one form of electrical power to another desired form and voltage. While the power supply  (either separated or integrated) can be an integral part and housed within the camera  enclosure, it may be enclosed as a separate housing connected via cable to the camera  assembly. For example, a small outlet plug-in step-down transformer shape can be used (also known as wall-wart, \u201cpower brick\u201d, \u201cplug pack\u201d, \u201cplug-in adapter\u201d, \u201cadapter block\u201d, \u201cdomestic mains adapter\u201d, \u201cpower adapter\u201d, or AC adapter). Further, the power supply  may be a linear or switching type.","Various formats that can be used to represent the captured image are TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), RAW format, AVI, DV, MOV, WMV, MP4, DCF (Design Rule for Camera Format), ITU-T H.261, ITU-T H.263, ITU-T H.264, ITU-T CCIR 601, ASF, Exif (Exchangeable Image File Format), and DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) standards. In many cases, video data is compressed before transmission, in order to allow its transmission over a reduced bandwidth transmission system. A video compressor  (or video encoder) is shown in  disposed between the image processor  and the transceiver , allowing for compression of the digital video signal before its transmission over a cable or over-the-air. In some cases, compression may not be required, hence obviating the need for such compressor . Such compression can be lossy or lossless types. Common compression algorithms are JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group). The above and other image or video compression techniques can make use of intraframe compression commonly based on registering the differences between part of single frame or a single image. Interframe compression can further be used for video streams, based on registering differences between frames. Other examples of image processing include run length encoding and delta modulation. Further, the image can be dynamically dithered to allow the displayed image to appear to have higher resolution and quality.","The single lens or a lens array  is positioned to collect optical energy representative of a subject or a scenery, and to focus the optical energy onto the photosensor array . Commonly, the photosensor array  is a matrix of photosensitive pixels, which generates an electric signal that is a representative of the optical energy directed at the pixel by the imaging optics.","While the digital camera  has been exampled above with regard to capturing a single image using the single lens  and the single sensor , it is apparent that multiple images can be equally considered, using multiple image capturing mechanisms. An example of two capturing mechanisms is shown for a digital camera  shown in . Lenses and are respectively associated with sensors and , which in turn respectively connects to image processors and . In the case where a compression function is used, video compressors and , respectively, compress the data received from the processors and . In one embodiment, two transceivers (each of the same as transceiver , for example) and two ports (each of the same type as port , for example) are used. Further, two communication mediums (each similar or the same as described above) can be employed, each carrying the image corresponding to the respective lens. Further, the same medium can be used using Frequency Division\/Domain Multiplexing (FDM). In such an environment, each signal is carried in a dedicated frequency band, distinct from the other signals concurrently carried over the same medium. The signals are combined onto the medium and separated from the medium using various filtering schemes, employed in a multiplexer . In another embodiment, the multiple images are carried using Time Domain\/Division Multiplexing (TDM). The digital data stream from the video compressors and is multiplexed into a single stream by the multiplexer , serving as a time multiplexer. The combined signal is then fed to the single transceiver  for transmitting onto the medium. Using two or more image-capturing components can further be used to provide stereoscopic video, allowing 3-D or any other stereoscopic view of the content, or other methods of improving the displayed image quality of functionality.","A prior art example of a portable electronic camera connectable to a computer is disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Common face-detection algorithms focused on the detection of frontal human faces, and other algorithms attempt to solve the more general and difficult problem of multi-view face detection. That is, the detection of faces that are either rotated along the axis from the face to the observer (in-plane rotation), or rotated along the vertical or left-right axis (out-of-plane rotation), or both.

A digital image is a numeric representation (normally binary) of a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of a vector or raster type. Raster images have a finite set of digital values, called picture elements or pixels. The digital image contains a fixed number of rows and columns of pixels, which are the smallest individual element in an image, holding quantized values that represent the brightness of a given color at any specific point. Typically, the pixels are stored in computer memory as a raster image or raster map, a two-dimensional array of small integers, where these values are commonly transmitted or stored in a compressed form. The raster images can be created by a variety of input devices and techniques, such as digital cameras, scanners, coordinate-measuring machines, seismographic profiling, airborne radar, and more. Common image formats include GIF, JPEG, and PNG.","The Graphics Interchange Format (better known by its acronym GIF) is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. The GIF (GRAPHICS INTERCHANGE FORMAT) Standard Version 89a is available from www.w3.org\/Graphics\/GIF\/spec-gif89a.txt.","JPEG (seen most often with the .jpg or peg filename extension) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality and typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality. JPEG\/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices, along with JPEG\/JFIF. The term \u201cJPEG\u201d is an acronym for the Joint Photographic Experts Group, which created the standard. JPEG\/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65535\u00d765535 pixels\u2014one to four gigapixels (1000 megapixels), depending on the aspect ratio (from panoramic 3:1 to square). JPEG is standardized under as ISO\/IEC 10918-1:1994 entitled: \u201c-","Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression that was created as an improved replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the commonly used lossless image compression format on the Internet. PNG supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with or without alpha channel), and full-color non-palette-based RGB images (with or without alpha channel). PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet, not for professional-quality print graphics, and, therefore, does not support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK. PNG was published as an ISO\/IEC15948:2004 standard entitled: \u201c(): ","Metadata. The term \u201cmetadata\u201d, as used herein, refers to data that describes characteristics, attributes, or parameters of other data, in particular, files (such as program files) and objects. Such data is typically structured information that describes, explains, locates, and otherwise makes it easier to retrieve and use an information resource. Metadata typically includes structural metadata, relating to the design and specification of data structures or \u201cdata about the containers of data\u201d; and descriptive metadata about individual instances of application data or the data content. Metadata may include the means of creation of the data, the purpose of the data, time and date of creation, the creator or author of the data, the location on a computer network where the data were created, and the standards used.","For example, metadata associated with a computer word processing file might include the title of the document, the name of the author, the company to whom the document belongs, the dates that the document was created and last modified, keywords which describe the document, and other descriptive data. While some of this information may also be included in the document itself (e.g., title, author, and data), metadata may be a separate collection of data that may be stored separately from, but associated with, the actual document. One common format for documenting metadata is eXtensible Markup Language (XML). XML provides a formal syntax, which supports the creation of arbitrary descriptions, sometimes called \u201ctags.\u201d An example of a metadata entry might be <title>War and Peace<\/title>, where the bracketed words delineate the beginning and end of the group of characters that constitute the title of the document that is described by the metadata. In the example of the word processing file, the metadata (sometimes referred to as \u201cdocument properties\u201d) is entered manually by the author, the editor, or the document manager. The metadata concept is further described in a National Information Standards Organization (NISO) Booklet entitled: \u201c\u201d (ISBN: 1-880124-62-9), in the IETF RFC 5013 entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in the IETF RFC 2731 entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. An extraction of metadata from files or objects is described in a U.S. Pat. No. 8,700,626 to Bedingfield, entitled: \u201cSystems, Methods and Computer Products for Content-Derived Metadata\u201d, and in a U.S. Patent Application Publication 2012\/0278705 to Yang et al., entitled: \u201cSystem and Method for Automatically Extracting Metadata from Unstructured Electronic Documents\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Metadata can be stored either internally in the same file, object, or structure as the data (this is also called internal or embedded metadata), or externally in a separate file or field separated from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata detached from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Metadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as XML can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools, however, these formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, and processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special libraries to convert the binary information into a human-readable content.","Tag. A tag is a type of metadata relating to non-hierarchical keyword or term assigned to a digital image, describing the image and allows it to be found again by browsing or searching. Tags may be chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its viewer, depending on the system.","Color space. A color space is a specific organization of colors, allowing for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g., three tuples\/channels in RGB or four in CMYK). When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see. Colors are commonly created in printing with color spaces based on the CMYK color model, using the subtractive primary colors of pigment (Cyan (C), Magenta (M), Yellow (Y), and Black (K)). To create a three-dimensional representation of a given color space, we can assign the amount of magenta color to the representation's X axis, the amount of cyan to its Y axis, and the amount of yellow to its Z axis. The resulting 3-D space provides a unique position for every possible color that can be created by combining those three pigments. Colors are typically created on computer monitors with color spaces based on the RGB color model, using the additive primary colors (red, green, and blue). A three-dimensional representation would assign each of the three colors to the X, Y, and Z axes. Popular color models include RGB, CMYK, HSL, YUV, YCbCr, and YPbPr color formats.","Color spaces and the various color space models are described in an article by Marko Tkalcic and Jurij F. Tasic of the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in the article entitled: \u201c\u201d by Andrew Oran and Vince Roth, published May 2012, Issue 4 of the journal \u2018The Tech Review\u2019 by the Association of Moving Image Archivists, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Conversions between color spaces or models are described in an article entitled: \u201c\u201d by Adrian Ford and Alan Roberts (Aug. 11, 1998), and in an article by Philippe Colantoni and Al dated 2004, entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","A color space maps a range of physically produced colors (from mixed light, pigments, etc.) to an objective description of color sensations registered in the eye, typically in terms of tristimulus values, but not usually in the LMS space defined by the cone spectral sensitivities. The tristimulus values associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic additive color model. In some color spaces, including LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are not real colors, in the sense that they cannot be generated with any light spectrum.","CIE color space. The CIE 1931 standards were created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931 and include the CIE 1931 RGB, the CIE 1931 XYZ, the CIELUV, and the CIEUVW color models. When judging the relative luminance (brightness) of different colors in well-lit situations, humans tend to perceive light within the green parts of the spectrum as brighter than red or blue light of equal power. The luminosity function that describes the perceived brightnesses of different wavelengths is thus roughly analogous to the spectral sensitivity of M cones. The CIE model capitalizes on this fact by defining Y as luminance. Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, or the S cone response, and X is a mix (a linear combination) of cone response curves chosen to be nonnegative. The XYZ tristimulus values are thus analogous to, but different to, the LMS cone responses of the human eye. Defining Y as luminance has the useful result that for any given Y value, the XZ plane contains all possible chromaticities at that luminance. CIE color space is described in a paper by Gernot Hoffmann entitled: \u201c\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","RGB color space. RGB is an abbreviation for Red-Green-Blue. An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model. A particular RGB color space is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce any chromaticity by the triangle defined by those primary colors. The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve. RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) describes what kind of light needs to be emitted to produce a given color. Light is added together to create form from darkness. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. RGB is a color model, and there are many different RGB color spaces derived from this color model, such as RGBA that is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency. RGB color spaces are described in an article published by The BabelColor Company by Danny Pascale (Revised 2003 Oct. 6) entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in an article by Sabine Susstrunk, Robert Buckley, and Steve Swen from the Laboratory of audio-visual Communication (EPFL) entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The RGB color space includes the RGB, sRGB, Adobe RGB, Adobe Wide Gamut RGB, ProPhoto RGB color space, Apple RGB, ISO RGB, ROMM RGB, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) Recommendation ITU-R BT.709, and ITU-R BT.202.","Luma plus chroma\/chrominance (YUV). Some color spaces are based on separating the component (Y) that represents the luma information, from the components (U+V, or I+Q) that represent the chrominance information. YUV is a color space typically used as part of a color image pipeline, where it encodes a color image or video taking human perception into account, allowing reduced bandwidth for chrominance components, thereby typically enabling transmission errors or compression artifacts to be more efficiently masked by the human perception than using a \u201cdirect\u201d RGB-representation. Other color spaces have similar properties, and the main reason to implement or investigate properties of Y\u2032UV would be for interfacing with analog or digital television or photographic equipment that conforms to certain Y\u2032UV standards.","The Y\u2032UV model defines a color space in terms of one luma (Y\u2032) and two chrominance (UV) components. The Y\u2032UV color model is used in the PAL and SECAM composite color video standards. Previous black-and-white systems used only luma (Y\u2032) information. Color information (U and V) was added separately via a sub-carrier so that a black-and-white receiver would still be able to receive and display a color picture transmission in the receiver's native black-and-white format. Y\u2032 stands for the luma component (the brightness) and U and V are the chrominance (color) components; luminance is denoted by Y and luma by Y\u2032\u2014the prime symbols (\u2032) denote gamma compression, with \u201cluminance\u201d meaning perceptual (color science) brightness, while \u201cluma\u201d is electronic (voltage of display) brightness. The YPbPr color model used in analog component video and its digital version YCbCr used in digital video are more or less derived from it, and are sometimes called Y\u2032UV. (CB\/PB and CR\/PR are deviations from grey on blue-yellow and red-cyan axes, whereas U and V are blue-luminance and red-luminance differences.) The Y\u2032IQ color space used in the analog NTSC television broadcasting system is related to it, although in a more complex way. YCbCr, Y\u2032CbCr, or Y Pb\/Cb Pr\/Cr, also written as YCBCR or Y\u2032CBCR, is a family of color spaces used as a part of the color image pipeline in video and digital photography systems. Y\u2032 is the luma component and CB and CR are the blue-difference and red-difference chroma components. Y\u2032 (with prime) is distinguished from Y, which is luminance, meaning that light intensity is nonlinearly encoded based on gamma corrected RGB primaries. Color models based on the YUV color space include YUV (used in PAL), YDbDr (used in SECAM), YIQ (used in NTSC), YCbCr (described in ITU-R BT.601, BT.709, and BT.2020), YPbPr, xvYCC, and YCgCo. The YUV family is further described in an article published in the International Journal of Engineering Research and Applications (IJERA) ISSN: 2248-9622 Vol. 2, Issue 2, March-April 2012, pp. 152-156 by Gnanathej a Rakesh and Sreenivasulu Reddy of the University College of Engineering, Tirupati, entitled: \u201c\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Hue and saturation. HSL (Hue-Saturation-Lightness) and HSV (Hue-Aaturation-Value) are the two most common cylindrical-coordinate representations of points in an RGB color model, and are commonly used today in color pickers, in image editing software, and in image analysis and computer vision. The two representations rearrange the geometry of RGB in an attempt to be more intuitive and perceptually relevant than the Cartesian (cube) representation, by mapping the values into a cylinder loosely inspired by a traditional color wheel. The angle around the central vertical axis corresponds to \u201chue\u201d and the distance from the axis corresponds to \u201csaturation\u201d. These first two values give the two schemes the \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 in their names. The height corresponds to a third value, the system's representation of the perceived luminance in relation to the saturation.","Perceived luminance is a notoriously difficult aspect of color to represent in a digital format (see disadvantages section), and this has given rise to two systems attempting to solve this issue: HSL (L for lightness) and HSV or HSB (V for value or B for brightness). A third model, HSI (I for intensity), common in computer vision applications, attempts to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the other two systems. While typically consistent, these definitions are not standardized. HSV and HSL color models are described in an article by Darrin Cardanu entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in an article by Douglas A. Kerr (Issue 3, May 12, 2008) entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Optical flow. Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer (an eye or a camera) and the scene. Motion estimation and video compression schemes have developed as a major aspect of the optical flow research, and typically use gradient-based optical flow estimation. Motion estimation is the process of determining motion vectors that describe the transformation from one 2D image to another, usually from adjacent frames in a video sequence. The motion vectors may be represented by a translational model or by many other models that can approximate the motion of a real video camera, such as rotation and translation in all three dimensions and zoom. Optical flow techniques are described in an article by David J. Fleet and Yair Weiss entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in an article by J. L. Baron, D. J. Fleet, and S. S. Beauchemin entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Digital photography is described in an article by Robert Berdan (downloaded from www.canadianphotographer.com) entitled: Digital Photography Basics for Beginners\u201c, and in a guide published on April 2004 by Que Publishing (ISBN\u20140-7897-3120-7) entitled: Absolute Beginner's Guide to Digital Photography\u201d authored by Joseph Ciaglia et al., which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Aperture. Camera aperture is the unit of measurement that defines the size of the opening in the lens (typically measured in f-stop), that can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or digital sensor, and determines the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come to a focus in the image plane. The aperture determines how collimated the admitted rays are, and if an aperture is narrow, then highly collimated rays are admitted, resulting in a sharp focus at the image plane, while if an aperture is wide, then uncollimated rays are admitted, resulting in a sharp focus only for rays with a certain focal length. Commonly, camera aperture refers to the diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. Most digital cameras provide automatic aperture control, which allows viewing and metering at the lens's maximum aperture, stops the lens down to the working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture after exposure.","The aperture stop of a photographic lens can usually be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size regulates the image sensor degree of exposure to light. Typically, a fast shutter requires a larger aperture to ensure sufficient light exposure, and a slow shutter requires a smaller aperture to avoid excessive exposure. The lens aperture is usually specified as an f-number, the ratio of focal length to effective aperture diameter. A lens typically has a set of marked \u201cf-stops\u201d that the f-number can be set to. A lower f-number denotes a greater aperture opening which allows more light to reach the film or image sensor. The photography term \u201cone f-stop\u201d refers to a factor of \u221a2 (approx. 1.41) change in f-number, which in turn corresponds to a factor of 2 change in light intensity. Typical ranges of apertures used in photography are about f\/2.8-f\/22 or f\/2-f\/16 covering 6 stops, which may be divided into wide, middle, and narrow of 2 stops each, roughly (using round numbers) f\/2-f\/4, f\/4-f\/8, and f\/8-f\/16 or (for a slower lens) f\/2.8-f\/5.6, f\/5.6-f\/11, and f\/11-f\/22.","Exposure Index (ISO). An Exposure Index (EI) rating (a.k.a. ISO setting) refers to a relationship between exposure and sensor data values, that can be achieved by setting the signal gain of the sensor, and is specified by a digital camera manufacturer such that the image files produced by the camera has a lightness similar to what would be obtained with film of the same EI rating at the same exposure. Commonly few EI choices are provided by adjusting the signal gain of an image sensor in the digital realm.","Focal length. An optical focus, also called an image point, is the point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge, and although the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial extent, called the blur circle. An image, or image point or region, is in focus if the light from object points is converged almost as much as possible in the image, and out of focus if the light is not well converged. For a lens, or a spherical or parabolic mirror, it is a point onto which collimated light parallel to the axis is focused. Since light can pass through a lens in either direction, a lens has two focal points\u2014one on each side. The distance in air from the lens or mirror's principal plane to the focus is referred to as the focal length. A photographic lens for which the focus is not adjustable is called a fixed-focus lens or sometimes focus-free, and the focus is set at the time of manufacture, and remains fixed. It is usually set to the hyperfocal distance, so that the depth of field ranges all the way down from half that distance to infinity, which is acceptable for most cameras used for capturing images of humans or objects larger than a meter.","For an interchangeable lens camera, the Flange Focal Distance (FFD) (also known as the flange-to-film distance, flange focal depth, Flange Back Distance (FBD), Flange Focal Length (FFL), or register, depending on the usage and source) of a lens mount system is the distance from the mounting flange (the metal ring on the camera and the rear of the lens) to the film or sensor plane. This value is different for different camera systems, and the range of this distance which renders an image clearly in focus within all focal lengths is usually measured in hundredths of millimeters and is known as the depth of focus (not to be confused with the similarly named depth of field).","Autofocus (AF) systems rely on one or more sensors to determine correct focus. Some AF systems rely on a single sensor while others use an array of sensors. Most modern SLR cameras use through-the-lens optical AF sensors, with a separate sensor array providing light metering, although the latter can be programmed to prioritize its metering to the same area as one or more of the AF sensors. Through-the-lens optical autofocusing is often speedier and more precise than can be achieved manually with an ordinary viewfinder, although more precise manual focus can be achieved with special accessories such as focusing magnifiers. Autofocus accuracy within \u2153 of the depth of field (DOF) at the widest aperture of the lens is not uncommon in professional AF SLR cameras. Most multi-sensor AF cameras allow manual selection of the active sensor, and many offer an automatic selection of the sensor using algorithms that attempt to discern the location of the subject.","Exposure time. Shutter speed (or exposure time) is the length of time interval a digital camera shutter is open when taking a photograph, so that the amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time. The camera's shutter speed, the lens's brightness (f-number), and the scene's luminance together determine the amount of light that reaches the film or sensor (the exposure), and Exposure Value (EV) is a quantity that accounts for the shutter speed and the f-number. In addition to its effect on exposure, the shutter speed changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short shutter speeds can be used to freeze fast-moving subjects, for example at sporting events while very long shutter speeds are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for artistic effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called \u201cfast\u201d, and long exposure times \u201cslow\u201d. Adjustment to the aperture controls the depth of field, the distance range over which objects are acceptably sharp; such adjustments need to be compensated by changes in the shutter speed. Shutter speed is one of several methods used to control the amount of light recorded by the camera's digital sensor or film, and may also be used to manipulate the visual effects of the final image beyond its luminosity.","A method and an apparatus for rating a captured image based on accessing a database of reference images that have an associated rating value, and selecting reference images to form a metadata-based subset of reference images, are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012\/0213445 to LUU et al., entitled: \u201cMethod, Apparatus, and System for Rating Images\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

One of the cameras, commonly referred to as the \u2018rear\u2019 camera is directed towards the object targeted to be captured, while the other camera, commonly referred to as the \u2018front\u2019 camera, typically mounted on the device screen side, is directed to capture the person holding the device, for example for video conferencing. A perspective view  of a person  holding such a dual-camera device  is shown in  and a top view of the scene is shown in . The person  is looking at the plant A , that is located in the person  Field of View (FOV) having a vertical angle and a horizontal angle  (which may be the same, similar, or different angles), centered at the person  gaze direction shown by a line of sight . Similarly, the field of view of the rear camera in the device  is shown having a vertical angle and a horizontal angle , both centered on the rear camera line of sight . A plant B  is shown in the room adjacent to the plant A , but is not looked at by both the person  and the device  rear camera. Since both the rear camera and the person  are looking at the same object, namely the plant A , there is a substantial overlap in their respective field of views, and the image captured by the rear camera corresponds to the image looked at by the person .","An arrangement where the fields of view are not overlapping is shown in a perspective view of the person  holding the dual-camera device  as shown in and a top view of this scene is shown in . The person  is looking at the plant B , that is located in the person  Field of View (FOV) having a vertical angle and a horizontal angle  (which may be the same, similar, or different angles), centered at the person  gaze direction shown by a line of sight . The field of view of the rear camera in the device  is shown having a vertical angle and a horizontal angle , both centered on the rear camera line of sight , directed towards plant A . The rear camera and the person  are not looking at the same object, as the rear camera is capturing the image of the plant A , and the person  is looking at the plant B . Hence there is not an overlapping in their respective field of views, and the image captured by the rear camera is different from the image looked at by the person .","Traditionally, the person  may look at the screen of the device  in order to verify the actual image that is captured by the rear camera, and accordingly operate the rear camera, such as by capturing the image by pressing or touching a shutter button. However, in some cases, the device  does not include a screen visible to the person , hence the scene to be captured is not apparent to the person . Further, it is more intuitive and easier to use if the person  is only required to look directly at the object of interest (such as the plant B ) rather than at an image on a screen. In such a case, the rear camera may be used in order to estimate and evaluate whether there is partial or full overlapping between the rear camera field of view and the person  field of view, such as shown in views  and , or whether there is non- or poor overlapping, such as shown in views and . The person  may be accordingly notified regarding the degree of the estimated overlapping, and may accordingly take an action such as better positioning the rear camera to improve the capturing of the object of interest, or may decide to take a frame in the case where substantial or full overlapping is estimated.","A geometrical scheme of the top view is shown as a top view in . As described above, a dashed line  represent the horizontal line-of-sight (typically the center of the field of view) of the rear camera that is part of the handheld device . In most cases, the rear camera line of sight, denoted as a dashed line , is parallel, and oppositely directed, to the rear camera line of sight , and may be considered as an extension of the line . An imaginary line, denoted as dashed line is parallel to the rear camera line of sight , but originates at the person  eyes, serving as the imaginary origin of the person  gaze direction or line of sight . A dashed line is connecting the front camera line-of-sight origin to the person  gaze origin. An angle \u03b1 is formed between the front camera line of sight and the line connecting the front camera to the person . Since the dashed lines , , and are parallel to each other, an angle \u03b1 is formed between the line and the dashed line representing a person  line of sight that is parallel to the rear camera line of sight , which is identical to the angle \u03b1 . In general, the angle \u03b1 is the angular deviation of the detected face of the person  from the line of sight of the front camera.","An angle \u03b2 is defined between the line and the actual person  gaze direction . Such an angle \u03b2 typically represents, or is dependent upon, the head pose as detected by the front camera of the device . An angle \u03c6 is defined as the angle between the person  line of sight (gaze direction)  and the imaginary line , that is parallel to the rear camera line of sight . As shown in the figure, the angle \u03c6 may be calculated as \u03c6=\u03b2\u2212\u03b1. Thus by estimating or obtaining angle \u03b1 and the angle \u03b2 , the angle \u03c6 may be calculated or estimated. The angle \u03c6 represents the deviation of the person  line of sight  from the rear camera line of sight  (or line ), and hence may be used to indicate or estimate the overlapping level of the field of view  of the rear camera and the person  field of view . For example, in the case \u03c6=0, it is an indication that the fields of view are substantially or totally overlapping. Assuming the field of view  of the rear camera has a horizontal angular opening of a total of \u03c6 degrees, (\u00b1\u03c6\/2 degrees), in the case where \u03c6\u2267\u03c6\/2, it is expected that the field of views are substantially or totally non-overlapping. In one example, the range may be defined where sufficient overlapping is obtained, such as where \u03c6\u2266\u03c6\/2, \u03c6\u2266\u03c6\/3, or \u03c6\u2266\u03c6\/4. In the general case, the angle \u03c6 may be used as a measurement, such as proportional estimation, of the degree of overlapping fields of respective views.","A flow chart  for estimation of the angle \u03c6 or the degree of the overlapping of the fields of view is shown in . An image of the person  holding the device  is captured by the front camera of the device  as part of a \u201cReceive Image\u201d step , and the image is processed by a face detection algorithm in order to detect and preferably locate the position of the face of the person  as part of a \u201cFace detection\u201d step .","In an \u201cEstimate User Angular Position\u201d step , the angle \u03b1 is estimated or calculated. In one example, a pre-set value is used. For example, a low value of the angle \u03b1 , such as \u03b1\u226625\u00b0 or \u03b1=0\u00b0 is not reasonable, since the device  probably interferes or blocks the person  line of sight . In another example, a low value of the angle \u03b1 may be used only in one plane, such as vertically or horizontally. For example, a low value may be obtained in the horizontal plane when the user  holds the device  in front of his chest or above his head, yet resulting a non-low value in the vertical plane. Similarly, a high value of the angle \u03b1 , such as \u03b1\u226775\u00b0 or \u03b1=90\u00b0 is not reasonable, being uncomfortable to the user , and making the usage of the device  non-intuitive and hard to hold and use. Hence, an example of reasonable values for the angle \u03b1 may be 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, or 60\u00b0.","Alternatively or in addition, the user angular position is estimated or calculated based on analyzing or processing the captured image received in the \u201cReceive Image\u201d step . A pictorial view of a captured image  is shown in . In one example, a single human face  is detected in the \u201cFace Detection\u201d step , and the horizontal location of the face center is determined and shown as a dashed line  in . The dashed vertical line  is calculated to be at the detected face  center, or preferably between the eyes of the detected face.","Next, the distance deviation  between the image center represented by the imaginary dashed line  horizontally centered in the image, and the detected face  center location line  is calculated (shown as the deviation line  in ). This distance deviation  (DEV) represents the deviation of the person location (particularly its face location) from the optimal viewing point represented by the image center line . The total horizontal distance (HD)  represents the horizontal end-to-end distance of the image. Both the total horizontal distance  and the deviation distance  may be measured by a number of pixels, actual distance on a printed or shown image, or any other method for estimating distances in an image. Assuming that the front camera has a horizontal angular opening of a total of \u03b3 degrees, (\u00b1\u03b3\/2 degrees), the total horizontal distance (HD)  is proportional to the front camera field of view (\u03b3) at the object distance, such as a head distance.","The head distance may be estimated based on knowing that the person is holding the device at a known estimated distance such as 30-40 cm, or alternatively may be calculated or estimated by using the head size in the captured image by a known camera with known \u03b3, compared to an average human head size. Thus by using a known (or average) head size (or any other object of a known size), the proportion between the horizontal distance  and front camera field of view (\u03b3) may be calculated.","Similarly, the deviation distance (DEV)  is proportional to the angle \u03b1 . As such, the angle \u03b1 may be calculated as \u03b1=\u03b3*(DEV\/HD). Clearly, in the case where the detected face  is horizontally centered in the image , meaning that DEV=zero, then \u03b1=zero, suggesting that the detected face is located at the line of sight of the front camera. Assuming a common field of view of 120\u00b0, and a deviation that is centered between the center line  and the edge of the image (DEV=HD\/4), then the resulting angle \u03b1 is calculated as: \u03b1 120\u00b0\/4=30\u00b0.","In an \u201cEstimate User Gaze Detection\u201d step , the angle \u03b2 is estimated. Any algorithm for an estimation of a person gaze direction may be used. In one example, the user gaze direction may be estimated based on eye location detection, eye tracking, or any other gaze direction based on eye detection. Alternatively or in addition, the person gaze direction estimation may be based on, according to, or use, a head pose estimation or detection algorithm. Preferably, the user gaze direction may be based on a combination of both head pose and eye location detection, as described for example in a paper published in IEEE Transaction on Image Processing, Vol. 21, No. 2, February 2012 by Roberto Valenti entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in an article by Roberto Valenti, Adel Lablack, Nicu Sebe, Chabane Djeraba, and Theo Gevers entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Various techniques are available for detecting the existence and location of parts of a human face, such as nose, nose corner, eyes, canthi, mouth, mouth corner, cheeks, ears and other facial landmarks. An example of such an algorithm is described in a paper published in Proc. of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009, by J. Sivic, M. Everingham and A. Zisserman, entitled: \u201c\u2018\u201d, in Master's Thesis of M. Uricar May 2011 entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in a paper published in VISAPP '12: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications, 2012, by M. Uricar, V. Franc and V. Hlavac entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Further, an open source implementation of a detection of facial landmarks detection is available for download (March 2015) from: cmp.felk.cvut.cz\/\u02dcuricamic\/flandmark\/(preceded by http:\/\/).","In one example, facial landmark (or facial parts) detection may be used for estimating the user gaze by estimating the user head pose, and may be represented by the angle \u03b2 . For example, the existence of, or the number of, facial landmarks or parts detected may be used. In one example, if both user's ears are detected, the person  may be looking directly (or substantially directly) at the front camera, and accordingly the angle \u03b2 is zero or near zero (\u03b2=0\u00b0 or \u03b2\u02dc0\u00b0), such as \u03b2\u226610\u00b0. In the case illustrated in the view , the person  left ear is probably not shown in the image and thus cannot be detected, while the other facial parts, such as left cheek and left eye, as well as the right ear, are captured and thus may be detected in the captured image. In such a case, the head pose angle \u03b2 may be estimated to be about 30\u00b0. Similarly, in the case where only the right side of the face is shown and detected, such as the right eye, right cheek, and right ear, it can be estimated that the user  head pose is substantially left and perpendicular to the front camera line of sight, hence \u03b2=90\u00b0 or \u03b2\u02dc90\u00b0. Similarly, the detection of right or left nostrils or cheeks may be used for estimating the head pose.","A stereo vision is the extraction of 3D information from digital images, obtained by two or more digital cameras. By comparing information about a scene from two vantage points, three-dimension (3D) information can be extracted by examination of the relative positions of objects in the two panels, similar to the human two-eyes process referred to as Stereopsis. In a stereo vision scheme, two cameras are displaced horizontally from one another and used to obtain two differing views of a scene, in a manner similar to human binocular vision. By comparing these two images, the relative depth information can be obtained, in the form of disparities, which are inversely proportional to the differences in distance to the objects. Typically, several processing steps are required, including removing of distortions from the images, such as barrel distortion, to ensure that the observed image is purely projectional, projecting back to a common plane to allow comparison of the image pairs (known as image rectification), creating a disparity map by estimating the position of features in the two images, and converting to a height map by inversion the disparity as observed by the common projection, is, and when utilizing the correct proportionality constant, the height map can be calibrated to provide exact distances. Multi-view stereo processing algorithms are described in a paper by Steven M. Seitz, Brian Curless, James Diebel, Daniel Scharstein, and Rochard Szeliski, entitled: \u201c-\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Devices having multiple cameras are becoming popular, such as Amazon Fire Phone available from AMAZON.COM, INC. Headquartered in Seattle, Wash., 98109 U.S.A., having multiple rear cameras and supporting 3D images capturing, described in the \u2018\u2019, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","In one example, two (or more) front cameras are used, providing stereo vision capability of the user , and a 3D model is formed and analyzed for estimating the head pose and the gaze direction. An algorithm for extracting head pose and gaze direction from a stereo vision information is disclosed in an article describing a research at The Australian National University by Yoshio Matsumoto and Alexander Zelinsky entitled: \u201c-\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The person  angular position relative to the front camera of device , shown as the angle \u03b1 is calculated or estimated as part of the \u201cEstimate User Angular Position\u201d step . The person  line of sight relative to the front camera of device , shown as the angle \u03b2 is calculated or estimated as part of the \u201cEstimate User Gaze Direction\u201d step . In a \u201cCalculate User Gaze Detection\u201d step , the deviation of the user  gaze direction from the optimal rear camera line of sight  or , represented by the angle \u03c6 may be calculated as \u03c6=\u03b2\u2212\u03b1, and an action may be taken in response to the calculated or estimated value of the angle \u03c6 in a \u201cTake Action\u201d step . Any action described herein, such as an action that is part of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  or of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step , may be equally applicable to \u201cTake Action\u201d step , based on the calculated or estimated value of the angle \u03c6 ","Further, the rear digital camera may be controlled based on estimated value of the angle \u03c6 itself, or based on the fact that the estimated value of the angle \u03c6 is above (or below) a pre-set threshold value. For example, upon the estimated value of the angle \u03c6 exceeding a maximum threshold or upon falling below a minimum threshold, an action may be initiated or controlled. For example, the rear digital camera may automatically capture an additional image, or inhibit the user from capturing an image. Further, an action may be affected only when the threshold is being exceeded or any other condition is satisfied for a pre-set time interval, in order to allow for stable operation. For example, the rear digital camera may automatically capture an additional image in the case the angle \u03c6 is below a set threshold (e.g., 30\u00b0) for a 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 seconds. In another example, the digital camera settings may be controlled, such as the changing the aperture size (e.g., aperture diameter), exposure time or index, focal length, exposure index, or any combination thereof. For example, the exposure index and the exposure time may be controlled in response to measured or estimated sharpness or other feature, in order to improve the captured image sharpness. Alternatively or in addition, the angle \u03c6 value may be used as a condition for saving the captured image to a memory, such that only captured images associated with a value above the minimum threshold are saved, while captured images associated with a value below the minimum threshold are discarded.","While exampled above regarding calculating or estimating the horizontal deviation of the person  gaze from an optimal one, the method and system may equally apply to calculating or estimating the vertical deviation of the user gaze direction. In such a case, the vertical user deviation is estimated or calculated in the \u201cEstimate User Angular Position\u201d step , the vertical user gaze direction is estimated or calculated in the \u201cEstimate User Gaze Direction\u201d step , and these values are used for calculating the vertical deviation in the \u201cCalculate User Gaze Deviation\u201d step . In one example, both the vertical and the horizontal deviations are estimated or calculated, and an action may use either one or both of the obtained values. Further in such a case, a total angle \u03c6[\u03c6] may be calculated based on the vertical value \u03c6 designated as \u03c6and on the horizontal value \u03c6 designated as \u03c6, such as \u03c6=\u03c6+\u03c6\u03c6=\u221a{square root over (\u03c6vertical+\u03c6horizontal)}. The action taken in the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  may be then be based on the value of \u03c6.","While represent a 2D projection planes, the method may equally apply to a real world 3D scene, where multiple projections (beyond vertical and horizontal projections) may be used in order to obtain a better estimation of the overlapping of the rear camera and the user gaze field of views. For example, multiple horizontal and\/or horizontal with varying depth may be used, as well as any other plane angles. A weighted average of all these multiple 2D projections may be calculated in order to obtain a better estimation of the correlation of the total angle \u03c6.","The user angular position is described above as being estimated in the \u201cEstimate User Angular Position\u201d step  based on image processing of an image captured by the rear camera of the device . Similarly, the user gaze direction is described above as being estimated in the \u201cEstimate User Gaze Direction\u201d step  based on image processing of an image captured by the front camera of the device . Alternatively or in addition, the user angular position, the user gaze direction, or both, may be estimated using another sensor in the device . Further, the user angular position, the user gaze direction, or both, may be estimated using another sensor (or sensors) that is not part of the device . For example, a sensor (or sensors) may be external to the sensed person  body, implanted inside the body, or may be wearable.","While explained above regarding the estimation of a 2D overlapping of the rear camera FOV and the user FOV, a 3D (volume) overlapping may equally be estimated. In one example, part of the infinite volume captured by a camera is considered, such as by setting a depth limit, as shown in . The volume to be considered is defined as the volume between a plane defined by distance \u2018a\u2019 and a plane defined by the distance \u2018b\u2019 from a camera, and inside the FOV. Similarly, a volume that is part of a user FOV may be defined by two distance values representing two parallel planes perpendicular to the user center line-of-sight, as shown in .","A top view of a general physical arrangement is shown in , having a rear camera  having a center line of sight , and a FOV limited by lines  and . A front camera , distinct and separated from the rear camera  is shown having a center line of sight , and a FOV limited by lines  and . The front camera  is positioned to capture a user's head , positioned having a gaze direction , and a FOV limited by lines  and .","Since the head size of human adults is known to be substantially similar to most humans, and given the known front camera  properties, the distance of the user  from the front camera  (represented as line in view in ) may be estimated. Further, the angle \u03b2 relating to the angular deviation of the person  line of sight  relative to the front camera  may be estimated as described above. The coordinates of origin of user field of view , defined as the user coordinates system (0, 0, 0), may be determined relative to the rear camera  coordinates system, based on the estimated distance and the estimated angle \u03b2 . Thus a transformation matrix may be constructed for transforming from the user coordinates system to the rear camera  coordinates system. The estimated distance may be used to construct a translation matrix, and the user gaze (calculated in user gaze estimation) may be used for to construct a rotation matrix, and the two matrices may be combined to form a transformation matrix. The transformation matrices to and from the rear camera  and to the front camera  may be calculated from the known distances and angles of the two cameras, whether or not they are integrated in a single device. The coordinates of every point inside the user field of view, given a cone to represent the 3D field of view, may be calculated using front camera  coordinate system. In one example, a cone formula may be used, such as x+y=E*z, where z is the axis of the cone.","A point in a space defined by 3D coordinates may be determined or estimated to be inside or outside the rear camera  field of view. Using the known distance and relations of the rear  and front  cameras, a rotation and translation matrix may be constructed, allowing for transformation of a point in one coordinate system to the other coordinate system. For example, a translation matrix may be constructed based on the known distance between the cameras, and the rotation matrix may be constructed based on the known position of the cameras in the device, such as a smartphone. Based on the known rotation and translation matrices from the front camera  to the user gaze coordinate system described herein, a point located in the rear camera  coordinate system may be transformed to the user gaze coordinate system. The rear camera  focus properties may be used to estimate the field of view coordinates that are inside the Depth Of Field (DOF), in order to estimate the exact object size and distance from the rear camera . For example, in a case wherein the depth of field is 5 to 10 meters from the camera, the camera angle of view is X, and assuming cone shape field of view, points may be calculated and determined to be inside or outside the field of view in the DOF region. A 3D coordinates system may be easily converted to another system by multiplying a point in one coordinate system in a transformation matrix that contains the appropriate rotation and translation, to obtain that point coordinates in the second coordinate system.","One way to estimate the rear camera and head FOV percentage of shared FOV is to use a Monte Carlo analysis method on points inside the rear camera FOV inside the DOF, convert them to the head coordinate system, and check if they are inside the user field of view. In the example shown in , the DOF of the field of view 2D cross section defined by lines  and  is defined as between the distance \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019. Any point inside that area may be considered \u201crelevant FOV\u201d. In a Monte Carlo method we choose multiple random points (such as 100 or 1000 points) inside this relevant rear camera FOV, and each point is transformed to the user head coordinate system for checking if it is inside the user FOV.","The fraction obtained by dividing the number of points that passed this test by total number of points chosen randomly is defined as \u2018pass fraction\u2019 of points, denoted by \u2018G\u2019.","This fraction calculation may be used as part of, as a substitute for, or combined with, the \u201cEstimate User Gaze Detection\u201d step . Further, as part of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step , an action may be taken when the pass fraction is above (or below) a pre-defined threshold. For example, an action may be taken if the pass fraction is above 0.8 (80%).","The calculation of the level of FOVs overlapping may use various algorithms and techniques, such as a linear-time algorithm that recovers absolute camera orientations and positions, for network of terrestrial image nodes in outdoor urban scenes described in UCV 49(2\/3), pp. 143-174, September\/October 2002 article by Mattew Antone and Seth Teller entitled: \u201c-\u201d, estimating the relative pose between axial cameras from pairwise point correspondence as described in an article by Francisco Vasconcelos and Joan P.

Other methods for calculating the FOV overlapping are described in the chapter entitled: \u201c-\u201d by Daniel Muhle, Steffen Abraham, Christian Heipke and Manfred Wiggenhagen, published by Photogrammetric Image Analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 6952, 2011, pp 13-24.","The method may be used to estimate that the tree  is viewable by both the rear camera  and user , that a rabbit  is only seen by the user , and that the flower  is only seen by the rear camera . It is noted that in the example shown in , the rear camera  and front camera  respective center-lines of FOV  and , may not be on the same line.","Assuming a camera having a sensor that is 3.39 mm tall (referenced to landscape mode), then half of that is 1.695 mm. For example, the focal length of the iPhone 4 is listed as 3.85 mm. By calculating an a tan(1.695\/3.85) to be 23.75\u00b0 from center to top, or 47.5\u00b0 degrees top to bottom. For the longer dimension 4.52\/2=2.26 mm, the calculation of a tan(2.26\/3.85)=30.41\u00b0 center to side, or 60.8\u00b0 left to right (again referencing with respect to landscape orientation). Hence, such a camera properties may be defined by 60.8\u00b0 horizontal by 47.5\u00b0 vertical. A sensor size for the iPhone 5S back camera is reported to be 4.89\u00d73.67 mm, with a focal length of 4.12 mm. In such a case, the horizontal calculation results in 2*a tan((4.89\/2)\/4.12)=61.4\u00b0 degrees wide, and 2*a tan((3.67\/2)\/4.12)=48.0\u00b0 top to bottom.","A method for computing a photo quality of an image captured by an image acquisition device (or system) is described in Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) International Application (IA) Publication No. WO 2014\/064690 to Sivan, entitled: \u201cReal Time Assessment of Picture Quality\u201d (hereinafter the \u2018690 PCT Publication\u2019), which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Each of the methods of steps herein may consist of, include, be part of, or be based on, a part of, or the whole of, the functionalities or structure (such as software) described in the '690 PCT Publication. Further, each of the devices or elements herein may consist of, include, be part of, or be based on, a part of, or the whole of, the devices or elements described in the '690 PCT Publication.","The term \u201cQuality Indicator\u201d (QI) herein refers to a value that indicates the quality of an image or a part thereof, such as a region or an object in the image. Image quality is a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation (typically, compared to an ideal or perfect image) such as distortion or artifacts, typically introduced by imaging systems, where an image is formed on the image plane of the camera and then measured electronically or chemically to produce the photograph. In one example, image quality may be related to the deviation from an ideal model of photograph formed in a camera by measuring light that is representing the amount of light that falls on each point at a certain point in time. Further, an image for which quality should be determined is primarily not the result of a photographic process in a camera, but the result of storing or transmitting the image. A typical example is a digital image that has been compressed, stored or transmitted, and then decompressed again. Unless a lossless compression method has been used, the resulting image is normally not identical to the original image and the deviation from the (ideal) original image is then a measure of quality. In one example, a QI may be as defined in the '690 PCT Publication. Alternatively or in addition, the QI may be relating to quantifying the existence of a feature, a characteristic, or an object in the entire image or in a region thereof.","Methods for estimating a numerical value for an image file in a color model format having three channels. A region of the image including a detected object (such as a human face) is extracted and converted to a Luma\/Chroma color model. The non-object parts are detected and removed (such as non-skin parts) from the extracted region, and the correlation between the chroma channels is calculated. The numerical value is estimated based on comparing the channels average and standard deviation values, or by calculating the respective correlation coefficient. A numerical value may be estimated by analyzing multiple sequentially captured images, by associating a value and a weighting factor for each image, and by calculating a multi-image numerical value using weighted arithmetic, geometric, or harmonic mean. The weighting factors may be calculated based on the image age, difference analysis, detected trend, or based on a sensor output.","In a typical digital camera such as the digital camera  shown in , the resulting image quality depends on all three factors mentioned above: how much the image formation process of the camera deviates from the pinhole model, the quality of the image measurement process, and the coding artifacts that are introduced in the image produced by the camera, such as by a JPEG coding method. While the image quality is typically objectively determined in terms of deviations from the ideal models, an image quality may equally be related to a subjective perception of an image, such as by a human looking at a photograph. An Image Quality Metrics (IQM) is described in an article by Kim-Han Thung and Paramesran of the Dept. of Electrical Engineering of University of Malaya, entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in the paper entitled: \u201cby Alan Chalmers et al., (Course #44, SIGGRAPH 2000), which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Systems and methods for determining face regions in an image, and for computing an overall image exposure score for an image are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,873,850 to Krishnaswamy, entitled: \u201cDetecting Exposure Quality in Images\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Factors of image quality may include image sharpness, noise, dynamic range, tone reproduction, contrast, color accuracy, distortion, vignetting, exposure accuracy, Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), Lens flare, color moir\u00e9, or artifacts. An image sharpness is typically affected by the lens (such as lens  of the digital camera ) design and manufacturing quality, focal length, aperture, and distance from the image center, by the image sensor characteristics (such as the image sensor ), such as pixel count and anti-aliasing filter, as well as by the focus accuracy, and the atmospheric disturbances (thermal effects and aerosols). Noise is a random variation of image density, visible as grain in film and pixel level variations in digital images, and it commonly arises from the effects of basic physics\u2014the photon nature of light and the thermal energy of heat\u2014inside image sensors. Dynamic range (or exposure range) refers to the range of light levels a camera can capture, usually measured in f-stops, EV (Exposure Value), or zones (all factors of two in exposure). Tone reproduction is the relationship between scene luminance and the reproduced image brightness. Contrast, also known as gamma, is the slope of the tone reproduction curve in a log-log space. Color accuracy refers to the color shifts, saturation, and the effectiveness of its white balance algorithms. Distortion refers to an aberration that causes straight lines to curve. Vignetting (or light falloff) is the effect of darkening images near the corners. Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), also known as \u201ccolor fringing\u201d, is a lens aberration that causes colors to focus at different distances from the image center, and it is most visible near corners of images. Lens flare may refer to a stray light in lenses and optical systems caused by reflections between lens elements and the inside barrel of the lens, and may cause image-fogging (loss of shadow detail and color) as well as \u201cghost\u201d images. Color moir\u00e9 is artificial color banding that can appear in images with repetitive patterns of high spatial frequencies, like fabrics or picket fences. It is affected by lens sharpness, the anti-aliasing (low-pass) filter (which softens the image), and de-mosaicing software.","Flare. Flare, or lens flare, is the light scattered in lens systems through generally unwanted image formation mechanisms, such as internal reflection and scattering from material inhomogeneities in the lens. Flare manifests itself in two ways: as visible artifacts, and as a haze across the image. The haze makes the image look \u201cwashed out\u201d by reducing contrast and color saturation (adding light to dark image regions, and adding white to saturated regions, reducing their saturation). Visible artifacts, usually in the shape of the lens iris, are formed when light follows a pathway through the lens that contains one or more reflections from the lens surfaces. Flare is particularly caused by a very bright light source in either the image, which produces visible artifacts, or shining into the lens but not in the image\u2014which produces a haze. Most commonly, this occurs when shooting into the sun (when the sun is in the frame or the lens is pointed at the direction of the sun), and is reduced by using a lens hood or other shade.","The spatial distribution of the lens flare typically manifests as several starbursts, rings, or circles in a row across the image or view. Lens flare patterns typically spread widely across the scene and change location with the camera's movement relative to light sources, tracking with the light position and fading as the camera points away from the bright light until it causes no flare at all. The specific spatial distribution of the flare depends on the shape of the aperture of the image formation elements. When a bright light source is shining on the lens but not in its field of view, lens flare appears as a haze that washes out the image and reduces contrast. Modern lenses use lens coatings to reduce the amount of reflection and minimize flare. The use of photographic filters can cause flare, particularly ghosts of bright lights (under central inversion). In digital cameras, where the sun is shining on an unprotected lens, a flare may be in the form of a group of small rainbows. This artifact is formed by internal diffraction on the image sensor, which acts like a diffraction grating.","Backlighting. Backlighting refers to bright lighting that originates from behind an object of interest leads to underexposure for the main subject. A person standing in front of a window or entering through an outside door are common examples. When viewed using a regular digital camera, the person entering through the door appears silhouetted.","Blur. Motion blur is the apparent streaking of relative movement between a camera and an object in a still image, and typically results when the position of an image or object being captured (or the camera) changes during the recording of a single frame, either due to rapid movement or long exposure, since a camera creates an image that does not represent a single instant of time, but rather the image may represent the scene over a period of time. A fast moving object, a camera moving, or longer exposure time may result in blurring artifacts, which make it apparent as a blur. Any object moving with respect to the camera looks blurred or smeared along the direction of relative motion, and this smearing may occur on an object that is moving or on a static background or object if the camera is moving. A method and system for estimating motion blur of an image associated with a moving object by inspecting and computing a radon transform of a power spectrum associated with the image are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011\/0096180 to McCloskey et al., entitled: \u201cFourier Domain Blur Estimation Method and System\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","An example of estimating a QI of a human face exposure in an image is exampled in a flow chart  shown in .

Common face-detection algorithms focused on the detection of frontal human faces, and other algorithms attempt to solve the more general and difficult problem of multi-view face detection. That is, the detection of faces that are either rotated along the axis from the face of the observer (in-plane rotation), or rotated along the vertical or left-right axis (out-of-plane rotation), or both.

Various face detection techniques are further described in an article published by Microsoft Research on June 2010 and authored by Cha Zhang and Zhengyou Zhang, entitled: \u201c\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Various object detection (or recognition) schemes in general, and face detection techniques in particular, are based on using Haar-like features (Haar wavelets) instead of the usual image intensities. A Haar-like feature considers adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window, sums up the pixel intensities in each region, and calculates the difference between these sums. This difference is then used to categorize subsections of an image. Viola-Jones object detection framework. When applied to face detection, using Haar features is based on the assumption that all human faces share some similar properties, such as the eyes region is darker than the upper-cheeks, and the nose bridge region is brighter than the eyes. The Haar-features are used by the Viola-Jones object detection framework, described in articles by Paul Viola and Michael Jones, such as the International Journal of Computer Vision 2004 article entitled: \u201c-\u201d and in the Accepted Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2001 article entitled: \u201c\u201d, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","Some face detection algorithms allow for locating the exact detected human face contours in the captured image. However, common techniques used for face detection that may be used as part of the \u201cFace Detection\u201d step , only provide the general location of the detected face in the captured image, as well as various other characterizations, such as the face size. In a \u201cFace Region Extraction\u201d step , the region or part of the captured image containing at least the detected face, is extracted for further processing, allowing for ignoring the parts of the image that do not include the detected human face, being the only element of interest. For example, the extracted region may be rectangular or square shaped, including the oval or round-shaped human face.","The captured image received in the \u201cReceive Image\u201d step  may use any color space format, such as RGB, YUV, or YCrCb. For further processing (as described below), it may be preferred to use the YCrCb color model where the color and luminosity are carried over separate channels. Thus, in a \u201cConvert to YCrCb Format\u201d step  the extracted face region is converted to the YCrCb format using conventional conversion schemes.","Skin detection refers to the process of identifying skin-colored pixels or regions in an image, typically based on a pre-determined skin-tone color. Skin detection techniques are described in an article by Ahmed Elgammal, Crystal Muang, and Dunxu Hu from the Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, entitled: \u201c\u201d, in an article by Chelsia Amy Doukim, Jamal Ahmed Dargham, and Ali Chekima of the School of Engineering & Information Technology, University Malaysia Sabah, entitled: \u201c\u201d, and in an article by Vladimir Vezhnevets, Vassili Sazonov, and Alla Andreeva of the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Moscow State University, entitled: \u201c-\u201d, which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The region extracted from the completely received image in the \u201cFace Region Extraction\u201d step  typically included background and other elements that are not the detected human face. In a \u201cRemove Non-Skin Area\u201d step , the parts (or pixels) that are not part of the detected human face are removed (or marked so that are ignored in further processing) to enable analysis solely on the detected face. In one example, the removal of the non-face portion is based on a known human skin color.","In one example, a human skin may be detected using the difference of the luminance component of the reflection in distinct light wavelengths. When the image was captured during day time, as may be validated by using GPS location or time, by using recognized objects (such a a vehicle), or based on a device white balance detection, the luminance value may be used. A reflectance of a human skin in the Blue-Violet (\u02dc450 nm) and Green-Yellow (\u02dc550 nm) spectra is lower than in the Orange-Red (600-700 nm) spectra. Hence, when the YCbCr color model is used, pixels having higher luminance (Y) values associated with higher Cr values may be considered as a human skin. For example, CbCr values of (80, 160) are likely to be skin related than the values of (80, 135). In one example, a probability (or confidence level) may be associated with the human skin detection, where equal intensity relating to an equal reflectance in the 550-650 nm suggests a low probability (such as 20%) to represent human skin, while CbCr values of (80, 135) that are three times the intensity level of CbCr values of (80, 160) suggests only 5% probability of representing a human skin. In one example, a threshold is set (such as 75%), and only pixels having probability above the threshold are considered as representing a human skin.","A flow-chart designated as \u201cFace Extracting and Preparing\u201d, being part of the flow-chart , includes the \u201cFace Detection\u201d step , the \u201cFace Region Extraction\u201d step , the \u201cConvert to YCrCb Format\u201d step , and the \u201cRemove Non-Skin Area\u201d step . The flow chart provides a method for extracting only the detected face from the received image, and representing this human face in a color model suitable for future analysis, such as using the YCrCb color model.","The quality of an extracted detected face is estimated in a flow-chart being part of the flow chart  and designated as \u201cQI Analysis\u201d. The QI Analysis flow chart includes a \u201cCalculate Histogram\u201d step , a \u201cCalculate Deviation+Mean\u201d step , and an \u201cEstimate Correlation\u201d step .","As part of the \u201cCalculate Histogram\u201d step , the distribution of one or all of the channels of the pixels of the extracted face image with the removed non-skin\/non-face parts is calculated. For example, if a channel of a pixel is represented by 8 bits representing values from 0 to 255, a histogram of the possible 256 values is to be calculated. The formed histogram may then be used to calculate the mean (average) and the standard deviation of the histogram values, as part of the \u201cCalculate Deviation+Mean\u201d step . For example where YCrCb is used, the mean and standard deviation of each of the channels of the color model, namely mean and standard deviation for the \u2018Y\u2019 component (respectively designated as MEAN(Y) and DEV(Y)), for the \u2018Cr\u2019 component (respectively designated as MEAN(Cr) and DEV(Cr)), and for the \u2018Cb\u2019 component (respectively designated as MEAN(Cb) and DEV(Cb)), are calculated.","Based on former analysis or statistics, an image of a human face is known to exhibit various characteristics. In one example, the distribution of colors of human faces is known to show good correlation. In the example of using the YCrCb color model, the distribution of the Cr and Cb values are expected to be similar or even to be substantially the same. Hence, comparing the various channels and measuring the correlation between the two channels provide an indication of the quality of the extracted human face image, and may be performed as part of the \u201cEstimate Correlation\u201d step . For example, the MEAN(Cr) and MEAN(Cb) may be compared, and the absolute difference may be defined as MEAN_DIFF=|MEAN(Cr)\u2212MEAN(Cb)|. In the optimal case, MEAN_DIFF=0 denoting the same average, indicating a high level of correlation between the two channels. Higher value denotes lower correlation between the channels. Alternatively or in addition, the standard deviation of the channels is used to calculate the correlation, where DEV_REL is defined to be DEV_REL=DEV(Cr)\/DEV(Cb). In the optimal case, DEV_REL=1 denoting the same standard deviation, indicating a high level of correlation between the two channels. Much higher than 1 (such as 2.5), or much lower than 1 value (such as 0.25), denotes lower correlation between the channels. The correlation may combine both using the MEAN and the DEV values, providing higher confidence measurement of the correlation. The calculated correlation may be used as a basis for the QI, where lower correlation suggests lower QI value and higher correlation suggests higher QI value. In one example, the QI may be estimated as QI=1\/MEAN_DIFF, so that similar MEAN values (high correlation) result high value of QI, while distant MEAN values suggest a low value of QI. In another example of using DEV for estimating the QI, the QI may be defined as QI=|1\/(DEV_REL\u22121)|, so that similar DEV values result in a higher value of QI, while distant MEAN values suggest a low value of QI.","As part of a \u201cTag\/Notify\u201d step , the estimated QI (based on the color tones correlation) is then associated with the image captured in the \u201cReceive Image\u201d step . In one example, the estimated QI value is added to the image file metadata, such as a \u2018tag\u2019, available for tagging by the user or a machine. In another example, the user is notified of the QI of the image, such as by displaying the QI value as part of the image (when displayed).","Referring now to flow chart  shown in , illustrating a generalized method for estimating and associating QI relating to an image.

If as the one variable increases, the other decreases, the rank correlation coefficients are negative.","Other techniques to measure correlation involve the Distance correlation, the Brownian covariance\/Brownian correlation, the Randomized Dependence Coefficient, and the polychoric correlation schemes. The above and other correlation schemes that may be used are described in the JDMS 1:3539, January\/February 1990 article by Richard Taylor entitled: \u201c\u201d, in Chapter 4 of the book named \u201c\u201d entitled: --\u201d, and in Chapter 22 entitled: \u201c\u201d by Dr. Rick Yount (4ed. 2006), which are all incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","While the QI Analysis' flow chart was described regarding analysis of the image in order to estimate a QI that relates to object detection, the analysis in general, and the calculated correlation in particular, may be used to estimate any feature or characteristic of the image as a whole, or of an extracted object with removed background after performing the \u201cObject Extracting and Preparing\u201d flow chart . In one example, the correlation may be used to estimate a QI value that relates to an estimation or measurement of any factor relating to the image quality, such as image sharpness, noise, dynamic range, tone reproduction, contrast, color accuracy, distortion, vignetting, exposure accuracy, Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), Lens flare, color moir\u00e9, backlighting, or artifacts.","The QI value may be calculated as part of \u201cEstimate QI\u201d step  based on the calculated correlation coefficient. In one example, the estimated correlation coefficient or the estimated QI are compared to a pre-set threshold value. An action may be taken as part of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  if the estimated correlation coefficient or the estimated QI are above the pre-set threshold value, or alternately the action is taken if the estimated correlation coefficient or the estimated QI are below the pre-set threshold value. Further, any action described in the '690 PCT Publication may equally be used as part of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step . Further, the digital camera (such as the digital camera ) may be controlled based on the estimated QI value itself, or based on the fact that the estimated QI is above (or below) a pre-set threshold value. For example, upon exceeding a maximum threshold or upon falling below a minimum threshold, the digital camera may automatically capture an additional image. Alternatively or in addition, the value may be used as a condition for saving the captured image to a memory, such that only captured images associated with a QI value above the minimum threshold are saved, while captured images associated with a QI value below the minimum threshold are discarded. In another example, the digital camera settings may be controlled, such as the changing the aperture size (e.g., aperture diameter), exposure time or index, focal length, exposure index, or any combination thereof. For example, the exposure index and the exposure time may be controlled in response to measured or estimated sharpness or other feature, in order to improve the captured image sharpness.","With a digital camera, the cost and effort associated with taking a photograph is negligible. Hence, in many cases, a user may take multiple consecutive pictures of a scene, so the photographer can then later select the best image of the group or arrange them in a sequence to study the transitions in detail. Many digital cameras provide \u2018burst\u2019 or continuous high speed shooting mode, where several photographs are captured in quick succession by either pressing or touching the shutter button or holding it down. Commonly digital cameras today are capable of capturing and recording 10-40 still images per second in burst mode, and faster rate of capture is allowed in some available digital cameras. Cameras capable of high continuous shooting rates are typically used when the subjects are in motion, as in sports photography, or where the opportunities are brief. Rather than anticipating the action precisely, photographers can simply start shooting from just before they believe the action will occur, giving a high chance of at least one frame being acceptable.","Similarly, video recording involves capturing multiple images using a fixed frame rate. The number of still pictures per unit of time of video ranges from six or eight frames per second (frame\/s) for old mechanical cameras to 120 or more frames per second for new professional cameras. PAL standards (commonly used in most of Europe) and SECAM (popular in France and Russia) specify 25 frame\/s, while NTSC standards (USA, Canada, Japan, etc.) specify 29.97 frames. The minimum frame rate to achieve a comfortable illusion of a moving image is about sixteen frames per second. Typically, in burst mode or in capturing video, the multi-frame shooting rate is continuous, so in the case of a rate of 10 fps (frames per second), the still images are captured every 1\/10 second, and a rate of 30 fps involves capturing every 1\/30 second.","A false positive error, or in short false positive, commonly called a \u201cfalse alarm\u201d, is a result that indicates a given condition has been satisfied, when it actually has not been fulfilled. A false positive error is a type I error where the test is checking a single condition, and results in an affirmative or negative decision usually designated as \u201ctrue or false\u201d. The false positive rate is the proportion of absent events that yield positive test outcomes, i.e., the conditional probability of a positive test result given an absent event. The false positive rate is equal to the significance level. The specificity of the test is equal to 1 minus the false positive rate. A false negative error, or in short false negative, is where a test result indicates that a condition failed, while it actually was successful. A false negative error is a type II error occurring in test steps where a single condition is checked for and the result can be either positive or negative. Complementarily, the false negative rate is the proportion of events that are being tested for which yield negative test outcomes with the test, i.e., the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the event being looked for has taken place.","A QI value may be associated with an image as a result of applying an image processing algorithm to that image. For example, the flow chart  above describes an exemplary method for estimating a QI for a human face detected in an image, and the flow chart  above describes an exemplary method for estimating a QI for an object detected in an image. However, the image processing algorithm may provide false negative or false positive result in the estimation or measurement due to any factor relating to the image quality, such as image sharpness, noise, dynamic range, tone reproduction, contrast, color accuracy, distortion, vignetting, exposure accuracy, Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), Lens flare, color moir\u00e9, backlighting, or artifacts.","However, in the case of taking multiple images, such as by burst or video mode, the recently captured images may be used in order to reduce the false negative or false positive rates, and to improve the confidence level of the estimated QI. A QI that is estimated based on multiple (or a single) former frames is denoted as Multi-Frame QI (MFQI). For example, it may be assumed that there is a high degree of correlation between two consecutive images taken during a short period that is less than a second, such as 1\/10 or 1\/30 seconds apart, since most actions or scenes are not expected to quickly change. The high degree of correlation may be used when analyzing an image, by using information obtained by processing the recently former captured images.","An example of a flow chart  for estimating a multi-frame QI (MFQI) for an image (i), denoted as MFQI(i), based on former three captured images, denoted as (i\u22123), (i\u22122), and (i\u22121), where (i\u22123) refers to the \u2018oldest\u2019 taken image and (i\u22121) refers to the last image captured before the current discussed (i), is shown in .

However, due to various impairments in the captured image, such as impacts of image sharpness, noise, dynamic range, tone reproduction, contrast, color accuracy, distortion, vignetting, exposure accuracy, Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), Lens flare, color moir\u00e9, backlighting, or artifacts, the algorithm may exhibit false negative, where the object is indeed in the image, but could not be detected or located by the algorithm used. For example, a human may be shown in the image, but his face may not be detected, for example due to head pose. In such a case, the algorithm may return a value of 0% (QI=0%) as the probability of the presence of the object. In the case of multiple frames being captured rapidly and consecutively, where the object is detected in multiple consecutive frames (100% probability), and then the object is not detected in one frame (0% probability), a multi frame QI may be used to better estimate the probability of the existence of a human face in the image.

Using the same data in an example of using a weighted average, where the weight factors are w=0.4, w=0.3, w=0.2 and w=0.1, the resulting MFQI(i)=60%.

However, in some occasions the correlation may not exist. For example, in the case of object detection, the object may be located near a frame edge in one frame and absent from the frame in the next frame. Further, the object to be detected may be moving and thus forming an optical flow in the images, until reaching out of frame location. Such situation may be detected when a QI of a frame is substantially different from the QIs obtained for multiple former frames. For example, assuming a sequence where QI=90, QI=87, QI=91, and QI=32, the low QI associated with the last captured frame (i) may indicate a different scenario (e.g., a human face out of the frame), resulting no or low correlation to the former images. In such a case, calculating the MFQI(i) based only on age related weights, may result in inaccurate value. Preferably, such significantly different (non-correlated) QI value may not be used in the MFQI(i) calculation (such as assuming w=0), or may be used with a lowered weight.

Preferably, symmetrical distribution with respect to the mean value is assumed, where the data relating to the QI values are symmetrically distributed around the mean while the frequency of occurrence of data farther away from the mean diminishes, such as the normal distribution, the logistic distribution, or the Student's t-distribution. The distribution fitting may be based on parametric methods, where the parameters of the distribution are calculated from the data series, such as the method of moments, the method of L-moments, and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Alternatively or in addition, a regression-based method may be used, by using a transformation of the cumulative distribution function so that a linear relation is found between the cumulative probability and the values of the data, which may also need to be transformed, depending on the selected probability.","While in the example above it is assumed that the QI values are similar between consecutive frames, and are normally distributed, it may equally be that the QI values exhibit a trend. For example, assuming a consecutive set of QI values of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 45 clearly suggest a steady linear growth of the QI values, and the next QI value is clearly predicted to be 50. In such a case, a frame associated with a QIvalue that is substantially different from the predicted value, may be associated with a low value of the weight coefficient \u03b8.","Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a \u201csmooth\u201d function is constructed that approximately fits the data. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data, and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data. Curve fitting is described in a guide entitled: \u201c\u201d and in NASA Technical Note (NATA TN D-6374) entitled: \u201c---\u201d by John Q. Howell, which are both incorporated in their entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","A curve fit may be used to fit the QI values to a first degree polynomial (linear) equation of the form y=ax+b, representing a line with slope a, where they variable represents the QI value and the x variable represents the frame number (i, i=1 . . . N). A second degree polynomial equation may be used having the form of y=ax+bx+c, or alternatively a third degree polynomial may be used having the form of y=ax+bx+cx+d. The equation used for the curve-fitting, may then be used for extrapolation in order to predict the value of QI, denoted herein as PREDICTED(QI). In the example of a consecutive set of QI values of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 (corresponding to frames numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) the set fits a linear equation of y=5x+15 (a=5, b=15), and thus the next QI(7) is predicted to be PREDICTED (QI)=50. In such a case, a DISTANCE can be defined as DISTANCE=|PREDICTED(QI)\u2212QI|, and the weight coefficient \u03b8 may be calculated based on this value, where higher weight coefficient \u03b8 is assigned for a lower value of DISTANCE. The weight coefficient \u03b8 that is calculated based on curve fitting as described above is designated herein as \u03b8(Curve-Fit). In one example, the used coefficient \u03b8 is based on the QI values by using both calculated \u03b8(Distribution) and \u03b8(Curve-Fit), and the combined coefficient \u03b8, designated as \u03b8(Fitting), is calculated as a function of both, for example using the equation: \u03b8(Fitting)=\u03b8(Curve-Fit)*\u03b8(Distribution).","While the weight coefficient \u03b8 was exampled above to be estimated or calculated based on multiple consecutive frames each associated with its QI, the weight coefficient may further be estimated based on an input from a sensor. Devices (such as smartphones) are commercially available comprising both a digital camera and an environmental sensor, and the sensor output may be used to determine or impact the estimation of the weight coefficient, by sensing an environmental situation occurring while capturing a specific frame to the weighing factor that is associated to that frame. Any element capable of measuring or responding to a physical phenomenon may be used as a sensor. An appropriate sensor may be adapted for a specific physical phenomenon, such as a sensor responsive to temperature, humidity, pressure, audio, vibration, light, motion, sound, proximity, flow rate, electrical voltage, and electrical current. Further, the sensor may be any sensor described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013\/0201316 to Binder et al., entitled: \u201cSystem and Method for Server Based Control\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The sensor may be semiconductor-based and may be based on MEMS technology. For example, the sensor may be an accelerometer for sensing or estimating motion, which is known to form a motion blur in the captured image. In such a case, a lower value may be assigned to the weight coefficient \u03b8 when higher motion is sensed, in order to minimize or eliminate the motion blur effected frames. The use of additional various sensors is further described in the '690 PCT Publication.","In one example, the sensor is a motion sensor, and may include one or more accelerometers, which measures the absolute acceleration or the acceleration relative to freefall. For example, one single-axis accelerometer per axis may be used, requiring three such accelerometers for three-axis sensing. The motion sensor may be a single or multi-axis sensor, detecting the magnitude and direction of the acceleration as a vector quantity, and thus can be used to sense orientation, acceleration, vibration, shock and falling. The motion sensor output may be analog or digital signals, representing the measured values. The motion sensor may be based on a piezoelectric accelerometer that utilizes the piezoelectric effect of certain materials to measure dynamic changes in mechanical variables (e.g., acceleration, vibration, and mechanical shock). Piezoelectric accelerometers commonly rely on piezoceramics (e.g., lead zirconate titanate) or single crystals (e.g., Quartz, Tourmaline).

For example, a measured value that may greatly impact the image, such as degrading the image quality (such as motion) or affect a feature of the image, may be associated with a lower value of the weight coefficient \u03b8, in order to reduce the effect of the frame affected by the physical phenomenon. For example, in a case no motion is detected, it is reasonable to assume \u03b8=1, while sensing a high degree of acceleration or velocity (such as above a pre-set threshold) may result in \u03b8=0. The weight coefficient \u03b8 that is calculated based on a sensor output as described above is designated herein as \u03b8(Sensor).","While exampled above regarding QI value representing the quality indicator associated with the respective image, the method herein may equally apply to any numerical value applied to an image. For example, any QI or other value described in the '690 PCT Publication may equally be used herein. Typically, an image processing algorithm is used to associate a numerical value to an image, defined herein as QI as well, including cases where the numerical value is not associated with any quality measure. For example, the image processing algorithm may be associated with a feature or characteristic of the captured image. In one example described above, the image processing algorithm is an object detection algorithm, such as a face detection algorithm, and the numerical value associated with an image is the probability that the image is indeed found in the captured image. In such a case, the object detection scheme may return for example a value of 100% if the object is detected in the image, or 0% in the case the algorithm failed to detect the object. In another example, the numerical value may be used to estimate image sharpness, noise, dynamic range, tone reproduction, contrast, color accuracy, distortion, vignetting, exposure accuracy, Lateral Chromatic Aberration (LCA), Lens flare, color moir\u00e9, backlighting, or artifacts. In another example, the numerical value refers to the location of an object in the image.","In the general case, the MFQI(i) may be calculated or estimated based on the values (such as QIs values) weighted according to the respective frames age, and the weighing factors may be further updated according to the weight coefficient \u03b8, that may be based on analyzing for substantial different values of QI [\u03b8(Distribution)], based on curve fitting in case of detecting a trend [\u03b8(Curve-Fit)], based on a sensor output [\u03b8(Sensor)], or a function of any combination thereof, generally denotes as \u03b8=f[\u03b8(Distribution), \u03b8(Curve-Fit), \u03b8(Sensor)]=f[\u03b8(Distribution), \u03b8(Fitting)]. In one example, the weights factors or the weight coefficient \u03b8 are based on, or are according to, the confidence level as described in the '690 PCT Publication.","A general flow chart  for a multi-frame analysis is shown in . A digital camera  (which may correspond with camera ) captures N images, designated as image() , image() , image() , and image(N) N, in a digital file format. Each image(i) (i=1 to N) is processed, preferably in real-time immediately after its capture, using image processing as part of an \u201cImage Processing \u201d step , determining a value corresponding to a feature or characteristic of the respective captured image. A resulting Value(i) (such as the respective QI value) is associated with each image(i), such that a Value() is corresponding to the image() , a Value() is corresponding to the image() , a Value() is corresponding to the image() , and a Value(N) N is corresponding to the image(N) N. The values are stored in a memory (may correspond with the main memory ), also storing assigned age related weight factors w, as part of a \u201cMemory (w(i),QI(i))\u201d step . The multi-frame analysis for providing a value that is based on all of the captured images, such as the MFQI value, is performed as part of a \u201cMulti-Frame Analysis\u201d step , and the calculated value may be used as a basis for taking an action in a \u201cTake Action\u201d step , which may correspond to the \u201cTake Action\u201d step . The analysis described in flow-chart  may be performed off-line at a remote location, such as a service provided over the Internet by a remote server. Preferably, the analysis described in flow-chart  may be performed locally, such as collocated with the digital camera, or integrated with the digital camera, and may be performed in real-time, such as before the next frame is captured in a burst mode or as part of video capturing. In one example, as part of the \u201cTake Action\u201d step , the digital camera (such as the digital camera ) may be controlled based on multi-estimated or calculated multi-frame value (such as MFQI) itself, or based on the fact that the estimated MFQI value is above (or below) a pre-set threshold value. For example, upon exceeding a maximum threshold or upon falling below a minimum threshold, an additional image may automatically be captured by the digital camera. In another example, the digital camera settings may be controlled, such as the changing the aperture size (e.g., aperture diameter), exposure time or index, focal length, exposure index, or any combination thereof. For example, the exposure index and the exposure time may be controlled in response to measured or estimated sharpness or any other feature, in order to improve the captured image sharpness. Alternatively or in addition, the value may be used as a condition for saving the captured image to a memory, such that only captured images associated with an MFQI value above the minimum threshold are saved, while captured images associated with an MFQI value below the minimum threshold are discarded. The \u201cMulti-Frame Analysis\u201d step may be based on, or use, a weighted mean where each value is weighted according to the weighting factors W, such as weighted arithmetic mean, weighted geometric mean, or weighted harmonic mean.","In a \u201cCoefficient Estimation [w\u2032(i)\u2190w(i)*\u03b8]\u201d step , one or more of the weighting factors w(such as the weight wof the last captured frame N) is modified to be w*\u03b8, and in the case of the last frame, the multi-frame analysis in step is using w*\u03b8 instead of the original, age-based only, w. The weight coefficient \u03b8 may be calculated in a \u201cCurve\/Distribution Fitting\u201d step based on the curve-fitting of the values QI(i) (generally value(i)), as described above and designated as \u03b8(Curve-Fit). Alternatively or in addition, the weight coefficient \u03b8 may be calculated in the \u201cCurve\/Distribution Fitting\u201d step based on the distribution of the values QI(i) (generally value(i)), as described above and designated as \u03b8(Distribution), or may be based on both, as described above and designated as \u03b8(Fitting).","Alternatively or in addition, the weight coefficient \u03b8 may be based on a sensor that is responsive to the digital camera  environment, preferably sensed at the time the respective image is captured by the digital camera . For example, the sensor may be a \u201cMotion Sensor\u201d  (which may be an accelerometer), which is mechanically housed with, attached, or otherwise mechanically coupled to the digital camera  as illustrated by the dashed line . The weight coefficient \u03b8 may be calculated in a \u201cMotion Coefficient Estimation\u201d step and used in the \u201cCurve\/Distribution Fitting\u201d step based on the sensor output, as described above and designated as \u03b8(Sensor).","Many image processing algorithms output two or more values as part of the processing. For example, an object detection algorithm may provide the location of the object in the image, as well as the probability that indeed the object was detected. In such a case, one of the values, for example the main feature of interest, may be used (as QI value) for the multi-frame calculation (such as MFQI) in the \u201cMulti-Frame Analysis\u201d step . Simultaneously, the other value obtained from the image processing, may be used to calculate the weighting coefficient \u03b8, shown designated as \u03b8(Image) in flow-chart . In the example of the object detection algorithm that provides both the detection probability and the location of the detected object in the image, the optical flow may be calculated as the MFQI, and the confidence\/probability of the detection may be used to accordingly adjust the contribution of each image to the total multi-frame analysis.","In another example, the captured images image() , image() , . . . image (N) N are being processed by another image processing algorithm that is distinct from the image processing used for calculating the values to N, and such a scheme is described by an \u201cImage Processing \u201d step . The values obtained from this additional image processing may be used to calculate the weight coefficient \u03b8, as designated by \u03b8(Image ). Hence, in the general case, the weight coefficient \u03b8 may be a function of all exampled factors, formalized as: \u03b8=f[\u03b8(Fitting), \u03b8(Image ), \u03b8(Image ), \u03b8(Sensor)], and calculated as part of the \u201cCoefficient Estimation [w\u2032(i)\u2190w(i)*\u03b8]\u201d step . In one example, the total weight coefficient \u03b8 may be calculated by multiplying of all the impacting factors, namely calculated as: \u03b8=\u03b8(Fitting)*\u03b8(Image )*\u03b8(Image )*\u03b8(Sensor).","In the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  above, an action is performed in response to the estimated value of the angle \u03c6 , in the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  an action is performed in response to the estimated value of the estimated QI, and in the \u201cTake Action\u201d step  an action is performed in response to the estimated value of the estimated MFQI. The action taken in response to the estimated value (of the angle \u03c6 , the QI, or the MFQI) may include control, activation, or initiation of an actuator for affecting a physical phenomenon, and the actuator and its control may be as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013\/0201316 to Binder et al., entitled: \u201cSystem and Method for Server Based Control\u201d, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The action taken may include activation of an annunciator, that may consist of one or more visual or audible signaling component, or any other devices that indicate a status to the person. The annunciator may include a visual signaling device. For example, the annunciator may be activated when the estimated value (of the angle \u03c6 , the QI, or the MFQI) exceeds a threshold that is either a minimum or a maximum one. Alternatively or in addition, the annunciator parameters may be controlled based on the estimated value. In one example, the device illuminates a visible light, such as a Light-Emitting-Diode (LED), or uses a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) that uses changes in the reflectivity in an applied electric field. The LED may be a multi-color LED, such as LED Part No. 08L5015RGBC available from RSR Electronics, Inc. from NJ, U.S.A., described in Data-sheet Multi Color LED Part No. 08L5015RGBC, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. However, any type of visible electric light emitter such as a flashlight, an incandescent lamp, and compact fluorescent lamps can be used. Multiple light emitters may be used, and the illumination may be steady, blinking or flashing. Further, a single-state visual indicator may be used to provide multiple indications, such as by using different colors (of the same visual indicator), different intensity levels, variable duty-cycle and so forth. Further, the visual signaling may be associated with the device  function, theme or shape. Such conceptual relationships may include, for example, the light emitters' brightness, appearance, location, type, color and steadiness that are influenced by the estimated value. In one example, the annunciator operation is based on a numerical digital display that provides readings in the form of numbers of the estimated value of any value derived thereof. For example, the annunciator may use the quadruple digits, seven-segments, LED display Part No.: LTC-3610G available from Lite-On Electronics, Inc., and described in Lite-On Electronics, Inc., Publication BNS-OD-C131\/A4 downloaded March 2011, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. Similarly, the annunciator may be based on an alphanumerical digital display that provides readings in the form of characters, including numbers, letters or symbols. For example, the annunciator may use the quadruple digits, seven-segments, LED display Part No.: LTM-8647AC available from Lite-On Electronics, Inc., and described in Lite-On Electronics, Inc., Publication BNS-OD-C131\/A4 downloaded March 2011, which is incorporated in its entirety for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.","The invention can be similarly used to display word messages in a variety of fashions and formats, such as scrolling, static, bold and flashing. The device may further display visual display material beyond words and characters, such as arrows, symbols, ASCII and non-ASCII characters, still images such as pictures and video. The annunciator may use any electronic display or any other output device used for the presentation of visual information. The display may be a digital or analog video display, and may use technologies such as LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), TFT (Thin-Film Transistor), FED (Field Emission Display), CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) or any other electronic screen technology that visually shows information such as graphics or text. In many cases, an adaptor (not shown) is required in order to connect an analog display to the digital data. For example, the adaptor may convert to composite video (PAL, NTSC) or S-Video or HDTV signal. Analog displays commonly use interfaces such as composite video such as NTSC, PAL or SECAM formats. Similarly, analog RGB, VGA (Video Graphics Array), SVGA (Super Video Graphics Array), SCART, S-video and other standard analog interfaces can be used. Further, personal computer monitors, plasma or flat panel displays, CRT, DLP display or a video projector may be equally used.

Other digital interfaces that can be used are USB, SDI (Serial Digital Interface), FireWire, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface), DVI (Digital Visual Interface), UDI (Unified Display Interface), DisplayPort, Digital Component Video and DVB (Digital Video Broadcast).","In one example, the annunciator affects sound or music generation. The estimated value may be associated with a musical tune (or a tone) or any other single sound, which is played upon activation of the annunciator. The annunciator may include an audible signaling device (sounder) that emits audible sounds that can be heard by a human (having frequency components in the 20-20,000 Hz band). In one example, the device is a buzzer (or beeper), a chime, a whistle or a ringer. Buzzers are known in the art and are either electromechanical or ceramic-based piezoelectric sounders that make a high-pitch noise. The sounder may emit a single or multiple tones, and can be in continuous or intermittent operation. In another example, the sounder simulates the voice of a human being or generates music, typically by using an electronic circuit having a memory for storing the sounds (e.g., click, gong, music, song, voice message, etc.), a digital to analog converter to reconstruct the electrical representation of the sound and driver for driving a loudspeaker, which is an electro-acoustical transducer that converts an electrical signal to sound.

The term \u201csoftware integration\u201d or any other reference to the integration of two programs or processes herein, is used herein to include, but not limited to, software components (e.g., programs, modules, functions, processes, etc.) that are (directly or via another component) combined, working or functioning together or form a whole, commonly for sharing a common purpose or set of objectives. Such software integration can take the form of sharing the same program code, exchanging data, being managed by the same manager program, executed by the same processor, stored on the same medium, sharing the same GUI or other user interface, sharing peripheral hardware (such as a monitor, printer, keyboard and memory), sharing data or a database, or being part of a single package. The term \u201chardware integration\u201d or integration of hardware components is used herein to include, but not limited to, hardware components that are (directly or via another component) combined, working or functioning together or form a whole, commonly for sharing a common purpose or set of objectives. Such hardware integration can take the form of sharing the same power source (or power supply) or sharing other resources, exchanging data or control (e.g., by communicating), being managed by the same manager, physically connected or attached, sharing peripheral hardware connection (such as a monitor, printer, keyboard and memory), being part of a single package or mounted in a single enclosure (or any other physical collocating), sharing a communication port, or used or controlled with the same software or hardware. The term \u201cintegration\u201d herein is used herein to include as applicable, but not limited to, a software integration, a hardware integration, or any combination thereof.","Any networking protocol may be utilized for exchanging information between the network elements (e.g., clients, and servers) within the network (such as the Internet ). For example, it is contemplated that communications can be performed using TCP\/IP. Generally, HTTP and HTTPS are utilized on top of TCP\/IP as the message transport envelope. These two protocols are able to deal with firewall technology better than other message management techniques. However, partners may choose to use a message-queuing system instead of HTTP and HTTPS if greater communications reliability is needed. A non-limiting example of a message queuing system is IBM's MQ-Series or the Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ). The system described hereinafter is suited for both HTTP\/HTTPS, message-queuing systems, and other communications transport protocol technologies. Furthermore, depending on the differing business and technical requirements of the various partners within the network, the physical network may embrace and utilize multiple communication protocol technologies.","The term \u201cport\u201d refers to a place of access to a device, electrical circuit or network, where energy or signal may be supplied or withdrawn. The term \u201cinterface\u201d of a networked device refers to a physical interface, a logical interface (e.g., a portion of a physical interface or sometimes referred to in the industry as a sub-interface\u2014for example, such as, but not limited to a particular VLAN associated with a network interface), and\/or a virtual interface (e.g., traffic grouped together based on some characteristic\u2014for example, such as, but not limited to, a tunnel interface). As used herein, the term \u201cindependent\u201d relating to two (or more) elements, processes, or functionalities, refers to a scenario where one does not affect nor preclude the other. For example, independent communication such as over a pair of independent data routes means that communication over one data route does not affect nor preclude the communication over the other data routes.","Some embodiments may be used in conjunction with various devices, network elements, and systems, for example, a Personal Computer (PC), a desktop computer, a mobile computer, a laptop computer, a notebook computer, a tablet computer, a server computer, a handheld computer, a handheld device, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device, a cellular handset, a handheld PDA device, an on-board device, an off-board device, a hybrid device, a vehicular device, a non-vehicular device, a mobile or portable device, a non-mobile or non-portable device, a wireless communication station, a wireless communication device, a wireless Access Point (AP), a wired or wireless router, a wired or wireless modem, a wired or wireless network, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wireless LAN (WLAN), a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Wireless MAN (WMAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), a Wireless WAN (WWAN), a Personal Area Network (PAN), a Wireless PAN (WPAN), devices and\/or networks operating substantially in accordance with existing IEEE 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11k, 802.11n, 802.11r, 802.16, 802.16d, 802.16e, 802.20, 802.21 standards and\/or future versions and\/or derivatives of the above standards, units and\/or devices which are part of the above networks, one way and\/or two-way radio communication systems, cellular radio-telephone communication systems, a cellular telephone, a wireless telephone, a Personal Communication Systems (PCS) device, a PDA device which incorporates a wireless communication device, a mobile or portable Global Positioning System (GPS) device, a device which incorporates a GPS receiver or transceiver or chip, a device which incorporates an RFID element or chip, a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) transceiver or device, a Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) transceiver or device, a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) transceiver or device, a device having one or more internal antennas and\/or external antennas, Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) devices or systems, multi-standard radio devices or systems, a wired or wireless handheld device (e.g., BlackBerry, Palm Treo), a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) device, or the like.","As used herein, the terms \u201cprogram\u201d, \u201cprogrammable\u201d, and \u201ccomputer program\u201d are meant to include any sequence or human or machine cognizable steps, which perform a function.

Application software is typically a set of one or more programs designed to carry out operations for a specific application. Commonly, an application software is dependent on system software that manages and integrates computer capabilities, but does not directly perform tasks that benefit the user, such as an operating system, to execute. Examples of types of application software may include accounting software, media players, and office suites. Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately, and further may be developed and coded as a proprietary, or as an open-source, software. Most applications are designed to help people perform an activity.","The terms \u201ctask\u201d and \u201cprocess\u201d are used generically herein to describe any type of running programs, including, but not limited to a computer process, task, thread, executing application, operating system, user process, device driver, native code, machine or other language, etc., and can be interactive and\/or non-interactive, executing locally and\/or remotely, executing in foreground and\/or background, executing in the user and\/or operating system address spaces, a routine of a library and\/or standalone application, and is not limited to any particular memory partitioning technique. The steps, connections, and processing of signals and information illustrated in the figures, including, but not limited to any block and flow diagrams and message sequence charts, may typically be performed in the same or in a different serial or parallel ordering and\/or by different components and\/or processes, threads, etc., and\/or over different connections and be combined with other functions in other embodiments, unless this disables the embodiment or a sequence is explicitly or implicitly required (e.g., for a sequence of reading the value, processing the value\u2014the value must be obtained prior to processing it, although some of the associated processing may be performed prior to, concurrently with, and\/or after the read operation). Where certain process steps are described in a particular order or where alphabetic and\/or alphanumeric labels are used to identify certain steps, the embodiments are not limited to any particular order of carrying out such steps. In particular, the labels are used merely for convenient identification of steps and are not intended to imply, specify or require a particular order for carrying out such steps. Furthermore, other embodiments may use more or fewer steps than those discussed herein. They may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means plus function elements in the claims below are intended to include any structure, or material, for performing the function in combination with other claimed elements as specifically claimed.
