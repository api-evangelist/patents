{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["A multiple Beam Antenna (MBA) is a type of antenna system employed in the satellite applications and under normal operating mode has a field of view (FOV) that covers a section of the Earth's surface termed the coverage area. The MBA contains several feeds that illuminate a lens or a reflector system to produce multiple beams. The adaptive MBA is designed to combat interference sources including intentional jammers located anywhere within the desired area covered by the quiescent pattern of the antenna. This is accomplished by relatively high resolution afforded by a multibeam antenna with a relatively large aperture size and a significant number of beams providing the desired degrees of freedom in the adaptive nulling process. The outputs of the multiple beams are linearly combined in the MBA beamformer in an adaptive manner so as to introduce nulls in the direction of interference sources while minimizing the inevitable antenna gain reduction in any other direction within the quiescent beam width. To achieve the desired objectives effectively, the adaptive algorithm must have sufficiently rapid convergence rate to adapt in a dynamic scenario, such as the presence of blinking jammers, and have reasonable computational requirements in terms of the actual number of arithmetic operations per update of the algorithm.","The adaptive algorithms of the prior art are based on the constrained optimization of the array gain related to the signal to noise power ratio for a signal source in the direction of the peak of the antenna gain as specified by the steering vector. The steering vector or the quiescent weight vector actually produces reasonable directive gain to users in the specified coverage area in the absence of jammers\u2014essentially a property of the MBA antenna.","However, this is not the case with the adapted pattern obtained with the adaptive algorithm in the presence of jammers wherein there is considerable reduction in the antenna gain in the coverage area with the reduction being highly non uniform over the area of coverage. One of the adaptive algorithms termed SMI (Sample Matrix Inversion) minimizes the residual interference power at the MBA beamformer output. However, the SMI algorithm does not optimize the area covered by the adapted beam. In terms of implementation, the SMI algorithm requires Ncomplex multiplications and additions and an N\u00d7N matrix inversion for each algorithm update wherein N is the number of beams in the MBA. Furthermore, in situations involving multiple jammers of varying power levels, the estimated correlation matrix may become ill conditioned and high precision arithmetic may be required to avoid numerical instability. A computationally simpler algorithm termed correlation feedback (CF) requires only order N computations. However, for the case of high condition number of the relevant correlation matrix involved, the convergence may be very slow and may not be acceptable in some dynamic scenario.","Quantized state (QS) algorithms taught by Kumar have convergence rates similar to that of SMI algorithm and possibly orders of magnitude faster than the CF algorithm. The QS algorithm require much smaller computational requirements compared to the SMI algorithm and are also numerically robust with matrix condition number that is order of the square root of the condition number of the correlation matrix involved in the SMI algorithm. The quantizes state algorithms are also capable of providing better gain distribution in the coverage area than the SMI algorithm especially in areas in the vicinity of the interference sources.","The adaptive algorithms of the previous literature exhibit spurious nulls in the adapted MBA beam pattern, in that the antenna gain pattern has nulls in the directions other than the direction of the interfering sources. The number of the spurious nulls, their locations and depth is highly variable and depends upon the algorithm used, the number of interfering sources, their directions and power levels, etc., and is otherwise unpredictable. Due to these spurious nulls, the coverage area of the MBA antenna has undesirable holes around these nulls in addition to those around the interfering sources.","Thus it is desirable to have architectures that eliminate the presence of spurious nulls in the area of coverage, provide superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area compared to the architectures of the prior art, and result in a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio for the users located in the coverage area. It may be also desirable to be able to have architectures for finding the directions of the interference sources including intentional jammers for RF surveillance purposes. The adaptive multibeam architectures of this invention possess these and various other benefits.","Various embodiments described herein are directed to methods and systems for adaptive multibeam antenna architectures for recovering users' signals transmitted from sources in the coverage area of the antenna in the presence of interference sources. The invention presents architectures that mitigate the presence of spurious nulls in the area of coverage, provide superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area compared to the architectures of the prior art, and result in a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio for the users located in the coverage area. For example, various embodiments may utilize an architecture comprised of an array of antenna feeds, an RF to baseband conversion subsystem, a bank of digital beamformers, a channelization subsystem, a bank of weighted combiners, and a bank of demodulators for the demodulation and detection of user signals.","In one of the invented architectures, the bank of digital beamformers is comprised of a multiplicity M of MBA beamformers that have a common RF front end and employ different algorithms, for example, one of the MBAs may employ one of the QS algorithms with the other employing SMI algorithm in the case of two beamformers and combining the outputs of the multiplicity of the beamformers to produce the resultant MBA pattern. As another example, two different QS algorithms may be employed in the two of the beamformers thus maintaining the computational advantages of the QS algorithm.","The invented architecture inherits many advantages of the various algorithms in the component beamformers resulting in an overall superior antenna gain distribution in the coverage area after the adaptation. Due to different weight vector arrived at by the different adaptive algorithms in the multiplicity of the beamformers resulting from a relatively large degree of freedom due to the number of beams N being much higher than the number of interference sources, the residual interference from M different beamformers may have significant decorrelation among them. Thus a diversity gain can be realized by combining the outputs of the M beamformers using, for example, maximal ratio combining, in addition to the gain that will be realized by the selecting the beamformer with the highest antenna gain.","As the antenna gain of any of the M beamformers is highly non uniform over the coverage area, such a selection or maximal ratio combining performed over the total outputs of the multiplicity M beamformers may not provide the complete benefit of the diversity combining. However, the realization that different users in the coverage area transmit their signals in a multiple access mode such as the frequency division multiple accessing (FDMA) mode, users at different locations in the coverage area can be differentiated on the basis of the frequency bands allocated to them for transmission. Therefore, the invention presents architectures that first channelize different user signals based on their allocated bandwidth in FDMA system or assigned code in the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Accessing) System for each of the M beamformers and then using diversity combining or selection techniques for different users realize a full benefit of the multiple beamformer architecture with diversity combining. Various other embodiments of the architecture of the invention may use various other multiple accessing modes including time division multiple accessing (TDMA) mode and various hybrid modes.","The invention presents algorithms such as the quantized state algorithms with multiple thresholds termed generalized quantized state (GQS) algorithms and transformed state quantized state (TQS) algorithms that may be employed in various embodiments of the invented multibeam antenna architectures. The method for obtaining the input threshold levels and the corresponding quantized state levels in terms of the power levels of the multiplicity N feeds' outputs is presented for increased antenna gain in the close vicinity of the interference sources.","Various embodiment of one of the architectures may comprise of phased array antenna with multiple digital beamformers wherein a single digital beamformers may receive signals from multiple signal sources, transmitting in different frequency bands in a the FDMA mode or using different codes in the CDMA mode, while introducing nulls in the direction of interference sources. In various embodiments of the invention, more than one digital beamformer may receive signal from a common source and a diversity gain may be achieved by combining the signals from multiple digital beamformers. As an example of M equal to 4 digital beamformers with K equal to 4 different desired signal sources transmitting in different bandwidth slots, wherein one of the four digital beamformers may receive signals from \u03ba=3 signal sources with indices (1, 2, 3) with the other three digital beamformers receiving signals from the sources given with indices (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4) and (1, 2, 4) respectively and appropriately combining these signals in the signal combiners may result in achieving triple diversity gain.","An important characteristic of the invented architecture is that the resultant composite MBA beam pattern does not exhibit any spurious nulls in the coverage area when the multiplicity of the beamformers M is sufficient. This is due to the fact that different beamformers employ different adaptive algorithms and thus their spurious nulls may not coincide with the result that any of the users that are not in the immediate vicinity of the interfering sources do not experience antenna gain null and the resulting loss in the availability of the communication link. Furthermore the gain pattern obtained by selecting the maximum of the gain of the M beamformers at each location of the coverage area also may not exhibit any spurious nulls. The absence of spurious nulls makes it possible to precisely locate the sources of interference with the MBA architecture of the invention useful for possible counter measures.","These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent form the detailed description of the invention.","The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best modes contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention. Various modifications, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art, since the generic principles of the present invention have been defined herein specifically to provide systems and methods for adaptive multibeam antenna architectures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1"},"Referring to , the RF signals  v, . . . , vat the output of the N RF feeds  in the focal plane of the MBA reflector, not shown, are inputted to the RF to baseband conversion subsystem  for providing the state vector  x(k) comprised of the digital complex baseband signals to the digital beamformers through M.

The digital beamformers linearly combine the elements x(k), . . . , x(k) of the state vector x(k) in an adaptive manner so as to create antenna beam nulls in the directions of the interference sources. All of the M digital beamformers introduce nulls in the direction of the interference sources, however, they may apply different adaptive algorithms for the nulling process and\/or some of the beamformers may use the same class of algorithms but with different algorithm parameters. Application of different nulling algorithms may result in significantly different MBA gain pattern after the adaptation for the M digital beamformers 1, 2, . . . , M.","Referring to , the outputs  of the digital beamformers z(k), . . . , z(k) are inputted to the signal combiner block  for appropriately combining the signals at the outputs of the M digital beamformers. Referring to , the signals  z(k), . . . , z(k) are inputted to the polyphase analyzer  blocks 1, 2, . . . , M. Polyphase analyzer is a computationally efficient system for filtering\/channelizing the input spectrum into K FFT channels that may correspond to the spectral bands allocated to K different users with the users' signals converted to the complex baseband. In a polyphase channelizer each of the K FFT channel has the same bandwidth. A user with a higher bandwidth requirement may be allocated multiple adjacent frequency slots corresponding to multiple FFT channels.","Referring to , the polyphase channelizer  outputs u, u, . . . , uare inputted to the weighted combiner ; n=1, . . . , K. Each of the M signals u,u, . . . , uat the input to the combiner is a different version of the complex baseband signal of the user n with the difference arising from different MBA antenna gain of the M beamformers in the direction of the user n that results in a different receiver signal to noise plus interference power ratio among the M inputs to the weighted combiner . Due to different weight vectors in the M digital beamformers arising from the fact that the number of degrees of freedom equal to the dimension of the weight vector is much higher than the number of interference sources to be nulled, the residual interference plus noise at the output of the M beamformers may be significantly uncorrelated. This results in the resulting noise plus interference associated with the M inputs to a weighted combiner being significantly uncorrelated. By appropriate combination of the M signal inputs, a significant diversity gain can be achieved in terms of the reduction of the noise plus interference power at the combiner output by employing various diversity combining techniques thereby achieving a higher signal to noise plus interference ratio at the weighted combiner output compared to the signal to noise plus interference ratios at the inputs to the weighted combiner.","In various embodiments of the invention, the weighted combiner may use a switched diversity scheme wherein the combiner selects the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio by assigning a weight 1 to the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio and weight 0 to all of the other (M\u22121) inputs. After the convergence of the adaptive digital beamformers, the residual interference power on all the M beamformer outputs is relatively insignificant compared to the noise power. With the weight vectors in the M beamformers all normalized to unit norm, the noise powers at the outputs of the M beamformers are equal and equal to the variance \u03c3of the noise at the outputs , . . . , N of the IF to baseband converters . Therefore selection of the input with the maximum input signal to interference plus noise ratio form the M inputs to the weighted combiner is equivalent to selecting the input with maximum total signal plus noise power. In case of uncorrelated noise and interference among various signals at the input of the weighted combiner , the signal to noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) at the weighted combiner output may be equal to the sum of the SNIR at the individual inputs to the weighted combiner with the use of maximal ratio combining resulting in very significant diversity gain due to the multiple digital beamformers.","Referring to , the outputs  u, . . . , uof the weighted combiners  are inputted to the respective data demodulator  blocks 1, . . . , K for the demodulation and detection of the various user data providing detected data outputs  {circumflex over (d)}, {circumflex over (d)}, . . . , {circumflex over (d)}. The data demodulator  blocks may also include a low pass filter to eliminate any out of band noise or interference before the demodulation and detection operation.","In various embodiments of the invention that use polyphase channelizer for channelization, any user c allocated \u03ba number of bandwidth slots, the corresponding \u03ba output signals  at the weighted combiner  are selected by the channel selector block . The \u03ba outputs  selected by the channel selector  are inputted to the polyphase synthesizer block  that translates the spectrum of the \u03ba inputs  such that the translated spectrum of the \u03ba inputs  occupy adjacent frequency slots and combines these translated signals to provide the composite baseband signal  uat the output of the polyphase synthesizer block . The composite baseband signal at the output of the polyphase synthesizer block  is inputted to the data demodulator block  for filtering, demodulation and detection providing the detected data  {circumflex over (d)}for the user n that has allocation of multiple \u03ba frequency slots at the output of block . In various embodiments of the invention there may be multiple number of users allocated with different number of frequency slots wherein the composite baseband signal for each such user is generated and detected with the use of channel selector, polyphase synthesizer block and the data demodulator block as in the generation of data {circumflex over (d)}for the user c allocated with \u03ba frequency slots.","The multiplicity \u03ba channels allocated to a single user c all have the same physical location and thus the weighted combiner weight vectors of the corresponding \u03ba weighted combiners  may be the selected to be equal and therefore, splitting the spectrum of user c by the polyphase analyzer  into \u03ba channels and combing the corresponding \u03ba outputs form the weighted combiner  output  may not result in any discontinuity due to different signal gain experienced by different components of the split spectrum of the composite user c. Furthermore any impact due to the filtering operations in the polyphase analyzer  and synthesizer  in terms of introduction of any possible discontinuity in the spectrum at the boundaries of the adjacent \u03ba multiple channels in the composite signal  ucan be eliminated by the use of generalized polyphase channelizer taught by Kumar in \u201cGeneralized Polyphase Channelization System, U.S. Pat.

In various other embodiments of the invention, various methods other than the polyphase analyzer method may be used for the channelization operation wherein in some of these methods, the bandwidth allocated to different users may be different. However, the alternative channelization methods may also have a higher computational requirement then the polyphase analyzer\/synthesizer method. Non limiting examples of such alternative methods are the frequency domain filtering method, analytical signal method, multistage and hybrid techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["75","70","205","70","205","210","220","230","240","210","250","80","70","80","230"],"i":["m ","a","m ","m "],"sub":["1","2","N","1","2","N","1","2","N","1","2","N","1","2","N"],"sup":["m","m","m","m","m","m","m","m "]},"The adaptive algorithm of block  in  may select the weight vector w=[ww. . . w], with T denoting transpose, so as to minimize the power Jat the combiner  output according to\n\nMin ()|()()]\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nSubject to 1\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nIn (1) E denotes the expected value operator, superscript H denotes the conjugate transpose operation and x=[xx. . . x], and in (2) ddenotes the steering vector.

In the FDMA system, the users at different locations have different frequency band allocations due to the intrinsic characteristics of the FDMA system, therefore selection of the input with the highest antenna gain at the user location is achieved by selecting the input with the maximum signal power from the \u03bainputs to the weighted combiner. Such a selection also maximizes the output signal to noise ratio if the noise power at the various inputs to the weighted combiner is equal.","After the adaptive algorithms in the digital beamformers  1 through M have achieved convergence, the residual interference due to any jammers may be relatively insignificant compared to the beamformer output noise due to the spatially uncorrelated noise at the outputs of the RF BPF\/AMP blocks  1 through N of .

As the various adaptive algorithms used in the digital beamformers  normalize the norm of the vector wto 1, the noise variance \u03c3at the outputs of the beamformers - through M are all equal to \u03c3. Furthermore, the variance of the noise in any specific frequency band is also equal among the outputs of the digital beamformers resulting in equal noise variance among all the inputs inputted to any one of the K weighted combiners . Thus selection of the input with maximum signal to noise ratio in the weighted combiner  is accomplished by selecting the input with the maximum signal plus noise power that may be estimated from the samples of the signals u.","In one of the various embodiments of the invention, the weight \u03c8in (35) with the index mcorresponding to the maximum total signal plus noise power among the M inputs to the weighted combiner -is set equal to 0 with the remaining weights set equal to 0.
