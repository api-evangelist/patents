No. 13\/182,313, filed Jul. 13, 2011 and entitled \u201cAPPARATUSES AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING MULTI-STANDBY MODE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS USING SINGLE SUBSCRIBER IDENTITY CARD WITH MULTIPLE SUBSCRIBER NUMBERS\u201d, the entirety of which are incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to management of multiple subscriber numbers in a single subscriber identity card, and more particularly, to apparatuses and methods for providing a multi-standby mode of wireless communications using a single subscriber identity card with multiple subscriber numbers.","2. Description of the Related Art","With growing demand for ubiquitous computing and networking, various wireless communication technologies have been developed, such as the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) technology, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) technology, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology, Code Division Multiple Access 2000 (CDMA 2000) technology, Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) technology, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) technology, Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, Time-Division LTE (TD-LTE) technology, and others. Generally, a cellular phone only supports one wireless communication technology and provides the user the flexibility of mobile communications at all times via the supported wireless communication technology, regardless of his\/her geographic location. Especially in today's business world, a cellular phone is becoming a necessary business tool for conducting business conveniently. For business people, having an additional cellular phone exclusive for business matters is a common choice, since they need to conduct business while out of the office or even out of the city\/country. Others may find having an additional cellular phone is a good way to save\/control the budget for wireless service charges (including phone services and\/or data services). However, having two or more than two cellular phones may be troublesome when one has to switch frequently between the cellular phones and carry around all the cellular phones with himself\/herself.","In order to provide a convenient way of having multiple subscriber numbers, dual-card cellular phones have been developed, which generally have two wireless communication modules for respectively performing wireless transmission and reception with an individual subscriber number. Alternatively, the design of a single subscriber identity card having a plurality of subscriber numbers has also been developed for a single-card cellular phones to retrieve the subscriber numbers in the single subscriber identity card and to be able to perform the wireless transmission and reception using different subscriber numbers. Note that, a single-card cellular phone, which supports a single subscriber identity card having a plurality of subscriber numbers, may only activate one subscriber number at a time via the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Application Toolkit (SAT). That is, only a single standby mode of wireless communications may be provided in the single-card cellular phone with the activated subscriber number. If the user decides to use wireless services with another subscriber number, he\/she may have to manually switch the activated subscriber number to the desired one via the SAT. As a result, Mobile-Terminated (MT) calls associated with the inactivated subscriber numbers will be missed and inconveniences may occur.","Accordingly, embodiments of the invention provide apparatuses and methods for providing a multi-standby mode of wireless communications using a single subscriber identity card with multiple subscriber numbers. In one aspect of the invention, a communication device comprising a processing unit is provided. The processing unit reads a plurality of elementary files from a single subscriber identity card for each of a plurality of subscriber numbers when power-on, and registers to a network for each of the subscriber numbers according to the read elementary files. Also, the processing unit enables a multi-standby mode of wireless communications in response to successful registration to the network for at least two of the subscriber numbers.","In another aspect of the invention, a method for providing a multi-standby mode, executed by a micro-processing unit (MPU) of a Baseband chip, is provided. The method comprises the steps of reading a plurality of elementary files from a single subscriber identity card for each of a plurality of subscriber numbers when power-on, registering to a network for each of the subscriber numbers according to the read elementary files, and enabling a multi-standby mode of wireless communications in response to successful registration to the network for at least two of the subscriber numbers.","In one aspect of the invention, a communication device comprising a processing unit is provided. The processing unit enables a multi-standby mode of wireless communications with a single subscriber identity card comprising a plurality of subscriber numbers, and polls a plurality of SIM instances in the subscriber identity card respectively corresponding to the subscriber numbers. Also, the processing unit determines whether there is any command waiting to be processed for each of the polled SIM instances, and if so, processes at least one determined command from the polled SIM instances.","In another aspect of the invention, a method for polling a single subscriber identity card comprising a plurality of subscriber numbers, executed by an MPU of a Baseband chip, is provided. The method comprises the steps of enabling a multi-standby mode of wireless communications with a subscriber identity card comprising a plurality of subscriber numbers, polling a plurality of SIM instances in the subscriber identity card respectively corresponding to the subscriber numbers, determining whether there is any command waiting to be processed corresponding to each of the polled SIM instances, and if so, processing at least one determined command from the polled SIM instances.","In one aspect of the invention, a communication device comprising a processing unit is provided. The processing unit enables a connected mode of wireless communications with one of a plurality of subscriber numbers in a single subscriber identity card, and polls a plurality of SIM instances in the subscriber identity card respectively corresponding to the subscriber numbers. Also, the processing unit determines whether the subscriber identity card remains detected and whether there is any command waiting to be processed for each of the polled SIM instances, and if so, processes at least one determined command from the polled SIM instances.","In another aspect of the invention, a method for polling a single subscriber identity card, executed by an MPU of a Baseband chip, is provided. The method comprises the steps of enabling a connected mode of wireless communications with one of a plurality of subscriber numbers, polling a plurality of SIM instances in the subscriber identity card respectively corresponding to the subscriber numbers, determining whether the subscriber identity card remains detected and whether there is any command waiting to be processed for each of the polled SIM instances, and if so, processing at least one determined command from the polled SIM instances.","In one aspect of the invention, a communication device comprising a processing unit is provided. The processing unit determines whether at least one elementary file in a single subscriber identity card is required to be read out. If so, the processing unit further activates one SIM instance in the subscriber identity card for the elementary file, and reads the elementary file from the subscriber identity card.","In another aspect of the invention, a method for accessing data in a single subscriber identity card, executed by an MPU of a Baseband chip, is provided. The method comprises the steps of determining whether at least one elementary file in the subscriber identity card is required to be read out, and if so, activating one SIM instance in the subscriber identity card for the elementary file, and reading the elementary file from the subscriber identity card.","Other aspects and features of the present invention will become apparent to those with ordinarily skill in the art upon review of the following descriptions of specific embodiments of the apparatus and methods for providing a multi-standby mode of wireless communications using a single subscriber identity card with multiple subscriber numbers.","The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. It should be understood that the embodiments may be realized in software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof.","A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card typically contains user account information, an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and a set of SIM Application Toolkit (SAT) commands, and provides storage space for phone book contacts. A Micro-Controlling Unit (MCU) or Micro-Processing Unit (MPU) of the Baseband chip (referred to as a Baseband MPU hereinafter) may interact with a MPU of a SIM card (referred to as a SIM MPU hereinafter) to fetch data or SAT commands from the plugged in SIM card. A communication device is immediately programmed after plugging in the SIM card. SIM cards may also be programmed to display custom menus for personalized services.","A Universal SIM (USIM) card is plugged into a communication device for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (also called 3G) telephony communications. The USIM card stores user account information, an IMSI, authentication information and a set of USIM Application Toolkit (USAT) commands, and provides space for storing text messages and phone book contacts. A Baseband MPU may interact with an MCU of the USIM card (each referred to as a USIM MCU hereinafter) to fetch data or SAT commands from the plugged in USIM cards. The phone book on the USIM card is greatly enhanced when compared to the SIM card. For authentication purposes, the USIM card may store a long-term preshared secret key K, which is shared with the Authentication Center (AuC) in the network. The USIM MCU may verify a sequence number that must be within a range using a window mechanism to avoid replay attacks, and is in charge of generating the session keys CK and IK to be used in the confidentiality and integrity algorithms of the KASUMI (also termed A5\/3) block cipher in the UMTS systems. A communication device is immediately programmed after plugging in the USIM card.","A Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) or a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Subscriber Identity Module (CSIM) card has been developed for a CDMA communication device and is equivalent to the GSM SIM and 3G USIM except that it is capable of working in CDMA networks. The R-UIM or the CSIM card is physically compatible with the GSM SIM card, and provides similar security mechanisms for the CDMA system.","A SIM Application Toolkit (SAT) is a standard of the GSM which enables an SIM MCU to initiate actions which can be used for various value-added services. The SAT consists of a set of commands programmed into a SIM card which define how the SIM MCU interacts directly with the outside world and initiates commands independently of the communication device and the network. The SAT enables the SIM MCU to build up an interactive exchange between a network application and an end user, and to access or control access to the network. The SIM MCU also provides SAT commands to the Baseband MPU to display a menu, ask for user input, or the similar. An SAT has been deployed by many network operators for many applications, often where a menu-based approach is required, such as mobile banking, content browsing, and switching between multiple subscriber numbers in a single subscriber identity card, etc. Designed as a single application environment, an SAT can be started at the initial power up of the SIM card and is especially suited to low level applications with simple user interfaces.","A USIM Application Toolkit (USAT) is the equivalent of an SAT for 3G networks. A USAT enables the USIM MCU to initiate actions which can be used for various value-added services delivered over the communication device. The USAT is employed in a multi-application environment of 3G devices and is not activated until a specific application has been selected, unlike SAT, which is activated at startup. Particularly, certain functions are card related rather than application related.","SAT and USAT proactive commands may be grouped into two categories: RF-dependent; and RF-independent. RF-dependent SAT\/USAT proactive commands, when executed by the Baseband MPU, request for RF resources (i.e. an RF module), while RF-independent SAT\/USAT proactive commands do not request for RF resources.","Exemplary RF-dependent SAT\/USAT proactive commands are listed below.\n\n","Exemplary RF-independent SAT\/USAT proactive commands are listed below.\n\n","The SAT\/USAT provides mechanisms which allow applications that are presented in a subscriber identity card to interact and operate with a communication device which supports the specific mechanism(s) required by the applications. Specifically, referring to , applications in a form of an SAT\/USAT applet, when executed by a MCU of a subscriber identity card, requests the communication device (i.e. Baseband MPU\/processor) to perform a particular task such as playing a tone, displaying text or menu on a screen, getting a user input, setting up a call, or others, by employing SAT\/USAT application programming interfaces (API), also referred to as the mentioned SAT\/USAT proactive commands. The subscriber identity card may be the mentioned SIM, USIM, R-UIM or CSIM card.","Referring to , the Baseband MPU operates as a master and initiates commands to the MPU of the subscriber identity card. Note that SIM\/USIM procedures may end in \u201890 00\u2019 (indicating normal ending to the initiated command), or may end in \u201891 XX\u2019 (indicating response data available from a subscriber identity card). The response code \u201891 XX\u2019 may also inform the Baseband MPU that the previous command has been successfully executed by the MPU of the subscriber identity card in the same way as \u201890 00\u2019 (i.e. \u201cOK\u201d), as well as, indicate response data which contains an SAT\/USAT proactive command from the MPU of the subscriber identity card for a particular procedure. The value \u2018XX\u2019 indicates the length of the response data. After that, the Baseband MPU uses the FETCH command to obtain the response data indicating a particular SAT\/USAT proactive command. If the indicated command has been successfully executed, the Baseband MPU informs the MPU of the subscriber identity card with \u201cTERMINAL RESPONSE\u201d. If the indicated command is not successfully executed, the Baseband MPU informs the MPU of the subscriber identity card with \u201cTERMINAL RESPONSE\u201d with an error condition.","For a subscriber identity card having multiple subscriber numbers, a data format of a SIM instance may be deployed for independently storing the data concerning a respective subscriber number, as shown in , or a shared data format for all SIM instances may be deployed for jointly storing the data concerning the multiple subscriber numbers, as shown in . Alternatively, a partly-independent data format of one SIM instance may be deployed for storing the data concerning a respective subscriber number, in which most EFs are jointly used for storing the data concerning the subscriber numbers and only some other EFs are independently used for storing the data concerning respective subscriber numbers, as shown in . Taking a single subscriber identity card having 4 subscriber numbers for example, if the data format as shown in  is employed, independent SIM instances are presented as four trees for storing the data concerning the 4 subscriber numbers, respectively; or if the data format as shown in  is employed, only a macro SIM instance is presented as one tree for storing the data concerning the 4 subscriber numbers, and data for 4 subscriber numbers is integrated into relevant nodes; or if the data format as shown in  is employed, 4 partly-independent SIM instances are presented for storing the unique data concerning the 4 subscriber numbers, such as data branching from the DFbeing distinct from one SIM instance to another, and the EFs within the dotted rectangle are shared by all 4 SIM instances. In one embodiment, the amount of subscriber numbers in a subscriber identity card may be determined via a service menu provided by a SAT\/USAT applet in the subscriber identity card, as shown in . In another embodiment, with the data formats in , the amount of subscriber numbers in a subscriber identity card may be determined according to the quantity of SIM instances therein, or in the data format in , a proprietary EF may be used for storing the information of the amount of subscriber numbers in the subscriber identity card as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0088"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Identifier: \u20186F01\u2019","Structure: transparent","Optional"]},{"entry":["File size: 1 byte","Update activity: low",{}]},{"entry":["Access Conditions:",{},{}]},{"entry":["READ","CHV 1",{}]},{"entry":["UPDATE","ADM",{}]},{"entry":["INVALIDATE","ADM",{}]},{"entry":["REHABILITATE","ADM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Bytes","Description","M\/O","Length"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1","Number of SIM instances","M","1 byte"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","110","130","140","150","120","120","121","110","130","140","150","120","110","120","120","110","110","100","120","150","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","620","630","630"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["710","720","730","740","750","760","770","150","750","770"]},"For the refresh procedure described in , some exemplary EFs to be read from a SIM card are listed below.\n\n","For the refresh procedure described in , some exemplary EFs to be read from a USIM card are listed below.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0118"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A and 8B","FIGS. 8A and 8B"],"b":["801","802","803","804","805","806","807"]},"After that, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device transmits to the subscriber identity card an AUTHENTICATION CHALLENGE message containing the random part RAND and the authentication part AUTN (step S). With the random part RAND and the authentication part AUTN, the MPU of the subscriber identity card runs the authentication algorithm associated with the first SIM instance and generates an authentication vector which includes authentication parameters such as XMAC, RES, CK, and IK (step S). Specifically, the authentication algorithm is a combination of the f, f, f, f, and f algorithm defined in the release 10 of the 3GPP TS 35.205 and 35.206 specifications, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 35.205 and 35.206 specifications). The subscriber identity card then replies to the communication device with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the generated authentication vector (step S). Then, the communication device transmits to the network another AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the authentication parameter RES (step S). When receiving the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network further transmits a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the communication device (step S), to start the integrity protection of the subsequent messages. Upon receiving the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device runs the integrity algorithm f defined in the release 10 of the 3GPP TS 35.201 and 35.202 specifications, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 35.201 and 35.202 specifications) to calculate a 32-bit message authentication code MAC-I (step S). After the calculation of the message authentication code MAC-I, the communication device replies to the network with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message containing the message authentication code MAC-I (step S). The network determines whether the message authentication code MAC-I is authenticated and decides to accept the registration of the communication device when the MAC-I is successfully authenticated. Upon accepting the registration of the communication device, the network further transmits a TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message to re-allocate the TMSI to the communication device (step S), and transmits a LOCATION UPDATE ACCEPT message to the communication device (step S). The communication device replies to the network with a TMSI REALLOCATION ACKNOWLEDGE message for acknowledging the reception of the TMSI REALLOCATION COMMAND message (step S). The registration to the network according to the first SIM instance ends with the communication device receiving the LOCATION UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the network selection procedure may be repeated for the next SIM instance in the subscriber identity card, until registrations to the networks according to each of the SIM instances in the subscriber identity card have been completed. Thus, the communication device simultaneously camps on multiple cells provided by the same or different networks, i.e., the communication device operates in a multi-standby mode using the multiple subscriber numbers in the subscriber identity card. Note that, the steps S to S may be omitted for the cases where the authentication algorithms respectively associated with the SIM instances in the subscriber identity card are the same or the authentication algorithms associated with the last activated SIM instance and the currently activated SIM instance are the same. Other detailed descriptions of the network selection procedure are omitted herein since they are beyond the scope of the invention, and references may be made to the release 10 of the 3GPP TS 23.122 specification, v.10.3.0 (referred to herein as the TS 23.122 specification), release 10 of the 3GPP TS 43.022 specification, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 43.022 specification), release 10 of the 3GPP TS 25.304 specification, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 25.304 specification), and release 10 of the 3GPP TS 36.304 specification, v.10.1.0 (referred to herein as the TS 36.304 specification).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0120"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIGS. 9A and 9B"],"b":["901","902","903","904","905","906","907"]},"After that, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device transmits to the subscriber identity card an AUTHENTICATION CHALLENGE message containing the random part RAND (step S). With the random part RAND, the MPU of the subscriber identity card runs the authentication algorithm associated with the first SIM instance and generates an authentication vector which includes authentication parameters such as Kc and SRES (step S). Specifically, the authentication algorithm is a combination of the A3 and A8 algorithm defined in the release 10 of the 3GPP TS 55.205 specification, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 55.205 specification). The subscriber identity card then replies to the communication device with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the generated authentication vector (step S). Then, the communication device transmits to the network another AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the authentication parameter SRES (step S). When receiving the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network further transmits a CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message to the communication device (step S), to start the ciphering for subsequent messages. Upon receiving the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device runs the ciphering algorithm A5 defined in the release 10 of the 3GPP TS 55.216 specifications, v.10.0.0 (referred to herein as the TS 55.216 specification) to cipher the CIPHERING MODE COMMAND message and generate a ciphered message Kc(M) (step S). After the generation of the ciphered message Kc(M), the communication device replies to the network with a CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message containing the ciphered message Kc(M) (step S). The network determines whether the ciphered message Kc(M) is authenticated and decides to accept the registration of the communication device when the Kc(M) is successfully authenticated.

In this embodiment, the SIM instance update procedure is triggered during a network selection procedure in which the EFis required. As shown in , the SIM instance update procedure starts by the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device to transmit a SAT\/USAT proactive command to request the subscriber identity card to switch the activated SIM instance to the first SIM instance (step S). When receiving the SAT\/USAT proactive command, the MPU of the subscriber identity card replies to the communication device with a response code \u201891 XX\u2019 which indicates availability of a response data to be fetched (step S). Next, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device transmits a FETCH command to obtain the response data (step S). When receiving the response data, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device determines that the response data indicates a REFRESH command (step S). After that, the MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device requests to read the EFfrom the subscriber identity card (step S) and then receives the EFfrom the subscriber identity card (step S). The MPU of the Baseband chip in the communication device then stores the read EF in a local storage unit (step S). Alternatively, the EFs of one or more SIM instances may be read from the subscriber identity card and stored in the local storage unit at power on of the communication device, and the EFs of other SIM instances may be read later from the subscriber identity card when required, and the invention is not limited thereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0134"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 19"],"sub":["LOCI ","LOCI ","LOCI ","LOCI "],"b":["1901","1902","1903","1904","1905","1906","1907","1905","1906","1907"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0135"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["2010","2020","2020","2030"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 6","FIG. 11"],"b":["2110","2120","2130","2140","2150","2160","2170","2180","2190","2120","2190"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 21","FIG. 21"],"b":["2250","2260","2270","2180"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0138"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 21"],"b":["2350","2360","2370"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0139"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 6","FIG. 11"],"b":["2410","2420","2430","2440","2450","2460","2440","2470","2480","2490","2470"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0140"},"figref":["FIGS. 25A and 25B","FIG. 24"],"b":["2503","2504","2507","2509","2511","2507","2508","2510"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0141"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 25"],"b":["2608","2609","2508"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 27"],"b":["2710","2710","2720","2730","2740","2730","2740","2730","2740","2750","2760","2750","2760"],"sub":["LOCI","ACC"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0143"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 28"],"b":["2810","2810","2820","2830","2840","2830","2840","2830","2840","2850","2860","2850","2860"],"sub":"LOCI"},"While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto.
