title: Seal integrity detection system
abstract: A seal integrity verification system scans for changes in impedance in a seal with integral coaxial waveguide, twisted pair wires, parallel ribbon wires or parallel wires. The wires are monitored by a TDR to note changes in impedance. The changes indicate the location where the seal is not under proper compression to ensure a tight fit. This is especially useful in verifying that watertight doors on ships or submarines are sealing properly when shut.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The integrity of seals is often a critical element in the operation of various items. Nowhere is this truer than in doors, especially watertight doors, on ships. Watertight doors and hatches are critical to controlling flooding on ships and submarines. These doors often handle large amounts of traffic, cycling the doors open and shut several thousand times a week, causing the seal integrity to fade. Such doors often require extensive adjustments and maintenance in order to maintain a fluid tight closure. The twisting and flexing that occurs on ships cause doors to warp or bend resulting in loss of seal integrity. Other than periodic spot checks, there is currently no way to check the seal integrity on a continuous basis.","The current way to check seal integrity of watertight doors is to perform a chalk test. The chalk test is a simple means of determining if the gasket is in continuous contact with the knife-edge of the doorframe when the door is closed. Chalk is rubbed on the knife-edge of the doorframe and the door is shut and dogged tight. The door is then opened and the chalk line on the seal should be continuous if the door is adjusted properly. A non-continuous chalk line on the gasket indicates that the dogs are not pressing the gasket against the knife-edge properly. However, the chalk test does not guarantee that the door is watertight, as it does not measure seal compression.","Chalk tests are preformed on a periodic basis as it is a labor intensive test. Doors and doorframes, especially the knife-edges, are subject to wear and tear with repeated use. Additionally, the frames and surrounding structures are often subject to stresses that may warp or bend the frames or surrounding structure. This may mean that even though the chalk test was successful, subsequent damage to the door or frame might occur that causes a bad fit that will not be discovered until the next chalk test.","Another method used to check seal integrity uses acoustic transducers. In this test, transducers are placed on one side of a closed door to produce acoustic energy and the quality of the seal is surmised based on the amount of acoustic energy received. However, such a method is labor intensive and does not provide continuous feedback.","What is needed is an apparatus that can quickly and continuously determine if the seal is engaged adequately on a closed door.","In the present invention there is provided a first insulated conductive waveguide and a second conductive waveguide threaded through a seal. A time domain reflectometer (TDR) is connected the waveguides, whereby reflected pulses are detected indicating an area where the seal is not compressed adequately.","In accordance with the present invention a seal integrity checking system includes a first insulated conductive waveguide and a second insulated conductive waveguide inside a seal or gasket. A pulse generator may be operatively connected to the first and second waveguides and a pulse detector may be operatively connected to the first and second waveguides to detect reflected pulses that indicate an area where the seal is not compressed adequately.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention there is provided a seal integrity checking system that includes a gasket disposed around the periphery of a door that has a first insulated conductive waveguide embedded in the gasket and a second insulated conductive waveguide embedded in the gasket. The waveguides are separated by a dielectric and a pulse generator is operatively connected to the first and second waveguides. A pulse detector is operatively connected to the first and second waveguides so that the reflected pulses are detected and indicate an area where the seal is not compressed adequately","For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims.","Referring now to the example of , a door seal integrity verification system in accordance with the present invention is illustrated diagrammatically. The door  shown in the figure is an example of a watertight door on a ship. The watertight closure includes a movable door  on hinges  that is attached to the bulkhead  by a doorframe . The door  includes a latching mechanism that includes a door latching handle  and numerous dogs  that operate through linkages  to latch the door  and form a watertight seal by compressing gasket . The door  is only watertight if the gasket  is compressed properly between the door  and the doorframe . The time domain reflectometry (TDR)  interrogates an embedded waveguide to verify adequate compression of the seal .","TDR works by transmitting a pulse of energy down a transmission wire or cable and then the TDR instrument measures reflected pulses that indicate either the end of the transmission line or a fault somewhere along the line. A TDR instrument sends high frequency electrical impulse signals down the line and samples the reflected energy utilizing a pulse generator and a pulse detector. Impedance changes in the line will cause a reflection of some of the energy back toward the TDR and the instrument registers the reflections. The TDR works with transmission lines that include two metallic waveguides or conductors close together and are separated by a dielectric. The TDR may be used with parallel-insulated wires, parallel ribbon cable or a coaxial wire. This technique for using TDRs and interpreting measurements are generally well known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["10","12","10","14","13","12","22","15","22","24","30","10","22","24","24","30","22","24","22","10","22","10","10","10","22","10","22","24","24","10","12","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["10","12","22","15","10","22","24","10","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["22","24","26","25","30","10","30","26","24","100"]},"While there have been described what are believed to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it is intended to claim all such changes and modifications that fall within the true scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
