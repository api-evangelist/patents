indicate in a 14\u00d714 array with analog phase shifters PN, PNthe directivity of any odd-order intermodulation beam can be degraded by about 35 dB at a cost of fundamental beam degradation of less than 0.25 dB. Notably, using present day technology, digital phase shifter performance can be expected to fall short of that of analog devices owing to introduction of analog\/digital conversion quantization errors.","In some embodiments, a collection of directivity patterns P are stored in a memory device such as a semiconductor or disc drive memory device.

Among other things, pre-calculation and storage saves time and reduces processor requirements.
