{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Digital images (e.g., photos, videos, graphics, etc.) are often displayed on a monitor attached to a computing device (e.g., wired, wirelessly, integrated with). Conventionally, an image can be rasterized to a raster image comprising pixels corresponding to physical structures of the monitor upon which the image is to be displayed, and where respective pixels comprise color elements (e.g., red, green, blue (RGB)). The color elements of the pixels can comprise a display value describing how much of a particular color element is to be displayed. For example, increasing or decreasing a color element value can change the overall perceived color of the corresponding pixel (e.g., by perceptual blurring of the color elements, as perceived by humans, such as where red may be increased relative to green and blue to create burgundy, for example). Further, a filter can be applied to an input image to define the display view of the image. As an example, a filter can comprise elements corresponding to the respective pixels of the image, and the elements of the filter can further comprise values that adjust the color elements of one or more pixels up or down, thereby altering perception (e.g., color and\/or resolution) of a corresponding image.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Display monitors, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, and others, are conventionally regarded as comprising pixels. However, as provided herein, the application of image rendering filters is extended to monitors where the notion of pixel may be not well defined. That is, whereas prior image rendering filters were based upon defining RGB values of pixels, an image rendering filter as provided herein may instead be based upon defining values of color elements of a monitor. For example, as provided herein, a display monitor may be regarded as comprising repetitive patterns (e.g., areas of various geometries) of singly-colored color elements (e.g., sub-pixels). An image rendering filter as provided herein effectively defines intensities (values) of color elements in a manner such that a rendered image appears in a desired manner when displayed on a monitor. It may be appreciated that by treating the sub-pixels as separate units (e.g., detached from the notion of pixels), it may be possible to increase an effective resolution of a monitor.","Further, a viewer of a display monitor generally has particular characteristics that provide for \u201cperceptual error\u201d when viewing an image on the display monitor. That is, for example, a first type of viewer having a first set of viewing characteristics (e.g., normal versus distorted eye sight characteristics, human versus computer, etc.) may have different perceptual error than a second viewer having a second set of viewing characteristics. As an example, an \u201cideal\u201d image (e.g., having a desired view for a particular viewer viewing on a particular monitor) may be displayed on a monitor by accounting for the monitors particular characteristics and accounting for the viewer's particular characteristics as provided herein. This same image may not be ideal, however, for a different viewer\/user having different particular viewer characteristics and\/or for the image displayed on a different monitor.","It may be appreciated that an \u201cideal\u201d image may be regarded in the art as the image that is input for processing (e.g., prior to being filtered and\/or otherwise adjusted, etc.). However, as used herein \u201cideal\u201d image and\/or the like does not refer to a pre-processed or an input image, but instead refers to a resulting (e.g., rendered) image after processing such that it appears or is displayed to a particular viewer viewing on a particular monitor in a desired manner (e.g., similar to the input image, but when subsequently viewed by the particular viewer viewing on the particular monitor after being rendered). It may be appreciated that an input image may or may not be obtained from the same monitor upon which the \u201cideal\u201d rendered image is displayed. For example, an input image may be obtained from some other media possibly with higher resolution or different characteristics (e.g., paper, infinite-resolution image of a letter, different monitor, etc.). As provided herein, the monitor for a particular viewer. input image is reproduced in a desired (e.g., ideal) manner on a particular","Previously, image rendering filters were created for text rendering on a display, where general filters were numerically calculated for particular types of monitors, and an instance of a perceptual filter was incorporated. However, such a technique used merely one sample per physical sub-pixel of a monitor and disregarded actual geometry of physical sub-pixels, thus limiting precision of the filter calculation. Further, the calculation was based on a limited number of samplings in a spatial domain, which reduces precision of the filter and leads to large numbers of calculations. Additionally, one filter type was generally applied for different types of monitors, yielding less than desired results (e.g., non-customized results).","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed where characteristics of a display monitor are accounted for, such as the geometric arrangement, for example, of color elements of one or more portions or areas of the monitor (e.g., blocks of sub-pixels), and characteristics of the viewer are accounted for to create an image rendering filter to be applied to an image. Because the image rendering filter can be calculated using the particular display characteristics of the intended monitor and the viewing characteristics of the intended viewer, when applied to the image, the resulting filtered image comprise a desired view (e.g., ideal image). For example, a geometric arrangement of color elements for the monitor, along with spectral power distributions (SPDs) (e.g., and\/or components of SPDs) of the color elements can be combined with perceptual filtering\/perceptual transformation of the viewer to produce the \u201cideal\u201d image rendering filter (e.g., for that viewer using the monitor).","In one embodiment of creating an image rendering filter that can be used to produce a desired view of an image, one or more monitor characteristics of a monitor displaying the image are received. Further, one or more viewing characteristics for a viewer of the image are received. Additionally, the image rendering filter can be created based upon at least the received one or more monitor characteristics and the one or more viewing characteristics.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","As provided herein, a method may be devised that provides for finding an image rendering filter that can be applied to an image, resulting in an \u201cideal\u201d image reproduced on a particular monitor for a particular viewer. That is, for example, different monitors can have different display characteristics, and different viewers can have different viewing characteristics. In this example, the particular display characteristics and the particular viewing characteristics can be accounted for when creating the image rendering filter, such that a resulting image may be an \u201cideal\u201d rendering for the viewer of the image on the monitor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108"]},"Having created the image rendering filter, the exemplary method  ends at .","It may be appreciated that a monitor can comprise a plurality of color elements or sub-pixels. A color element may represent a color component (e.g., red, green, blue (RGB)), and respective color elements can have a different level of intensity (e.g., how brightly the color is displayed), which can affect how an image may be perceived by a viewer. For example, a first sub-pixel or color element may be predominantly responsible for displaying the color red, a second sub-pixel or color element may be predominantly responsible for displaying the color blue and a third sub-pixel or color element may be predominantly responsible for displaying the color green. Further, different types of monitors can have different geometric arrangements of color elements, for example, where a group of color elements may not be easily defined as a \u201cpixel,\u201d and may thus instead be regarded as a block or group of sub-pixels to describe a corresponding area of a monitor. Additionally, respective sub-pixels comprise spectral power distributions (SPD) (e.g., and\/or components of SPDs), which describe, among other things, color characteristics, properties, etc. for the respective sub-pixels (e.g., how much light or power is emitted by respective sub-pixels at different color wavelengths). It may be appreciated that sub-pixel and\/or the like as used herein may generally be regarded as one or more color elements.","As an illustrative example, an image rendering filter for producing an image on a monitor can be expressed in terms of geometric functions of a basic set of color elements of the monitor (e.g., where respective spectral power distributions (SPDs), or components thereof, for different color elements may be expressed in terms of perceptual opponent channels) and a generalized perceptual transformation (e.g., that can take into account a viewer's perceptual blurring in the opponent channels). For example, a monitor related image rendering filter may be created for a particular monitor that accounts for the monitors color element arrangement, where SPDs (e.g., and\/or components of SPDs) of the color elements, which may be applied to an input image to produce a rendered image that may be desired for that particular monitor. However, the viewer's perception of the image may not be accounted for in this type of monitor related image rendering filter. Accordingly, as provided herein, characteristics of the viewer (e.g., human, camera, etc.) can be considered as well to create an image rendering filter that yields an \u201cideal\u201d image given both the characteristics of the particular monitor and the characteristics of the particular viewer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202"]},"In one embodiment, the monitor specifications and\/or characteristics can comprise color element (e.g., sub-pixel) characteristics and\/or geometric characteristics of at least a portion or area of the monitor (e.g., repetitive block of color elements of the monitor, etc.). Monitor characteristics can comprise, for example, how many color elements are present per area of the monitor and\/or one or more colors indicated by respective color elements. Further, the monitor characteristics can comprise how blocks of the monitor and\/or color elements (e.g., sub-pixels) are arranged, for example, and\/or an intensity (e.g., maximal intensity) of light emitted by respective color elements at respective spatial locations.","For example, at  in the example embodiment , a geometry, geometric characteristic, geometric arrangement, etc. of the sub-pixels (e.g., color elements) of the monitor can be identified. In one embodiment, this may describe an arrangement of the color elements in the monitor relative to one another, such as in a repetitive block of color elements and\/or selected area of the monitor. For example, a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor may comprise substantially circular sub-pixels that are arranged in a geometric pattern usually repeating every two triplets (e.g., pixels). An LCD may comprise substantially rectangular sub-pixels that are arranged in a geometric pattern usually repeating every triplet (e.g., pixel). Other monitors can comprise arrangements where the sub-pixels are aligned in a hexagon pattern, a diagonal pattern, and\/or where the sub-pixels comprise different shapes (e.g., circles, squares, etc.) and\/or arrangements (e.g., relative to one another).","At , one or more portions or components of spectral power distributions (SPDs) for one or more color elements of the monitor can be identified from the monitor characteristics. In one embodiment, a representation of a color element in opponent channels can, for example, be an identified component of an SPD for a color element. An opponent channel may be regarded as being related to a color opponent process of the human visual system. Humans (e.g., and some other animals) perceive color using cones in the retina, which respond to different ranges of wavelengths of light that overlap each other. In the color opponent process there are three opponent channels: red versus green, blue versus yellow, and black versus white (or luminance).","As an example, different monitors may provide different SPD values for their color elements, which can be determined from respective monitor characteristics. An SPD for a sub-pixel or color element of a monitor can thus have one or more components, where an SPD component may, for example, be described as an intensity or amount of illumination that is provided at a particular wavelength of light (color) (e.g., how bright red may be). For example, SPD components of an incandescent light bulb often comprise higher wavelength values in the red and yellow wavelength ranges, whereas fluorescent light bulbs often have higher wavelength values in the blue and green wavelength ranges. Further, in this example, various types of monitors may have different SPD values (e.g., and\/or values for SPD components) for respective color elements (e.g., depending on type of material used, light source, power source, etc.).","In one aspect, the geometric arrangement of the color elements and\/or the SPD component values of the color elements in the opponent channels can affect how colors are perceived by a viewer. As an example, neighboring color element colors typically appear as a single color due to optic blurring and spatial integration because the color elements are close to one another and relatively small as compared to the viewing distance (e.g., distance from the viewer to the color elements). Further, as an example, the intensity of a particular wavelength of light may alter a perceived color produced by neighboring color elements (e.g., having a brighter yellow sub-pixel may change a perception of a neighboring red sub-pixel from red to orange). Therefore, in this aspect, for example, how respective color elements are arranged relative to one another and\/or how intense a particular color may be displayed can alter the perceived color of (at least a portion of) an image, as well as a sharpness and\/or contrast of (at least a portion of) the image, for example.","At  in the example embodiment , one or more viewer specifications and\/or characteristics (e.g., comprising specific user\/viewer specifications, formulations, etc., such as user input weighting factors, for example), can be received, such as at a computing device connected to the monitor. At , generalized perceptual filtering (transformation) of opponent channels for the viewer can be identified from the viewer specifications. As an example, the viewer may comprise a human viewer of the image, where different humans can comprise different viewing characteristics. For example, a near-sighted person may see an image differently than a person with normal eyesight, and a person with a type of color-blindness may see colors differently than one with normal vision. Further, as an example, the viewer may comprise a computing device using an image detection component (e.g., camera). In this example, a first camera may comprise different viewing characteristics than a second camera.","In one embodiment, the viewing characteristics can comprise one or more perceptual filtering or transformation parameters. Perceptual filtering or transformation parameters can comprise a perceptual blurring parameter of one or more visual opponent channels for the viewer (e.g., how different wavelengths of light are affected (e.g., blurred by) by a visual system of a particular user, a weighting parameter (e.g., showing relative importance of errors in different opponent channels and\/or relative importance of different kinds of errors for a particular viewer) and\/or a contrast parameter of one or more of the visual opponent channels for the viewer (e.g., how contrast related parameters affect a particular user's viewing experience). For example, as described above, the human visual system typically blends colors of neighboring color elements (e.g., or sub-pixels) into a single color by a visual blurring effect and luminance resolution of the respective color element colors, and such phenomena can be accounted for or at least considered by the perceptual filtering parameters.","In this embodiment, for example, a perceptual blurring parameter for the visual opponent channels may be associated with a particular type of viewer, such as a first perceptual blurring parameter for a human viewer with normal eyesight, a second parameter for a human viewer that is color blind, and a third parameter for a particular type of camera system. Further, a weighting parameter for one or more types of perceptual errors may be associated with a particular type of viewer, and\/or a contrast parameter may be associated with a particular type of viewer.","As an example, a database of viewers may be maintained, and, depending on the viewer type and characteristics, a set of perceptual filtering parameters may be associated with respective viewer types in the database. As another example, the viewer may input viewing characteristics into the computing device (e.g., responding to specific questions), and appropriate perceptual filtering or transformation parameters can be assigned to the viewer. For example, a viewer may give a response of green when shown blue (or vice versa), thus allowing the viewer to be identified as potentially having some degree of blue\/green color blindness.","In one embodiment, one or more characteristics related to one or more filtered image goals may also be received and used to help determine the image rendering filter. As an example, a viewer may identify different image viewing tasks based on relative importance of an error in different opponent channels, relative important of contrast errors, etc., for example. In this embodiment, the characteristics of the filtered image goal can comprise, or rather be comprised within viewer specifications or characteristics obtained at , for example (e.g., where viewer\/user provided weighting parameters, for example, that may assist the viewer in achieving particular viewing goals). By way of example, one or more perceptual filtering transformation parameters that may be comprised within viewing characteristics obtained at  may comprise a perceptual blurring parameter of one or more visual opponent channels for the viewer, a contrast parameter of one or more of the visual opponent channels for the viewer, and\/or one or more parameters related to a perceptual transformation goal (e.g., weighting parameters of one or more components of the perceptual transformation), etc.","At  in the example embodiment , a matrix in frequency domain can be calculated for a group (e.g., block) of color elements, which can be used in generating an image rendering filter. It may be appreciated that such a matrix is for the color elements of the block together, and expresses a generalized correlation or relation between characteristics of different color elements. The matrix is thus calculated for a group of color elements rather than color elements individually. By way of example, a Hermitian square matrix that can represent a generalized correlation value for respective pairs of color elements of a block\/area of a monitor can be calculated. As an example, a geometry function () and one or more components (Z) of the SPD in opponent channels (i), for respective color elements (\u03c0), can be determined, and a corresponding function () can be calculated in a frequency domain (f) for the respective color elements. Further, in this example, the perceptual filtering or transformation () for respective opponent channels can be determined and a corresponding function () can be calculated in frequency domain. Additionally, in this example, a generalized correlation matrix () can be calculated for the given frequency (\u03be) as a result of a matrix multiplication:\n\n(\u03be)=(\u03be).\n","At , a periodic generalized correlation matrix can be calculated as a sum of respective matrices in frequency domain. As an example, a matrix sum (\u03be)=\u03a3(\u03be+k\/\u039b) can be calculated, where  may be periodic with period 1\/\u039b, \u039b being size of the block\/area in spatial domain. Further, in this example, although (\u03be) may involve an infinite summation, the summation terms include ||, which can decrease extremely fast, and the terms, effectively becomes zero after a low number of iterations K, such as three to five iterations. Therefore, in this example, the summation matrix for the respective frequencies may be calculated as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u2112","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u03be"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"K"},"mo":"\u2009"}},"mi":"K"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u2112","f"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03be","mo":"+","mfrac":{"mi":["k","\u039b"]}}}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"\u2248"}}}},"At  in the example, embodiment , a rendering filter matrix may be determined for respective frequencies.

At , the matrix of filters can be converted to a spatial domain. In one embodiment, converting the matrix of filters to the spatial domain can comprise applying an inverse Fourier transform to the respective filters of the filter matrix. As an illustrative example, respective elements of the filter matrix can determine a contribution (e.g., by applying a convolution operation) of an opponent channel of an input image to intensity of one or more color elements of a corresponding block\/area of the monitor.","The resulting filter matrix in the spatial domain can comprise the image rendering filter for the particular monitor and particular viewer, for example. In one embodiment, creating the image rendering filter can comprise determining a linear rendering filter for a type of monitor that is displaying the image and for a type of viewer that is viewing the image. In this way, in this embodiment, a new image rendering filter may not need to be created for each new viewer and\/or monitor, for example. Instead, in this example, an image rendering filter may be selected for a viewer and monitor of the same type as used to determine the image rendering filter.","In one aspect, for example where there is limited support of geometric functions in the spatial domain, and a generalized perceptual transformation filter is a simple identity transformation, the process described above may not be used to determine the matrix of filters used for the image rendering filter, for example.
