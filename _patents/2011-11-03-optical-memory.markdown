"],"p":["The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC03-765F00098, between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of California at Berkeley.","The present invention relates to a method and device for optical data storage.","As the size and popularity of digital videos, images, databases, etc. increase in size, existing data storage techniques have scaled relatively well thus far. However, new digital storage techniques need to be developed, particularly to handle new advances in optical electronics.","Advancements in optical electronics, for example quantum optical computers and optical communication equipment (e.g. optical switches), have generated a need for fast, direct optical storage techniques. Current optical storage techniques generally employ either a cavity in which light is folded back and forth, a coil of optical fiber with enough optical path length, or Anderson localization (extending light path by highly scattering media). Although somewhat easy to implement, these techniques are plagued by a finite storage life and large size (due to the long optical path lengths for storage life).","Therefore, there is a need in the art for an optical data storage means that provides for fast and long-term data storage.","Optical memory comprising: a semiconductor wire, a first electrode, a second electrode, a light source, a means for producing a first voltage to the first electrode, a means for producing a second voltage to the second electrode, and a means for determining the presence of an electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceeding a predefined voltage. The first voltage is different than the second voltage.","The semiconductor wire is essentially optically transparent and has a bandgap less than the energy of the light produced by the light source and greater than background ambient light (light, electromagnetic radiation, etc.). The light source is optically connected to the semiconductor wire. The first electrode is electrically conductive and electrically insulated from the semiconductor wire. The second electrode is electrically conductive and electrically insulated from the semiconductor wire. Preferably, at least part of the first electrode is at a distance less than 5 nm, more preferably 1 nm, from the semiconductor wire. Preferably, at least part of the second electrode is at a distance less than 5 nm, more preferably 1 nm, from the semiconductor wire.","The first electrode and the second electrode are electrically insulated from each other. The means for producing a first voltage electrically is electrically connected to the first electrode. Preferably, the first voltage is less than 0 volts (system ground voltage). The means for producing a second voltage is electrically connected to the second electrode. Preferably, the second voltage is greater than 0 volts (system ground voltage). The means for determining the presence of an electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceeding a predefined voltage is electrically connected to the first electrode and the second electrode.","The first electrode and the second electrode produce an electric field across the semiconductor wire thereby creating a lateral electrostatic potential modulation within the semiconductor wire. When the semiconductor wire is optically excited, the photo-generated electrons and holes in the semiconductor wire spatially separate. The separated electrons and holes in the semiconductor wire then align with the lateral electrostatic until the lateral electrostatic potential modulation is removed. Therefore, an optical pulse can be determined and stored within the semiconductor wire for an infinite amount of time as long as the lateral electrostatic potential modulation remains.","The resulting electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode from the separated charges can then be detected by the means for determining the presence of an electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceeding a predefined voltage. Preferably, the means for determining the presence of an electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceeding a predefined voltage uses a volt meter, ADC (analog-to-digital-converter), or other voltage measuring means to detect the voltage between the first electrode and the second electrode.","The passing of light through the semiconductor wire, optically excites the semiconductor wire, thereby generating photo-generated electrons and holes in the semiconductor wire, which can be detected by the voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode. If the detected voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceed a predefined voltage, then light has passed through the semiconductor wire since the first voltage and second voltage have been applied to the first electrode and second electrode respectively.

In one embodiment, multiple pulses may be detected by a single wire, and are electronically stored for later retrieval using existing storage techniques (electronic or mechanical, for example magnetic hard disk, flash memory etc. . . . )","Optical memory comprising: a semiconductor wire, a first electrode, a second electrode, a light source, a means for producing a first voltage to the first electrode, a means for producing a second voltage to the second electrode, and a means for determining the presence of an electrical voltage across the first electrode and the second electrode exceeding a predefined voltage.
