Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, with the rapid spread of a network, such as the Internet, advertisements have been actively delivered through the network. As an aspect of the delivery of the advertisements, display advertising has been known which displays image or video advertisements in a predetermined space of a page (hereinafter, referred to as an advertisement delivery target page) which is an advertisement delivery target.","In the display advertising, advertisements are delivered to a user who has user attributes (for example, sex, age, and favorite) designated by an advertiser. Therefore, advertisements are effectively delivered (for example, see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2011-238020).","In the delivery of the advertisements, when the user who has accessed the advertisement delivery target page has the user attributes designated by the advertiser, advertisements are delivered. Therefore, it is preferable to predict a delivery target user, who will be the future advertisement delivery destination, as a future log and to accept an order from the advertiser on the basis of the future log.","However, it is difficult to accurately predict the delivery target user, who will be the future advertisement delivery destination, so as to be identical to the user who actually accesses the advertisement delivery target page. Therefore, it is difficult to perform a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order request with high accuracy.","According to an exemplary embodiment, an advertisement delivery management apparatus includes an acquisition unit, a determination unit, and an accepting unit. The acquisition unit acquires information on two or more types of delivery target user groups, each including a plurality of delivery target users predicted as future advertisement delivery destinations. The determination unit determines whether each of the delivery target user groups satisfies delivery conditions designated by an advertisement delivery order request. The accepting unit accepts the advertisement delivery order request based on the determination result of the determination unit.","The above and other objects, features, advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Hereinafter, an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method according to an exemplary embodiment (hereinafter, referred to as an \u201cembodiment\u201d) of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The advertisement delivery management apparatus and the advertisement delivery management method according to the present disclosure are not limited by the embodiment. In the following description, in some cases, a \u201cdatabase\u201d is described as a \u201cDB\u201d.","1. Advertisement Delivery Management Process","First, an advertisement delivery management process according to an embodiment will be described.  are diagrams illustrating the advertisement delivery management process according to the embodiment. The advertisement delivery management process makes it possible to perform a process of accepting orders from the advertiser with high accuracy.","As illustrated in , an advertisement delivery management system according to the embodiment includes an advertisement delivery management apparatus , an information delivery apparatus , an advertiser terminal , and a user terminal . The advertisement delivery management apparatus , the information delivery apparatus , the advertiser terminal , and the user terminal  are connected to each other through a communication network . The communication network  is an Internet protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet. In practice, there are a plurality of advertiser terminals  and a plurality of user terminals . However,  illustrates one advertiser terminal  and one user terminal , for convenience of explanation.","The advertiser terminal  is a terminal apparatus of the advertiser who wants to deliver advertisements and sends an order (hereinafter, referred to as an order request) for the advertisements to be delivered to the user terminal  of the user with predetermined user attributes to the advertisement delivery management apparatus . Specifically, the advertiser terminal  transmits, to the advertisement delivery management apparatus , the order request including advertising information which the advertiser wants to post on an advertisement delivery target page and information on the designated user attributes as the delivery destinations. Examples of the advertising information include two-dimensional content and three-dimensional content, such as banner advertisements, text advertisements, and video advertisements.","The user terminal  is the terminal apparatus of the user who accesses the advertisement delivery management apparatus  and the information delivery apparatus . When the information delivery apparatus  is accessed by the user terminal , for example, it transmits an advertisement delivery target page, such as a Web page, to the user terminal . The advertisement delivery target page includes the uniform resource locator (URL) of the advertising information. The user terminal  requests the advertisement delivery management apparatus  to transmit advertising information on the basis of the URL. When receiving the request for the advertising information from the user terminal , the advertisement delivery management apparatus  transmits advertising information corresponding to the request to the user terminal . The URL of the advertising information is not the URL of the advertisement delivery management apparatus , but may be the URL of the information delivery apparatus . In this case, the user terminal  requests the information delivery apparatus  to transmit advertising information on the basis of the URL of the advertising information. When receiving the request, the information delivery apparatus  requests the advertisement delivery management apparatus  to transmit advertising information to the user terminal . The advertisement delivery management apparatus  transmits advertising information corresponding to the transmission request from the information delivery apparatus  to the user terminal .","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  performs a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order request, a process of allocating user attributes corresponding to the accepted order request, and a process of delivering the advertising information designated by the order request to perform processes from the reception of the advertisement delivery order to the delivery of the advertising information.","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  stores information including the user attributes of a plurality of delivery target users, who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations, as a future log (prediction information) in a DB and performs the process of accepting the order request on the basis of the future log.","In the example illustrated in , information on delivery target users , , . . . , (hereinafter, generically referred to as a delivery target user  in some cases) who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations is stored in the DB. For example, the delivery target user has user attributes A to C and the delivery target user has user attributes A, B, and E. In addition, the delivery target user has user attributes B, D, and E.","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  repeatedly performs a process of randomly selecting a predetermined ratio R (for example, R=0.8) of delivery target users to the delivery target users , , . . . , to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups. In the example illustrated in , the advertisement delivery management apparatus  acquires information on different delivery target user groups , , . . . , (hereinafter, generically referred to as a delivery target user group  in some cases) from a future log .","As illustrated in , when receiving an advertisement delivery order request  from the advertiser terminal , the advertisement delivery management apparatus  determines whether each of the delivery target user groups to satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request .","The delivery conditions designated by the order request  include, for example, user attributes and the number of postings. For example, it is assumed that the user attribute is an \u201cattribute A\u201d and the number of postings is \u201c1000\u201d. In addition, it is assumed that the number of delivery target users  having the \u201cattribute A\u201d as the user attribute is \u201c1200\u201d in the delivery target user group , is \u201c1120\u201d in the delivery target user group , and is \u201c980\u201d in the delivery target user group .","In this case, the delivery target user groups  which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request  are, for example, the delivery target user groups and . In contrast, the delivery target user group includes \u201c980\u201d delivery target users  having the user attribute A and does not satisfy \u201c1000\u201d, which is the number of postings designated by the order request .","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  accepts the order request  when the ratio of the delivery target user groups  which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request  to the delivery target user groups to is equal to or greater than a predetermined value R (for example, R=0.9). On the other hand, when the ratio of the delivery target user groups  which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request  is less than the predetermined value R, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  does not accept the order request .","As such, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  determines whether to accept the order request  on the basis of whether delivery target user groups to , each including a plurality of delivery target users  predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations, satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request . Therefore, it is possible to perform the process of determining whether the delivery conditions designated by the order request  are satisfied for a plurality of prediction patterns. As a result, it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request , as compared to when the determination is performed for one prediction pattern.","In addition, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  randomly selects a predetermined ratio R of the delivery target users  to the delivery target users , , . . . , included in the future log  to acquire information on delivery target user groups to . Therefore, it is possible to easily generate different prediction patterns. In this embodiment, the delivery target users  are randomly selected. However, for example, the delivery target users  may be selected on the basis of a predetermined rule. In addition, plural types of future logs may be predicted and the plural types of future logs may be used as the delivery target user groups to .","When the ratio of the delivery target user groups  satisfying the delivery conditions to the delivery target user groups to is equal to or greater than the predetermined value R, the advertisement delivery management apparatus  accepts the advertisement delivery order request . Therefore, it is possible to further improve the reception accuracy of the order request . That is, as the number of delivery target user groups  increases, the ratio of the delivery target user groups  satisfying the delivery conditions designated by the order request  is reduced. As a result, there is a concern that the reception accuracy of the order request  will be reduced. However, it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request  by adjusting the predetermined value R.","Next, the detailed structure of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  which performs the above-mentioned advertisement delivery management process and the detailed content of the process will be described with reference to the drawings.","2. Structure of Advertisement Delivery Management Apparatus ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","10","11","12","13","14","15","15","21","22","23","24"]},"The communication unit  is an interface, such as a network interface card (NIC). The control unit  transmits and receives various kinds of information to and from the advertiser terminal  or the user terminal  through the communication unit  and the communication network . The advertising information DB , the user information DB , the past log DB , and the future log DB  are each a semiconductor memory device, such as a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), or a flash memory, or a storage device, such as an optical disk.","The control unit  is implemented by an integrated circuit, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate array (FPGA). A central processing unit (CPU) or a micro processing unit (MPU) executes a program stored in the storage device using the RAM as a work area to cause the control unit  to function as the advertisement delivery unit , the future log prediction unit , the accepting unit , and the allocation unit . The structure of the control unit  is not limited thereto, but the control unit  may have any structure as long as it can perform the following information processing.","For Advertisement Delivery Unit ","When a request to deliver advertising information is received from the user terminal , the advertisement delivery unit  acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal  from an advertising information table in the advertising information DB  and transmits the acquired advertising information from the communication unit  to the user terminal  which is a delivery request source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"11"},"The \u201cadvertisement ID\u201d is identification information which is allocated to each accepted order request. The \u201cuser attributes\u201d are user attributes designated by the order request. The \u201cposting period\u201d is the period for which the advertising information designated by the order request is delivered. The \u201cnumber of postings\u201d is the number of deliveries of the advertising information designated by the order request. In addition, the \u201cadvertising information\u201d is advertising information designated by the order request.","For example, an advertisement ID \u201cA\u201d indicates that the user attribute of a delivery target is a \u201cvehicle\u201d, the delivery period of advertising information is \u201cfrom Jan. 1, 2013 to Jan. 31, 2013\u201d, the number of times the advertising information is delivered is \u201c1000\u201d, and the advertising information is a \u201cbanner advertisement Ya\u201d. When the number of deliveries of the advertising information is greater than \u201c1000\u201d within the delivery period of the advertising information, the process of delivering the advertising information corresponding to the order request ends.","When the user of the user terminal  who transmitted the advertising information delivery request has the user attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d, for example, the advertisement delivery unit  acquires the advertising information \u201cbanner advertisement Ya\u201d of the advertisement ID \u201cA\u201d from the advertising information table in the advertising information DB  and transmits the acquired advertising information to the user terminal  which is a delivery request source.","The user attributes of the user of the user terminal  are determined on the basis of the user information table in the user information DB .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the user information table stored in the user information DB . As illustrated in , the user information table includes information, such as a \u201cuser ID\u201d, \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d, and \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d.","The \u201cuser ID\u201d is identification information for identifying the user of the user terminal . The \u201cuser ID\u201d corresponds to, for example, user identification information which is set to a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) cookie transmitted and received between the advertisement delivery management apparatus  and the user terminal .","The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are information indicating, for example, the values, lifestyle, character, and preference of the user. The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are classified into, for example, attributes \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ccosmetics\u201d, \u201cclothes\u201d, and \u201ctravel\u201d. In the example illustrated in , \u201c1\u201d is set to each attribute when the preference of the user is a relatively high and \u201c0\u201d is set to each attribute in the other cases. In addition, the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are not limited to the attributes illustrated in , but may include various attributes, such as economy, politics, baseball, soccer, other sports, sweets, a personal computer, white goods, and furniture.","The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d indicate demographic user attribute information. The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are classified into, for example, attributes \u201csex\u201d and \u201cage\u201d of the user. In , \u201c1\u201d is stored in the attribute \u201csex\u201d when the user is a female and \u201c2\u201d is stored in the attribute \u201csex\u201d when the user is a male. The age of the user is stored in the attribute \u201cage\u201d. The \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are not limited to the attributes illustrated in , but may include various attributes, such as the job, family structure, annual income, address, native place, and academic background of the user.","For example, when the user with a user ID \u201cU\u201d illustrated in  transmits an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal , it is determined that the user attributes of the user are, for example, \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ctravel\u201d, \u201cmale\u201d, and \u201c21 years old\u201d. In addition, for example, when the user with a user ID \u201cU\u201d illustrated in  transmits an advertising information delivery request from the user terminal , the advertisement delivery unit  determines that the user attributes of the user are \u201cclothes\u201d, \u201cfemale\u201d, and \u201c44 years old\u201d.","The advertisement delivery unit  sets the user ID of the user who transmits the advertising information delivery request in an access log table in the past log DB .  is a diagram illustrating an example of the access log table stored in the past log DB .","As illustrated in , the access log table is a table in which that associates the date and time when the user transmits the advertisement information delivery request to the advertisement delivery management apparatus  with the user ID is set. The advertisement delivery unit  updates the access log table whenever the advertising information delivery request is received from the user terminal .","When a request to transmit advertising information to the user terminal  is received from the information delivery apparatus , similarly the advertisement delivery unit  acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal  from the advertising information table in the advertising information DB  and transmits the acquired advertising information from the communication unit  to the user terminal . The transmission request from the information delivery apparatus  includes the user ID of the user of the user terminal . The advertisement delivery unit  acquires advertising information corresponding to the user attributes of the user of the user terminal  from the advertising information table on the basis of the user ID.","For Future Log Prediction Unit ","The future log prediction unit  determines a plurality of delivery target users who are predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations on the basis of the access log table stored in the past log DB  and sets the user information of the determined delivery target users in a future log table stored in the future log DB .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"14"},"The \u201cdelivery target ID\u201d is identification information allocated to each delivery target user who is predicted as the future advertisement delivery destination. The delivery target user is a virtual user who is different from the user set in the user information table stored in the user information DB .","The \u201callocation state\u201d is information indicating whether the delivery target user has been allocated to the order request. When a delivery target user (hereinafter, referred to as an allocated user in some cases) has been allocated to the order request, \u201c1\u201d is set to the \u201callocation state\u201d. When a delivery target user (hereinafter, referred to as a non-allocated user in some cases) has not been allocated for the order request, \u201c0\u201d is set to the \u201callocation state\u201d.","The \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d and the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are the same as those in the user information table in the user information DB . The user who is set in the user information table may be presumed as the delivery target user and the delivery target ID may be used as the user ID. In this case, information on the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d and the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d can be acquired from the user information table on the basis of the user ID.","The future log prediction unit  can predict the delivery target user who will be the advertisement delivery destination for a predetermined future period on the basis of, for example, the access log in the same period last year or the access log in the previous predetermined period. For example, the future log prediction unit  can presume the user who transmitted the advertising information delivery request for the last month as the delivery target user for the next month.","The future log prediction unit  can perform a statistical process for the past log which is set in the access log table to determine the tendency of the delivery target user who will be the future advertisement delivery destination and predict the future log on the basis of the determination result. In this case, for example, the future log prediction unit  may determine the tendency of the delivery target user, considering, for example, weather or temperature change information.","The future log prediction unit  can set the predicted future log in the future log table. In addition, the future log prediction unit  may set the future log which is acquired from an external apparatus through the communication unit  in the future log table.","In addition, a plurality of future log prediction units  which predict the delivery target users according to different rules may be provided. In this case, it is possible to acquire information on a plurality of different future logs (hereinafter, referred to as prediction patterns in some cases).","For Accepting Unit ","The accepting unit  determines whether to accept the order request from the advertiser terminal  on the basis of the future log set in the future log table. When it is determined that the order request is accepted, the accepting unit  transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal . As described above, the order request from the advertiser terminal  includes designated information, such as the user attributes and the number of postings.","The accepting process of the accepting unit  includes, for example, a process of acquiring the delivery target user group, a process of determining whether each delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request, and a process of determining whether to accept the order request. Hereinafter, each process will be described specifically.","Acquisition Process of Accepting Unit ","First, the process of acquiring the delivery target user group will be described. In the process, the accepting unit  repeatedly performs a process of randomly selecting a predetermined ratio R of the non-allocated users to the non-allocated users included in the future log table to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups.","For example, it is assumed that the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is \u201c1000\u201d and the predetermined ratio R is set to \u201c0.08\u201d. In this case, the accepting unit  repeatedly performs the process of selecting the non-allocated users from the future log table 800 times (=1000\u00d70.8) m times (m is an integer equal to or greater than 2).","In this way, the accepting unit  can acquire information on m delivery target user groups, each including \u201c800\u201d non-allocated users, from the future log table. Whenever the predetermined ratio R of the non-allocated users is selected, the accepting unit  sets the selected non-allocated users as a delivery target user group in the delivery target user group table.  is a diagram illustrating an example of the delivery target user group table.","In this way, it is possible to easily generate different future logs (prediction patterns) on the basis of the future log table. That is, when the future log prediction unit  generates two or more types of future logs, two or more types of different prediction rules are needed. However, the delivery target user is sampled from the future log table to prevent an increase in the number of prediction rules in the future log prediction unit .","Since the delivery target user is sampled from the future log table, the delivery target user group acquired by the accepting unit  is associated with the delivery tendency of the user attributes in the future log table. Therefore, for example, when the prediction accuracy of the future log prediction unit  is high, it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy in the reception determination process.","As the number of delivery target users forming the delivery target user group is reduced, the association of the delivery target users with the delivery tendency of the user attributes in the future log table is reduced, which makes it possible to change the association between the prediction patterns, depending on the number of non-allocated users. Therefore, as the number of delivery target users is reduced, a process of determining whether the delivery conditions are satisfied, which will be described below, becomes stricter. As a result, it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy in the reception determination process.","The predetermined ratio R can be set to the control unit  by the administrator of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  through an operation unit (not illustrated). In addition, the accepting unit  may change the predetermined ratio R, depending on the number of non-allocated users in the future log table.","For example, when the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is relatively large, the accepting unit  increases the predetermined ratio R. When the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is relatively small, the accepting unit  decreases the predetermined ratio R. In this way, it is possible to improve the accuracy of the accepting process.","In the process of acquiring the delivery target user group, the accepting unit  may select the delivery target user according other different rules, instead of randomly selecting the delivery target user. For example, the accepting unit  can randomly remove a predetermined ratio R (=1\u2212R) of the non-allocated users to the non-allocated users included in the future log table and form the delivery target user group with the remaining non-allocated users.","For example, the accepting unit  may acquire, as the delivery target user group, the non-allocated users except for a plurality of k-th (1\u2266k\u2266m) rows among rows of the non-allocated users in the future log table. For example, it is assumed that the predetermined ratio R is \u201c0.8\u201d and m is \u201c10\u201d.","In this case, the accepting unit  excludes the non-allocated users which are set in the rows in which the last digit is \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d, such as the third to tenth tows, the thirteenth to twentieth rows . . . , for the first delivery target user group in the future log table. In addition, the accepting unit  excludes the non-allocated users which are set in the rows in which the last digit is \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d, such as the first row, the fourth to tenth rows, the eleventh row, the fourteenth to twentieth rows . . . , for the second delivery target user group in the future log table.","The accepting unit  may repeatedly perform a process of randomly selecting the predetermined ratio R of the non-allocated users to the non-allocated users included in the future log table and multiplying the selected non-allocated users by a predetermined coefficient K (>1) to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups. The accepting unit  sets the predetermined coefficient K to, for example, 1\/R. The predetermined ratio R is preferably set such that the predetermined coefficient K is an integer when the predetermined coefficient K is 1\/R.","As such, when the predetermined coefficient K is multiplied, the accepting unit  can accurately set the delivery target user group corresponding to the number of non-allocated users included in the future log table. When the predetermined coefficient K which is not an integer is multiplied, there is a concern a decimal fraction will be included in the number of non-allocated users forming the delivery target user group. Therefore, the accepting unit  can round off, cut off, or round up a value obtained by multiplying the number of non-allocated users forming the delivery target user group by the predetermined coefficient K, on the basis of, for example, predetermined conditions. In this way, the total number of non-allocated users forming each delivery target user group can be equal or substantially equal to the total number of non-allocated users in the future log table.","As described above, when a plurality of future log prediction units  generate two or more types of future logs, the accepting unit  can acquire the two or more types of future logs as two or more types of delivery target user groups with no change from the future log prediction unit .","Satisfaction Determination Process of Accepting Unit ","Next, a process of determining whether each delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request will be described. In the process, the accepting unit  determines whether two or more types of delivery target user groups each satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request.","Specifically, the accepting unit  counts the number of delivery target users with the user attributes designated by the order request among the delivery target users in the delivery target user group. When the count result is equal to or greater than the number of postings designated by the order request, the accepting unit  determines that the delivery conditions designated by the order request are satisfied.","For example, when the user attribute designated by the order request is \u201cvehicle\u201d and the number of postings is \u201c1000\u201d, the accepting unit  counts the number of delivery target users with the attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d to which \u201c1\u201d is set among the delivery target users in each delivery target user group. When the count result is equal to or greater than \u201c1000\u201d, the accepting unit  determines that the delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the order request. When the count result is less than \u201c1000\u201d, the accepting unit  determines that the delivery target user group does not satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request.","The accepting unit  counts a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute (hereinafter, referred to as a combined user attribute in some cases). For example, when the frequency of a combination of the user attributes \u201cclothes\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d which is designated by the order request is high, the accepting unit  counts the combination of the user attributes \u201cclothes\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d as one user attribute.","Information on the order request accepted by the accepting unit  is set in the advertising information table stored in the advertising information DB . The accepting unit  can determine a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value on the basis of the advertising information table.","For example, the accepting unit  determines the total number of postings designated by the past order request as a first sum on the basis of the advertising information table and determines the total number of postings designated by the past order request as a second sum for each combination of two or more user attributes. Then, the accepting unit  counts, as one user attribute, a combination of the user attributes in which the ratio of the second sum to the first sum is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value.","When the frequency of the combination of the user attributes \u201cclothes\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d which is designated by the order request is high and the future log table is in the state illustrated in , the user attribute of the delivery target user with a delivery target ID \u201cF\u201d is not \u201cclothes\u201d or \u201ctravel\u201d, but is \u201cclothes & travel\u201d.","The combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value may not be determined by the accepting unit , but may be set in a separate user information DB  by an external apparatus.","For example, when the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is equal to or less than a predetermined value or when the number of non-allocated users with the combined user attribute is equal to or less than a predetermined value, the accepting unit  can divide the combined user attribute into a plurality of user attributes. Therefore, it is possible to increase the total number of user attributes. As a result, the possibility that the order request designating the combined user attribute will be accepted is reduced, but it is possible to increase the possibility that other order requests will be accepted.","Reception Determination Process of Accepting Unit ","Next, a process of determining whether to accept the order request will be described. In the process, the accepting unit  determines whether to accept the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the above-mentioned satisfaction determination process.","Specifically, when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than the predetermined value R, the accepting unit  accepts the advertisement delivery order request. For example, in a case in which the number of delivery target user groups is \u201c10\u201d and the predetermined value R is \u201c0.8\u201d, when the number of delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions is equal to or greater than \u201c8\u201d, the accepting unit  accepts the advertisement delivery order request.","The predetermined value R can be set in the control unit  by the administrator of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  through the operation unit (not illustrated). In addition, the accepting unit  may change the predetermined value R depending on the number of non-allocated users in the future log table.","For example, when the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is relatively large, the accepting unit  decreases the predetermined value R. When the number of non-allocated users in the future log table is relatively small, the accepting unit  increases the predetermined value R. In this way, it is possible to perform the accepting process with high accuracy.","In the above description, the accepting unit  selects the delivery target users forming the delivery target user group from the non-allocated users in the future log table. However, the accepting unit  may select the delivery target users forming the delivery target user group from all of the delivery target users in the future log table. Here, \u201call of the delivery target users\u201d are delivery target users including both the allocated users and the non-allocated users. When the number of non-allocated users is \u201c2000\u201d and the number of allocated users is \u201c8000\u201d, the number of all delivery target users is \u201c10000\u201d.","In this case, the accepting unit  processes the accepted order requests and a new advertisement delivery order request from the advertiser terminal  as one order request. For example, it is assumed that the accepted order requests are order requests with advertisement IDs \u201cA\u201d to \u201cA\u201d illustrated in . In addition, it is assumed that, in a new order request, the designated user attributes is \u201cvehicle\u201d and the designated number of postings is \u201c1000\u201d.","The accepting unit  determines a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d is equal to or greater than \u201c1000\u201d, a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute \u201cvehicle & travel\u201d is equal to or greater than \u201c2000\u201d, and a delivery target user group in which the number of delivery target users with the user attribute \u201cmale & twenties\u201d is equal to or greater than \u201c1500\u201d as the delivery target user groups which satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the order request.","For Allocation Unit ","Whenever the accepting unit  accepts an advertisement delivery order request, the allocation unit  allocates the delivery target user to the order request. The allocation process determines an allocation score corresponding to the allocation state of the delivery target user set in the future log table in response to the order request and minimizes a reduction in the allocation score before and after the allocation of the delivery target user in response to a new advertisement delivery order request. The allocation unit  uses the combined user attribute as one user attribute, similarly to the accepting unit .","First, the allocation score will be described. The allocation unit  counts the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d of the non-allocated users among a plurality of delivery target users set in the future log table illustrated in . The non-allocated user is a delivery target user for which \u201c0\u201d is set to the \u201callocation state\u201d in the future log table.","The \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d is the sum of the \u201cnumber of user attributes\u201d of the non-allocated users. For example, when the number of non-allocated users is 1000, the sum of the \u201cnumber of user attributes\u201d of 1000 non-allocated users is the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d.","The \u201cnumber of user attributes\u201d is the number of delivery target users which are effectively set according to each classified user attribute. In the case of the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d, the attributes mean, for example, \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ccosmetics\u201d, \u201cclothes\u201d, and \u201ctravel\u201d. In the case of the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d, the attributes mean, for example, \u201csex\u201d and \u201cage\u201d.","In the case of the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d the effectively set delivery target user is a delivery target user for which \u201c1\u201d is set to the corresponding attributes. In the case of the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d, the effectively set delivery target user is a delivery target user for which information is set to the attributes.","For example, it is assumed that the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d are classified into only four attributes, such as \u201cvehicle\u201d, \u201ccosmetics\u201d, \u201cclothes\u201d, and \u201ctravel\u201d and the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d are classified into only two attributes, such as \u201csex\u201d and \u201cage\u201d. In this case, the maximum value of the \u201cnumber of user attributes\u201d is \u201c6\u201d.","In the example illustrated in , the delivery target users who are not allocated to the order request are delivery target users with delivery target IDs \u201cF\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, and \u201cF\u201d. In this case, as illustrated in , the \u201cnumbers of user attributes\u201d of the delivery target users corresponding to the delivery target IDs \u201cF\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, \u201cF\u201d, and \u201cF\u201d are \u201c4\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, and \u201c6\u201d, respectively. Therefore, as illustrated in , the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d, which is the sum of the \u201cnumber of user attributes\u201d of the delivery target users who are not allocated to the order request, is \u201c15 (=4+2+3+6)\u201d and the allocation score is \u201c15\u201d.","The allocation unit  may use the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d included only in the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d as the allocation score. In addition, the allocation unit  may use the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d included only in the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d as the allocation score. The allocation unit  may use the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d included only in a portion of the \u201cpsychographic attributes\u201d or the \u201cdemographic attributes\u201d as the allocation score.","In addition, the \u201ctotal number of user attributes\u201d may not be used as the allocation score, but other indexes may be used as the allocation score. For example, the allocation unit  may use the minimum number or ratio of non-allocated users with the user attributes as the allocation score.","Next, the allocation of the delivery target users in response to a new advertisement delivery order request will be described. The allocation unit  selects the non-allocated users who have the user attributes designated by a new advertisement delivery order request and correspond to the number of postings designated by the order request from the future log table and determines a reduction in the allocation score before and after the selected non-allocated users are allocated to the order request.","There are a plurality of combinations of the non-allocated users corresponding to the number of postings which is designated by the order request except in the case in which only the number of non-allocated users with the user attributes designated by the advertisement delivery order request which corresponds to the number of postings designated by the order request is set in the future log table. For example, when the number of non-allocated users with the user attributes designated by the advertisement delivery order request is \u201c10\u201d and the number of non-allocated users corresponding to the number of postings designated by the order request is \u201c5\u201d, the number of combinations of the non-allocated users is \u201c252\u201d.","The allocation unit  determines combinations of the non-allocated users where a reduction in the allocation score is the minimum before and after all combinations of the non-allocated users corresponding to the number of postings designated by the order request are allocated to the order request. Then, the allocation unit  selects combinations of the non-allocated users which are determined to have the minimum reduction in the allocation score and allocates the selected combinations to the order request.","In addition, the allocation unit  may select one of the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the accepting unit  and perform an allocation process such that a reduction in the allocation score is the minimum before and after the delivery target users are allocated to the order request among the non-allocated users forming the selected delivery target user group. In this case, it is possible to reduce the number of combinations of the non-allocated users used to determine the allocation score in the allocation process and reduce the processing load of the allocation unit .","In this case, for example, the allocation unit  can allocate, to the order request, a delivery target user group with the largest number of user attributes designated by the order request among the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the accepting unit . In this way, it is possible to appropriately allocate the delivery target user while reducing the processing load of the allocation unit .","3. Process Flow of Advertisement Delivery Management Apparatus ","Next, the procedure of an advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to an embodiment will be described.  is a diagram illustrating an example of the flow of the advertisement delivery management process of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment. The flow of the advertisement delivery management process starts when an advertisement delivery order request is transmitted by the advertiser terminal .","When the communication unit  receives the advertisement delivery order request from the advertiser terminal , the control unit  of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  performs a process of acquiring the delivery target user group, as illustrated in  (Step S). In the process, the control unit  repeatedly performs a process of selecting the delivery target user from the future log table stored in the future log DB  according to a predetermined rule to acquire information on two or more types of delivery target user groups.","Then, the control unit  performs a delivery condition satisfaction process (Step S). In the process, the control unit  determines whether two or more types of delivery target user groups each satisfy the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request.","Then, the control unit  determines whether the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted (Step S). In the process, the control unit  determines that the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups acquired in Step S is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.","When it is determined that the advertisement delivery order request can be accepted (Step S; Yes), the control unit  sets information included in the order request to the advertising information table to update the advertising information table (Step S). Examples of the information included in the order request include user attributes, an posting period, the number of postings, and advertising information. These information items are set in the advertising information table.","Then, the control unit  performs a process of allocating the delivery target user (Step S). The non-allocated user with the user attribute designated by the order request is allocated to the order request by the allocation process.","Then, the control unit  updates the future log table on the basis of the result of the allocation process in Step S (Step S). Specifically, the control unit  updates the non-allocated user who is allocated to the order request among the non-allocated users set in the future log table to the allocated user. The \u201callocation state\u201d is changed from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d to update the non-allocated user to the allocated user.","Then, the control unit  transmits a response to the reception of the order to the advertiser terminal  through the communication unit  (Step S) and ends the advertisement delivery management process. On the other hand, when it is determined in Step S that the order request cannot be accepted from the advertiser terminal  (Step S; No), the control unit  transmits an order rejection response to the advertiser terminal  through the communication unit  (Step S) and ends the advertisement delivery management process.","4. Modifications","In the above-described embodiment, the accepting unit  accepts the advertisement delivery order request when the ratio of the delivery target user groups which are determined to satisfy the delivery conditions by the determination unit to two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than a predetermined value. However, the embodiment is not limited to the above-mentioned reception determination process. For example, the accepting unit  may accept the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the satisfaction rate of each delivery target user group for the delivery conditions.","For example, it is assumed that the numbers of delivery target users with the user attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d in the first to third delivery target user groups are \u201c2000\u201d, \u201c1400\u201d, and \u201c1000\u201d, respectively, and the delivery conditions are that the number of times the user attribute \u201cvehicle\u201d is delivered is \u201c1500\u201d.","In this case, the satisfaction rate of the first delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 1.25 (=2000\/1500), the satisfaction rate of the second delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 0.93 (=1400\/1500), and the satisfaction rate of the third delivery target user group for the delivery conditions is 0.67 (=1000\/1500).","Therefore, the average of the satisfaction rates of the first to third delivery target user groups for the delivery conditions is 0.95. When the average of the satisfaction rates is equal to or greater than a predetermined value R (for example, 0.9), the accepting unit  can determine to accept the advertisement delivery order request.","When the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to two or more types of delivery target user groups is in a predetermined range (for example, 0.8 to 0.9), the accepting unit  may determine the average of the satisfaction rates of the delivery target user groups for the delivery conditions. In this case, when the average of the satisfaction rates is the predetermined value R, the accepting unit  can determine to accept the advertisement delivery order request.","In the above description, the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R can be changed depending on the settings of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  by the administrator or the number of non-allocated users in the future log table. However, the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R may be changed depending on other factors. For example, the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R may be changed on the basis of the coincidence (hereinafter, referred to as the coincidence of prediction) between the future log predicted by the future log prediction unit  and the user attributes of the user to which advertising information is actually delivered.","For example, when the coincidence of prediction is low, the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R is reduced. When the coincidence of prediction is high, the predetermined ratio R or the predetermined value R is increased. In this way, it is possible to accept the order request with high accuracy.","5. Effects","In the advertisement delivery management apparatus  according to the embodiment, the accepting unit  (corresponding to an example of an acquisition unit) acquires information on two or more types of delivery target user groups, each including a plurality of delivery target users predicted as the future advertisement delivery destinations, and the accepting unit  (corresponding to an example of a determination unit) determines whether each of the two or more types of delivery target user groups satisfies the delivery conditions designated by the advertisement delivery order request. Then, the accepting unit  (corresponding to an example of an accepting unit) accepts the advertisement delivery order request on the basis of the determination result.","According to this structure, the process of determining whether the advertisement delivery conditions are satisfied can be performed for a plurality of prediction patterns. Therefore, it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of an order request, as compared to a case in which the determination process is performed for one prediction pattern. As a result, it is possible to prevent loss of sales opportunities and prevent the reception of an order request which is not capable of being actually accepted.","The accepting unit  accepts the advertisement delivery order request when the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions to the two or more types of delivery target user groups is equal to or greater than a predetermined value.","According to this structure, it is possible to further improve the reception accuracy of an order request. That is, as the number of delivery target user groups increases, the ratio of the delivery target user groups satisfying the delivery conditions designated by the order request is reduced. As a result, there is a concern that the reception accuracy of the order request will be reduced. However, it is possible to improve the reception accuracy of the order request by adjusting the predetermined value.","The future log prediction unit  (corresponding to an example of a prediction unit) predicts a plurality of delivery target users as the future advertisement delivery destinations and the accepting unit  repeatedly performs a process of selecting a predetermined ratio of the delivery target users to the plurality of delivery target users according to a predetermined rule to acquire information on the two or more types of delivery target user groups.","According to this structure, it is possible to easily acquire different prediction patterns. Since these prediction patterns are acquired from one prediction pattern predicted by the future log prediction unit , they can be associated with the delivery tendency of the user attributes. When the prediction accuracy of the future log prediction unit  is high, it is possible to Improve the reception accuracy of the order request.","The predetermined rule according to which the accepting unit  selects the delivery target user is a rule that randomly selects a predetermined number of delivery target users from a plurality of delivery target users.","According to this structure, it is possible to easily acquire different prediction patterns.","In addition, a plurality of future log prediction units  (corresponding to an example of a prediction unit) predict a plurality of delivery target users as the future advertisement delivery destinations according to different rules and the accepting unit  acquires information on the plurality of delivery target users predicted by the plurality of future log prediction units  as information on the two or more types of delivery target user groups.","According to this structure, even when the prediction accuracy of each future log prediction unit  is low, it is possible to accept an order request with high accuracy.","The order request delivery conditions include information for designating one or more user attributes and information on the number of deliveries. The accepting unit  determines that the delivery target user group satisfies the delivery conditions when the number of delivery target users with the user attribute designated by the delivery conditions among a plurality of delivery target users in the delivery target user group is equal to or greater than the number of deliveries designated by the delivery conditions.","According to this structure, it is possible to accurately determine whether the delivery conditions are satisfied, considering the user attributes or the number of deliveries designated by the order request.","The accepting unit  determines the number of delivery target users, using a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the advertisement delivery order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute.","According to this structure, it is possible to count the number of delivery target users, using a combination of two or more user attributes whose frequency is designated by the order request and is equal to or greater than a threshold value as one user attribute. Therefore, it is possible to increase the possibility of the future advertisement delivery order being accepted and prevent loss of sales opportunities.","6. Others","The advertisement delivery management apparatus  may be implemented by a plurality of server computers. In addition, the structure of the advertisement delivery management apparatus  may be flexibly changed depending on the functions. For example, an external platform may be called by an application programming interface (API) or network computing and then executed to implement the advertisement delivery management apparatus . The advertisement delivery management apparatus  and the information delivery apparatus  may be implemented by one server computer.","According to the embodiment, it is possible to provide an advertisement delivery management apparatus and an advertisement delivery management method which can perform a process of accepting an advertisement delivery order with high accuracy.","Although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments for a complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modifications and alternative constructions that may occur to one skilled in the art that fairly fall within the basic teaching herein set forth."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
