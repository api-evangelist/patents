{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Recently, with the development of telecommunication services and networks, communication devices have become more prevalent. Often times, a user may have a plurality of communication devices each having disparate telephone numbers. Keeping track of each telephone number may be confusing and time consuming. In order to reduce the confusion and improve efficiency of keeping track of telephone numbers, service providers introduced \u201cone-telephone number\u201d telephony services that provide call connection to the plurality of communication devices of the user. However, the current \u201cone-telephone number\u201d telephony service requires users to either acquire a new telephone number, or to port a telephone number of a communication device of the user to act as a pilot number and acquire a different number for the communication device of the user. Thus, the current \u201cone-telephone number\u201d telephony service is inefficient and increase the number of telephone numbers associated with the user.","An exemplary embodiment provides a system and a process for re-using public domain identifications. For example, a public domain identification may be associated with a plurality of private domain identifications. The public domain identification may include one or more identifications known to other users. For example, the public domain identification may include a public telephone number, a public uniform resource identifier (URI), a public uniform resource locator (URL), a public electronic mail address, a public screen name, and\/or other public identifications. The private domain identification may include one or more identifications not known to other users. For example, the private domain identification may include a private telephone number, a private uniform resource identifier (URI), a private uniform resource locator (URL), a private electronic mail address, a private screen name, and\/or other private identifications. In an exemplary embodiment, a private telephone number of a plurality of private telephone numbers may be assigned as the public telephone number for the plurality of private telephone numbers. In another exemplary embodiment, a private uniform resource identifier (URI) of a plurality of private uniform resource identifiers (URIs) may be assigned as the public uniform resource identifier (URI) of the plurality of private uniform resource identifiers (URIs). In other exemplary embodiments, a private electronic mail address of a plurality of electronic mail addresses may be assigned as the public electronic mail address of the plurality of electronic mail addresses. For example, a first user communication device associated with a calling party may attempt to establish a communication session with a called party via a plurality of user communication devices having a plurality of disparate telephone numbers associated with the called party. The calling party may utilize the first user communication device to dial a public telephone number associated with the plurality of user communication devices having a plurality of disparate private telephone numbers associated with the called party. In an exemplary embodiment, the public telephone number may be selected from any telephone number of the plurality of private telephone numbers of the plurality of user communication devices of the called party. The first user communication device may establish a communication session with a call control application system by dialing the public telephone number. The call control application system may establish a first communication session with the calling party via the first user communication device. The call control application system may also search a database of telephone numbers and identify the plurality of private telephone numbers associated with the public telephone number. The call control application system may establish a second communication session with the called party via a user communication device of the plurality of user communication devices associated with the called party. The call control application system may couple the first communication session and the second communication session in order to establish a communication session between the calling party and the called party.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","106","106","118","120","126","106","122","124","106","122"]},"In an exemplary embodiment, a calling party associated with the user communication device  may attempt to establish a communication session with a called party by dialing a public telephone number associated with the called party.

For example, the communication network  may include one or more of a public switched telephone network (PTSN), a signaling system #7 (SS7) network, a fiber optics network, a passive optical network, a cable network, an Internet network, a satellite network (e.g., operating in Band C, Band Ku or Band Ka), a wireless LAN, a Global System for Mobile Communication (\u201cGSM\u201d), a Personal Communication Service (\u201cPCS\u201d), a Personal Area Network (\u201cPAN\u201d), D-AMPS, Wi-Fi, Fixed Wireless Data, IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.15.1, 802.11n and 802.11g or any other wired or wireless network for transmitting and receiving a data signal. In addition, the communication network  may include, without limitation, telephone line, fiber optics, IEEE Ethernet 802.3, wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), or global network such as the Internet. The communication network  may support an Internet network, a wireless communication network, a cellular network, or the like, or any combination thereof. The communication network  may further include one, or any number of the exemplary types of networks mentioned above operating as a stand-alone network or in cooperation with each other. The communication network  may include a plurality of mobile switching centers (MSCs) and a plurality of signaling control points (SCPs).","The communication network  may utilize one or more protocols of one or more network elements to which it is communicatively coupled. The communication network  may translate to or from other protocols to one or more protocols of network devices. Although the communication network  is depicted as one network, it should be appreciated that according to one or more embodiments, the communication network  may comprise a plurality of interconnected networks, such as, for example, a service provider network, the Internet, a broadcaster's network, a cable television network, corporate networks, and home networks.","The transmitter\/receiver  coupling the wireless mobile communication device  to the communication network  may be a repeater, a microwave antenna, a cellular tower, or another network access device capable of providing connectivity between two different network mediums. Transmitter\/receiver  may be capable of sending and receiving signals via a mobile network, a paging network, a cellular network, a satellite network or a radio network.
