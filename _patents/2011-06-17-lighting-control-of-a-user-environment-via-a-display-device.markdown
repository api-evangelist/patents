No. 11\/624,886, filed Jan. 19, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,965,859 and entitled \u201cLighting Control of a User Environment via a Display Device,\u201d which claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/798,112 filed May 4, 2006, and entitled \u201cLighting Control of a User Environment via a Display Device.\u201d The disclosures of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to the generation of visual data through an image capture device during an audio\/visual session such as an \u2018audio\/visual chat\u2019 session or during video game play. More specifically, the present invention relates to control of lighting conditions in a user environment that affect the quality of image data generated during audio\/visual sessions.","2. Description of the Related Art","With the increased processing capabilities of various computing systems, new methods for interacting with those computer systems have become available. For example, a variety of input devices employing video image capture allow user control of or interaction with objects on a graphical display such as a video monitor.","Such video input devices often are responsive to the movement or position of a user in the field of view of an image capture device. Video image processing translates the movement of the user that has been captured as a sequence of video images into signals that may be used, for example, to control a character or avatar in a video game. Alternatively, image processing may generate a video image to be displayed in a \u2018chat\u2019 session in a manner similar to a video conference.","An image capture device typically scans a field of view in which a user may be present (e.g., a user environment such as an office, game room, living room or the like). The captured video image may be applied to a video digitizer that provides digital output to a processor that analyzes and processes the digital information received from the digitizer. Based upon the position or movement of the participant in the field of view, the processor produces signals that are used by the graphics generating system to move objects on the display. Similarly, the system may generate an image of the user for transmission to another user in a chat session.","The output of the devices on graphical displays can be significantly affected by a variety of factors, especially lighting conditions in the user environment. The computer processing time required for image processing in an ideal user environment may be extensive and complex and tends to require substantial computing and\/or temporal resources. A user environment that is overexposed or underexposed as to particular light sources only complicates such processing activities in that the system must compensate for the adverse lighting conditions thereby resulting in slower computing operations and affecting any real-time interactions. In some instances, the lighting conditions are so adverse that a computing system cannot compensate for the particular environment conditions and inaccurate data\u2014if any\u2014is generated thereby resulting in incorrect game control or the generation of poor chat session video.","There is a need for an image capture device whereby the lighting conditions of various user environments can be automatically and dynamically controlled subject to the particular requirements of the capture device or hardware and software related thereto. Additionally, there is a need for lessening the computational burdens of an image processing system coupled to such a device whereby the system may function substantially in real-time thus providing the user with a natural interaction experience with regard to a game, chat session, or any other interaction involving the aforementioned image capture device.","Various embodiments provide a video conferencing system in which a first image capture device captures first user environment image data in a first user environment for transmission over a communications network, and a second image capture device captures second user environment image data in a second user environment for transmission over the communications network. The system includes a conference management server coupled to the network, the conference management server receiving the first user environment image data and the second user environment image data. The conference management server further monitors at least one lighting condition in the first user environment and at least one lighting condition in the second user environment. A first computing device is associated with the first image capture device, the first computing device receiving lighting control instructions from the conference management server, and a second computing device is associated with the second image capture device, the second computing device receiving lighting control instructions from the conference management server. The lighting control instructions from the conference management server comprise generating an outer frame area and an inner frame area, the outer frame area controlling at least one lighting condition in the respective user environment so that the at least one lighting condition remains within an operating range of the respective image capture device.","Further embodiments of the present invention provide a method of video conferencing comprising capturing first user environment image data with a first image capture device in a first user environment for transmission over a communications network, and capturing second user environment image data with a second image capture device in a second user environment for transmission over the communications network. The method further includes monitoring at least one lighting condition in the first user environment and at least one lighting condition in the second user environment with a conference management server coupled to the network, the conference management server receiving the first user environment image data and the second user environment image data. The method also includes receiving lighting control instructions from the conference management server at a first computing device associated with the first image capture device, and receiving lighting control instructions from the conference management server at a second computing device associated with the second image capture device. The lighting control instructions from the conference management server cause the first and second computing devices to generate an outer frame area and an inner frame area, the outer frame area controlling at least one lighting condition in the respective user environment so that the at least one lighting condition remains within an operating range of the respective image capture device.","In yet other embodiments of the present invention, a machine-readable medium is provided. An executable program may be embodied in the medium, the program comprising instructions for the method of video conferencing as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","130","140","110"]},"The client computing device  may be implemented as a PlayStation\u00ae 3 from Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. It should be noted, however, that the client computing device  and its processor functionality may be implemented in other types of computing devices such as personal computers, workstations, laptop computers, wireless computing devices, portable media devices, or any other type of computing device that may be capable of receiving and processing graphical image data.","Video display device  may be any device configured for the display of video data such as a television or computer monitor. In one embodiment, video display device  receives graphical image data from client computing device  via an AV MULTI OUT connector that may be coupled to an integrated audio\/video cable and the requisite video and audio connectors. Various other connection mechanisms may also be used, for example, S VIDEO, an RFU adaptor, component video input (Y C\/PC\/P), and HDTV input (Y PP). In some embodiments, such as a portable media device, the client computing device  and video display device  may be integrated as is the case in a PlayStation\u00ae Portable from Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.","Image capture device  may be, in one embodiment of the present invention, a color digital camera device with functionality similar to that of a webcam. Image capture device  may be coupled to client computing device  via a USB cable. In some embodiments, image capture device  may utilize a wireless transmission protocol to exchange data with the client computing device  (e.g., 802.11x).","Image capture device  extracts specific information from captured multi-dimensional image data for subsequent presentation to a user of the device (e.g., a color image on visual display device  or for transmission to another user over a network as in  below). For example, captured image data may be integrated into a video game or other user-centric application (e.g., a workout or training video). Captured image data may also be utilized in a video conference or \u2018audio\/visual chat session\u2019 wherein the captured data may be transmitted to another user's computing device for display.","Image capture device  may be capable of capturing and mapping in three-dimensions in addition to normal two-dimensional video imagery. Similar to normal cameras, image capture device  captures two-dimensional data for a plurality of pixels that comprise the video image. These values are color values for each pixel\u2014generally red, green, and blue (RGB) values. In this manner, objects captured by the image capture device  appear as two-dimensional objects on a monitor.","Unlike a conventional camera, however, image capture device  may also capture depth values in a particular field-of-view (e.g., a particular user environment). That is, image capture device  may capture the x and y components of an environment using RGB values for each pixel in the environment in addition to a z-component, which represents a depth value for the environment. (i.e., the z-axis).","In operation, a z-value may be captured for each pixel of the scene, each z-value representing a distance from the camera to a particular object in the scene corresponding to the related pixel. A maximum detection range may be defined beyond which depth values will not be detected. Through the use of z-value capture, each object can be tracked in three-dimensions whereby the z-values along with the two-dimensional pixel data can be processed to create an enhanced three-dimensional interactive environment for the user.","An input image processor (not shown) at client computing device  translates the captured video images and depth data into signals that are delivered to an output image processor (not shown) at the client computing device . The output image processor may be programmed to effect movement and status of virtual objects on the video display device  in response to signals received from the input image processor. In some embodiments, input and output image processors may be an integrated part of the hardware and software configuration of the image capture device . In other embodiments, such processing functionality may be partially distributed over a network like that shown in , such processing taking place at, for example, a conferencing management server. Some embodiments of the image capture device  may also be configured for the capture and subsequent processing of visual data in high-definition.","Various image processing techniques allow a user to interact with the image capture device  using motion, color detection and, in some embodiments, sound through a built-in microphone or other audio input device (not shown) coupled to the image capture device  or client computing device . Certain interaction techniques are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/759,782 for a \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Light Input Device\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser.

Image capture device  may comprise a pivot thereby allowing for positioning of the device and its related field-of-view. The image capture device  may further comprise a rotational ring around the camera lens for manual focus control. Some embodiments of the image capture device  may provide for automated positioning and focusing through the use of a directional-sensitive microphone that tracks a source of audio (e.g., an individual who is speaking) and the focus of the image capture device  may be subsequently adjusted according to the position of the audio source relative to the image capture device .","Referring now to , a block diagram of one embodiment of a client computing device  () is illustrated. Client computing device  may be used to aid in the generation of real-time, three-dimensional, interactive environment data. The client computing device  may be communicatively coupled to image capture device  in order to generate the aforementioned environment data.","The client computing device  may comprise, but is not limited to, a main memory , a central processing unit (CPU) , vector processing units VU  and VU , a graphics processing unit (GPU) , all of which may be coupled via a bus  to an input\/output processor (IOP) . The client computing device  may also comprise an IOP memory , a controller interface , a memory card , a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface , and an IEEE 1394 interface . The client computing device  may further include an operating system read-only memory (OS ROM) , a sound processing unit (SPU) , an optical disc control unit , and a hard disc drive (HDD) , all of which may be connected via a bus  to IOP .","Some embodiments of the client computing device  may also include a network adaptor , which may offer an Ethernet connection  and\/or telephony connection . The client computing device , in one embodiment, may be an electronic gaming console although client computing device  (or portions thereof) may also be implemented as a general-purpose computer, a set-top box, a hand-held gaming device, or in a mobile device such as a cellular phone. It should further be noted that various other system architectures may be utilized within the scope of the present invention such as the computer architecture and high speed processing model disclosed in U.S. patent publication number 2002-0138637 for a \u201cComputer Architecture and Software Cells for Broadband Networks,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The CPU , the VU , the VU , the GPU , and the IOP  communicate via a system bus . The CPU  communicates with the main memory  via a dedicated bus . The VU  and the GPU  may also communicate with one another via a dedicated bus . The CPU  executes programs stored in the OS ROM  and the main memory . The main memory  may contain pre-stored programs and may also contain programs transferred via the IOP  from a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or other optical disc (not shown) using the optical disc control unit . The IOP  controls data exchanges between the CPU , the VU , the VU , the GPU  and other devices of the system, such as the controller interface , or from other such systems via the network adaptor .","The GPU  executes drawing instructions from the CPU  and the VU  to produce images for display on a display device (not shown). The VU  transforms objects from three-dimensional coordinates to two-dimensional coordinates, and sends the two-dimensional coordinates to the GPU . The SPU  executes instructions and processes data to produce sound signals that are output on an audio device (not shown).","A user of the client computing device  provides instructions to the CPU  via a controller coupled to the controller interface . Controller may be any control device, for example, a joystick, a set of directional buttons, and\/or other control buttons. An exemplary controller is illustrated in  (). A user may instruct the CPU  to store certain information on the memory card , which may be removable (e.g., a flash memory or other non-volatile memory card), or may instruct a character in a game to perform some specified action. Other devices may be connected to the system via the USB interface  and the IEEE 1394 interface . As previously noted, the image capture device  may be coupled to the client computing device  utilizing a USB connector or, in another example, a wireless Ethernet network through Ethernet connection .","In that regard, some embodiments of the client computing device  comprise a network adaptor  that provides the hardware functionality necessary for the client computing device  to connect to a network. The network adaptor  may comprise, for example, a system connector that operates to connect the network adaptor  to the client computing device  through an expansion bus connector . The network adaptor  may also comprise a power connector and data connector to allow for the provisioning of power from the client computing device  to the network adaptor  and the exchange of data between the client computing device  and the network adaptor . Network adaptor  may be fully integrated with the client computing device  or may be a detachable hardware device that may be implemented in older legacy client computing devices .","In some embodiments of the present invention, the network adaptor  may also require the installation of certain software on the client computing device  to allow for identification and connection to a particular IP address and\/or dial-up to a particular Internet Service Provider. Software may also provide other functionalities, such as the creation and maintenance of user profiles, in addition to functional interaction between the client computing device  and the network adaptor . Such software or data related to such functionality may be embodied on CD-ROMs for games or applications requiring a network connection; stored on memory card ; or part of a firmware upgrade.","The network adaptor  may also comprise an Ethernet connection . Through the Ethernet connection , a network cable (e.g., a 100 Base-TX or 10-Base T) may be coupled to the network adaptor  for connection to a network. The network cable may, for example, be communicatively coupled to a DSL or cable modem. The network cable may also be communicatively coupled to, for example, a router via a LAN port; the router may then be coupled to a DSL or cable modem through a WAN port. In further embodiments, the Ethernet connection  may allow for a network cable to be connected to a wireless Ethernet bridge. The wireless Ethernet bridge may be communicatively coupled to a wireless router utilizing, for example, an 802.11x protocol. The wireless router may be further communicatively coupled to a cable or DSL modem.","The network adaptor  may also comprise a telephony connection . Through the telephony connection , a standard telephone line with, for example, an RJ-11C telephone connector may be connected to the network adaptor  and a telephone wall jack. In this regard, the network adaptor  may further comprise modem functionality such that the client computing device  may communicate data over the public switched telephone network via the telephony connection .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","310","320","300","120","130","200","210","300","226"]},"Inner frame area  and outer frame area  are artificial boundaries that may be created by client computing device  as the result of drawing instructions from the CPU  being executed by GPU . The dimensions of these areas may be determined by or in light of a particular software title being executed (e.g., a video game title utilizing an image capture device ) or by a server component as might be utilized in an \u2018audio\/visual chat\u2019 session as is discussed in further detail in . In some embodiments\u2014for example, in the case of a 4:3 game shown on a 16:9 display\u2014the outer frame area  may be the extra \u2018dead space\u2019 on the sides of a widescreen display.","Referring to , the size of outer frame area  is larger than that of the corresponding frame area  in . Accordingly, the inner frame area  of  is smaller than that of the corresponding frame area  in . The inner frame area  and outer frame area  may also be subject to particular user configurations or settings that may be saved on memory card  or some other memory device coupled to the client computing device .","In one embodiment of the present invention, video game data will be displayed in the inner frame area . This could include image data of the user as might be generated by the image capture device  or a derived visual game state based upon the image data of the user. For example, the image capture device  may capture an image of the user for insertion into a game environment in the form of an avatar. Similarly, the image capture device  may generate data used to determine whether the user came into contact with a particular portion of the game environment by \u2018grabbing\u2019 at an object or providing input data through a prop device. This real-world activity or interaction may be reflected in the game environment as a result of the user, for example, swinging at a baseball with a baseball bat prop device in an interactive baseball game. An image capture device  tracks and captures the swinging of the baseball bat prop device and, through the necessary image processors, translates that real-world activity into on-screen display data.","The inner frame area  may also be used to display \u2018chat\u2019 session data such as the image of a remote participant communicating with the user. The inner frame area  may also display multi-media data generated by the remote participant and transmitted to the present user in the form of a textual \u2018instant message\u2019 or a short video clip. Various types of interactive data may also be displayed in the inner frame area  such as an interactive game (e.g., chess or checkers) or a collaborative document (e.g., a report that is being concurrently edited by one or more parties).","As has been previously noted, image capture device  may require certain light levels or light conditions in order for the image capture device  to function properly or optimally. If the environment in which the image capture device  is operating in lacks sufficient light, certain data (e.g., user interactions or prop input data) may not be detected because the image capture device  cannot properly discern various x-y-z position values, color differentiations, or otherwise detect motion of a user or object. Image capture device , in conjunction with software and\/or hardware operating internally to the image capture device , at the client computing device , and\/or by an intermediate server as is discussed in , will determine whether there is proper light present in the environment to properly capture data (e.g., with respect to a target histogram). Similar determinations may be made with regard to, for example, the presence of too much light if the image capture device  or a client computing device  coupled to the image capture device  is configured with an infrared (IR) receiver to receive commands from a remote control (e.g., camera on\/camera off). Various other spectral emissions may be subject to such user environment light control.","In the event that there is a determination that insufficient light exists to properly capture image data, the outer frame area  may be used to provide additional light to the user environment such that the video display device  operates as an artificial light source (e.g., certain RGB values of individual pixels in the video display device  are adjusted as to average a necessary user environment light level). That is, the outer frame area  will become visibly brightened with a particular color and\/or intensity of light such that the video display device  lights the environment proximate to the image capture device  whereby image data may be properly captured for subsequent processing.","For example, a user may be utilizing the image capture device  to play the aforementioned simulated baseball game with a prop device. As such, the user may find an avatar of themselves inserted into the \u2018home plate\u2019 video game environment and displayed in the inner frame area  of . If the image capture device  and related processing utilities determine that there is insufficient light in the scene environment to properly track the prop device or any other aspect of the user, the video game software operating at client computing device  may (via CPU ) cause the execution of rendering instructions by the GPU  that causes the rendering on the display device  of a white \u2018filler\u2019 in the outer frame area  (i.e., the execution of drawing instructions that causes the individual pixels within the outer frame area  to display a particular luminance and\/or shading). The inner frame area  would continue to display the baseball video game and related information while simultaneously becoming surrounded by a white \u2018halo\u2019 in the outer frame area .","This white \u2018halo\u2019 displayed by the video display device  will \u2018spill\u2019 into the real-world environment of the user\u2014that is, the light emitted by the display and measured in candelas per meter squared (cd\/m)\u2014whereby the video display device  actually becomes an alternative light source. This additional light generated by the video display device  will result in the generation of sufficient additional light to allow for the image capture device  to properly capture image data for processing. The intensity of the \u2018halo\u2019 emitted by the outer frame area  can be controlled in part by the particular rendering instructions from GPU ; that is, how white (what shade of white) and how bright (the intensity thereof).","In some embodiments of the present invention, the particular hardware configuration of the video display device  may be taken into account such that the GPU  may optimize the resources at its disposal with regard to manipulating the outer frame area  and the light emitted by the same. These configurations may be automatically detected by the client computing device  or provided to the client computing device  through user input as to particular configurations, the brand and model of the video display device  (which in turn corresponds to particular operating specifications), and so forth. In some embodiments, client computing device  may consult a look-up table or other data store (either locally or over a network) to identify particular operating capabilities (e.g., bit depth) for a particular display model if those capabilities are not immediately identified by the user or through certain plug-and-play (PnP) functionality.","For example, a liquid crystal display (LCD) in a flat screen television comprises a certain resolution (i.e., the number of dots of color\u2014pixels\u2014on the display) referenced by a horizontal axis (rows) and vertical axis (columns). A wide aspect 22-inch LCD monitor may conform to the WUXGA (Wide Ultra Extended Graphics Array) standard and comprise a resolution of 1920\u00d71200 whereas a smaller device such as a 15-inch LCD monitor may only conform to the XGA (Extended Graphics Array) standard and comprise a resolution of 1024\u00d7768. While an LCD display device is referenced, the present invention is equally applicable to a CRT-based display.","Additionally, the particular display mode of a video display device  determines how many colors that video display device  can display. For example, a display that is configured to operate in SuperVGA mode can display 16,777,216 colors (also known as true color) the result of a 24-bit-long description of a pixel (the bit depth). For example, in 24-bit bit depth, eight bits are dedicated to each of the three additive primary colors (RGB). The bit depth therefore determines the number of colors that can be displayed at one time. To create a single colored pixel an LCD, for example, uses three sub-pixels with red, green, and blue filers. Subject to the control and variation of the voltage applied, the intensity of each sub-pixel can range over 256 shades. Combining the sub-pixels produces a possible palette of 16.8 million colors (256 shades of red\u00d7256 shades of green\u00d7256 shades of blue).","The brightness of the light emitted into the user environment can also be affected by the size of the outer frame area  relative the inner frame area . Returning to , by filling the outer frame area  with white image data, a certain degree of luminance may be created. Identical white image data (i.e., the same intensity and shade) in , however, will create a greater degree of luminance in that the outer frame area  of  is larger than that of . Thus, the amount of light that is generated by the video display device  though a \u2018halo\u2019 may be dynamically controlled during the use of image capture device .","For example, the image capture device  and related client computing device  may be in a room with a window in the late afternoon. While there may be sufficient natural light to support image data capture at the time game play commences, as the afternoon continues and the natural light source begins to disappear (i.e., the sun sets), there may be insufficient light for the image capture device  to properly continue to capture image data. The outer frame area  may, at that point, be illuminated as a white halo to provide the additional light necessary to allow for game play to continue. The intensity of the light, as noted, may be controlled by the client computing device  that may be running game software that has been calibrated with the image capture device  to determine when the proper amount of light is present to allow for the game to function as intended. In that regard, requisite light settings may be predetermined or calibrated based on the particular game and\/or user environment.","As natural light continues to disappear throughout the course of the day, the intensity of the artificial light source emitted from the video display device  may be gradually increased. For example, a dull gray light source in the outer frame area  may provide sufficient light at 4:00 PM but a flat white emission may be required from the outer frame area  at 6:00 PM. The intensity of the light may also be increased (e.g., the brightness of the light). At some point, the limitations of the video display device  may be such that even the most intense white available does not provide sufficient \u2018artificial light\u2019 to allow game play to continue. At that point, the GPU  may cause for the size of the inner frame area  to decrease and the outer frame area  to increase thereby providing additional artificial light (i.e., additional individual pixels in the screen display utilized for illumination purposes versus the display of game data).","In some instances, particular portions of the user environment may be subject to insufficient lighting conditions. For example, the right side of a room may have an open window whereby sufficient light may be provided to allow for image data capture. The left side of the room, however, may have window shades drawn such that no natural light may be entering that portion of the user environment. The orientation of the inner frame area  and outer frame area  may be adjusted such that the inner frame area  may be moved to the far right hand side of the video display device  whereby the inner frame area  may be off-center but providing a larger, focused outer frame area  on the left-side of the display such that additional artificial light may be generated by the video display device . The positioning and centering of the frame areas  and  may be dynamically adjusted as use of the image capture device  continues.","Alternatively, particular gradations of color from one side of the video display device  to another may be implemented wherein the orientation of the inner frame area  and the outer frame area  may remain constant. In the aforementioned example where the left side of a room is darker than the right, the portion of the outer frame area  relative the left side of the room may emit a white light while the right side of the outer frame area  displays a neutral background color in that sufficient natural light is present on the right side of the room. A gradual gradation of color (from white to black) between the left side of the outer frame area  to the right side may bridge the two \u2018sides\u2019 of the outer frame area .","Particular portions of the outer frame area  (or other frame areas in the case of multiple frames surrounding the inner frame area ) may be subdivided into various sub-sections. Each of those sub-sections may be subject to various lighting controls. For example, the outer frame area  may be sub-divided into four quadrants: an upper right, upper left, lower right, and lower left quadrant. Each of those individual quadrants may be subject to various lighting controls (e.g., the upper right and lower left corner of the frame may be illuminated while the upper left and lower right are not). These various controls include color, luminance, and any other condition that may be controlled by the various systems and methods disclosed herein.","The various sub-divisions may also be subjected to various shapes for both functional and aesthetic reasons. For example, instead of squares and rectangles, various triangle or other polygonal configurations may be implemented. Various circular or elliptical patterns may also be used. These and any other shape or design capable of being displayed (e.g., lines, squiggles, waves, dots, splotches, etc.) may be uniformly or randomly displayed as a group or with a variety of shapes and each object subject to lighting control. Various shapes and patterns may also be subject to strobing (i.e., regular, controllable series of high power flashes rather than continuous light) for a variety of effects.","For example, strobing may be used to create a strobe light feature in the user environment or, similarly, to counter an effect caused by natural or other artificial light conditions in the user environment. Certain video games or television programs that may cause epileptic fits, feelings of vertigo, and the like and that might be displayed in the inner frame area  may be countered through a counter-strobe effect in the outer frame area . In that regard, the presently described lighting control systems and methods may also be implemented with traditional television programming in addition to \u2018chat\u2019 sessions and video games.","As noted, certain calibrations may take place through the image capture device . The image capture device  may, at start-up, sample the user environment to determine various lighting conditions and the effect those conditions will have on image capture over a particular operating range (e.g., lowest possible range of capture to an optimal range of capture). The image capture device, in conjunction with the various lighting controls discussed herein as implemented by various hardware and\/or software operations, may then adjust certain user environment lighting conditions through inner frame area  and outer frame area  lighting manipulations (e.g., size, brightness, orientation, color). During the course of these adjustments, the image capture device  may \u2018re-sample\u2019 the environment to determine what environmental control condition will allow for a particular operation of a game or \u2018audio\/video chat\u2019 session in light of the particular environment.","The client computing device  in conjunction with particular \u2018chat\u2019 or video game software may make that determination or such a determination may come as a result of a management server determination as is described in the context of . Similarly, the determination of a particular user environment condition may come from a user in another environment if that particular user is unable to properly view the first user in an \u2018audio\/video chat\u2019 session. That decision by a second user may be made by selecting an available environment setting in light of several environmental control conditions.","For example, during the start-up calibration, the first user environment may be subject to three different intensities of a particular color of light; three different colors of light; and three different frame area sizes. The image capture device  may capture an image of each of those nine possible environments. The effect of that particular environment control may then be displayed to the second user in the form of a still frame or even a short (e.g., 5 second) video clip. The second user may then select the particular environment control based on the image or clip that appears best. A user operating in a solo environment (e.g., playing a video game) may select a particular environmental control in a similar fashion.","These calibrations or adjustments may occur at start-up of a game or chat session or may occur dynamically during the session. For example, adjustments may occur automatically during game play or at breaks such as between levels. Adjustments may further occur in response to a user action wherein a query may be made such as during a pause. In some embodiments, a particular frame of data (e.g., an I-frame) may indicate the propriety and need to readjust lighting conditions in the user environment.","Similarly, particular frames of data may be recognized during the decoding process as likely to cause certain changes in the user environment. For example, incoming image data of a conference remote participant may consist of a bright white background that will spill into the user environment thereby causing an unintended change in user environment lighting conditions. These environment changing conditions may be identified in advance such that when the actual image data may be rendered that video display device  will have already adjusted an inner frame area  and\/or outer frame area  as may be appropriate such that no adverse affect or change to the user environment occurs.","It should be noted that in some embodiments of the present invention, the outer frame area  may always be present but simply unutilized (i.e., a neutral background color such as black). The frame area may then be \u2018filled\u2019 as needed in response to GPU  executing a drawing instruction from the CPU . In other embodiments, the actual graphic images to be displayed may occupy the majority of the game screen and, as such, only the inner frame area  may be displayed. If and when an artificial light emission is necessary from a \u2018halo\u2019 generated by the outer frame area , the software executed by the CPU  and otherwise controlling the display of the frame areas  and  and interacting with the image capture device  may cause the GPU  to reconfigure the game environment (e.g., re-size the game environment to fit in a small inner frame area ) such that the outer frame area  may now be displayed and emit the appropriate \u2018halo\u2019 of artificial light.","The re-sizing of the various frame areas may occur during the course of game play (e.g., the re-sizing occurs as game play progresses). Alternatively, the re-sizing may occur only during pauses in game action such as to avoid the size of the environment and various characters changing while game play is occurring (i.e., to avoid a vertigo-type effect). Additionally, re-sizing may actually cause an automatic pause in game play with a query issued to the user as to whether re-sizing is permitted. In these instances, the amount of natural light may be sufficient to allow game play to continue but not without some processing errors. If game play deteriorates to the point that additional light is necessary, the user may be asked whether they wish to activate the illumination control feature of the present invention. If not (e.g., the user does not wish to minimize the size of the actual game environment in the inner frame area ), the user may manually provide another source of artificial light through, for example, an overhead lamp or other light source in the actual user environment. Various user input may be provided through, for example, controller  in addition to other inputs such as voice-recognition.","In some embodiments, different colors or shades of colors may also be utilized to maximize the color balance of a particular user environment. For example, a user may have different light sources offering different colors of light. These varying colors may cause difficulty with the image capture device  processing environment information, especially with regard to color differentiation. In these instances, the image capture device  may identify irregularities or processing difficulties in the environment in a manner similar to the identification of a lack of sufficient light. The outer frame area  may used in a similar manner as to produce different colors and intensity of light to counterbalance certain overexposures in the particular environment. In some embodiments, additional frame areas may be used (e.g., a third, fourth, or fifth frame area) such that combinations of certain colors (e.g., yellow and blue individual halos to create an overall green appearance) may be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","420","410","420"]},"In , the outer frame area  has been \u2018filled\u2019 such that it now reflects white light \u2018halo\u2019 as referenced in the context of . The inner frame area  has also been reduced in that the lighting conditions in the environment of the user receiving the present image have made it necessary to increase the amount of light emitted into that environment. As such, the outer frame area  was expanded at the expense of the inner frame area .","In some embodiments of the present invention, the inner frame area  may need to be reduced in that the graphic data in the inner frame area  is inadvertently creating excess light and thereby oversaturating the user environment. For example, in the aforementioned baseball game example, if the user hits a home run, the image displayed may pan upward to the sky to follow the path of the baseball as it travels toward the outskirts of the ballpark. As the scene pans toward the sky, the screen display will become predominantly white and gray (i.e., colors of the sky and clouds). These bright colors may \u2018spill\u2019 into the user environment, which may cause image data capture difficulties. In response to such a situation, the inner frame area  may decrease in size to reduce the amount of secondary light \u2018spillage\u2019 into the user environment. Additionally, the outer frame area  may be darkened to help counter suddenly excess bright light being emitted from the inner frame area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"In step  an image capture device may attempt to capture image data from a user environment. In step , a determination may be made whether adverse lighting conditions are inhibiting the processing of the image capture data or the actual capture of the data. If there are no adverse conditions present and the image data is captured and processed without incident, image data capture proceeds as necessary followed by subsequent processing of the data.","If it is determined in step  that adverse lighting conditions do exist, an attempt may be made to adjust display intensity in step . This may occur through various adjustments whereby the outer frame area may be \u2018filled\u2019 with a particular color and intensity of light as discussed in the context of  and A and B above. If the adjustment as to display intensity is not sufficient, then (in step ), frame image boundaries may be enlarged (or reduced as is appropriate) in order to increase or decrease the total amount of artificial light projected into the user environment.","While step  and the adjustment of frame boundaries is recited as following step  and the adjustment of light intensity, this is not to suggest the necessity of a step-by-step process. Both adjustments may occur concurrently or frame adjustment may occur prior to intensity adjustment in that  is an exemplary embodiment only.

In that regard, such a system may comprise an image capture device, a video display device, and a client computing device having processor functionality. Systems \/ would be placed in the context of a user environment, such as a living room or a conference room, which would be located within the field-of-view of the image capture device.","Systems \/ may each be running software for facilitating a video-conference or video \u2018chat\u2019 session or otherwise related to a particular video game involving image data capture. The exchange of data between systems \/ may be limited to video images and accompanying audio. The session may further comprise additional ancillary data such as textual exchanges (e.g., closed captioning); various in-conference applications such as an enterprise application allowing for collaborative development between multiple users (e.g., a word processing document or presentation slide); video games that may be played on-line during the session; or other multi-media applications (e.g., a media player). These data exchanges are in addition to various session protocols related to establishing and maintaining the exchange of conferencing and other related data.","Through the aforementioned software, which may be accessed through optical disk control unit , the network adaptor  may initiate a conferencing session through, for example, Ethernet connection  over the communications network . Image data (and related audio data) may be captured through the image capture device, which may be coupled to the system  via, for example, USB interface . GPU , in turn, executes various drawing instructions related to not only the actual conferencing data (e.g., user images) but also the inner frame area and outer frame area and related illumination control commands (e.g., \u2018filling\u2019 the outer frame with a particular intensity and color) whereby lighting conditions of a particular environment may be controlled. Instructions related to control of lighting conditions in the particular environment may be a part of the video conferencing software executed by each system \/ or at server .","In some embodiments of the present invention, address book data may be stored on a removable data storage device as may be accessed through memory card interface .

The conferencing software may also include certain security features or parental controls to ensure that under-age children do not access the system  or are limited to sessions with particular, pre-approved conferees. Such information may also be stored on the aforementioned memory device. Conferencing software may further facilitate the generation of video mail such as a 30-second full-motion video. Software may further facilitate entry into various chat-rooms or interaction with certain applications, such as video games.","Communications network  comprises various communications facilities and mediums (e.g., telephony, wireless, satellite, cable, optic, and so forth) as may be provided by telecommunications companies and Internet Service Providers. Communications network  may be a geographically widespread network (e.g., a Wide Area Network (WAN)), like the Internet that depends upon the aforementioned communications facilities to link various network segments. In that regard, a WAN may ultimately be comprised of smaller linked communications networks such as Local Area Networks (LANs). A LAN is typically comprised of a group of computers and other devices dispersed over a relatively limited area and connected by, for example, a variety of broadband communications links. LANs may take on a variety of configurations including server client, peer-to-peer, peer groups, or a combination of the same. Communications network  may also be a closed, proprietary network.","In some embodiments of the present invention, a conferencing management server  may be utilized to conduct various video conferences or other user interactions. For example, system  may actually connect with server ; server  will then create a connection with system  and a \u2018chat\u2019 session may commence. Server  may provide various network controls such as connection acceptance, session initiation and termination, bandwidth management, conference recording (e.g., recording the conference session or a transcript of the same for future access); managing chat rooms or group sessions (e.g., sessions involving more than two participants); facilitating certain data exchanges ancillary to the actual conference (e.g., documents, presentations, video games); and also ensuring proper control of lighting conditions in a particular user environment.","In the latter example, the server  may monitor lighting conditions in the conferencing environment of each system (\/) and adjust certain frame settings through the necessary drawing instructions such that proper lighting conditions are maintained at both ends of the conference. In this regard, server  may actually provide the drawing instructions for execution by the appropriate system to \u2018fill\u2019 a frame or adjust the size of the same. Server  may also receive various indications from each system (\/) concerning the quality of lighting conditions at the other system (\/) and facilitate adjustments as is appropriate by communicating the various indications to various participant devices.","Server  may also host the necessary software for the conference to take place. In such an instance, the systems \/ may comprise only minimal application data necessary to contact the server  to indicate the desire to participate in a conference session. Critical conferencing architecture software and execution of the same may then occur at the server , which may have considerably more processing power than the end-user device (e.g., an entertainment system). By leaving heavy processing to the more powerful conferencing server (like server ), conferencing exchanges do not \u2018slow down\u2019 or experience jitter due to processing delays at the various end-users and their related computing devices. In some embodiments of the present invention, like those utilizing a high speed processing model as disclosed in U.S. patent publication number 2002-0138637 for a \u201cComputer Architecture and Software Cells for Broadband Networks,\u201d server  may also manage various distributed computing operations.","In some embodiments of the present invention, the control of lighting conditions in a user environment can also be associated with bandwidth and processing availability. For example, in MPEG compression, images are represented in YUV color space (YCbCr) wherein 24-bits per pixel are present: 8-bits for luminance (Y) and 8-bits for each of the two chrominance (U), (V) elements. The chrominance information in the YUV color space data may be sub-sampled in both the horizontal and vertical direction. All of the luminance information may be retained, however, as the human eye is more sensitive to luminance information rather than chrominance information. Frames of video are subsequently divided into 16\u00d716 macro-blocks consisting of four 8\u00d78 luminance blocks and two 8\u00d78 chrominance blocks (1 U and 1 V).","Each frame of video data may then be encoded as one of three types of frames: intra-frame (I-frames), forward predicted frame (P-frames), and bi-directional predicted frames (B-frames). In the case of an I-frame, the frame may be encoded as a single image with no reference to past or future frames. Further, with the exception of data quantization following the encoding of each 8\u00d78 block from a spatial domain to a frequency domain utilizing the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the aforementioned sub-sampling, there is no lossy compression in an I-frame\u2014especially with regard to luminosity. The other frame types\u2014P-frames (relative to a past reference frame) and B-frames (relative to a past reference frame, a future reference frame or both)\u2014refer to the I-frame. Thus, decreasing certain luminosity information in the I-frame would represent savings with regard to the all of the frames in a stream of video data.","In this regard, the image data captured from the user environment could be accepted at the lowest possible operating condition. That is, lighting controls would illuminate a user environment no more so than necessary in order to reduce the amount of luminosity data being captured, compressed and subsequently transmitted over a network. This decreased luminosity data represents not only savings in bandwidth at a transmitting computing device, a receiving computing device, and over the network backbone but can also recognize a savings with regard to processing cycles at a computing device perform digitization and compression following image capture.","A utility related to preservation of bandwidth and processing power vis-\u00e0-vis the image capture device and\/or related hardware or software may be manually implemented by a user. For example, a user may recognize that their particular computing device lacks accelerated processing power or may be coupled to a low bandwidth network or, similarly, that a recipient of data captured by the image capture device suffers from similar limitations. In these instances, the user may activate such a utility to avoid bottlenecks of data.","Similarly, this preservation utility may be implemented on an as-needed basis, the need being recognized by a network congestion monitoring utility like ping, which utilizes the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and trace route, which utilizes the Uniform Datagram Protocol (UDP), to measure network response time. These and other network utilities may be implemented in various network devices (e.g., switches or routers) or through large-scale platforms like the Network Application Performance Analysis Solution (NAPAS) for Cisco Systems. Indicia of network congestion generated by these applications and solutions may be provided to a computing device operating certain software related to image capture (e.g., a client computing device or a conference management server) such that bandwidth and\/or processor preservation may be activated through the manipulation of lighting conditions that are not optimal but otherwise sufficient to allow for continued image data capture.","In certain embodiments wherein one end of a video data exchange degrades a particular lighting condition for the purposes of improved processing or transmission time, the recipient of that data may adjust the incoming video data such that it does not appear as lesser quality image data. For example, the incoming video data may be pre-processed such that luminance that was degraded by the sender of the data may be artificially amplified by the recipient through editing or video pre-processing editing software that automatically adjusts the data as it is decoded and rendered.","While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. In addition, modifications may be made without departing from the essential teachings of the present invention. Various alternative systems may be utilized to implement the various methodologies described herein and various methods may be used to achieve certain results from the aforementioned systems. For example, a light emitting diode (not shown) on an image capture device  may be used to provide certain strobing conditions or to otherwise operate as an additional artificial light source that may be balanced with the various frame image areas of a video display display ."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
