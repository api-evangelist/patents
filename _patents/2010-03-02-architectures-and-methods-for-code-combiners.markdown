{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA8802-09-C-0001 awarded by the Department of the United States Air Force. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation techniques are used in various communications fields to allow multiple access (i.e., multiple data signals to be transmitted on a single channel). According to CDMA, each data signal is modulated with a pseudo-random code having a wider bandwidth than the data signal. The result is a spread-spectrum user signal or code. Different data signals to be transmitted on the same channel may utilize different pseudo-random codes. A receiver of a particular data signal may either have or may derive the pseudo-random code with which its respective data signal was modulated. The receiver may utilize the appropriate pseudo-random code to demodulate the user signal or code and derive the original data signal. User signals or codes modulated by pseudo-random codes not known to the receiver will appear as noise.","It is often desirable to amplify a CDMA signal composed of many individual user signals or codes (e.g., to transmit the signal). For example, a global positioning system (GPS) satellite may transmit a combination of multiple GPS signals. Also, for example, a mobile telephone base station may transmit a combination of multiple CDMA signals corresponding to different conversations or other data transactions. In many applications, highly linearized power amplifiers (LPA's) may be used to amplify signals comprising a combination of codes. LPA's generate an output signal with minimal distortion, however, suffer from poor power efficiency. When a higher power efficiency is required, high-power nonlinear power amplifiers (HPA's) may be used. HPA's, however, generate a large number of distortion terms that are present, along with the input signal, at the amplifier output. In addition, there is some loss in the signal power as a component of the amplifier output power is used up by the distortion terms. It is possible to minimize the distortion terms and associated output power loss by configuring the HPA with a larger output power back-off. This, however, also reduces DC-RF power conversion efficiency.","It is known to reduce HPA distortion by pre-combining CDMA codes prior to amplification according to a majority logic scheme. A majority logic combiner counts the number of codes at its input that have a value of +1 and \u22121 during any chip period. The output is set to which ever value (e.g., +1 or \u22121) occurs in a majority of the signals. Where M is the number of codes to be combined, the output of a majority logic combiner at any time k may be equal to +1 if the number of codes that take the value +1 is greater than or equal to (M+1)\/2 and is equal to \u22121 otherwise. For example, Table 1 below shows a chart illustrating the output (v) of a majority logic combiner operating on three input codes (c, c, c):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Majority Logic Combiner Output"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["c","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","+1","+1","+1","+1"]},{"entry":["c","\u22121","\u22121","+1","+1","\u22121","\u22121","+1","+1"]},{"entry":["c","\u22121","+1","\u22121","+1","\u22121","+1","\u22121","+1"]},{"entry":["v","\u22121","\u22121","\u22121","+1","\u22121","+1","+1","+1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"sub":"0"},"Majority logic combining may allow HPA amplifiers to operate more effectively, however, the majority logic combining process itself may introduce distortion terms, which can be amplified by the HPA, leading to signal degradation.","Various embodiments are directed to signum code combiners that combine a plurality of codes and have three possible logical outputs, +1, \u22121 and 0. For example, the output of the signum combiner may be +1 if the sum of the input signals is greater than zero; \u22121 if the sum of the input signals is less than zero and zero if the sum of the input signals is equal to zero. Various embodiments are also directed to signum combiners have various additional features including, for example, successive signal insertion signum combiners, signum combiners with interlacing, and weighted coefficient signum combiners.

comparison of Table 7 with Table 5 above demonstrates that the signum combiner provides an improved signal to distortion ratio (SDR) and power efficiency over the majority logic combiner. For example, for M=4 codes, the signum combiner has an SDR \u03b3 of 9.54 dB. The majority logic combiner has an SDR \u03b3 of 4.77 dB when M=3 and an SDR \u03b3 of 3.74 dB for M=5. The average SDR \u03b3 of the majority logic combiner between the case where M=3 and the case where M=5 is 4.25 dB. Compared with the SDR \u03b3 for the signum combiner when M=4, this represents an improvement of more than 5 dB. Also, the power loss to distortion Pof the signum combiner when M=4 is equal to 0.46 dB, compared with majority logic combiner's 1.39 dB average between the M=3 and M=5 cases. Similarly, the power efficiency, defined as the ratio of Pand Pis equal to 90% with M=4 for the sigma combiner compared to 72.5% average for M=3 and M=5 for the majority logic combiner. As the power conversion efficiency of the high-power non-linear amplifier (HPA) with both the majority logic and signum combiners is about same, the signum combiner may result in a very significant overall power efficiency improvement. For example, with a 60% conversion efficiency of the HPA, the overall efficiency of the sigma combiner may be 54% (0.9 0.6 100%) compared to 43.5% for the majority logic combiner. These advantages may be obtained with about 1 dB reduction in the signal power P. However, as shown in the following, the signal power Pcan be increased at the cost of a nominal reduction in the SDR which still remains relatively high.","In addition to the mathematical analysis presented, the performance of a signum combiner was also obtained utilizing a computer simulation developed in the MATLAB software package available from THE MATHWORKS. According to the simulation, a signum combiner with an output given by Equation (2) above was input with M random codes of length 8192. The amplitudes of the signal terms, denoted by awere obtained by correlating the combiner output with the various input codes. Fifty simulations were run.

For example,  illustrates one embodiment of an architecture  for utilizing a cascaded set of signum combiners to combine code groups of differing power. According to various embodiments, the architecture  and generalized versions thereof may be referred to as successive signal insertion signum combiners. In the embodiment illustrated by the architecture , three code groups are received: CG, CG, CG. Codes within a common group may have the same power level. Also, for code CGmay have the highest power, with CGhaving a power less than or equal that of CGand CGhaving a power less than or equal to CG. Each of the code groups CG, CG, CGmay be provided as input to respective signum combiners , , . The output of the signum combiner  corresponding to the highest power code group (CG) may be provided as input to a logic converter . The output of the logic converter  may provide a magnitude of its input. For example, if the output of the signum combiner  is equal to +1 or \u22121, the output of the logic converter  may be 1. If the output of the signum combiner  is equal to 0, then the output of the logic converter  may be 0. The output of the logic converter  may be provided to the inhibit input of a tri-state gate , whose input is connected to the output of the signum combiner  corresponding to the next highest power code group (CG). Accordingly, the output of the tri-state gate  may be equal to zero when the signum combination of the CGcodes is equal to +1 or \u22121 and may be equal to the signum combination of the CGcodes when the signum combination of the CGcodes is equal to zero.","An additional signum combiner  may receive as input a signal that is the output of the signum combiner , corresponding to CG, and a signal that is the output of the tri-state gate . The output of the signum combiner  may be provided to a logic converter , which may operate in a manner similar to that of converter . The output of the logic converter may be provided to a tri-state gate . The input of the tri-state gate  may be the output of the signum combiner  corresponding to the next highest power code group (CG). An additional signum combiner  may receive as input a signal corresponding to the output of the combination of the CGand CGcodes (e.g., the output of the signum combiner ). In addition, the combiner  may receive an input that may be equal to 0 when the combination of CGand CGis equal to +1 or \u22121 and may be equal to the combination of CGwhen the combination of CGand CGis equal to zero. The output of the combiner  may be the output of the architecture .","The cascaded architecture  illustrated in  may be expanded for an arbitrary number of code groups CGwhere i=1 to N. The power of each code group CGmay decrease as i increases. The number of codes in each code group CGmay be given by M.

Code group CGmay be combined with code group CGutilizing the logic converter and tri-state gate logic shown in the architecture . The combination of groups CGand CGmay then be combined with the code group CG, also using the logic converter and tri-state gate logic shown in the architecture .

According to various embodiments, however, the output of a signum combiner may be modulated according to any suitable modulation scheme. For example,  illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulator  for modulating the output of a signum combiner. A signum combiner  may combine a series of codes c, for i=1 to n. The combiner  may be any suitable type of signum combiner including, for example, a successive insertion signum combiner, such as , an interlaced signum combiner, such as , or one or multiple stage weighted coefficients signum combiner, such as .","The output v(t) of the combiner  may be may be input to a square-root raised cosine filter  for band limiting. The resulting band limited signal v(t) may be input to a BPSK modulator , which may modulate the band limited signal v(t) with a carrier signal  to generate a modulated signal v(t) output. The output v(t) of the signum combiner may also be input to a three-to-two level logic converter . The output of the logic converter  may be 1 if the input is non-zero and 0 otherwise. The output of the logic converter  may be provided to a delay adjust  with a delay equal to that introduced by the filter . The output of the delay adjust may be provided to a switch  which may control the DC voltage (provided by supply ) to a power amplifier . When the logic converter output is 1 (e.g., when v(t) is \u22121 or 1), the switch  may be closed, allowing the amplifier  to amplify the modulated signal v(t), resulting in the transmission of an RF signal, v(t). When the logic converter output is zero (e.g., when v(t) is 0), the switch  may be open, preventing amplification of the modulated signal v(t) and, therefore, also preventing transmission. It will be appreciated that the power supply switch  may lead to some small distortion as it may block any signal caused by adjacent symbols during the period when the signum combiner output is zero. Nonetheless, the overall system may provide increased power efficiency, as set forth above.","According to various embodiments the band limiting filter  and power supply switch  may be omitted. When the filter  is omitted, the output v(t) of the modulator  may be zero when the combiner  output v(t) is also zero. For some power amplifiers , such as class B and class C amplifiers, there may be no conduction and, therefore, no transmission when the input is equal to zero. Accordingly, in embodiments where the filter  is omitted the power supply switch  may not be necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","502","100","200","300","504","504","502"],"sub":["i ","i ","i ","i","i ","q"]},"The output v(t) of the in-phase combiner  may be provided to a logic converter  having an output LCequal to 1 if the input is nonzero and equal to zero otherwise. Similarly, the quadruature signum combiner  output v(t) may be input to the logic converter  having an output LCequal to 1 if the input is nonzero and equal to zero otherwise. The logic converter outputs LCand LCmay be input to logic gates , ,  generating outputs L, Land L, respectively. Lmay be 1 if and only if LCis equal to 1 and LCis equal to zero. Lmay be equal to 1 if and only if both of the inputs LCand LCare equal to zero. Similarly, Lmay be equal to 1 if LCis equal to zero and LCis equal to 1. The logic outputs L, Land Lmay all equal zero if both LCand LCare equal to one.","The logic output Lmay be provided to and may control a multiplier switch . The multiplier switch  may provide an output v(t) that is equal to v(t) when Lis zero and is equal to the inphase combiner output v(t) multiplied by \u221a{square root over (2)} if Lis 1. Accordingly, when v(t) is non zero and v(t) is zero, the combiner output v(t) may be multiplied by \u221a{square root over (2)}. Similarly a multiplier switch  may generate an output v(t) that is equal to v(t) when Lis zero and equal to v(t) multiplied by \u221a{square root over (2)} when v(t) is nonzero and v(t) is zero (e.g., when Lis equal to one).","The outputs v(t), v(t) of the multiplier switches ,  may be input to the QPSK modulator , generating the QPSK modulated signal v(t) at the modulator output. The QPSK modulated signal v(t) may be input to the power amplifier , generating the amplified signal v(t). When both the inphase and quadrature signum combiner outputs v(t) and v(t) are zero, the logic output Lis 1 and the power supply switch  is turned to the ground position, disconnecting the DC power supply  from the power amplifier . Thus no DC power is supplied to the amplifier during the period when both v(t) and v(t) are zero resulting in zero output at the QPSK modulator output and ensuring high DC to AC power conversion efficiency. For the usual class B and C amplifier designs, there is no conduction with the amplifier input equal to 0 and thus the power supply switch may not be required. Again, when class B and\/or C amplifier designs are used for the power amplifier , there may not be any conduction when the input v(t) is equal to zero, and this the power supply switch  may be omitted.","The multiplication of the signum combiner outputs v(t) and v(t) by \u221a{square root over (2)} in a manner described herein may ensure that the QPSK modulated signal v(t) is a constant envelope signal when the dc power supply is ON and is zero otherwise. This may maximize the DC to RF power conversion efficiency of the power amplifier . Such a multiplication by \u221a{square root over (2)} may also result in a further improvement in terms of the transmitted signal power P. For example, with n=4 codes at the input of the in-phase combiner  and m=4 codes at the input of the quadrature combiner , the coefficients of the various code components present in the signal v(t) are equal to 0.433 compared to 0.375 for the signum combiner without such modification as given by Table 6. Multiplication by \u221a{square root over (2)} does not result in any increase in the peak envelope power at the amplifier input which is equal to A\u221a{square root over (2)} with or without the multiplication by \u221a{square root over (2)}. The corresponding power levels are P=0.7534 W and P=0.8599 W as compared to P=0.5625 W and P=0.625 W from Table 6. The signal-to-noise ratio \u03b3 is equal to 8.50 dB compared to 9.54 dB thus resulting in about 1 dB degradation. However, the increase in the signal power Pby 1.27 dB is desirable as the signal-to-noise ratio \u03b3 equal to 8.50 dB is relatively high especially compared to the traditional majority logic combiner with \u03b3 equal to 4.77 dB and 3.74 dB for the number of codes equal to three and four respectively as per the results of Table 5.","It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating other elements, for purposes of clarity.
