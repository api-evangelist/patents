title: Automatic sort and propagation associated with electronic documents
abstract: Techniques for automatic sort and propagation of information relating to electronic documents are presented. With regard to an electronic document, such as an incoming message, an enhanced information management component (EIMC) can analyze the document to identify a file folder associated with a subject to which the document relates. Based on interaction with or tagging of the document in a first user interface (UI) and predefined user preferences, the EIMC can propagate information relating to the subject and/or document to a second UI. The EIMC can archive the document in the identified file folder automatically or in response to as little as one UI control manipulation. The EIMC can analyze audio or video content to facilitate tagging and archiving of such content using the first UI and propagation of information relating to such content and/or related subject to a second UI.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject specification generally relates to electronic communication services, and, more particularly, to automatic sort and propagation associated with electronic documents.","Communication device users often use their communication devices (e.g., computer, mobile phone, electronic notepad, electronic netbook, etc.) to access information or electronic documents from web sites, email server, social network sites, content servers, etc., and to receive and send electronic documents, including messages (e.g., emails, text messages, multimedia messages) and associated content (e.g., audio or video content), and\/or social network messages or postings. Some users (e.g., business persons, attorneys, legal assistants, etc.) often receive dozens to hundreds of electronic messages every day. Managing the high volume of electronic messages can be very time consuming for users. For instance, when a user receives an email regarding a particular business matter, the user can desire to save the email to an electronic file folder relating to that business matter. Currently, the user has to search for and locate the folder and move (e.g., drag) the email to and\/or save the email in the folder. Performing such searching, locating, moving, and other message processing for a high volume of messages each day can be very time consuming and an inefficient use of the user's time.","Another issue is that conventional applications and user interfaces (UIs), for example, for use with email messages, typically process and present messages in a linear chronological manner to a user. However, a user can desire to have electronic documents, such as messages, and file folders processed and presented to the user based on subject, project, or topic, as opposed to linear chronological presentation of various messages relating to various subjects, projects, or topics.","Yet another issue is that a user often can be working with a group of users (e.g., fellow employees) on a particular project, and the user can take a certain action with regard to an electronic document relating to the project, wherein the action can have an impact on the project. While that user is aware of the action taken with regard to the electronic document and\/or the impact on the project, the other users in the group are not aware of the action taken with regard to the electronic document and the impact of such action on the project, and further, the other users may not even be aware of the electronic document if they weren't provided a copy (e.g., via \u201ccarbon copy\u201d (cc:)) of the electronic document. For example, the action taken with regard to the electronic document can impact a project timeline and\/or status of the project. Conventionally, unless the user proactively takes other action(s) (e.g., email message(s) to the other users, phone call(s) to the other users, face-to-face conversation(s) with the other users) to inform the other users in the group regarding the electronic document, the action the user took with regard to the electronic document, and the impact on the project timeline and\/or project status, the other users in the group may not be aware of such information.","The above-described deficiencies of today's systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non-limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.","The following presents a simplified summary of the various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Techniques for automatic sort and propagation of information associated with electronic documents are presented. With regard to an electronic document (e.g., email, text message, voice mail message, web page (e.g., social network page), hypertext document, word processing document, audio file comprising audio content, video file comprising video content, etc.), an enhanced information management component (EIMC) can analyze the electronic document to identify one or more items of key-content (e.g., keywords, keyphrases, key portion of audio or video content, key object, key link, key hyperlink, key electronic item, etc.) (or at least potential items of key-content) based at least in part on one or more tags stored in a data store, wherein the tags also can be respectively associated with electronic file folders in a directory and\/or stored in the data store or another desired storage location(s). Automatically, dynamically, or in response to user input received via a user interface (UI) component, the EIMC can associate a tag(s) with the electronic document, and can perform one or more document processing actions in relation to the electronic document.","The one or more document processing actions can comprise, for example, archiving the electronic document in a file folder associated with the tag and\/or a subject (e.g., client, project, topic, etc.) to which the electronic document relates; propagating the electronic document, or information relating to the electronic document, from the first communication device (e.g., on which the electronic document was originally displayed) to another communication device(s) (e.g., a communication device that is part of a group of communication devices (or group of users) associated with the tag) and\/or modifying an electronic item (e.g., associated with the second communication device; propagating interactions with (e.g., tagging of, identifying specified information in) the electronic document, in part, by searching a data store, message server, online sites, etc., to identify one or more other electronic documents to tag, retrieve, and\/or modify, based at least in part on the interactions with the electronic document; generating and\/or updating a progress summary or timeline associated with the tag associated with the electronic document based at least in part on information in or associated with the electronic document; transmitting notification messages relating to the electronic document or interactions with the electronic document; generating a file folder comprising relevant electronic documents or other information in relation to a scheduled meeting for a group of users, and providing the file folder to those users (e.g., via their respective communication devices) based at least in part on the tagging of respective electronic documents, information in or associated with the electronic documents associated with the tag(s), the progress summary or timeline associated with the tag(s), etc.; and\/or performing another desired document processing action. The EIMC can perform one or more of the document procession actions, based at least in part on user preferences of respective users and predefined document processing criteria, wherein there can be a subset of predefined document processing rules that correspond to the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences, and wherein the predefined document processing rules can be applied by the EIMC when interacting with electronic documents, electronic items (e.g., electronic file folder, icon displayed on a UI display screen, metadata, tags, hyperlinks, links between electronic documents and\/or items, links between items of information in an electronic document, etc.), and communication devices.","In an aspect, based at least in part on the results of the analysis of an electronic document, the EIMC can archive the electronic document in an identified file folder automatically or in response to as little as one UI control manipulation (e.g., mouse click). In still another aspect, the EIMC can analyze audio or video content in or associated with an electronic document to facilitate tagging and archiving of such content using the first communication device and\/or propagating information relating to such content and\/or related subject from the first communication device to a second communication device.","In accordance with various aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a method that includes the acts of linking a tag to an electronic document based on an item of information associated with the electronic document, wherein the item of information corresponds to the tag; and modifying an electronic item associated with the tag based on a subset of information associated with the electronic document.","In accordance with various other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a system that includes a data store configured to store a subset of tags, wherein the subset of tags comprises a tag associated with a subject. The system can further include an information management component configured to associate the tag with an electronic document based on identification of an item of information that is associated with the electronic document and corresponds to the subject, and modify an electronic item associated with the tag based on information relating to the electronic document.","In accordance with still other aspects, the disclosed subject matter can comprise a computer program product, comprising: a computer readable storage medium comprising computer executable instructions that, in response to execution by a computing system, cause the computing system to perform operations. The operations including linking a tag to an electronic document based on an item of information associated with the electronic document, wherein the item of information corresponds to the tag; and modifying an electronic item associated with the tag based on a subset of information associated with the electronic document.","The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the disclosed subject matter. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the various embodiments may be employed and the disclosed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and distinctive features of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent from the following detailed description of the various embodiments when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The disclosed subject matter is described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It may be evident, however, that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the various embodiments herein.","Communication device users often use their communication devices (e.g., computer, mobile phone (e.g., cellular phone, smart phone), personal digital assistant (PDA), electronic notepad, electronic netbook, electronic gaming device, another type of electronic device with communication capabilities, etc.) to access information or electronic documents from web sites, email server, social network sites, content servers, etc., and to receive and send electronic documents, including messages (e.g., emails, text messages, multimedia messages) and associated content (e.g., audio or video content), and\/or social network messages or postings. Some users (e.g., business persons, attorneys, legal assistants, etc.) often receive dozens to hundreds of electronic documents each day. Managing the high volume of electronic documents from the various sources can be very time consuming for users. For instance, when a user receives an email regarding a particular business matter, the user can desire to save the email, and\/or related attachment (e.g., word processing document, portable document format (PDF) document, music or video file, etc.) or links (e.g., link to an online page or site), to an electronic file folder to which the email or associated attachment(s) relates, wherein, for example, the folder can be associated with or relate to a particular subject (e.g., a business project, a client matter, product production, type of product or service, company audit, employees, human resources, payroll, employee benefits, etc.). Today, the user has to search for and locate the file folder in the directory and move (e.g., drag) the email or related attachment to and\/or save the email or related attachment in the file folder. Performing such searching, locating, moving, and other electronic document processing for a high volume of electronic documents each day can be very time consuming and an inefficient use of the user's time.","Another issue is that conventional applications and UIs, for example, relating to email messages, typically process and present messages in a linear chronological manner to a user. However, a user can desire to have electronic documents, such as messages, and file folders processed and presented to the user based on subject, project, or topic.","Yet another issue is that a user often can be working with a group of users (e.g., fellow employees) on a particular project, and the user can take a certain action with regard to an electronic document relating to the project, wherein the action can have an impact on the project. While that user is aware of the action taken with regard to the electronic document and\/or the impact on the project, the other users in the group are not aware of the action taken with regard to the electronic document and the impact of such action on the project, and further, the other users may not even be aware of the electronic document if they weren't provided a copy (e.g., via \u201ccarbon copy\u201d (cc:)) of the electronic document. It is desirable to overcome these and other deficiencies in conventional electronic document processing systems and methods. For example, the action taken with regard to the electronic document can impact a project timeline and\/or status of the project. Conventionally, unless the user proactively takes other action(s) (e.g., email message(s) to the other users, phone call(s) to the other users, face-to-face conversation(s) with the other users) to inform the other users in the group regarding the electronic document, the action the user took with regard to the electronic document, and the impact on the project timeline and\/or project status, the other users in the group may not be aware of such information.","To that end, techniques for automatic sort and propagation of electronic documents are presented. With regard to an electronic document, such as a received message, an enhanced information management component (EIMC) can analyze the document to identify a file folder associated with a subject to which the electronic document relates. Based at least in part on interaction with or tagging of the electronic document in a first user interface (UI) component of a first communication device, predefined user preferences, and predefined document processing criteria, the EIMC can propagate information (e.g., the electronic document, a portion of the electronic document, notification regarding the electronic document or associated subject, information relating to a progress summary or timeline relating to the subject (e.g., work project), etc.) relating to the subject and\/or the electronic document to one or more other communication devices (e.g., UI display screens of the other communication device(s)), such as, for example, communication devices associated with users who are associated with the subject (e.g., users who are doing work relating to that subject or project).","For example, the EIMC can analyze or parse the electronic document and can identify key-content (or at least potential key-content), comprising a keyword(s), keyphrase(s), key audio content, key video content, key object(s), key link(s), key hyperlink(s), key electronic item, etc., in the electronic document or attachments associated therewith, and the key-content can be highlighted or emphasized when presented to the user via the UI component. The user can select an item of key-content to tag the electronic document or associated attachment based at least in part on that selected key-content, wherein the selected key-content can be indicative of or relate to the desired tag, associated file folder, associated subject, etc., and\/or can perform another desired document processing action(s) (e.g., propagation of information relating to the subject or electronic document to one or more other UI display screens of one or more other communication devices, searching one or more other electronic documents located in a data store(s), a server(s) and\/or online site(s) (e.g., to identify another electronic document that relates to the tag, to tag the other electronic document, to modify the other electronic document based at least in part on information in or interaction with the electronic document, etc.), archiving of the electronic document and\/or associated attachment(s), modifying a project timeline or a project summary relating to the electronic document, scheduling of a meeting relating to the electronic document or project relating thereto, etc.) by selection of the key-content or other interaction with the electronic document or associated information (e.g., another electronic document(s) attached thereto).","The EIMC also can archive the document in the identified file folder (e.g., associated with a subject, project, topic, etc.) automatically or in response to as little as one UI control manipulation (e.g., click) based at least in part on an identified key-content and\/or other information in or associated with the electronic document. For instance, the EIMC can automatically parse an electronic document (e.g., a received email), or can parse the electronic document in response to a command received from a user via the UI, and can identify one or more potential items of key-content, which can be highlighted or emphasized in the display screen of the UI component by the EIMC, wherein the one or more potential items of key-content can or may relate to a tag, associated file folder, associated subject, etc. In an aspect, via the UI component, the user can select an item of key-content (e.g., via a single click on the keyword, keyphrase, or other key-content) from the one or more potential items of key-content, wherein the selected item of key-content can be indicative of or related to the tag, file folder, and\/or subject, and the EIMC can store the electronic document in the file folder relating to that tag or subject, wherein the file folder can be associated with a tag relating to the selected keyword. The electronic document also can be associated with the tag (e.g., attach or apply the tag to the electronic document, link the tag to the electronic document, etc.) based at least in part on the selected key-content.","In another aspect, the EIMC can create, modify, and\/or update (e.g., automatically, dynamically) a subject (e.g., project) summary or subject timeline based at least in part on tag information associated with an electronic document relating to the subject, interaction by a user or EIMC with the electronic document, and\/or information in or associated with the electronic document. Information relating to the subject summary or subject timeline (e.g., as modified or updated) can be presented to the users in a group of users associated with the subject via their respective UI components in accordance with their respective user preferences and the predefined document processing criteria (and corresponding predefined document processing rules). In yet another aspect, at a desired time, such as at or near a time when a subject (e.g., project) meeting is scheduled, the EIMC can retrieve a subset of electronic documents relevant to the subject meeting from a data store(s), based at least in part on tag information associated with the documents and\/or the respective user preferences of the users participating in the subject meeting, and can present the subset of electronic documents, or a portion thereof, to the respective users via their respective UI components to enable easy access of such electronic documents by the users prior to or during the meeting.","In still another aspect, the EIMC can analyze audio or video content to facilitate tagging and archiving of such content using the first UI component of a first communication device and\/or propagation of information relating to such content and\/or related subject to a second UI component of a second communication device.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d \u201cplatform,\u201d \u201cinterface,\u201d and the like can refer to a computer-related entity or an entity related to an operational machine with one or more specific functionalities. The entities disclosed herein can be either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. Also, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate via local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems via the signal).","In addition, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor.\u201d That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances. Moreover, articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d as used in the subject specification and annexed drawings should generally be construed to mean \u201cone or more\u201d unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form.","Referring to the drawings,  is a block diagram of an example system  that can intelligently process electronic documents and propagate information from a communication device to one or more other communication devices associated with a group in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In an aspect, the system  can comprise a plurality of communication devices, including communication device, and communication device through communication device, wherein M can be virtually any desired integer number. The communication devices, including communication device, and communication device through communication device, can be communicatively connected to each other via a wireline or wireless communication connection to facilitate voice and data communications between the communication devices in a communication network environment.","A communication device (e.g., , , ) can be, for example, a computer, a mobile phone (e.g., cellular phone, smart phone), a PDA, an electronic notepad, an electronic netbook, an electronic gaming device, an Internet Protocol television (IPTV), a set-top box, or another type of electronic device with communication capabilities. The communication device be utilized to access information or electronic documents from web sites, email server, news server, content server, social network sites, etc., and to receive or send electronic documents, including messages (e.g., emails, text messages, multimedia messages) and associated content (e.g., audio or video content), and\/or social network messages or postings.","In an aspect, each communication device respectively can include a UI component, wherein communication device can include UI component, communication device can include UI component, and communication device can include UI component. The respective UI components (e.g., , , ) can provide one or more desired user interfaces, such as, for example, display screen(s), controls, or other components, that a user can utilize to interact with the UI component and associated components of the system  to facilitate performing desired actions, including, for example, actions (e.g., selection of a keyword(s) or keyphrase(s), tagging of electronic documents, saving changes made to an electronic document, storing an electronic document, creating, opening or closing an electronic file folder, etc.) relating to the processing of electronic documents (e.g., message (e.g., email, text message, multimedia message, voice mail message), web page (e.g., social network page), hypertext document, word processing document, audio file comprising audio content, video file comprising video content, and\/or related attachments (e.g., attached file(s) to a message) or a hyperlink (e.g., hyperlink to an online page or site), actions relating to objects or electronic items (e.g., icon representative of an electronic document or file folder, window, button or control, menu, etc.) on a display screen(s) of the UI component, etc. In accordance with various embodiments, a UI component (e.g., , , ) can comprise a graphical UI (GUI) or touch screen GUI.","In accordance with various aspects and embodiments, a UI component (e.g., , , ) can provide one or more GUIs, command line interfaces, and the like. For example, a GUI can be rendered that provides a user with a region or means to load, import, read, etc., data, and can include a region to present the results of such. These regions can comprise known text and\/or graphic regions comprising dialogue boxes, static controls, drop-down-menus, list boxes, pop-up menus, as edit controls, combo boxes, radio buttons, check boxes, push buttons, and graphic boxes. In addition, utilities to facilitate the presentation such as vertical and\/or horizontal scroll bars for navigation and toolbar buttons to determine whether a region will be viewable can be employed. For example, the user can interact with one or more of the components coupled and\/or incorporated into the system .","The user can also interact with the regions to select and provide information via various devices such as a mouse, a trackpad (e.g., a single-touch or multi-touch trackpad), a roller ball, a keypad, a keyboard, a pen and\/or voice activation, for example. Typically, a mechanism such as a push button or the enter key on the keyboard can be employed subsequent to entering the information in order to initiate the search. However, it is to be appreciated that the disclosed subject matter is not so limited. For example, merely highlighting a check box can initiate information conveyance. In another example, a command line interface can be employed. For example, the command line interface can prompt (e.g., via a text message on a display and an audio tone) the user for information via providing a text message. The user can provide suitable information, such as alpha-numeric input corresponding to an option provided in the interface prompt or an answer to a question posed in the prompt. It is to be appreciated that the command line interface can be employed in connection with a GUI and\/or application programming interface (API). In addition, the command line interface can be employed in connection with hardware (e.g., video cards) and\/or displays with limited graphic support, and\/or low bandwidth communication channels.","In accordance with various aspects and embodiments, all or a desired portion of the communications devices can comprise an enhanced information management component (EIMC) to facilitate desired (e.g., efficient, optimal, intelligent) processing of electronic documents and communications. For instance, communication device can include EIMC and be associated with the UI component, communication device can include EIMC and be associated with the UI component, and communication device can include EIMC and be associated with the UI component. The EIMC (e.g., , , ) of a respective communication device can be utilized to, in accordance with predefined document processing criteria (e.g., which can include specified user preferences, and can correspond with predefined document processing rules), tag an electronic document based at least in part on content of the electronic document; propagate (e.g., forward) information relating to the electronic document, tag or other information associated with the tag from a first communication device (e.g., ) to another communication device(s) (e.g., , ) (e.g., another communication device(s) in the same group as the first communication device, or another communication device(s) not associated with the same group as the first communication device, when in accordance with the predefined document processing criteria); propagate (e.g., backward) tag information, other information relating to the tag, or information relating to the electronic document to other electronic documents, electronic items (e.g., electronic file folder, electronic icon displayed on a display screen of a UI component, portion of the display screen, tag, link, hyperlink, etc.), and\/or other communication devices; archive the electronic document in a file folder associated with the tag automatically or in response to as little as one control manipulation (e.g., mouse click) of a term, phrase, or item (e.g., portion of audio content, portion of video content, object, icon, link, hyperlink, etc.), which represents or is associated with the tag, in the electronic document; generate or modify a timeline, summary, or progress report relating to a subject (e.g., project, topic, client, event, etc.) based at least in part on tagging of electronic documents and results of an analysis of information contained in the electronic documents; modifying information presented in a UI (e.g., a first UI wherein the tagging was performed, or modifying information presented in another UI(s) via propagation based at least in part on actions taken using the first UI and\/or actions taken by the EIMC) based at least in part on tagging of electronic documents and results of the analysis of information contained in the electronic documents; creation of a file folder comprising information for a scheduled meeting relating to a subject based at least in part on tagging of electronic documents and the result of the analysis of information contained in the electronic documents; or perform other desired tasks with regard to intelligently and efficiently processing electronic documents.","In accordance with still another aspect, a UI component (e.g., , , ) can employ voice recognition to facilitate intelligent processing of messages using electronic document processing controls, such as an activation control to manually activate intelligent processing and tagging of an electronic document, a select control to select an item of key-content, or other information in or associated with an electronic document, an archiving control to archive an electronic document, a play control to play audio or video content of or associated with an electronic document, and\/or other controls, as disclosed herein.

The respective users of the communication devices  and  can access their respective messages from the message server  or can draft and communicate messages via the message server  to other communication devices, for example, when the users and associated communication devices  and  are granted access to the message server , or a portion thereof.","In another aspect, the EIMC  and the communication devices  and  each can be associated with (e.g., communicatively connected to) a data store  via a wireline or wireless communication connection, wherein the data store  can have stored therein one or more electronic documents, one or more electronic file folders, and\/or one or more other electronic items. The respective users of the communication devices  and  can access electronic documents, file folders, or items from the data store  or can create and\/or store electronic documents, file folders, or items in the data store , for example, when the users and associated communication devices  and  are granted access to the data store , or a portion thereof.","In accordance with various aspects, the EIMC  can propagate information relating to an electronic document (e.g., propagate forward) from a first communication device  to a second communication device  and\/or propagate information relating to an electronic document (e.g., propagate backward) associated with a first communication device  to one or more other electronic documents, file folders or items associated with the message server  and\/or data store , based at least in part on tag information associated with such electronic document.","For instance, a user can be using a first communication device  to receive one or more messages utilizing a message application, wherein the one or more messages can be presented to the user via the UI component. In processing a message , the EIMC  can analyze or parse the electronic document  (e.g., message), including, for example, the sending address, information in the subject header, message content in the main body of the message, attachment to the electronic document , and\/or metadata associated with electronic document , to identify an item(s) of key-content that can indicate to what subject (e.g., project, topic, event, client, etc.) the electronic document  relates, wherein the item(s) of key-content can be the same as or similar to, and\/or can correspond to, one or more tag words stored in a data store  and respectively associated with one or more file folders stored in a data store .","For instance, there can be a file folder  named \u201cProject X\u201d and\/or associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d. The EIMC  can analyze or parse the electronic document  and can identify that the electronic document  contains the phrase \u201cProject X\u201d  in the main body of the electronic document , and can identify that there is a file folder  in the data store  that is associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d, and can thereby identify the phrase \u201cProject X\u201d  as a keyphrase. Automatically or in response to selection (e.g., via a single click) of the keyphrase \u201cProject X\u201d  by the user via the UI component , the EIMC  can store the electronic document  in the file folder  (e.g., file folder named \u201cProject X\u201d) associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d. When the archiving of the electronic document  is being done in response to selection by the user, the EIMC  also can highlight or emphasize the identified item(s) of key-content (e.g., keyphrase \u201cProject X\u201d ) on the display screen of the UI component  to differentiate the identified item(s) of key-content from other content in the electronic document  to facilitate selection of the identified item(s) of key-content by the user.","Also, the highlighting (e.g., using color(s) with regard to the text or the portion of the UI screen on which the text is displayed) or emphasizing (e.g., bolding, italicizing, or changing the size) of the item(s) of key-content can be varied (e.g., using different colors, different types of highlighting or emphasis), based at least in part on the level of confidence (e.g., green indicates high level of confidence or exact match, yellow indicates a medium level of confidence, and red indicates a low level of confidence) there is that the identified item(s) of key-content is associated with a tag word or tag phrase in the data store , or to differentiate one potential item(s) of key-content from another item(s) of key-content in the electronic document. For example, if the electronic document contained the phrase \u201cX Project\u201d instead of the phrase \u201cProject X\u201d, the EIMC  can highlight the phrase \u201cX Project\u201d (e.g., as a potential keyphrase) using a color (e.g., yellow, instead of green) or other indicator to indicate to the user that \u201cX Project\u201d and the associated electronic document may be related to the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and the associated file folder, but that there was not an exact match to the tag \u201cProject X\u201d. As another example, if the electronic document contained the phrase \u201celectronic purchase\u201d and there is a tag for \u201celectronic wallet\u201d in the data store , the EIMC  can highlight the phrase \u201celectronic purchase\u201d (e.g., as a potential keyphrase) using a color (e.g., yellow, instead of green) or other indicator to indicate to the user that \u201celectronic purchase\u201d and the associated electronic document may be related to the tag \u201celectronic wallet\u201d and the associated file folder, but that there was not an exact match to the tag \u201celectronic wallet\u201d. Similarly, the EIMC  can identify potential keywords or keyphrases, even when misspelled, in the electronic document, and the potential keywords or keyphrases can be highlighted or emphasized to indicate that such potential keywords or keyphrases may be a match to a tag, but the level of confidence is lower because the potential keywords or keyphrases were not an exact match to a stored tag.","In still another aspect, the EIMC  can propagate information relating to the electronic document  and\/or \u201cProject X\u201d to one or more communication devices (e.g., ) of one or more other users (e.g., users in the same user group), based at least in part on the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences. For instance, when in accord with the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences, the presentation or display of an electronic item, such as file folder  for \u201cProject X\u201d, can be modified on the display screen of the UI component  of the second communication device  based at least in part on information in or associated with the electronic document , and\/or interaction with and\/or actions taken with regard to the electronic document  by the EIMC  or the first user of the first communication device  via the UI component . For example, as shown in  in the BEFORE view of the UI component  of the second communication device , which is prior to the electronic document  being interacted with in the first communication device , the presentation of a plurality of file folders, including file folder  for \u201cProject X\u201d, on the display screen of the UI component  can be such that the file folder  can be ranked fourth out of the five displayed file folders from top of the display screen to bottom. For instance, when specified by the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences, as shown in  in the AFTER view of the UI component  of the second communication device , which is after the electronic document  has been interacted with in the first communication device , the presentation of the plurality of file folders, including file folder  for \u201cProject X\u201d, on the display screen of the UI component  can be modified such that the file folder  can be ranked first out of the five displayed file folders from top of the display screen to bottom and\/or the file folder  can be emphasized or highlighted, which can indicate to the second user of the second communication device  that there has be a change to the file folder .","Referring briefly to  (along with ,  and ), illustrated is a diagram of an example display screen  of the UI component  of the second communication device  in accordance with various aspects. The display screen  illustrates how file folders can be arranged in relation to each other and how various types of information relating to the content in the respective file folders can be presented to the user via the display screen , in accordance with the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences. For instance, when desired, the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences can specify that the EIMC  is to arrange the file folders from top to bottom on the display based at least in part on the respective number of new electronic documents (e.g., messages, word processing documents, social network posts, etc.) received (or modified) for each file folder over a specified time period (e.g., since the user last interacted with the electronic documents or the UI component, a specified amount of time, such as 1 hour, etc.), the respective number of priority or time-sensitive electronic documents received or modified over the specified time period, and\/or the respective time-sensitivity of the respective electronic documents in the file folder, in accordance with a specified arrangement algorithm. For example, as desired, in accordance with the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences, the specified arrangement algorithm can provide that the file folders are to be arranged from the file folder having the highest number of new electronic documents over the specified time period being presented at the top of the display down to the file folder having the lowest number of new electronic documents over the specified time period being presented at the bottom of the display, unless a file folder contains a new electronic document(s) that has a higher priority or is more time-sensitive (e.g., the amount of time to take action with regard to the time-sensitive electronic document is close to running out) than electronic documents in the other file folders, in which case the file folder that contains the new electronic document(s) having a higher priority or more time-sensitive electronic document is to be arranged and presented at a higher rank than the other file folders, with the remaining folders ranked based on the respective number of new messages.","In another aspect, the respective icons of the file folders or other regions of the display screen  that are in proximity to the file folders can comprise information relating to the respective file folders, wherein the information can comprise, for example, the respective number of new electronic documents received (or modified) for each file folder over the specified time period, the respective number of priority or time-sensitive electronic documents received or modified over the specified time period, and\/or the respective time-sensitivity of the respective electronic documents in the file folder.","Examples of the above-described aspects are shown in display screen . The display screen  can display a plurality of file folders relating to various subjects, wherein, for instance, the file folder  can relate to \u201cProject X\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201cProject X\u201d, file folder  can relate to \u201cProject Curve\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201cProject Curve\u201d, file folder  can relate to \u201c2011 Annual Audit\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201c2011 Annual Audit\u201d, file folder  can relate to \u201cProject: Electronic Wallet\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201cProject: Electronic Wallet\u201d, file folder  can relate to \u201cProject Y\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201cProject Y\u201d, and file folder  can relate to \u201cProject Z\u201d and can be associated with tag phrase \u201cProject Z\u201d. For instance, file folder  can comprise 2 new electronic documents over the specified time period, as shown with the number 2 indicated on the file folder , with those 2 new electronic documents being priority or time-sensitive electronic documents as indicated by the indicator \u201c2!\u201d, wherein the character \u201c!\u201d can indicate that those electronic documents are of higher priority or are time sensitive in nature. File folder  can comprise 4 new electronic documents over the specified time period as shown with the number 4 indicated on the file folder , with 1 of those new electronic documents being a priority or time-sensitive electronic document as indicated by the indicator \u201c1!\u201d. File folder  can comprise 3 new electronic documents over the specified time period as shown with the number 3 indicated on the file folder , with none of those new electronic documents being labeled as a priority or time-sensitive electronic document. File folder  can comprise 2 new electronic documents over the specified time period as shown with the number 2 indicated on the file folder , with none of those new electronic documents being labeled as a priority or time-sensitive electronic document. File folder  can comprise 1 new electronic document over the specified time period as shown with the number 1 indicated on the file folder , with that new electronic document not being labeled as a priority or time-sensitive electronic document. File folder  is shown having no new electronic documents over the specified time period as shown with the number 0 (or alternatively having no number shown) indicated on the file folder .","As shown on the display screen , the plurality of file folders can be displayed with the file folder  being ranked and presented highest, even though the file folder  does not have the most new electronic documents, because the file folder  has the highest number of higher priority or time-sensitive electronic documents as compared to the other file folders. File folder  can be ranked and presented as second highest, because it has a higher number of higher priority or time-sensitive electronic documents as compared to the other file folders  through , except for file folder . The remaining file folders  through  can be ranked with the file folder having the higher number of messages ranked higher than the other file folders.","The disclosed subject matter can thereby propagate information between communication devices based at least in part on intelligent document processing, including tagging, of electronic documents or items; and can present information to a user on a UI display screen in a more efficient and relevant manner by presenting the information on the UI display screen based at least in part on the subject matter (e.g., work project, topic, client, etc.) that is most relevant to the user at the time the user is viewing information on the UI display screen, as opposed to simply presenting information to the user in a linear chronological manner (although the disclosed subject matter also can be configured to display information on the UI display screen in a linear chronological manner, if and when desired by the user).","With regard to , in accordance with yet another aspect, the EIMC  also can propagate (e.g., backward) information relating to an electronic document  to other electronic documents or items. For instance, when a tag has been associated with a first electronic document by the EIMC , based at least in part on such tagging of the first electronic document, the EIMC  can search (e.g., dynamically, automatically, or in response to a request received from a user via a communication device) a subset of electronic documents (e.g., in a data store , on a message server , and\/or on an online site(s) ), identify a second electronic document contained in the subset of electronic documents based at least in part on the second electronic document comprising a second item of information that corresponds to the tag, associate the tag to the second electronic document, and store the first electronic document and the second electronic document in an electronic file folder associated with the tag.","For example, if the file folder  is being newly created to store the electronic message  and is newly associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d, the EIMC , after archiving the electronic document  in, or associating the electronic document  with, the file folder , the EIMC  can search for other electronic documents or items, which are or potentially may be related to the tag \u201cProject X\u201d, in the data store , in the message server , on an online site or page(s) (e.g., social network web site, news web site, etc.), based at least in part on the tag. For instance, the EIMC  can search electronic documents and items in the data store  and can identify electronic document  and electronic document  as including or being associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and can tag and\/or associate the electronic documents  and  with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and\/or can store the electronic documents  and  (e.g., copies of electronic documents  and ) in the file folder  associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d. The EIMC  also can search electronic documents or items in the message server  and can identify electronic document  as including or being associated with information relating to the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and can tag and\/or associate the electronic document  with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and\/or can store the electronic document  (e.g., a copy of electronic document ) in the file folder . As desired, the EIMC  also can search one or more online sites  to determine whether any of the one or more online sites  comprise or are associated with information (e.g., blogs, comments, audio or video content, or other online posts) relating to the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and, if the EIMC  does identify such an online site, the EIMC  can generate an electronic document that includes a copy of the online site, the online address, or other information relating to the online site, and can tag and\/or associate that electronic document with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d and\/or can store that electronic document in the file folder .","In another aspect, the UI display screen of one or more of the communication devices (e.g., , ) can be updated based at least in part the newly identified and tagged electronic documents, wherein, for example, for each UI display screen, the order or ranking of the file folders can be modified and\/or information (e.g., number of newly identified electronic documents, priority of newly identified electronic documents, time sensitivity of newly identified electronic documents, etc.) relating to the changes to the respective file folders (e.g., file folder  relating to \u201cProject X\u201d) can be generated and presented on the respective UI display screen.","In still another aspect, as desired, the EIMC  can be configured to periodically search online sites (e.g., a specified subset of online sites, or perform a search using a general online search engine) for web pages having key-content that are or may be a match to a stored tag, identify online sites or web pages that have or potentially have key-content that are or may be a match to a stored tag, and save copies of the identified online sites or web pages in the appropriate file folder(s) associated with the corresponding tag.","In another aspect, an electronic document can be tagged with more than one tag. For example, an electronic document can be related to a first project (e.g., Project X) and also be related to a second project (e.g., Project Y). In such instance, the EIMC  can tag the electronic document with a first tag to associate the electronic document with the first project and with a second tag to associate the electronic document with the second project, and copies of the electronic document can be stored in a first file folder associated with the first tag and a second file folder associated with the second tag.","Referring briefly to  (along with , , and ), depicted is a diagram of an example system  that can propagate information (e.g., scheduling related information) from a communication device to one or more other communication devices associated with a group in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In accordance with various aspects, the system  can include a first UI component  (also referred to herein and in  as UI component) associated with a first communication device (not shown for reasons of brevity and clarity) and a second UI component  (also referred to herein and in  as UI component) associated with a second communication device (not shown for reasons of brevity and clarity). The system  also can comprise an EIMC  that can analyze an electronic document to determine whether there is any content in or associated with the electronic document that is related to a tag (e.g., tag word or tag phrase) stored in the data store (e.g., ), highlight or emphasize any key-content (e.g., keyword or keyphrase) in the electronic document that is or may be related to the tag, archive the electronic document in a file folder associated with the tag, propagate information to the second UI component  based at least in part on interaction with (e.g., action(s) taken with regard to) the electronic document by the EIMC  or the first UI component , and\/or perform another document processing action(s) or task(s) with regard to the electronic document, such as more fully described herein. The first UI component , second UI component , and EIMC  each can be the same as or similar to, or can comprise the same or similar functionality as respective components (e.g., respectively or similarly named components), as more fully described herein.","Initially, prior to an analysis of an electronic document  received or displayed by the first UI component  (e.g., with regard to a first user (e.g., Fred)), the second UI component  can contain, display, or be associated with an electronic calendar  (also referred to herein and in  as e-calendar ) (e.g., for a second user). During this time, in the electronic calendar , there is no event item scheduled for Jun. 9, 2011, as shown in the BEFORE version of the display screen of the UI component . As more fully described herein, the EIMC  can propagate information relating to the electronic document , which is received or displayed by the first UI component , to the second UI component , in accordance with the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences.","In an aspect, when the electronic document  (e.g., email message) is received or displayed by the first UI component  (or received by a server (e.g., email server) associated with the first UI component or first user), the EIMC  can analyze or parse the electronic document  to identify potential keywords or keyphrases, and to identify other potentially relevant information, such as event related information (e.g., meeting information, deadline information, parties to be involved with the event, etc.), in or associated with the electronic document . For example, the EIMC  can identify the phrase \u201cProject X\u201d in the electronic document  as a potential keyphrase based at least in part on the phrase \u201cProject X\u201d matching the tag \u201cProject X\u201d retrieved from the data store (e.g., ), and can highlight or emphasize the keyphrase \u201cProject X\u201d in the electronic document . Also, the EIMC  can identify other potentially relevant information, such as the term \u201cmeeting\u201d, the date \u201cJun. 9, 2011\u201d, the time \u201c10 a.m.\u201d, an amount of time \u201c1 hour\u201d, and the message sender \u201cTom\u201d, and can highlight or emphasize this other potentially relevant information in the electronic document . As specified by the predefined document processing criteria and user preferences, the EIMC  can highlight or emphasize the other potentially relevant information differently from or the same as the identified keyphrase. For instance, if desired, the other potentially relevant information can have a different highlight color than the color used to highlight the keyphrase, and\/or the EIMC  can generate and display links between the various potentially relevant items of information in the electronic document  that are determined by the EIMC  to be related to each other (e.g., the term \u201cmeeting\u201d determined to be related to the date, time, and amount of time contained in the electronic document  based at least in part on their proximity to each other in the electronic document  and the common relationship of the term \u201cmeeting\u201d being associated with a date, time, and\/or amount of time in a message).","The predefined document processing criteria and\/or user preferences can specify that the second user associated with the second UI component  is part of a group of users, which can include the first user as well, who are associated with the tag phrase \u201cProject X\u201d, and can further specify that when information, such as event related information, is received by another user in that group, such information is to be provided to the second user via the second UI component  of the second communication device. In accordance with the predefined document processing criteria and\/or user preferences, the EIMC  can determine that the event related information contained in the electronic document  is to be propagated forward to the second UI component  associated with the second user, and the EIMC  can modify the UI display screen of the second UI component  and\/or the electronic calendar associated with the second UI component  based at least in part on the event related information identified in the electronic document  received or displayed by the first UI component . For example, the EIMC  can modify (e.g., automatically or dynamically) the electronic calendar  associated with the second UI component  to include an event item (e.g., meeting relating to \u201cProject X\u201d with Fred and Tom) scheduled for Jun. 9, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. If and when specified by user preferences, the EIMC  can have that event item scheduled only tentatively until confirmed by the second user, can identify and notify a user of a scheduling conflict (if there is another event item scheduled during that time period), and\/or can provide a separate electronic notification (e.g., email or text message, notification displayed in the second UI component  (e.g., notification displayed on or in proximity to the file folder  associated with \u201cProject X\u201d), etc.) to the second user to notify the second user of the new event item in the electronic calendar.","Turning briefly to  (along with , , and ), depicted is a diagram of an example system  that can generate and propagate project related information for a project associated with a group of communication devices and associated users in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In accordance with various aspects, the system  can include a first UI component  (also referred to herein and in  as UI component) associated with a first communication device (not shown for reasons of brevity and clarity) and a second UI component  (also referred to herein and in  as UI component) associated with a second communication device (not shown for reasons of brevity and clarity). The system  also can comprise an EIMC  that can analyze an electronic document to determine whether there is any content in or associated with the electronic document that is related to a tag word or phrase stored in the data store (e.g., ), highlight or emphasize any content (e.g., keyword or keyphrase) in the electronic document that is or may be related to the tag, archive the electronic document in a file folder associated with the tag, propagate information to the second UI component  based at least in part on interaction with (e.g., action(s) taken with regard to) the electronic document by the EIMC  or the first UI component , generate (e.g., automatically), modify (e.g., automatically) and\/or present (e.g., present to the first communication device and\/or propagate and present on the second communication device) a project summary and\/or project timeline for a project based at least in part on a subset of electronic documents associated with a tag relating to the project, and\/or perform another document processing action(s) or task(s) with regard to the electronic document, such as more fully described herein. The system  also can include a data store  that can be associated with the EIMC , first UI component , and second UI component . The data store  can receive, store, and provide electronic documents, including the subset of electronic documents relating to the project. The first UI component , second UI component , EIMC , and data store  each can be the same as or similar to, or can comprise the same or similar functionality as respective components (e.g., respectively or similarly named components), as more fully described herein.","As an example, the data store  can include a file folder  associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d, wherein the file folder  was created by the EIMC  in response to an email message  received by the first communication device associated with the first UI component . Based at least in part on analysis of the email message  and\/or actions of the first user of the first communication device, the EIMC  identified \u201cProject X\u201d as an item of key-content, generated the file folder , generated a tag \u201cProject X\u201d, which was applied to the file folder  and email message , and the email message  was stored in the file folder  in the data store . When analyzing and parsing the email message , the EIMC  also identified a time landmark in the email message , wherein the email message included information indicating the date for the presentation relating to \u201cProject X\u201d is Jun. 30, 2011. In an aspect, the EIMC  can generate (e.g., automatically) a project summary and\/or project timeline  relating to \u201cProject X\u201d that can be provided to the group of communication devices (and\/or associated users) that are identified as being associated with \u201cProject X\u201d. The project summary and\/or project timeline  can be provided (e.g., automatically) to the group of communication devices (and\/or associated users) that are identified as being associated with \u201cProject X\u201d.","As further example, a subsequent email message  can be received by the first communication device. The EIMC  can analyze and\/or parse email message  and identify that this email message  includes the keyphrase \u201cProject X\u201d, and further can identify certain time landmarks in the message , wherein the time landmarks include a deadline date of Jun. 10, 2011, for drafting a budget proposal relating to \u201cProject X\u201d, a deadline date of Jun. 17, 2011, for preparing a risk\/benefit analysis relating to \u201cProject X\u201d, and a deadline date of Jun. 24, 2011, for the project manager (the first user associated with the first communication device) to provide comments relating to \u201cProject X\u201d. In an aspect, the EIMC  can generate and apply the tag \u201cProject X\u201d to the email message , and update (e.g., modify) the project summary and\/or project timeline  relating to \u201cProject X\u201d to include the additional time landmarks and\/or other information relating to the \u201cProject X\u201d. When the project summary and\/or project timeline  is updated, the EIMC  can generate (e.g., automatically) and send (e.g., automatically) a notification message (e.g., email message, text message) to the communication devices of users in the group related to \u201cProject X\u201d, and\/or can modify the display screens of the respective UI components (e.g., , ) to reflect the updates or changes relating to \u201cProject X\u201d (e.g., modify the ranking of file folders as they are displayed in a UI component (e.g., , ) associated with a group member so that the file folder relating to \u201cProject X\u201d is ranked higher than other file folders that have not been modified or otherwise do not have as high of a priority as other subject matter of other file folders, and\/or provide information, which indicates the file folder for \u201cProject X\u201d has been modified, on or in proximity to the file folder icon associated with \u201cProject X\u201d when displayed by the UI component, etc.). The updated project summary and\/or project timeline  can be provided to the group of communication devices (and\/or associated users) that are identified as being associated with \u201cProject X\u201d.","To continue with the example, a subsequent email message  can be received by the first communication device, wherein the email message  includes information indicating that a meeting relating to \u201cProject X\u201d is to be scheduled for Jun. 9, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. with Fred (e.g., first user) and Tom (who requested the meeting). As disclosed herein, the EIMC  can analyze and\/or parse the message  and can identify that the email message  relates to \u201cProject X\u201d and contains information indicating there is to be a meeting relating to \u201cProject X\u201d to be scheduled for Jun. 9, 2011, at 10:00 a.m. The EIMC  can generate and apply (e.g., automatically) the tag \u201cProject X\u201d to the email message , archive the message  in the file folder , and update (e.g., automatically) the project summary and\/or project timeline  to indicate that the meeting is scheduled for Jun. 9, 2011, at 10:00 a.m. After the meeting has taken place, the EIMC  can update (e.g., automatically, or in response to user input received via a communication device indicating that the meeting occurred and was completed) the project summary and\/or project timeline  to indicate that the meeting is completed.","To further continue with the example, as \u201cProject X\u201d related items, like the budget proposal  for \u201cProject X\u201d and the risk\/benefit analysis  for \u201cProject X\u201d are drafted and stored in the file folder  for \u201cProject X\u201d, the EIMC  can analyze these electronic documents (e.g., , ), can respectively identify what the respective electronic documents are (e.g., the budget proposal  and the risk\/benefit analysis ), can tag the electronic documents  and  with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d (or the EIMC  can tag the electronic documents  and  when they are stored in the file folder ), and can update (e.g., automatically) the project summary and\/or project timeline  to indicate that these \u201cProject X\u201d related items have been completed.","As depicted in , an electronic document  comprising comments of the project manager (e.g., first user) has been drafted and is displayed on the display screen of the first UI component . Prior to storing the finalized version of the electronic document , the project summary and\/or project timeline  can indicate that the budget proposal  and risk\/benefit analysis  have been completed, but the comments of the project manager has not yet been completed, as shown in  (as shown in the second UI Component  (BEFORE)). When the electronic document  is saved and stored in the file folder , the EIMC  can analyze or parse the electronic document  and can identify that the electronic document  is related to \u201cProject X\u201d based at least in part on the electronic document  comprising the keyphrase \u201cProject X\u201d, which matches the tag \u201cProject X\u201d associated with file folder  and\/or because the electronic document  has been stored in the file folder , and can further identify that the electronic document  comprises comments of the project manager. Based on this analysis, the EIMC  can tag the electronic document  with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d (or the EIMC  can tag the electronic document  when it is stored in the file folder ), and can update the project summary and\/or project timeline  to indicate that the comments of the project manager have been completed, as shown in  (as shown in the second UI Component  (AFTER)).","Continuing to refer to  (along with ), in accordance with still another aspect, the EIMC  also can analyze and parse audio or video content to identify information associated with a tag(s). For example, the file folder  relating to \u201cProject X\u201d can have not only the tag \u201cProject X\u201d associated with it, but also can have the tag (e.g., sub-tag) \u201capparel (or clothing) with \u2018Project X\u2019 logo\u201d associated therewith, because \u201cProject X\u201d is a brand name, which is used with regard to products, including clothing. The communication device can receive an electronic document (e.g., email) that has a video file attached to it. The EIMC  can analyze and\/or parse the video content in the video file while the electronic document is displayed in the UI component and\/or when stored in the file folder  and\/or as accessed from the message server , to determine whether the video content contains any instances associated with a tag(s). If and when the EIMC  identifies any instances associated with a tag(s) (e.g., the tag \u201capparel (or clothing) with \u2018Project X\u2019 logo\u201d), the EIMC  tag the video content in general and\/or can tag the portion of the video content that comprises information relating to the tag. For example, if at 3 minutes and 10 seconds into the video content, the EIMC  identifies a person is wearing a shirt with the \u201cProject X\u201d logo on it, the EIMC  can generate and apply the corresponding tag(s) at the 3:10 point of the video content to facilitate directing the user to that point in the video content and\/or can generate textual information that can be presented along with the video to indicate that the information relating to the tag (e.g., video scene with the person wearing a shirt with the \u201cProject X\u201d logo on it) is located at the 3:10 point of the video content. The EIMC  can store the video content and associated tag information in the file folder  associated with the tag \u201cProject X\u201d (and\/or in a sub-file folder (of file folder ) associated with the sub-tag \u201capparel (or clothing) with \u2018Project X\u2019 logo\u201d). In an aspect, this update to the file folder  can be propagated to other communication devices (e.g. communication device) (and associated users) associated with the group relating to \u201cProject X\u201d, as more fully disclosed herein.","As another example, the EIMC  can search online sites (e.g., web pages of news web sites, social network web sites, etc.) in response to a command received from a communication device (e.g., communication device), periodically, or dynamically (e.g., in response to occurrence of an event relating to a tag) and can analyze and\/or parse information, such as audio content, video content and\/or digital images, contained on the online sites relates to a tag stored in the data store , and can download a copy of an online site, or portion thereof, that contains information relating to a tag, associate (e.g., apply, attach) the related tag to the downloaded online site, and store the downloaded online site to a file folder associated with the tag.","As still another example use is tagging of audio content or visual content (e.g., video content or visual images) is with regard to news organizations (e.g., traditional news organizations, celebrity magazines, etc.). For instance, a news organization can desire to obtain, store, and correlate information, including audio or visual content, of noteworthy persons (e.g., celebrities, politicians, etc.) or subjects (e.g., politics, environment, relationships, movies, music, finance, etc.). For actor Brad Pitt, the EIMC  can utilize tags, such as \u201cBrad Pitt\u201d, \u201cBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u201d, \u201cBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston\u201d, actor, celebrity, movies, Hollywood, and\/or other tags or sub-tags to tag content relating to Brad Pitt; and for actress Angelina Jolie, the EIMC  can utilize tags, such as \u201cAngelina Jolie\u201d, \u201cBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u201d, actor or actress, celebrity, movies, Hollywood, and\/or other tags or sub-tags to tag content relating to Angelina Jolie. The EIMC  can tag a digital photograph of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie downloaded from on a web site with one or more of the aforementioned tags, and the digital photograph can be stored in the respective folders associated with the respective tags. For example, that digital photograph can be tagged as \u201cBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u201d and stored in the file folder associated with tag \u201cBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u201d, but also can be sub-tagged (or cross-tagged) as \u201cBrad Pitt\u201d, and a copy of that digital photograph (or a corresponding alias file or link to the digital photograph file) also can be stored in a sub-file folder (or a separate file folder) associated with the tag \u201cBrad Pitt\u201d (e.g., within the file folder associated with the tag \u201cBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u201d).","The disclosed subject matter, by employing tagging of electronic documents (e.g., private tagging for closed user groups, public tagging) and propagation (e.g., forward, backward, laterally) of information between communication devices and\/or electronic documents based at least in on the tagging of electronic documents, can facilitate desired common access to or common benefit of tagging structures, project structures, project files, etc., which can allow all permitted users (e.g., users in a user group associated with a tag) the common benefit of the contributions of other users (e.g., other permitted users) in relation to electronic documents and other information relating thereto that are associated with the tag. Further, the disclosed subject matter facilitates intelligent and efficient processing of electronic documents without the user having to manually search for a desired destination (e.g., file folder, communication device associated with a user group, a server and\/or online site comprising information associated with a tag, etc.) for an electronic document or information relating thereto.","Referring to , depicted is a block diagram of an example EIMC  that can facilitate intelligent electronic document processing, document tagging, and information propagation, in accordance with various aspects and embodiments of the disclosed subject matter.
