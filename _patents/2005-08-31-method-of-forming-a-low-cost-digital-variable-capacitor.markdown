{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","The present invention relates generally to micro-electromechanical (MEM) systems and microwave components and, more particularly, to a low cost digital variable capacitor.","MEM variable capacitors can be implemented in both analog and digital configurations. Analog variable capacitors have the advantage that they can be tuned to any value in their capacitance range. However, they are subject to capacitance variations resulting from voltage fluctuations on the control line. Further, the tuning range of analog variable capacitors is typically limited by the pull-in phenomena associated with electrostatic parallel-plate actuators. Digital MEM variable capacitors have been demonstrated using switching networks with very high capacitance ratios (>10). Unfortunately, the switches introduce a small resistance that limits the ultimate Quality (Q) values or Q factors of the devices. Further, the size of a switching network and multiple capacitors limits the maximum frequency for which the device can operate. Digital MEM variable capacitors have also been implemented using mechanical standoffs to create capacitors with fixed up and down states. In these devices, multiple mechanical structures are used to create multiple digital states. These devices are controlled using individual control lines with one control line designated to each state. This requires a large number of control lines for each digital capacitor and limits the application of the devices in large numbers.","It would, therefore, be desirable to overcome the aforesaid and other disadvantages.","In one aspect of the present invention, set forth is a digital variable capacitor including a ground plane disposed on a substrate. An elongated signal electrode is also disposed on the substrate and includes a first end defining an input and a second end extending to a substantially central region of the substrate. In this arrangement, the elongated signal electrode is disposed to be electrically isolated from the ground plane. A number of elongated cantilevers are disposed on the substrate. Each of the cantilevers have a first end coupled to the second end of the signal electrode. Furthermore, each of the cantilevers have a second end suspended over different predetermined portions of the ground plane. In this arrangement, the first end of the electrode is adapted to receive one or more control values operative to actuate at least one of the number of cantilevers to position the second end thereof in relatively close proximity to the ground plane for providing at least a first predetermined capacitance value between the input defined at the first end of the signal electrode and the ground plane.","In another aspect of the present invention, set forth is a method of forming a digital variable capacitor. The method includes disposing and patterning a relatively thin metal layer on a relatively thick wafer substrate to form at least one signal electrode and at least one ground plane region, which includes a notched portion. In an embodiment, disposing and patterning the relatively thin metal layer may be accomplished by using an evaporation process. Furthermore, the thin metal layer may include a thin layer of gold, which may be patterned using a lift off process.","A sacrificial layer is disposed and patterned over portions of the signal electrode and the ground plane region. In an embodiment, the sacrificial layer may include polymethylglutarimide disposed and patterned over portions of the signal electrode and the ground plane region using a spin coating process. Thereafter the polymethylglutarimide can be permitted to cure. After the polymethylglutarimide cures, the polymethylglutarimide can be patterned using a photo-lithographic process.","At least one via or dimple may be etched in the sacrificial layer over and substantially aligned with the notched region defined on the ground plane region. In an embodiment, the via or dimple can be etched in the sacrificial lever using a photo-lithographic process to a depth of approximately one micrometer.","A relatively thick metal layer may be disposed over the signal electrode and\/or sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer may thereafter be etched away for forming a number of cantilevers. Each of the cantilevers include a first end coupled to a signal electrode and each of the number of cantilevers include a second end suspended over different predetermined portions of the ground plane. In this arrangement, the signal electrode is adapted to receive one or more control values operative to actuate at least one of the number of cantilevers to position the second end thereof in relative close proximity to the ground plane for providing at least a first predetermined capacitance between the signal electrode and the ground plane.","The present invention provides a digital variable capacitor and method of manufacturing the same. The digital variable capacitor is constructed and arranged to provide a number of discrete capacitance values using a single control electrode, which reduces dimensions and complexity. The digital variable capacitor may be employed for phase shifting, impedance matching and\/or other tuning related features for a number of relatively high frequency transmission lines, devices and systems. As will be described in further detail below, suffice it say here, the digital variable capacitor includes three separate cantilevers that are constructed and arranged to pull-in at three different voltages, such as 25 Volts, 31 Volts, and 35 Volts, which operates to provide four distinct capacitance states (2-bit equivalent).","Referring now to , shown is one embodiment of the digital variable capacitor package  in accordance with principles of the present invention. In the illustrative embodiment, the digital variable capacitor package  includes a substrate . In an embodiment, the substrate  can be formed of sapphire, glass or other sturdy dielectric materials and may include the dimensions of approximately 535 \u03bcm by 586 \u03bcm. A ground plane  may be disposed along an edge region  of the substrate  and may include first, second and third stepped regions , , ","A single elongated electrode  is also disposed on the substrate  and includes a first end defining an input and a second end extending to a central region of the substrate . The second end of the electrode  is electrically coupled to first ends , , of respective first, second and third elongated cantilevers , , . A second end , , of each of the respective first, second and third elongated cantilevers , ,  includes a capacitance plate portion \u2032, \u2032, \u2032. In the illustrative embodiment, a first digital capacitor  is formed between the capacitance plate portion defined at the second end of the first cantilever  and the first stepped portion of the ground plane . Further, a second digital capacitor  is formed between the capacitance plate portion \u2032 defined at the second end of the second cantilever  and the second stepped portion of the ground plane . Similarly, a third digital capacitor  is formed between the capacitance plate portion \u2032 defined at the second end of the third cantilever  and the third stepped portion of the ground plane .","Referring to and collectively, respectively shown are a top plan view of the first cantilever  and a cross-sectional view of the first cantilever  taken through lines a-a (). It should be understood that the first cantilever  is shown and described in and for illustrative purposes and that the second  and third  cantilevers may be similarly constructed and arranged. In , the first cantilever  includes a support portion  and a capacitance plate portion \u2032. The support portion  of the first cantilever  includes a pair of parallel support members , , each of which includes a length Iand a width W. The pair of support member , are adapted to receive a voltage potential from a D.C. control source (not shown), via the elongated electrode  (), and to deflect, deform and\/or otherwise bend downwardly a predetermined distance based on a function of their dimensions, i.e., length Iand a width W, to position the capacitance plate portion \u2032 in close proximity to the corresponding stepped portion of the ground plane .","The capacitance plate portion \u2032 of the first cantilever  similarly includes a predetermined length Iand width W. The length Iand width Wof the capacitance plate portion of the first cantilever  may be adjusted to form a predetermined capacitance between the capacitance plate portion and corresponding stepped portion of the ground plane  when the pair of support member , are actuated to position the capacitance plate portion \u2032 in close proximity to the stepped portion of the ground plane , as described above.","In an embodiment, each pair of parallel support members associated with each of the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  include different dimensions to provide for adjustment as to the pull-in voltage of each corresponding capacitance plate portion \u2032, \u2032, \u2032. For example, dimensions of the support members (eg., support members , ) and the associated pull-in voltages are provided in Table 1. Each capacitance plate portion \u2032, \u2032, \u2032 associated with the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  include equivalent dimensions of approximately l=100 \u03bcm and w=75 \u03bcm.","At least one protrusion  may be formed on a bottom surface \u2033 of the capacitance plate portion \u2032, which faces the stepped region of the ground plane . The protrusion  formed on the bottom portion \u2033 of the capacitance plate portion \u2032 is dimensioned to be accepted into a notched region  formed on the stepped region of the ground plane  for providing a positive downward stop position for the capacitive plate portion \u2032 of the first cantilever .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIGS. 3"],"i":["a ","e ","a ","e "],"b":["3","100","10","10","100","100","3","20","22","24","20"]},"In and , fabrication begins at step  with the deposition of a thin gold layer (\u22480.3 \u03bcm) 50 on the substrate  to form the control signal electrode and ground plane. In an embodiment, an evaporation process may be used for disposing the thin gold metal layer on the substrate . Thereafter, a lift off process may be used for patterning the thin gold metal layer.","In and at step , an optional resistor layer may be disposed for forming resistive bias lines. Although the optional resistor layer is not shown, it should be understood that the optional resistor layer may be disposed when banks of capacitors are going to be used simultaneously. Resistive bias lines may be used as RF blocks, and can be used equally well for one or more devices. The resistor layer may not be needed for some applications of digital variable capacitor package, however, if the capacitor is implemented into microwave circuits, resistive bias lines may become necessary. The resistor layer is followed by a sacrificial layer  of polymethylglutarimide (PMGI). In an embodiment, the sacrificial layer  may be approximately 3.0 \u03bcm in thickness. In an embodiment, the sacrificial layer  of PMGI can be disposed over portions of the signal electrode  and the ground plane  region using a spin coating process and the PMGI can be permitted to cure. Thereafter, the sacrificial layer  of PMGI can be patterned using a photolithographic process.","In and at step , a via  is then etched into the sacrificial layer  to a depth of approximately 1.0 \u03bcm. In and at step , a relatively thick layer of gold  or other suitable metal or metal alloy may be disposed over the control signal electrode  and sacrificial layer  using an electroplating process. In an embodiment, the relatively thick layer of gold  or other suitable metal or metal alloy may be approximately 5.0 \u03bcm in thickness. Thereafter, the relatively thick layer of gold  or other suitable metal or metal alloy may be may be patterned to form the first cantilever  and\/or any other mechanical devices, as shown below with respect to ","In and at step , a wet chemical etching and\/or solvent process is employed to remove the sacrificial layer , which operates to free the first cantilever  and\/or any other mechanical structures formed on the substrate . Optionally, the wet chemical etching and\/or solvent process may be followed by a drying process, which uses a COcritical point dryer to minimize stiction while drying the digital variable capacitance package . In an embodiment, a PMGI stripping agent may be used during the wet chemical etching and\/or solvent process for removal of the sacrificial layer .","Referring to , shown is a cross sectional view of each of the first, second and third cantilevers , , , respectively taken through lines a-a, b-b and c-c of . The first, second and third cantilevers , , , are constructed and arranged to sequentially pull in or actuate to an on-state when an increasing D.C. control voltage is applied to the signal electrode  (). In , the columns represents each of the first, second and third cantilevers and the rows represent the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  in various states (e.g., digital high state or digital low state).","In the exemplary embodiment, the sequence of operation of the digital variable capacitor package  includes State-0, as shown in row , representing the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  in off states (i.e., digital states: 0,0,0). State-1, as shown in row , represents the first cantilever  actuated to an on-state, while the second and third cantilevers ,  are in a non-actuated or off-state (i.e., digital states: 1,0,0). State-2 as shown in row , represents the first and second cantilevers ,  actuated to an on-state, while the third cantilever  is in a non-actuated or off-state (i.e., digital states: 1,1,0). State-3, as shown in row , represents the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  actuated to an on-state (i.e., digital states: 1,1,1).","The first, second and third cantilevers , ,  are constructed and arranged to pull-in at voltage levels below 40 Volts, and the pull-in voltages are all separated by at least 2.5 Volts. The pull-in voltage of the first, second and third cantilevers , ,  may be calculated using a one dimensional linear spring model, as shown in and . This model makes three simplifying assumptions: first, that the force applied to each cantilever , , or  is a point force applied to the cantilever , , or  at a distance, \u03b1\u00b7l, from the cantilever support member; such as support members and of , second that the spring constant of the support region can be assumed valid for this entire length, and third that the force can be calculated assuming that the gap \u201cg\u201d () is constant across the capacitor plate region. These assumptions introduce systematic errors into the calculation of the pull-in voltage. However, beam thickness and the gap across a fabricated wafer result in variations in the pull-in voltage on the order of \u00b110%. In addition, run to run variation of the pull-in voltage may be greater than \u00b115%. This modeling is directed to verifying and ensuring that the three capacitors (e.g., first, second, and third digital capacitors , ,  () of each of the first, second and third cantilevers , , ) have separate pull-in voltages to ensure four distinct capacitance states as shown and described above with respect to .","The spring constant, k, is calculated as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["k","sp"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"3","mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7"],"mi":["E","I"]},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mn":"1","mi":"b"}}},"mn":"3"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7"],"msub":{"mi":["w","b"]},"msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"3"}},"mn":"12"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["b ","b"],"b":["20","22","24","32","20","20","22","24","20","22","24","32"],"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a","b ","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00003","num":"00003"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"=","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mfrac":{"msub":{"mn":"1","mi":"c"},"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mn":"1","mi":"b"}}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["b ","c "],"b":["32","32","20","32","20","20","20","22","24","20","22","24"],"i":["a","b ","a","b ","a","b","b"],"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["V","pi"]},"mo":"=","msqrt":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":"4","mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7"],"msub":{"mi":["k","sp"]},"msubsup":{"mi":"g","mn":["0","3"]}},{"mn":"27","mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7","\u00b7"],"msub":[{"mi":"\u025b","mn":"0"},{"mn":"1","mi":"c"},{"mi":["w","c"]}]}]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"4"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["0 ","0 "],"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 6","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":["6","26","28","30","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"The digital variable capacitor  of the present invention may be of interest to microwave circuit designers because it provides a higher quality factor (Q>100) than other integrated reactive tuning devices (Q<50) at frequencies above XX GHz. In addition, the digital variable capacitor  has been shown to have high capacitance ratios (>1.5) and relatively high self-resonant frequencies (>40 GHz). Further, the digital variable capacitor package  includes exceptional linearity with respect to microwave signal power. The overall high performance of this device is very promising for applications including voltage controlled oscillators, tunable filters, and tunable matching networks.","The digital variable capacitor  of the present invention may be widely used in microwave and wireless systems as reactive tuning elements. Furthermore, the digital variable capacitor  may be employed as a tuning element for a voltage controlled oscillator. Varying the capacitance in the circuit varies the center frequency of the oscillator. Another common example may include using the digital variable capacitor  in phase shifters for phased array antennas. Yet another example is the use of the digital variable capacitor  in tuning circuits for matching an input feed to an antenna over a wide bandwidth.","The digital variable capacitor  of the present invention may also be used for applications at frequencies in the microwave to millimeter-wave frequency ranges. Of particular value is the discrete capacitance state which is provided by sequentially actuating each of the first, second and third cantilevers , , . In applications such as radar, the performance of the system is very sensitive to phase variations in elements such as the phase shifter.","As compared to traditional variable capacitors, the digital variable capacitor  of the present invention offers a good tuning ratio, relatively high Q, and discrete capacitance states. The tuning ratio of 1.7:1 can be improved significantly by increasing the initial air gap, or decreasing the final landing height. These changes are readily implemented and allow designers a greater degree of freedom than traditional designs. The high Q of this device is inherent to the metal air metal capacitor design. The thick metal layer and compact size provide very low losses. This directly translates into improved performance when integrated into systems. Finally, the discrete capacitance states, have significant potential impact in areas where phase noise is a critical parameter, specifically radar.","One skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention based on the above-described embodiments.
