title: Providing logical networking functionality for managed computer networks
abstract: Techniques are described for providing logical networking functionality for managed computer networks, such as for virtual computer networks provided on behalf of users or other entities. In some situations, a user may configure or otherwise specify a network topology for a virtual computer network, such as a logical network topology that separates multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network into multiple logical sub-networks and/or that specifies one or more logical networking devices for the virtual computer network. After a network topology is specified for a virtual computer network, logical networking functionality corresponding to the network topology may be provided in various manners, such as without physically implementing the network topology for the virtual computer network. In some situations, the computing nodes may include virtual machine nodes hosted on one or more physical computing machines or systems, such as by or on behalf of one or more users.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many companies and other organizations operate computer networks that interconnect numerous computing systems to support their operations, with the computing systems alternatively co-located (e.g., as part of a private local network) or instead located in multiple distinct geographical locations (e.g., connected via one or more private or shared intermediate networks). For example, data centers housing significant numbers of interconnected computing systems have become commonplace, such as private data centers that are operated by and on behalf of a single organization, as well as public data centers that are operated by entities as businesses. Some public data center operators provide network access, power, and secure installation facilities for hardware owned by various customers, while other public data center operators provide \u201cfull service\u201d facilities that also include hardware resources made available for use by their customers. However, as the scale and scope of typical data centers and computer networks has increased, the task of provisioning, administering, and managing the associated physical computing resources has become increasingly complicated.","The advent of virtualization technologies for commodity hardware has provided some benefits with respect to managing large-scale computing resources for many customers with diverse needs, allowing various computing resources to be efficiently and securely shared between multiple customers. For example, virtualization technologies such as those provided by VMWare, XEN, or User-Mode Linux may allow a single physical computing machine to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with one or more virtual machines hosted by the single physical computing machine, with each such virtual machine being a software simulation acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource, while also providing application isolation and security among the various virtual machines. Furthermore, some virtualization technologies are capable of providing virtual resources that span one or more physical resources, such as a single virtual machine with multiple virtual processors that actually spans multiple distinct physical computing systems.","Techniques are described for providing logical networking functionality for managed computer networks, such as for virtual computer networks that are provided on behalf of users or other entities. In at least some embodiments, the techniques enable a user to configure or otherwise specify a network topology for a virtual computer network being provided for the user, such as a logical network topology that separates multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network into multiple logical sub-networks and\/or that specifies one or more logical networking devices that are each associated with a specified group of the multiple computing nodes. After a network topology is specified for a virtual computer network, logical networking functionality corresponding to the network topology may be provided in various manners, such as without physically implementing the network topology for the virtual computer network. In particular, in at least some embodiments, communications between multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network are managed so as to emulate functionality that would be provided by specified logical networking devices if they were physically present and\/or to otherwise emulate functionality corresponding to a specified network topology if it was physically implemented, as described in greater detail below. In at least some embodiments, some or all of the described techniques are automatically performed by embodiments of an Overlay Network Manager system.","A virtual local network or other virtual computer network between multiple computing nodes may be provided in various ways in various embodiments, such as by creating an overlay network using one or more intermediate physical networks that separate the multiple computing nodes. In such embodiments, the intermediate physical network(s) may be used as a substrate network on which the overlay virtual computer network is provided, with messages between computing nodes of the overlay virtual computer network being passed over the intermediate physical network(s), but with the computing nodes being unaware of the existence and use of the intermediate physical network(s) in at least some such embodiments. For example, the multiple computing nodes may each have a distinct physical substrate network address that corresponds to a location of the computing node within the intermediate physical network(s), such as a substrate IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) network address (e.g., an IP network address that is specified in accordance with IPv4, or \u201cInternet Protocol version 4,\u201d or in accordance with IPv6, or \u201cInternet Protocol version 6,\u201d such as to reflect the networking protocol used by the intermediate physical networks). In other embodiments, a substrate network on which a virtual computer network is overlaid may itself include or be composed of one or more other virtual computer networks, such as other virtual computer networks implemented by one or more third parties (e.g., by an operator or provider of Internet or telecom infrastructure).","When computing nodes are selected to participate in a virtual computer network being provided by the Overlay Network Manager system and being overlaid on a substrate network, each computing node may be assigned one or more virtual network addresses for the provided virtual computer network that are unrelated to those computing nodes' substrate network addresses, such as from a range of virtual network addresses used for the provided virtual computer network\u2014in at least some embodiments and situations, the virtual computer network being provided may further use a networking protocol that is different from the networking protocol used by the substrate network (e.g., with the virtual computer network using the IPv4 networking protocol, and the substrate computer network using the IPv6 networking protocol). The computing nodes of the virtual computer network inter-communicate using the virtual network addresses (e.g., by sending a communication to another destination computing node by specifying that destination computing node's virtual network address as the destination network address for the communication), but the substrate network may be configured to route or otherwise forward communications based on substrate network addresses (e.g., by physical network router devices and other physical networking devices of the substrate network). If so, the overlay virtual computer network may be implemented from the edge of the intermediate physical network(s), by modifying the communications that enter the intermediate physical network(s) to use substrate network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the substrate network, and by modifying the communications that leave the intermediate physical network(s) to use virtual network addresses that are based on the networking protocol of the virtual computer network. Additional details related to the provision of such an overlay virtual computer network are included below.","In at least some embodiments, an embodiment of an Overlay Network Manager (\u201cONM\u201d) system provides overlay virtual computer networks to customers and other users, such as by providing and using numerous computing nodes that are in one or more geographical locations (e.g., in one or more data centers) and that are inter-connected via one or more intermediate physical networks. The ONM system may use various communication manager modules at the edge of the one or more intermediate physical networks to manage communications for the various overlay virtual computer networks as they enter and leave the intermediate physical network(s), and may use one or more system manager modules to coordinate other operations of the ONM system. For example, to enable the communication manager modules to manage communications for the overlay virtual computer networks being provided, the ONM system may track and use various information about the computing nodes of each virtual computer network, such as to map the substrate physical network address of each such computing node to the one or more overlay virtual network addresses associated with the computing node. Such mapping and other information may be stored and propagated in various manners in various embodiments, including centrally or in a distributed manner, as discussed in greater detail below.","Furthermore, in order to provide virtual computer networks to users and other entities in a desired manner, the ONM system allows users and other entities to interact with the ONM system in at least some embodiments to configure a variety of types of information for virtual computer networks that are provided by the ONM system on behalf of the users or other entities, and may track and use such configuration information as part of providing those virtual computer networks. The configuration information for a particular virtual computer network having multiple computing nodes may include, for example, one or more of the following non-exclusive list: a quantity of the multiple computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network; one or more particular computing nodes to include as part of the virtual computer network; a range or other group of multiple virtual network addresses to associate with the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network; particular virtual network addresses to associate with particular computing nodes or particular groups of related computing nodes; a type of at least some of the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network, such as to reflect quantities and\/or types of computing resources to be included with or otherwise available to the computing nodes; a geographic location at which some or all of the computing nodes of the virtual computer network are to be located; etc. In addition, the configuration information for a virtual computer network may be specified by a user or other entity in various manners in various embodiments, such as by an executing program of the user or other entity that interacts with an API (\u201capplication programming interface\u201d) provided by the ONM system for that purpose and\/or by a user that interactively uses a GUI (\u201cgraphical user interface\u201d) provided by the ONM system for that purpose.","In addition, as previously noted, logical networking functionality for managed computer networks may be provided by the ONM system in various manners in various embodiments, with the ONM system performing various actions to support such logical networking functionality. For example, a user or other entity may interact with the ONM system in at least some embodiments to configure various information about a network topology of a particular virtual computer network, and the ONM system may track and use such network topology configuration information as part of providing that virtual computer network. The network topology configuration information for a virtual computer network may include various types of information, including the following non-exclusive list: a specified arrangement of the multiple computing nodes of the virtual computer network, such as to have a first subset of the multiple computing nodes being part of a first sub-network that is associated with a first specified network router device, and to have a second subset of the multiple computing nodes being part of a second sub-network that is associated with a second specified network router device, etc; one or more specified network router devices or other networking devices that are to operate as part of the virtual computer network, such as to each support particular computing nodes and\/or to perform particular indicated functions; etc.","The ONM system may take various actions to support a network topology that is specified for a particular virtual computer network. In particular, in at least some embodiments, the ONM system may emulate logical networking functionality that corresponds to the specified network topology for a virtual computer network, but without physically implementing some or all of the specified network topology. As one example, the ONM system may use multiple communication manager modules to transparently manage communications sent by and to the computing nodes of the virtual computer network in a manner that emulates functionality that would be provided by one or more specified networking devices of the network topology if they were physically implemented for the virtual computer network and were used to route or otherwise forward the communications. Furthermore, the ONM system may use multiple communication manager modules to emulate responses to networking requests made by computing nodes in the manner of a local physical networking device, such as to respond to ping requests, SNMP (\u201cSimple Network Management Protocol\u201d) queries, etc. In this manner, the ONM system may provide logical networking functionality that corresponds to a specified network topology for a virtual computer network, but without the computing nodes of the virtual computer network (or the associated user or other entity) being aware that the specified network topology is not physically implemented for the virtual computer network. Furthermore, as described in greater detail below, in at least some embodiments, multiple modules of the ONM system may operate together in a distributed manner to provide functionality corresponding to a particular logical networking device, such that no single module or physical device is singly responsible for emulating a particular logical networking device. Additional details related to providing a logical networking functionality for a virtual computer network in accordance with specified configuration information are included below.","In at least some embodiments, the computing nodes between which communications are managed may be physical computing systems and\/or may be virtual machines that are each hosted on one or more physical computing systems, and the communications may include transmissions of data (e.g., messages, packets, frames, streams, etc.) in various formats. As previously noted, some or all computing nodes used for a particular provided overlay virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided by the ONM system for use by users, while in other embodiments some or all such computing nodes may instead be provided by a user who uses those computing nodes. Furthermore, in at least some situations, an embodiment of the ONM system may be part of or otherwise affiliated with a program execution service (or \u201cPES\u201d) that executes multiple programs on behalf of multiple customers or other users of the service, such as a program execution service that uses multiple computing systems on multiple physical networks (e.g., multiple physical computing systems and networks within a data center). In at least some such embodiments, virtual computer networks to which computing nodes belong may be selected based on associated users, such as based on the computing nodes executing programs on behalf of a user or other entity. In addition, in some situations, an embodiment of the ONM system may be part of or otherwise affiliated with a configurable network service (or \u201cCNS\u201d) that provides configurable private computer networks to multiple customers or other users of the service, such as by using cloud computing techniques with multiple computing systems that are provided on multiple physical networks (e.g., multiple physical computing systems and networks within a data center).","As previously noted, a virtual computer network may in some embodiments be provided as an overlay network that uses one or more intermediate physical networks as a substrate network, and one or more such overlay virtual computer networks may be implemented over the substrate network in various ways in various embodiments. For example, in at least some embodiments, communications between nodes of an overlay virtual computer network are managed by sending those communications over the substrate network without encapsulating the communications, such as by embedding virtual network address information for a computing node of the virtual computer network (e.g., the destination computing node's virtual network address) in a larger physical network address space used for a networking protocol of the one or more intermediate physical networks. As one illustrative example, a virtual computer network may be implemented using 32-bit IPv4 network addresses, and those 32-bit virtual network addresses may be embedded as part of 128-bit IPv6 network addresses used by the one or more intermediate physical networks, such as by re-headering communication packets or other data transmissions (e.g., using Stateless IP\/ICMP Translation, or SIIT), or otherwise modifying such data transmissions to translate them from a first networking protocol for which they are configured to a distinct second networking protocol. As another illustrative example, both the virtual computer network and substrate computer network may be implemented using the same network addressing protocol (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6), and data transmissions sent via the provided overlay virtual computer network using virtual network addresses may be modified to use different physical network addresses corresponding to the substrate network while the transmissions are sent over the substrate network, but with the original virtual network addresses being stored in the modified data transmissions or otherwise tracked so that the data transmissions may be restored to their original form when they exit the substrate network. In other embodiments, at least some of the overlay computer networks may be implemented using encapsulation of communications. Additional details related to SIIT are available at \u201cRequest For Comments 2765-Stateless IP\/ICMP Translation Algorithm\u201d, February 2000, at tools<dot>ieff<dot>org<slash>html<slash>rfc2765 (where <dot> and <slash> are replaced by the corresponding characters with those names), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. More generally, in some embodiments when implementing a first overlay network using a second substrate network, an N-bit network address that is specified for the first overlay network in accordance with a first network addressing protocol may be embedded as part of another M-bit network address that is specified for the second substrate network in accordance with a second network addressing protocol, with \u201cN\u201d and \u201cM\u201d being any integers that correspond to network addressing protocols. In addition, in at least some embodiments, an N-bit network address may be embedded in another network address using more or less than N bits of the other network address, such as if a group of N-bit network addresses of interest may be represented using a smaller number of bits (e.g., with L-bit labels or identifiers being mapped to particular N-bit network addresses and embedded in the other network addresses, where \u201cL\u201d is less than \u201cN\u201d).","Various benefits may be obtained from embedding virtual network address information in substrate network addresses for an underlying physical substrate network, including enabling an overlay of the virtual computer network on the physical substrate network without encapsulating communications or configuring physical networking devices of the physical substrate network, as discussed in greater detail below. Furthermore, other information may similarly be embedded in the larger physical network address space for a communication between computing nodes in at least some embodiments and situations, such as an identifier specific to a particular virtual computer network that includes those computing nodes (e.g., a virtual computer network for a user or other entity on whose behalf those computing nodes operate). Additional details related to provision of such virtual computer networks via use of overlay networks are included below.","Furthermore, in addition to managing configured network topologies for provided virtual computer networks, the ONM system may use the described techniques to provide various other benefits in various situations, such as limiting communications to and\/or from computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network to other computing nodes that belong to that virtual computer network. In this manner, computing nodes that belong to multiple virtual computer networks may share parts of one or more intermediate physical networks, while still maintaining network isolation for computing nodes of a particular virtual computer network. In addition, the use of the described techniques also allows computing nodes to easily be added to and\/or removed from a virtual computer network, such as to allow a user to dynamically modify the size of a virtual computer network (e.g., to dynamically modify the quantity of computing nodes to reflect an amount of current need for more or less computing resources). Furthermore, the use of the described techniques also supports changes to an underlying substrate network\u2014for example, if the underlying substrate network is expanded to include additional computing nodes at additional geographical locations, existing or new virtual computer networks being provided may seamlessly use those additional computing nodes, since the underlying substrate network will route communications to and from the substrate network addresses for those additional computing nodes in the same manner as for other previously existing substrate network computing nodes. In at least some embodiments, the underlying substrate network may be of any size (e.g., spanning multiple countries or continents), without regard to network latency between computing nodes at different locations.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which specific types of computing nodes, networks, communications, network topologies, and configuration operations are performed. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity, and the inventive techniques may be used in a wide variety of other situations, some of which are discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The illustrated example includes an example data center  with multiple physical computing systems operated on behalf of the ONM system. The example data center  is connected to a global internet  external to the data center , which provides access to one or more computing systems via private network , to one or more other globally accessible data centers  that each have multiple computing systems (not shown), and to one or more other computing systems . The global internet  may be, for example, a publicly accessible network of networks (possibly operated by various distinct parties), such as the Internet, and the private network  may be, for example, a corporate network that is wholly or partially inaccessible from computing systems external to the private network . Computing systems may be, for example, home computing systems or mobile computing devices that each connects directly to the Internet (e.g., via a telephone line, cable modem, a Digital Subscriber Line (\u201cDSL\u201d), cellular network or other wireless connection, etc.).","The example data center  includes a number of physical computing systems -and -, as well as a Communication Manager module  that executes on one or more other computing systems (not shown) to manage communications for the associated computing systems -, and a System Manager module  that executes on one or more computing systems (not shown). In this example, each physical computing system -hosts multiple virtual machine computing nodes and includes an associated virtual machine (\u201cVM\u201d) communication manager module (e.g., as part of a virtual machine hypervisor monitor for the physical computing system), such as VM Communication Manager module and virtual machines on host computing system , and such as VM Communication Manager module and virtual machines on host computing system . Physical computing systems -do not execute any virtual machines in this example, and thus may each act as a computing node that directly executes one or more software programs on behalf of a user. The Communication Manager module  that manages communications for the associated computing systems -may have various forms, such as, for example, a proxy computing device, firewall device, or networking device (e.g., a switch, router, hub, etc.) through which communications to and from the physical computing systems travel. In other embodiments, all or none of the physical computing systems at the data center may host virtual machines.","This example data center  further includes multiple physical networking devices, such as switches -, edge router devices -, and core router devices -. Switch is part of a physical sub-network that includes physical computing systems -, and is connected to edge router . Switch is part of a distinct physical sub-network that includes physical computing systems and -, as well as the computing systems providing the Communication Manager module  and the System Manager module , and is connected to edge router . The physical sub-networks established by switches -, in turn, are connected to each other and other networks (e.g., the global internet ) via an intermediate interconnection network , which includes the edge routers -and the core routers -. The edge routers -provide gateways between two or more sub-networks or networks. For example, edge router provides a gateway between the physical sub-network established by switch and the interconnection network , while edge router provides a gateway between the interconnection network  and global internet . The core routers -manage communications within the interconnection network , such as by routing or otherwise forwarding packets or other data transmissions as appropriate based on characteristics of such data transmissions (e.g., header information including source and\/or destination addresses, protocol identifiers, etc.) and\/or the characteristics of the interconnection network  itself (e.g., routes based on the physical network topology, etc.).","The illustrated System Manager module and Communication Manager modules may perform at least some of the described techniques in order to configure, authorize and otherwise manage communications sent to and from associated computing nodes, including to support providing various logical networking functionality for one or more virtual computer networks that are provided using various of the computing nodes. For example, Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes , Communication Manager module manages associated virtual machine computing nodes , and each of the other Communication Manager modules may similarly manage communications for a group of one or more other associated computing nodes. The illustrated Communication Manager modules may configure communications between computing nodes so as to overlay a particular virtual network over one or more intermediate physical networks that are used as a substrate network, such as over the interconnection network . Furthermore, a particular virtual network may optionally be extended beyond the data center  in some embodiments, such as if one or more other data centers  also provide computing nodes that are available for use by the example ONM system, and the particular virtual network includes computing nodes at two or more such data centers at two or more distinct geographical locations. Multiple such data centers or other geographical locations of one or more computing nodes may be inter-connected in various manners, including the following: directly via one or more public networks; via a private connection, not shown (e.g., a dedicated physical connection that is not shared with any third parties, a VPN or other mechanism that provides the private connection over a public network, etc.); etc. In addition, while not illustrated here, other such data centers or other geographical locations may each include one or more other Communication Manager modules that manage communications for computing systems at that data center or other geographical location, as well as over the global internet  to the data center  and any other such data centers .","In addition, a particular virtual computer network may optionally be extended beyond the data center  in other manners in other embodiments, such as if one or more other Communication Manager modules at the data center  are placed between edge router and the global internet , or instead based on one or more other Communication Manager modules external to the data center  (e.g., if another Communication Manager module is made part of private network , so as to manage communications for computing systems over the global internet  and private network ; etc.). Thus, for example, if an organization operating private network  desires to virtually extend its private computer network  to one or more of the computing nodes of the data center , it may do so by implementing one or more Communication Manager modules as part of the private network  (e.g., as part of the interface between the private network  and the global internet )\u2014in this manner, computing systems within the private network  may communicate with those data center computing nodes as if those data center computing nodes were part of the private network.","Thus, as one illustrative example, one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system (in this example, virtual machine computing node ) may be part of the same virtual local computer network as one of the virtual machine computing nodes on computing system (in this example, virtual machine computing node ), such as with the IPv4 networking protocol being used to represent the virtual network addresses for the virtual local network. The virtual machine  may then direct an outgoing communication (not shown) to the destination virtual machine computing node , such as by specifying a virtual network address for that destination virtual machine computing node. The Communication Manager module receives the outgoing communication, and in at least some embodiments determines whether to authorize the sending of the outgoing communication, such as based on previously obtained information about the sending virtual machine computing node  and\/or about the destination virtual machine computing node  (e.g., information about virtual networks and\/or entities with which the computing nodes are associated), and\/or by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module  (e.g., to obtain an authorization determination, to obtain some or all such information, etc.). By not delivering unauthorized communications to computing nodes, network isolation and security of entities' virtual computer networks is enhanced.","If the Communication Manager module determines that the outgoing communication is authorized (or does not perform such an authorization determination), the module determines the actual physical network location corresponding to the destination virtual network address for the communication. For example, the Communication Manager module may determine the actual destination network address to use for the virtual network address of the destination virtual machine  by dynamically interacting with the System Manager module , or may have previously determined and stored that information (e.g., in response to a request from the sending virtual machine  for information about that destination virtual network address, such as a request that the virtual machine  specifies using Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP). The Communication Manager module then re-headers or otherwise modifies the outgoing communication so that it is directed to Communication Manager module using an actual substrate network address, such as if Communication Manager module is associated with a range of multiple such actual substrate network addresses.  provide examples of doing such communication management in some embodiments, including to emulate logical networking functionality specified for the virtual network.","When Communication Manager module receives the communication via the interconnection network  in this example, it obtains the virtual destination network address for the communication (e.g., by extracting the virtual destination network address from the communication), and determines to which of the virtual machine computing nodes managed by the Communication Manager module that the communication is directed. The Communication Manager module next determines whether the communication is authorized for the destination virtual machine computing node , with examples of such authorization activities discussed in further detail in the examples of . If the communication is determined to be authorized (or the Communication Manager module does not perform such an authorization determination), the Communication Manager module then re-headers or otherwise modifies the incoming communication so that it is directed to the destination virtual machine computing node  using an appropriate virtual network address for the virtual computer network, such as by using the sending virtual machine computing node 's virtual network address as the source network address and by using the destination virtual machine computing node 's virtual network address as the destination network address. The Communication Manager module then forwards the modified communication to the destination virtual machine computing node . In at least some embodiments, before forwarding the incoming communication to the destination virtual machine, the Communication Manager module may also perform additional steps related to security, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","In addition, while not illustrated in , in some embodiments the various Communication Manager modules may take further actions to provide logical networking functionality corresponding to a specified network topology for the virtual computer network, such as by managing communications between computing nodes of the virtual computer network in specified manners and by responding to other types of requests sent by computing nodes of the virtual computer network. For example, although being separated from computing node  on physical computing system by the interconnection network  in the example embodiment of , virtual machine computing node  on physical computing system may be configured to be part of the same logical sub-network of the virtual computer network as computing node  (e.g., to not be separated by any logical specified router devices). Conversely, despite the physical proximity of virtual machine computing node  on physical computing system to virtual machine computing node  on physical computing system (i.e., being part of the same physical sub-network without any intervening physical router devices) in the example embodiment of , computing node  may be configured to be part of a distinct logical sub-network of the virtual computer network from that of computing node  (e.g., may be configured to be separated by one or more logical specified router devices, not shown). If so, the previous example of sending a communication from computing node  to computing node  may be performed in the manner previously described, without emulating the actions of any intervening logical router devices (despite the use of multiple physical router devices in the substrate interconnection network  for forwarding the communication), since computing nodes  and  are configured to be part of single sub-network in the specified network topology.","However, if computing node  sends an additional communication to computing node , the Communication Manager modules and\/or on the host computing systems and may perform additional actions that correspond to one or more logical specified router devices configured in the specified network topology to separate the computing nodes  and . For example, the source computing node  may send the additional communication in such a manner as to initially direct it to a first of the logical specified router devices that is configured to be local to computing node  (e.g., by including a virtual hardware address in the header of the additional communication that corresponds to that first logical specified router device), with that first logical specified router device being expected to forward the additional communication on toward the destination computing node  via the specified logical network topology. If so, the source Communication Manager module may detect that forwarding of the additional communication to the logical first router device (e.g., based on the virtual hardware address used in the header of the additional communication), or otherwise be aware of the configured network topology for the virtual computer network, and may take actions to emulate functionality of some or all of the logical specified router devices that are configured in the specified network topology to separate the computing nodes  and . For example, each logical router device that forwards the additional communication may be expected to take actions such as modifying a TTL (\u201ctime to live\u201d) hop value for the communication, modify a virtual destination hardware address that is specified for the communication to indicate the next intended destination of the additional communication on a route to the destination computing node, and\/or otherwise modify the communication header. If so, the source Communication Manager module may perform some or all of those actions before forwarding the additional communication to the destination Communication Manager module over the substrate network (in this case, via physical switch device ) for provision to destination computing node . Alternatively, some or all such additional actions to provide the logical networking functionality for the sent additional communication may instead be performed by the destination Communication Manager module after the additional communication is forwarded to the Communication Manager module by the Communication Manager module . The example of  provides additional details regarding examples of providing logical networking functionality.","By providing logical networking functionality using the described techniques, the ONM system provides various benefits. For example, because the various Communication Manager modules manage the overlay virtual network and may emulate functionality of logical networking devices, specified networking devices and other network topology do not need to be physically implemented for virtual computer networks being provided, and thus corresponding modifications are not needed to the interconnection network  or switches -to support particular configured network topologies. Nonetheless, if the computing nodes and software programs of a virtual computer network have been configured to expect a particular network topology for the virtual computer network, the appearance of that network topology may nonetheless be transparently provided for those computing nodes by the described techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2C","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["205","255","250","250","250","290","205","205","255","255","205","255"],"i":["a","c","a ","b","b "]},"In this example, the computing nodes  are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module R , the computing nodes  are managed by and physically connected to an associated Communication Manager module S , and the ONM Communication Manager modules  and  are physically connected to an interconnection network , as is the System Manager module , although the physical interconnections between computing nodes, modules and the interconnection network are not illustrated in this example. As one example, computing nodes  may each be one of multiple virtual machines hosted by a single physical computing system, and Communication Manager module R may be part of a hypervisor virtual machine monitor for that physical computing system. For example, with reference to , computing nodes  may represent the virtual machines , and computing nodes  may represent the virtual machines . If so, Communication Manager module R may correspond to Communication Manager module of , Communication Manager module S would correspond to Communication Manager module of , the interconnection network  would correspond to interconnection network  of , and the System Manager module  would correspond to System Manager module  of . Alternatively, computing nodes  or  may instead each be a distinct physical computing system, such as to correspond to computing systems -of , or to computing nodes at other data centers or geographical locations (e.g., computing systems at another data center , computing systems , etc.).","Each of the Communication Manager modules of  is associated with a group of multiple physical substrate network addresses, which the Communication Manager modules manage on behalf of their associated computing nodes. For example, Communication Manager module R is shown to be associated with the IPv6 network address range of \u201c::0A:01\/72\u201d, which corresponds to the 128-bit addresses (in hexadecimal) from XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXA:0100:0000:0000:0000 to XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXA:01FF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF (representing 2 to the power of 56 unique IPv6 addresses), where each \u201cX\u201d may represent any hexadecimal character that is appropriate for a particular situation (e.g., with the initial 64 bits corresponding a particular organization and network topology, as discussed in greater detail with respect to ). The interconnection network  will forward any communication with a destination network address in that range to Communication Manager module R\u2014thus, with the initial 72 bits of the range specified, the Communication Manager module R may use the remaining available 56 bits to represent the computing nodes that it manages and to determine how to process incoming communications whose destination network addresses are in that range.","For purposes of the example shown in , computing nodes , , , and are part of a single virtual computer network for entity Z, and have assigned IPv4 virtual network addresses of \u201c10.0.0.2\u201d, \u201c10.0.5.1\u201d, \u201c10.0.0.3\u201d, and \u201c10.1.5.3\u201d, respectively. Because computing node is part of a distinct virtual computer network for entity Y, it can share the same virtual network address as computing node without confusion. In this example, computing node A wants to communicate with computing node G , which are configured in this example to be part of a single common local physical sub-network (not shown) in a network topology for the virtual computer network, and the interconnection network  and Communication Manager modules are transparent to computing nodes A and G in this example. In particular, despite the physical separation of computing nodes A and G, the Communication Manager modules  and  operate so as to overlay the virtual computer network for entity Z over the physical interconnection network  for communications between those computing nodes, so that the lack of an actual local network is transparent to the computing nodes A and G.","In order to send the communication to computing node G, computing node A exchanges various messages  with Communication Manager module R , despite in the illustrated embodiment being unaware of the existence of Communication Manager module R (i.e., computing node A may believe that it is transmitting a broadcast message to all other nodes on a local sub-network, such as via a specified switching device that computing node A believes connects the nodes on the local sub-network). In particular, in this example, computing node A first sends an ARP message request -that includes the virtual network address for computing node G (i.e., \u201c10.0.0.3\u201d) and that requests the corresponding hardware address for computing node G (e.g., a 48-bit MAC address). Communication Manager module R intercepts the ARP request -, and responds to computing node A with a spoofed ARP response message -that includes a virtual hardware address for computing node G.","To obtain the virtual hardware address for computing node G to use with the response message, the Communication Manager module R first checks a local store  of information that maps virtual hardware addresses to corresponding IPv6 actual physical substrate network addresses, with each of the virtual hardware addresses also corresponding to an IPv4 virtual network address for a particular entity's virtual network. If the local store  does not contain an entry for computing node G (e.g., if none of the computing nodes  have previously communicated with computing node G, if a prior entry in local store  for computing node G has expired based on an associated expiration time, etc.), the Communication Manager module R interacts  with System Manager module  to obtain the corresponding actual IPv6 physical substrate network address for computing node G on behalf of computing node A. In particular, in this example, the System Manager module  maintains provisioning information  that identifies where each computing node is actually located and to which entity and\/or virtual computer network the computing node belongs, such as by initiating execution of programs on computing nodes for entities and virtual computer networks or by otherwise obtaining such provisioning information. As discussed in greater detail with respect to , the System Manager module determines whether the request from Communication Manager module R on behalf of computing node A for computing node G's actual IPv6 physical substrate network address is valid, including whether computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G, and if so provides that actual IPv6 physical substrate network address.","Communication Manager module R receives the actual IPv6 physical substrate network address for computing node G from the System Manager module , and stores this received information as part of a new entry for computing node G as part of mapping information  for later use (optionally with an expiration time and\/or other information). In addition, in this example, Communication Manager module R determines a dummy virtual hardware address to be used for computing node G (e.g., by generating an identifier that is locally unique for the computing nodes managed by Communication Manager module R), stores that dummy virtual hardware address in conjunction with the received actual IPv6 physical substrate network address as part of the new mapping information entry, and provides the dummy virtual hardware address to computing node A as part of response message -. By maintaining such mapping information , later communications from computing node A to computing node G may be authorized by Communication Manager module R without further interactions with the System Manager module , based on the use of the dummy virtual hardware address previously provided by Communication Manager module R. In other embodiments, the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node G may instead not be a dummy address, such as if System Manager module  further maintains information about hardware addresses used by the various computing nodes (e.g., virtual hardware addresses assigned to virtual machine computing nodes, actual hardware addresses assigned to computing systems acting as computing nodes, etc.) and provides the hardware address used by computing node G to Communication Manager module R as part of the interactions . In such embodiments, the Communication Manager module R may take further actions if computing nodes on different virtual networks use the same virtual hardware address, such as to map each combination of computing node hardware address and virtual computer network to a corresponding substrate network address.","In other embodiments, Communication Manager module R may interact with System Manager module  to obtain a physical substrate network address for computing node G or otherwise determine such a physical substrate network address at times other than upon receiving an ARP request, such as in response to any received communication that is directed to computing node G using the virtual network address \u201c10.0.0.3\u201d as part of entity Z's virtual computer network. Furthermore, in other embodiments the virtual hardware addresses that are used may differ from this example, such as if the virtual hardware addresses are specified by the System Manager module , if the virtual hardware addresses are not random and instead store one or more types of information specific to the corresponding computing nodes, etc. In addition, in this example, if computing node A had not been determined to be authorized to send communications to computing node G, whether by the System Manager module  and\/or Communication Manager module R, Communication Manager module R would not send the response message -with the virtual hardware address (e.g., instead sends no response or an error message response).","In this example, the returned IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G in interactions  is \u201c::0B:02:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.3\u201d, where \u201c10.0.0.3\u201d is stored in the last 32 bits of the 128-bit IPv6 address, and where \u201c<Z-identifier>\u201d is a 24-bit entity network identifier for computing node G corresponding to the virtual computer network for entity Z (e.g., as previously assigned by the System Manager module to that network to reflect a random number or some other number corresponding to the entity). The initial 72 bits of the IPv6 network address store the \u201c::0B:02\u201d designation, corresponding to the sub-network or other portion of the interconnection network with a network address range of \u201c::0B:02\/72\u201d to which Communication Manager module S corresponds\u2014thus, a communication sent over the interconnection network  to IPv6 destination network address \u201c::0B:02:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.3\u201d will be routed to Communication Manager module S. In other embodiments, the entity network identifier may be other lengths (e.g., 32 bits, if Communication Manager module S has an associated network address range of 64 bits rather than 56 bits) and\/or may have other forms (e.g., may be random, may store various types of information, etc.), and the remaining 56 bits used for the network address range after the \u201c::0B:02\u201d designation may store other types of information (e.g., an identifier for a particular entity, a tag or label for the virtual network, etc.). Additional details related to an example configured IPv6 actual physical network address for use with an overlay virtual computer network are described with respect to .","After receiving the response message -from Communication Manager module R, computing node A creates and initiates the sending of a communication to computing node G, shown in  as communication -. In particular, the header of communication -includes a destination network address for destination computing node G that is \u201c10.0.0.3\u201d, a destination hardware address for destination computing node G that is the virtual hardware address provided to computing node A in message -, a source network address for sending computing node A that is \u201c10.0.0.2\u201d, and a source hardware address for sending computing node A that is an actual or dummy hardware address that was previously identified to computing node A. Since computing node A believes that computing node G is part of the same local sub-network as itself, computing node A does not need to direct the communication -to any intermediate logical router devices that are configured in the network topology to separate the computing nodes.","Communication Manager module R intercepts the communication -, modifies the communication as appropriate, and forwards the modified communication over the interconnection network  to computing node G. In particular, Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual destination network address and virtual destination hardware address for computing node G from the header, and then retrieves the IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual destination hardware address from mapping information . As previously noted, the IPv6 actual physical substrate network address in this example is \u201c::0B:02:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.3\u201d, and Communication Manager module R creates a new IPv6 header that includes that actual physical substrate network address as the destination address. Similarly, the Communication Manager module R extracts the virtual source network address and virtual source hardware address for computing node A from the header of the received communication, obtains an IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to that virtual source hardware address (e.g., from a stored entry in mapping information , by interacting with the System Manager module  to obtain that information if not previously obtained, etc.), and includes that actual physical substrate network address as the source network address for the new IPv6 header. In this example, the IPv6 actual physical substrate network address for computing node A is \u201c::0A:01:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.2\u201d, which if used in a reply by Communication Manager module S on behalf of computing node G will be routed to Communication Manager module R for forwarding to computing node A. The Communication Manager module R then creates communication - by modifying communication -so as to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new IPv6 header (e.g., in accordance with SIIT), including populating the new IPv6 header with other information as appropriate for the communication (e.g., payload length, traffic class packet priority, etc.). Thus, the communication - includes the same content or payload as communication -, without encapsulating the communication -within the communication -. Furthermore, access to the specific information within the payload is not needed for such re-headering, such as to allow Communication Manager module R to handle communications in which the payload is encrypted without needing to decrypt that payload.","In at least some embodiments, before forwarding communication - to Communication Manager module S, Communication Manager module R may perform one or more actions to determine that communication -is authorized to be forwarded to computing node G as communication -, such as based on the mapping information  including a valid entry for the destination virtual hardware address used in communication -(e.g., an entry specific to sending computing node in some embodiments, or instead an entry corresponding to any of the computing nodes  in other embodiments). In other embodiments, such an authorization determination may not be performed by Communication Manager module R for each outgoing communication, or instead may be performed in other manners (e.g., based on a determination that the sending node and destination node are part of the same virtual computer network or are associated with the same entity or are otherwise authorized to inter-communicate, based on an interaction with System Manager module  to obtain an authorization determination for the communication, etc.).","After Communication Manager module R forwards the modified communication - to the interconnection network , the interconnection network uses the physical IPv6 destination network address of the communication to route the communication to Communication Manager module S. In doing so, the devices of the interconnection network  do not use the portion of the destination network address that includes the embedded entity network identifier or embedded virtual network address, and thus do not need any special configuration to forward such a communication, nor even awareness that a virtual computer network is being overlaid on the physical interconnection network.","When Communication Manager module S receives communication - via the interconnection network , it performs actions similar to those of Communication Manager module R, but in reverse. In particular, in at least some embodiments, the Communication Manager module S verifies that communication - is legitimate and authorized to be forwarded to computing node G, such as via one or more interactions  with the System Manager module. If the communication is determined to be authorized (or if the authorization determination is not performed), the Communication Manager module S then modifies communication - as appropriate and forwards the modified communication to computing node G. Additional details related to the verification of the communication - are discussed with respect to .","In particular, to modify communication -, Communication Manager module S retrieves information from mapping information  that corresponds to computing node G, including the virtual hardware address used by computing node G (or generates such a virtual hardware address if not previously available, such as for a new computing node). Communication Manager module S then creates communication -by modifying communication - so as to replace the prior IPv6 header with a new IPv4 header (e.g., in accordance with SIIT). The new IPv4 header includes the virtual network address and virtual hardware address for computing node G as the destination network address and destination hardware address for the new IPv4 header, the virtual network address and a virtual hardware address for computing node A as the source network address and source hardware address for the new IPv4 header, and includes other information as appropriate for the communication (e.g., total length, header checksum, etc.). The virtual hardware address used by Communication Manager module S for computing node A may be the same as the hardware address used by Communication Manager module R for computing node A, but in other embodiments each Communication Manager module may maintain separate hardware address information that is not related to the information used by the other Communication Manager modules (e.g., if Communication Manager module S generated its own dummy virtual hardware address for computing node A in response to a prior ARP request from one of the computing nodes  for computing node A's hardware address). Thus, the communication -includes the same content or payload as communications -and -. Communication Manager module S then forwards communication -to computing node G.","After receiving communication -, computing node G determines to send a response communication -to computing node A, using the source virtual network address and source virtual hardware address for computing node A from communication -. Communication Manager module S receives response communication -, and processes it in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication -and Communication Manager module R. In particular, Communication Manager module S optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A, and then modifies communication -to create communication - by generating a new IPv6 header using mapping information . After forwarding communication - to the interconnection network , the communication is sent to Communication Manager module R, which processes the incoming communication in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to communication - and Communication Manager module S. In particular, Communication Manager module R optionally verifies that computing node G is authorized to send communications to computing node A and that communication - actually was sent from the substrate network location of computing node G, and then modifies communication - to create response communication -by generating a new IPv4 header using mapping information . Communication Manager module R then forwards response communication -to computing node A. In other embodiments and situations, Communication Manager modules R and\/or S may handle response communications differently from initial communications, such as to assume that response communications are authorized in at least some situations, and to not perform some or all authorization activities for response communications in those situations.","In this manner, computing nodes A and G may inter-communicate using a IPv4-based virtual computer network, without any special configuration of those computing nodes to handle the actual intervening IPv6-based substrate interconnection network, and interconnection network  may forward IPv6 communications without any special configuration of any physical networking devices of the interconnection network, based on the Communication Manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network over the actual physical interconnection network without encapsulation of communications and on using embedded virtual network addresses in the substrate physical network addresses.","In addition, while not illustrated with respect to , in at least some embodiments the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes. For example, Communication Manager modules may take various actions to support broadcast and multicast capabilities for computing nodes that they manage. As one example, in some embodiments, a special multicast group virtual network address suffix may be reserved from each entity network identifier prefix for use in signaling networking Layer 2 raw encapsulated communications. Similarly, for link-local broadcast and multicast communications, a special multicast group \/64 prefix may be reserved (e.g., \u201cFF36:0000::\u201d), while a different destination address prefix (e.g., \u201cFF15:0000::\u201d) may be used for other multicast communications. Thus, for example, multicast and broadcast IP frames may be encapsulated using a corresponding reserved 64-bit prefix for the first 64 bits of the 128-bit IPv6 address, with the remaining 64 bits including the virtual IPv4 network address for the destination computing node and the entity network identifier for the destination computing node in a manner similar to that previously described. Alternatively, in other embodiments, one or more types of broadcast and\/or multicast communications may each have a corresponding reserved label or other identifier that has a different value or form, including using a different number of bits and\/or being stored in a manner other than as a network address prefix. When a computing node sends a broadcast\/multicast communication, any Communication Manager module with an associated computing node that has subscribed to that multicast\/broadcast group would be identified (e.g., based on those Communication Manager modules having subscribed to the group, such as in response to prior join communications sent by those associated computing nodes), and the Communication Manager module for the sending computing node would forward the communication to each of the identified Communication Manager modules of the group, for forwarding to their appropriate managed computing nodes. In addition, in some embodiments and situations, at least some broadcast or multicast communications may not be forwarded by Communication Manager modules, such as communications with an IPv4 prefix of 224.0\/16 or another designated prefix or other label or identifier.","In addition to supporting broadcast and multicast capabilities for managed computing nodes, the Communication Manager modules may receive and handle other types of requests and communications on behalf of associated computing nodes that correspond to configured network topologies for the virtual computer networks to which the computing nodes belong. For example, computing nodes may send various requests that a specified local router device or other specified networking device would be expected to handle (e.g., ping requests, SNMP queries, etc.), and the associated Communication Manager modules may intercept such requests and take various corresponding actions to emulate the functionality that would have been provided by the specified networking device if it was physically implemented.","In addition, it will be appreciated that a Communication Manager module may facilitate communications between multiple of the computing nodes that are associated with that Communication Manager module. For example, with respect to , computing node may wish to send an additional communication (not shown) to computing node . If so, Communication Manager module R would perform actions similar to those previously described with respect to the handling of outgoing communication -by Communication Manager module R and the handling of incoming communication - by Communication Manager module S, but without re-headering of the additional communication to use an IPv6 header since the communication will not travel over the interconnection network. However, if computing nodes and are configured in a network topology for the virtual computer network to be separated by one or more logical networking devices, the Communication Manager module R may take additional actions to emulate the functionality of those logical networking devices, as discussed in greater detail with respect to .","While not illustrated with respect to , in at least some embodiments other types of requests and communications may also be handled in various ways. For example, in at least some embodiments, an entity may have one or more computing nodes that are managed by Communication Manager module(s) and that are part of a virtual computer network for that entity, and may further have one or more other non-managed computing systems (e.g., computing systems that are directly connected to the interconnection network  and\/or that natively use IPv6 network addressing) that do not have an associated Communication Manager module that manages their communications. If the entity desires that those non-managed computing systems be part of that virtual computer network or otherwise communicate with the managed computing nodes of the virtual computer network, such communications between managed computing nodes and non-managed computing systems may be handled by the Communication Manager module(s) that manage the one or more computing nodes in at least some such embodiments. For example, in such situations, if such a non-managed computing system is provided with an actual IPv6 destination network address for such a managed computing node (e.g., \u201c::0A:01:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.2\u201d for managed computing node A in this example), the non-managed computing system may send communications to computing node A via interconnection network  using that destination network address, and Communication Manager module R would forward those communications to computing node A (e.g., after re-headering the communications in a manner similar to that previously described) if Communication Manager module R is configured to accept communications from that non-managed computing system (or from any non-managed computing system). Furthermore, Communication Manager module R may generate a dummy virtual network address to correspond to such a non-managed computing system, map it to the actual IPv6 network address for the non-managed computing system, and provide the dummy virtual network address to computing node A (e.g., as the source address for the communications forwarded to computing node A from the non-managed computing system), thus allowing computing node A to send communications to the non-managed computing system.","Similarly, in at least some embodiments and situations, at least some managed computing nodes and\/or their virtual computer networks may be configured to allow communications with other devices that are not part of the virtual computer network, such as other non-managed computing systems or other types of network appliance devices that do not have an associated Communication Manager module that manages their communications. In such situations, if the managed computing nodes and\/or the virtual computer network is configured to allow communications with such other non-managed devices, such a non-managed device may similarly be provided with the actual IPv6 destination network address for such a computing node (e.g., \u201c::0A:01:<Z-identifier>:10.0.0.2\u201d for computing node A in this example), allowing the non-managed device to send communications to computing node A via interconnection network  using that destination network address, with Communication Manager module R then forwarding those communications to computing node A (e.g., after re-headering the communications in a manner similar to that previously described). Furthermore, Communication Manager module R may similarly manage outgoing communications from computing node A to such a non-managed device to allow computing node A to send such communications.","In addition, as previously noted, a communication manager module manages communications for associated computing nodes in various ways, including in some embodiments by assigning virtual network addresses to computing nodes of a virtual computer network, and\/or by assigning substrate physical network addresses to managed computing nodes from a range of substrate physical network addresses that correspond to the communication manager module. In other embodiments, some such activities may instead be performed by one or more computing nodes of the virtual computer network, such as to allow a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server or other device of a virtual computer network to specify virtual network addresses and\/or substrate physical network addresses to particular computing nodes of the virtual network. In such embodiments, the communication manager module obtains such configuration information from the virtual network device(s), and updates its mapping information accordingly (and in some embodiments may further update one or more system manager modules that maintain information about computing nodes associated with virtual networks). In yet other embodiments, a user or other entity associated with a virtual computer network may directly configure particular computing nodes to use particular virtual network addresses. If so, the communication manager modules and\/or system manager module may track which virtual network addresses are used by particular computing nodes, and similarly update stored mapping information accordingly.","In addition, in some embodiments and situations, a managed computing node may itself be treated as a phantom router, with multiple virtual network addresses associated with that managed computing node, and with that managed computing node forwarding communications to other computing nodes that correspond to those multiple virtual network addresses. In such embodiments, the communication manager module that manages communications for that managed router computing node handles communications to and from that computing node in a manner similar to that previously described. However, the communication manager module is configured with the multiple virtual network addresses that correspond to the managed router computing node, so that incoming communications to any of those multiple virtual network addresses are forwarded to the managed router computing node, and so that outgoing communications from the managed router computing node are given a substrate source physical network address that corresponds to the particular computing node that sent the communication via the managed router computing node. In this manner, routers or other networking devices of a particular customer or other entity may be virtually represented for a virtual computer network implemented for that entity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["210","260","290","220","225","290","250","225","225","1","290","225","1","290"],"i":"a "},"After the System Manager module  determines that computing node A is authorized to communicate with computing node G (e.g., based on having the same entity network identifier, based on computing node A having an entity network identifier that is authorized to communicate with computing nodes of the entity network identifier for computing node G, based on other information provided by or associated with computing node A indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications, based on information provided by or associated with computing node G indicating that computing node A is authorized to perform such communications, etc.), the System Manager module  returns a response message - that includes the desired actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node G. In addition, in at least some embodiments, before sending the desired actual physical network address, the System Manager module  may further verify that Communication Manager module R is authorized to send the message - on behalf of computing node A, such as based on computing node A being determined to be one of the computing nodes to which Communication Manager module R is associated.","In other embodiments, Communication Manager module R may perform some or all of the actions described as being performed by System Manager module , such as to maintain provisioning information for the various computing nodes and\/or to determine whether computing node A is authorized to send communications to computing node G, or instead no such authorization determination may be performed in some or all situations.

For example, logical router device J may be a local router device to computing node A (e.g., may manage a first sub-network that includes computing node A), and logical router device L may be a local router device to computing node H (e.g., may manage a distinct second sub-network that includes computing node H). While computing nodes A and H are illustrated as being separated by two router devices in the configured network topology in this example, it will be appreciated that two such computing nodes may be separated by 0, 1 or more than 2 router devices in other situations, and that other types of networking devices may separate computing nodes in some situations.","In the example of , the additional information that is shown for computing nodes A and H includes hardware addresses associated with those computing nodes for the virtual computer network, such as virtual hardware addresses that are assigned to the computing nodes by the System Manager module  and\/or the Communication Manager modules R and S.

The various hardware addresses will be used as part of the sending of the communication from computing node A to computing node H, and the providing of corresponding logical networking functionality for the virtual computer network, as described below.","Thus, in a manner similar to that described with respect to , computing node A determines to send a communication to computing node H, and accordingly exchanges various messages  with Communication Manager module R . In particular, in this example, computing node A first sends an ARP message request -for virtual hardware address information. However, unlike the example of  in which computing nodes A and G were part of the same logical sub-network, communications from computing node A to computing node H are expected to first pass through an initial intermediate destination of local router device J before being forwarded to computing node H. Accordingly, since logical router J is the initial intermediate destination for logically remote computing node H, the ARP message request -includes the virtual network address for logical router J (i.e., \u201c10.0.0.1\u201d) and requests the corresponding hardware address for logical router J. In other embodiments, computing node A may instead request virtual hardware address information for computing node H directly (e.g., using the virtual network address \u201c10.1.5.3\u201d for computing node H), but be provided with the corresponding hardware address for logical router J.","Communication Manager module R intercepts the ARP request -, and obtains a hardware address to provide to computing node A as part of spoofed ARP response message -. The Communication Manager module R may determine the hardware address for logical router J, as well as that computing node H is part of a distinct logical sub-network from computing node A, in various manners in various embodiments. For example, as previously discussed, the Communication Manager module R may store various hardware address information as part of mapping information , and if so may already have stored hardware address information for logical router J. If not, however, Communication Manager module R performs one or more interactions  with the System Manager module  to obtain information from the module  corresponding to the indicated virtual network address for logical router J. However, rather than obtaining a substrate network address corresponding to the indicated virtual network address, as for computing node G in , the System Manager module  indicates that the virtual network address corresponds to a logical router device of the configured network topology, and may also provide information to the Communication Manager module R that indicates the hardware address information for logical router J. In particular, the System Manager module  maintains various information  related to the configured network topology for the virtual computer networks that it provides or otherwise manages, such as information about specified networking devices, and use that information to provide requested information to Communication Manager modules. The Communication Manager module R then stores the received information as part of mapping information  for future use, and in this manner determines that computing node H is part of a distinct sub-network from computing node A in the configured network topology. Furthermore, Communication Manager module R provides computing node A with the hardware address \u201c00-01-42-09-88-73\u201d corresponding to logical router J as part of response message -. While request -and response message -actually pass between computing node A and Communication Manager module R in the manner discussed, from the standpoint of computing node A, the communications -and -are part of logical interactions  that occur with local router device J.","After receiving the response message -from Communication Manager module R, computing node A creates and initiates the sending of a communication to computing node H, shown in  as communication -. In particular, the header of communication -includes a destination network address for destination computing node H that is \u201c10.1.5.3\u201d, a destination hardware address that is the virtual hardware address for logical router J provided to computing node A in message -, a source network address for sending computing node A that is \u201c10.0.0.2\u201d, and a source hardware address for sending computing node A that is an actual or dummy hardware address that was previously identified to computing node A. From the standpoint of computing node A, the sent communication will be handled in the manner illustrated for logical communication , and will be sent to local logical router J as communication for forwarding based on the destination hardware address in the communication. If logical router J were physically implemented and received such a communication , it would modify the header of the communication and forward the modified communication to logical router L, which would similarly modify the header of the communication and forward the modified communication to computing node H. The modifications that logical router J would perform to such a communication may include decrementing a TTL network hop value in the header and changing the destination hardware address to correspond to the next destination, which in this example would be logical router L. Similarly, the modifications that logical router L would perform to such a communication may include further decrementing the TTL network hop value in the header and changing the destination hardware address to correspond to the next destination, which in this example would be computing node H.","While communication -from computing node A to computing node H is logically handled in the manner illustrated for communication , the communication -is actually intercepted and handled by Communication Manager module R. In particular, in a manner similar to that described in  for communication -, Communication Manager module R intercepts the communication -, modifies the communication as appropriate, and forwards the modified communication over the interconnection network  to computing node H. To determine the substrate network address to be used for forwarding the modified communication over the interconnection network , Communication Manager module R extracts the destination virtual network address and destination virtual hardware address from the header of communication -. However, based on the destination virtual hardware address corresponding to logical router J, Communication Manager module R determines to use the destination virtual network address to identify the destination substrate network address, in a manner different from that of . Thus, the Communication Manager module R checks the mapping information  to determine if a substrate network address corresponding to computing node H's virtual network address has been previously determined and stored. If not, Communication Manager module R performs one or more interactions  with the System Manager module  to determine that information, in a manner similar to the interactions  of . As discussed in greater detail with respect to , in response to the ARP request message -and\/or communication -, the Communication Manager module R and\/or the System Manager module  may further perform various optional authentication activities.","After Communication Manager module R determines the IPv6 actual physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node H, it creates a new IPv6 header that includes that actual physical substrate network address as the destination address, and similarly adds a source IPv6 address for computing node A to the new header. In this example, the physical substrate network address corresponding to computing node H is similar to that of computing node G, and in particular is the IPv6 substrate network address \u201c::0B:02:<Z-identifier>:10.1.5.3\u201d, where \u201c10.1.5.3\u201d is stored in the last 32 bits of the 128-bit IPv6 address, and where \u201c<Z-identifier>\u201d is a 24-bit entity network identifier for the virtual computer network. Thus, as with communications sent to computing node G, a communication sent over the interconnection network  to the substrate network address for computing node H will be routed to Communication Manager module S. The Communication Manager module R next creates a new communication - by modifying communication -so as to replace the prior IPv4 header with the new IPv6 header (e.g., in accordance with SIIT), including populating the new IPv6 header with other information as appropriate for the new communication (e.g., payload length, traffic class packet priority, etc.), and forwards communication - over the interconnection network . The interconnection network then uses the physical IPv6 destination network address of the communication - to route the communication to Communication Manager module S. When Communication Manager module S receives communication - via the interconnection network , it performs actions similar to those described in  with respect to communication -, including to modify the communication to include an appropriate IPv4 header, and to provide the modified communication as communication -to computing node H.","Furthermore, as noted elsewhere, Communication Manager module R and\/or Communication Manager module S take further actions in this example to modify the communication from computing node A to computing node H in such a manner as to provide logical networking functionality corresponding to the configured network topology for the virtual computer network, including to emulate functionality that would be provided by logical routers J and L if they were physically implemented for the virtual computer network. For example, as previously discussed, logical routers J and L would perform various modifications to communication  as it is forwarded to computing node H if those routers were physically implemented and used, including to modify TTL network hop values and to perform other header modifications. Accordingly, Communication Manager module R and\/or Communication Manager module S may perform similar modifications to the communication -and\/or -to emulate such functionality of the logical routers J and L. Thus, computing node H receives a communication -that appears to be communication forwarded via the specified network topology for the virtual computer network.","In this manner, the ONM system may provide logical networking functionality corresponding to the configured network topology, without any special configuration of the computing nodes of the virtual computer network or of the physical networking devices of the intervening substrate interconnection network, based on the Communication Manager modules overlaying the virtual computer network on the actual physical interconnection network in such a manner as to emulate the configured network topology. In addition, multiple modules of the ONM system may operate together in a distributed manner to provide functionality corresponding to a particular logical networking device, such as with modules ,  and  operating together in the previous example to emulate functionality corresponding to each of logical router devices and ","As previously noted, configuration information that is specified for a virtual computer network may include various network topology information, and various computing nodes may be selected for the virtual computer network and configured in accordance with the network topology in various manners. For example, in some embodiments, the selection of a computing node to be used in a virtual computer network and\/or to be assigned a particular role in a configured network topology may be based at least in part on a geographical and\/or network location of the computing node, such as an absolute location, or instead a location relative to one or more other computing resources of interest (e.g., other computing nodes of the same virtual network, storage resources to be used by the computing node, etc.), such as within a minimum and\/or maximum specified geographical distance or other degree of proximity to an indicated other computing resource or other location. In addition, in some embodiments, factors used when selecting a computing node may be not be based on location, such as to include one or more of the following: constraints related to capabilities of a computing node, such as resource-related criteria (e.g., an amount of memory, an amount of processor usage, an amount of network bandwidth, and\/or an amount of disk space), and\/or specialized capabilities available only on a subset of available computing nodes; constraints related to costs, such as based on fees or operating costs associated with use of particular computing nodes; etc.","Various other types of actions than those discussed with respect to  may be performed in other embodiments, including for types of network addressing protocols other than IPv4 and IPv6.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 2D","b":"272"},"In this example, the initial 64-bit network portion of the IPv6 address includes a 32-bit identifier for bits  through  that corresponds to a corporate or other organization identifier assigned to such an organization by an Internet registry operator on behalf of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (in this example, based on an assignment from the Regional Internet Registry RIPE NNC, or Reseaux IP Europeens Network Coordination Centre). For example, in some embodiments, an organization that operates an embodiment of the ONM system or another organization that uses the described techniques may have an associated identifier . The initial 64-bit network portion of the address also includes a 32-bit group of information in this example that corresponds to topology of a group of multiple computing nodes (e.g., a sub-network or other network portion) provided on behalf of the group whose identifier is indicated in information . As previously discussed, in at least some embodiments, the initial 64-bit network portion of the address represents a partial network address for the substrate network that corresponds to a location of multiple related computing nodes, such as a sub-network or other portion of the substrate network. In particular, the initial 64-bit network address portion in at least some embodiments corresponds to a particular communication manager module that represents multiple associated computing nodes being managed by the communication manager module, such as based on the communication manager module managing the range of network addresses corresponding to some or all of the 64-bit interface identifier address portion in order to represent the various managed computing nodes.

In particular, in the examples of  and , the first two bits (bits  and  of the overall IPv6 address) indicate a particular version of the topology information, such that the meaning of the remaining 30 bits may change over time or in different situations. With respect to example , various bits as shown each indicate different geographical locales, geographic areas within the locales, computer racks within the geographic areas, and physical computing system nodes within the computer racks. In this example, the 6 bits for the locale information may represent 64 unique values, the 8 bits for the area information may represent 256 unique values for each locale value, the 8 bits for the rack information may represent 256 unique values for each area value, and the 8 bits for the physical computing system node information may represent 256 unique values for each rack value. Conversely, with respect to example , only locale and rack information is shown, but each have additional bits in order to represent those types of information, such as to have 16,384 unique locale values using its 14 bits, and to have 65,536 unique rack values using its 16 bits for each locale value.

In some situations, a communication manager module tracks or otherwise determines the virtual computer networks to which the module's associated computing nodes belong (e.g., based on entities on whose behalf the virtual computer networks operate) as part of managing the communications for the virtual computer networks. The determination by a communication manager module of a corresponding virtual computer network for a computing node may be performed in various ways in various embodiments, such as by interacting with a system manager module that provides that information, by tracking software programs executing on such computing nodes, by tracking entities associated with such computing nodes, etc. For example, when a particular computing node begins to execute one or more software programs on behalf of a user, and that user also has other software programs executing on other computing nodes, the new computing node executing the user's program(s) may be selected to be associated with a virtual computer network for the user that includes those other computing nodes.

The header re-writing may further include changing other information in the new header, including changing a virtual network address for the sending computing node to be a corresponding physical substrate network address, and in at least some embodiments includes modifying the received communication without encapsulation as part of an overlay of the virtual computer network over the substrate one or more intermediate physical networks. Furthermore, for a communication whose destination hardware address does correspond to a logical networking device, the routine in block  may further perform other modifications that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by the one or more logical networking devices that would be used to forward the communication to the destination computing node in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. In block , the routine then facilitates providing of the modified outgoing communication to the destination computing node, such as by initiating forwarding of the modified outgoing communication over the substrate intermediate network(s) to the destination computing node. While not illustrated here, in other embodiments various additional types of processing may be performed for outgoing node communications, such as to verify that the communications are valid or otherwise authorized in various ways (e.g., to verify that the sending computing node is authorized to send communications to the destination computing node, such as based on being associated with the same entity or part of the same virtual computer network, based on the sending and destination computing nodes being associated with different entities that are authorized to inter-communicate, based on the type of communication or other information specific to the communication, etc.).","If it is instead determined in block  that the received message is an incoming node communication for one of the managed computing nodes from an external computing node, the routine continues to block  to identify the physical substrate network addresses for the sending and destination computing nodes from the communication header. After block , the routine continues to block  to optionally verify that the incoming communication is valid in one or more ways. For example, the routine may determine whether the physical substrate network address for the sending communication node is actually mapped to a computing node that corresponds to the source physical substrate network address location, such as based on interactions with a system manager module and\/or based on other information previously obtained and stored by the routine. In addition, the routine may determine whether the physical substrate network address for the destination communication node corresponds to an actual managed computing node. While not illustrated here, if an incoming communication is determined to not be valid, the routine may take various actions not shown, such as to generate one or more errors and perform associated processing and\/or drop the incoming communication without forwarding it to the indicated destination node. For example, if the incoming communication indicates a destination network address that does not correspond to a current managed computing node, the routine may drop the incoming communication and\/or initiate an error message, although in some embodiments such error messages are not sent to the sending computing node, or other actions may be taken to support forwarding communications to a moved computing node that was previously supported by the routine.","In the illustrated embodiment, after block , the routine continues to block  to retrieve the hardware address and the virtual network address that are mapped to the physical destination substrate network address, and to rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent to a computing node with that virtual network address and hardware address. For example, in some embodiments the destination virtual network address may be obtained from the destination physical substrate network address itself, such as from a subset of the bits of the destination physical substrate network address. In addition, the destination hardware address may have previously been mapped to the physical destination substrate network address, such as previously discussed with respect to block . In situations in which such prior mapping has not occurred, the routine may instead perform blocks - to obtain such information. The routine may similarly rewrite the communication header for the virtual computer network so that it appears to be sent from a computing node with a source virtual network address and source hardware address corresponding to the sending computing node. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the routine in block  may further perform other modifications to the incoming communication that correspond to providing logical networking functionality to emulate the actions and functionality that would be performed by one or more logical networking devices that would have been used to forward the communication to the destination computing node in accordance with the configured network topology for the virtual computer network. After block , the routine continues to block  to facilitate providing of the modified incoming communication to the destination computing node, such as by initiating forwarding of the modified incoming communication to the destination node.","If it is instead determined in block  that a message of another type is received, the routine continues to block  to perform another indicated operation as appropriate, such as to store information about entities associated with particular computing nodes, store information about configured network topologies for particular virtual computer networks, respond to requests and other messages from computing nodes in a manner to provide logical networking functionality corresponding to configured network topologies for virtual computer networks (e.g., by emulating actions and other functionalities that would be performed by specified logical networking devices if they were physically implemented), update previously mapped or stored information to reflect changes with respect to computing nodes that are being managed or to remote computing nodes, etc.","After blocks , , or , or if it is instead determined in block  that the processing is not being performed with respect to an outgoing communication, the routine continues to block  to determine whether to continue, such as until an explicit indication to terminate is received. If it is determined to continue, the routine returns to block , and if not continues to block  and ends.","In addition, various embodiments may provide mechanisms for customer users and other entities to interact with an embodiment of the system manager module for purpose of configuring computing nodes and their communications.
