title: Personalised dynamic email addresses in enterprise environments
abstract: Companies provide a set of default personalized dynamic email addresses for both individuals and groups. The embodiments may be implemented as an extension to existing email servers, which are coupled to an existing enterprise information system. When receiving an email sent to a personalized dynamic email address, an address resolver component is used to access the definition of the email address, query for the respective recipient(s), and replace the recipient(s) in the email message. Users have the possibility to define further personalized dynamic email addresses using, for example, a web interface. The embodiments may be smoothly integrated into an existing communication infrastructure of companies without the need to change existing systems.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Email is an important means for communication within companies. While messages are frequently sent to people who know each other personally, many emails are intended to be received by a person having a specific role in a company. Examples include a direct manager, an HR business partner and a team assistant (who might change on a daily basis if the assistants are working part-time or are on sick leave, for instance). The names of the persons filling these roles are not always known and need to be looked up in some system or by asking other colleagues. Furthermore, the people executing these roles might change frequently and employees might not be informed about this.","Besides messages between two individuals, emails are frequently sent to distribution lists. Distribution lists exist in many companies, for instance, for all people in a certain team, at a certain location, of a certain cost center etc. However, these lists are typically static in nature. They need to be maintained manually, which is error-prone, or they are being generated automatically from data stored in some systems. The latter typically happens on a periodic basis and might therefore not reflect recent changes.","Embodiments of techniques for personalized dynamic email addresses in enterprise environments are described herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201cthis embodiment\u201d and similar phrases, means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one of the one or more embodiments. Thus, the appearances of these phrases in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","A personalized dynamic email address is an email address that does not initially define an exact person as a receiver but rather defines a receiver or a group of receivers that are in a specific relation to the sender. One example could be the address \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d, which delivers an email to the current manager of the sender of the email. If an employee wants, for example, to inform the current manager that she or he will stay at home because of sickness, the employee can send an email to the address mentioned, and the system delivers this mail to the correct manager, even if reorganizations are ongoing and the employee does not know the name of her or his current manager. This makes it also unnecessary to look up this information in a corporate address book, if available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","120","170","110","110","110"]},"The sender's computer  delivers the message to a default email server  using proprietary or standard protocols, such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The email server  then delivers the message to an address resolver  using either pull or push mechanisms, because the address resolver  has the email address \u201cmy@company.corp\u201d. The email server  uses proprietary or standard protocols, such as SMTP, to deliver the message to the address resolver .","The address resolver  resolves the alias \u201cmanager\u201d enclosed as a comment in the parentheses from \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d. In one embodiment, the address resolver  looks-up a query associated with the alias, executes the query on the enterprise information system  and receives the email address of the manager , for example \u201cthomas@company.org\u201d. The address resolver  redirects the email message by sending the email message to \u201cthomas@company.org\u201d via the email server  using proprietary or standard protocols such as SMTP.","The email server  proceeds then as with a standard email address and delivers the email message via manager's computer  to the manager  using proprietary or standard protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210"]},"The format of the personalized dynamic email addresses may depend on the implementation. In one embodiment, the format may be such as the one presented in relation to , for example \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d. \u201cmy\u201d is the email address of an address resolver, for example the address resolver  (). In other embodiments, other valid names can be used to address the address resolver, for example \u201cresolver\u201d. Parentheses formally indicate that the enclosed text within the parentheses is a comment, according to the common standard for emails RFC 5322. In one embodiment, the comment may be used to enclose an alias as described further. For example, \u201cmanager\u201d is an alias, which identifies a query to dynamically retrieve recipient(s) of the email message. The query is intended to translate the personalized dynamic email address into an exact email address, such as \u201cfrank@company.corp\u201d. \u201c@\u201d is the typical delimiter in email addresses and \u201ccompany.corp\u201d is an example domain name.","Alternatives to the discussed above format of the personalized dynamic email addresses may exist. In one embodiment, an alias may be defined to include dynamic components. For example, if an internal system needs to send an email notification to the manager of a certain employee, the alias may be defined such as \u201cmanager-of-?\u201d, where \u201c?\u201d stands for an email alias of an employee. In such case, an email to \u201cmy(manager-of-frank)@company.corp\u201d may be transformed to the email address of the manager of the employee having email address \u201cfrank@company.corp\u201d.","Turning back to , at block , a definition of the personalized email addresses is accessed. In one embodiment the personalized dynamic email addresses may include the address of an address resolver component, such as \u201cmy\u201d or \u201cresolver\u201d discussed above.","Then, at block , a data storage is queried to find at least one recipient according to the definition. In one embodiment, the personalized dynamic email addresses may include an alias identifying a query to dynamically retrieve the at least one recipient. The query may be formulated in a standard query language such as Structured Query Language (SQL), and the enterprise information system, such as enterprise information system  (), may provide an interface for such queries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["NAME","ID","EMAIL","MANAGER","STUDENT","LOCATION","SUPERVISOR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Thomas","1000","thomas@company.corp","?","0","DA","?"]},{"entry":["Frank","1001","frank@company.corp","1000","0","KA","?"]},{"entry":["Anirban","1002","anirban@company.corp","?","0","KA","?"]},{"entry":["Nina","1003","nina@company.corp","1002","0","KA","?"]},{"entry":["Christoph","1004","christoph@company.corp","1002","0","KA","?"]},{"entry":["Tom","1005","tom@company.corp","1002","0","KA","?"]},{"entry":["Dennis","1006","dennis@company.corp","?","1","KA","1001"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Table 1 shows an exemplary data table within an enterprise information system (EIS), such as enterprise information system  (). Table 1 is simplified, this means that either the EIS may provide such simplified tables via database views, or an address resolver, such as the address resolver  (), may need to use more complex queries building on the original data tables in the EIS. Typically, the tables contain data, which may be accessible for all employees via a corporate address book. The column NAME contains the name of an employee, the ID is an employee identifier, and EMAIL is the email address of the employee described in the row. The column MANGER contains the ID of the manager of the employee, and the column SUPERVISOR contains an optional supervisor, typically if the employee is a student. The column STUDENT indicates if the person is a student, and the column LOCATION indicates the location of an employee.

In other embodiments, the email server uses proprietary protocols for communication, specific for the organization implementing the personalized dynamic email addresses.","Typically, a sender does not know to whom an email message is delivered if sent to a personalized dynamic email address. This may be necessary as senders may need to know whom to contact for a follow-up or to document to which person an email message has been delivered. In one embodiment, confirmation to a sender of a delivery of an email message with a personalized dynamic email addresses is implemented. In one embodiment, the address resolver might be configured to include the sender of an email message in the \u201cCC\u201d or \u201cBCC\u201d field of an email message, which is redirected. In another embodiment, the address resolver might be configured to send a delivery report to the sender of an email message.

An application server  within the management system  for personalized dynamic email addresses in enterprise environments provides an application, for example a web application (not shown), which allows adding, deleting, executing, and changing entries in the alias repository . Such an application may be used by a company administrator  to maintain personalized dynamic email addresses to be used by employees. In one embodiment, employees may also maintain further individual personalized email addresses using such an application provided by the application server . The application may handle pure SQL queries or may provide some visual means or wizard to maintain the queries. Because the application server  may also execute queries, this functionality may be used for testing purposes or to browse potential recipients of an email to confirm that a certain alias is correct.","The described embodiments may utilize alternative email address formats for personalized dynamic email addresses. The format \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d, described above, which has an alias \u201cmanager\u201d in a comment included in parentheses, is advantageous, because standard mail clients may be used without modifications. However RFC 5322 indeed recommends not using comments in address fields, because some legacy implementations may remove comments. Because the current embodiments are meant to be implemented within companies, an environment without such legacy systems may be expected. Some current email programs do not treat comments correctly. Therefore the following two alternatives may be implemented. Instead of using comments in email addresses, for example, \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d, the name field as defined in RFC 5322 may be used alternatively: \u201cmanager <my@company.corp>\u201d. The address \u201cmy@company.corp\u201d may be the address from the address resolver component, which then uses the name (instead of a comment) as the alias to resolve the final recipient(s) of the email. This variation may also be used without the need to change any existing email clients or servers within a company.","Instead of comments or the name field (as proposed in the previous paragraph), the usage of different identifiers in email address may be used, with slight modifications of the affected systems. An example may be an email address like \u201c!manger@company.corp\u201d, where the exclamation mark identifies that the text enclosed by \u201c!\u201d and \u201c@\u201d is an alias, which needs to be treated by the address resolver component. \u201c!\u201d may be any valid character which is normally not used in company email addresses. However, this or similar embodiments require slight changes in the mail servers as all such addresses need to be forwarded to the address resolver component.","Different companies and different users may have different preferences how details of the current embodiments may be implemented. Therefore, variations may be realized with and may be configured for a whole organization or individually by the users (employees). One aspect which may be configured differently according to the specificities of the organizations is a feature if a recipient of an email should know that a mail was sent via a dynamic email address or not. The address resolver could keep the original \u201cTo\u201d field of the message header (e.g., \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d) and redirect the mail to another address (e.g., \u201cthomas@company.corp\u201d), or the address resolver could just change the \u201cTo\u201d field of the email (e.g., from \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d to \u201cthomas@company.corp\u201d). The first alternative gives the recipient of the email the knowledge that a dynamic email address was used and the recipient may better understand why the salutation in the email may not be personalized. In other configurations, other means may be used to indicate that an email is delivered using a personalized dynamic email address. This includes prefixes in the message subject or textual notifications in the email body (for example: \u201cThis message was originally sent to my(manager)@company.corp.\u201d).","In one embodiment, the alias translation may be done prior to sending the email message, within the email client of the sender. Such alternative may be used in addition or as an exclusive embodiment. By using a plug-in for a client program, a sender may translate a dynamic email address to a real address on her or his computer. This allows the usage of personalized salutations within the email body and provides control to which recipient(s) an email will be delivered. In this embodiment, the plug-in in the email client program on the sender's computer may directly access the address resolver component via a dedicated interface, for example, a Web Service or a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface, and may translate a dynamic email address, such as \u201cmy(manager)@company.corp\u201d, to a real email address (e.g., \u201cthomas@company.corp\u201d).","Some embodiments may include the above-described methods being written as one or more software components. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, distributed, or peer computer systems. These components may be written in a computer language corresponding to one or more programming languages such as, functional, declarative, procedural, object-oriented, lower level languages and the like. They may be linked to other components via various application programming interfaces and then compiled into one complete application for a server or a client. Alternatively, the components may be implemented in server and client applications. Further, these components may be linked together via various distributed programming protocols. Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of these components across a distributed programming environment. For example, a logic level may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system containing an interface level (e.g., a graphical user interface). These first and second computer systems can be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other configuration. The clients can vary in complexity from mobile and handheld devices, to thin clients and on to thick clients or even other servers.","The above-illustrated software components are tangibly stored on a computer readable storage medium as instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media that stores one or more sets of instructions. The term \u201ccomputer readable storage medium\u201d should be taken to include any physical article that is capable of undergoing a set of physical changes to physically store, encode, or otherwise carry a set of instructions for execution by a computer system which causes the computer system to perform any of the methods or process steps described, represented, or illustrated herein. A computer readable storage medium may be a non-transitory computer readable storage medium. Examples of non-transitory computer readable storage media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media, such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs, DVDs and holographic devices; magneto-optical media: and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute, such as application-specific integrated circuits (\u201cASICs\u201d), programmable logic devices (\u201cPLDs\u201d) and ROM and RAM devices. Examples of computer readable instructions include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, an embodiment may be implemented using Java, C++, or other object-oriented programming language and development tools. Another embodiment may be implemented in hard-wired circuitry in place of, or in combination with machine readable software instructions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","405","455","400","440","455","410","415","410","415","405","415","400","425","430","400","425","430","400","435","400","450","450","400","445","400","420","460","460","460","450","460"]},"A data source is an information resource.
