Here, the first application indicates a native application which may be directly executed on the platform of the terminal device, and the second application indicates an added application which may be executed through middleware including a porting layer and a VM.","In the case of a mobile terminal on the WISE (Web-based Inquiry Science Environment) platform of LG, native applications operating on the WISE platform corresponds to the first application, and the Google android applications correspond to the second application.","The platform layer module  is connected to the terminal processor  and configured to operate the first application.","The middleware module  is positioned between the platform layer module  and the application layer module  and configured to connect the second application provided in the application layer module .","At this time, the middleware module  not only includes a VM and a library to execute the second application, but also includes a porting layer to connect the middleware module  to the platform layer module . The details of the middleware module  will be described with reference to .","The terminal processor  is a central processing unit (CPU). In the case of a mobile terminal, a mobile-dedicated processor capable of processing a variety of multimedia and a communication function may be used as the terminal processor .","The terminal hardware  includes a screen output unit, an audio output unit, and a user input unit which compose the terminal device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"20"},"The middleware module  may be divided into a class library layer , a native library layer , and a porting layer . At this time, the respective layers become close to the physical layer in the downward direction. The lowermost porting layer  is positioned adjacent to the platform layer module , and the uppermost class library layer  is positioned adjacent to the application layer module .","The class library layer module  includes an application framework module - including a class library required for executing the second application and a core class library module - providing the Java API (Application Programming Interface).","In an actual example, the application framework module - is used by modifying or reusing an application framework module of the Google android platform. The application framework module of the Google android platform includes a class library and services required for executing android applications. At this time, some services are not needed for compatibility with the applications, and thus may be removed to reduce the weight.","Furthermore, the core class library module - is applied by reusing a core library which belongs to the android runtime in the Google android platform. The core library of the Google android platform includes a basic Java API for programming in Java.","The native library layer module  includes a VM - configured to operate the second application positioned in the application layer  through the class library provided in the application framework module - and the Java API provided in the core class library module -. Furthermore, the native library layer module  includes native libraries - which are to be the foundation for implementing libraries of the application framework module -.","In an actual example, the VM - is applied by modifying the Dalvik VM of the Google android platform. That is, Linux-dependent modules are removed from the existing Dalvik VM, functions which are not provided by other platforms are added, and the Dalvik-VM is reconfigured in a structure to be executed even on a single task.","Furthermore, the native libraries - are applied by reusing libraries positioned under the application framework layer of the Google android platform.

That is, the VM may escape from the Linux-dependent functions of the existing android platform.","Furthermore, the VM - is configured by modifying the existing Dalvik VM to perform the memory management according to the terminal device .","In addition, the VM - may be operated on a single task by modifying the existing Dalvik VM to operate the VM - even in the terminal device  which does not support multi-tasking but operates on a single task. That is, the VM - operates on a single task in interconnection with the platform layer module  through the porting layer module .","As described above, the core class library - provides a basic Java API for programming in Java.","The native libraries - serve as the foundation for implementing upper-layer libraries and may be ported and provided according to other platforms other than Linux.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["21","22"]},"Referring to , the native library layer module  includes a variety of native libraries - which operate in interconnection with the hardware management modules of the porting layer module .","The application framework module - may includes a variety of service modules for performing telephone service, location-based service, Bluetooth networking service, WiFi networking service, USB service, sensor service and so on.
