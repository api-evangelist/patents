title: Timing mechanism and direct messaging for electronic trading platform
abstract: A system and interface for trading financial instruments includes an intermediary computer system that is operable to communicate with one or more trader terminals. The intermediary computer system includes one or more processors and storage media, and it communicates with trader terminals and displays to the trader terminals a listing of financial instruments, and information related to such financial instruments, that are available for trading. The intermediary computer system periodically updates the option adjusted price of financial instruments to provide traders with a time period in which the price will remain stable and during which time the traders can confidently execute orders based on the then available price. A timer, which is constantly visible to traders, displays the amount of time remaining until the displayed adjusted prices will be updated.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/499,673 filed on Sep. 2, 2003.","Financial markets function to bring together buyers and sellers and provide a mechanism for financial instruments to be traded. In recent years the use of electronic trading systems has revolutionized the industry as people have increasingly favored electronic trading systems over the older, manual methods of trading. Financial markets favor electronic trading systems as electronic trading systems offer reduced labor costs, increased accuracy, real time market information and greater versatility in communications.","Electronic trading systems are well known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,674,044, issued to Kalmus et al., entitled \u201cAutomated Securities Trading System\u201d describes a system for trading securities wherein a centralized computer communicates with trader terminals to obtain the best bid and asked prices in order to implement a trade. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,501, issued to Silverman et al., entitled \u201cAnonymous Matching System\u201d provides an automated matching system where a centralized computer in communication with traders matches bid and ask prices for a trade, subject to the buyers and sellers matching specified criteria. The system described by Silverman et al. is also operable to automatically update the prices based on the best available bids present in the system.","The present invention relates to a system for trading financial instruments. The system for trading financial instruments includes an intermediary computer system that communicates with trader terminals to provide a full listing of financial instruments available for trade, including specific information for each instrument. The intermediary computer system further provides periodic updates of the option adjusted price for the particular types of financial instruments available through the system, a timer to indicate the amount of time remaining before an update of the option adjusted price will occur, and the ability to send traders direct messages.","The intermediary computer system communicates with the trader terminals to display on the terminals a listing of financial instruments available to trade, the option adjusted price of the financial instruments and specific information about each particular financial instrument, e.g., the financial instrument's coupon or maturity date. The intermediary computer system periodically updates the option adjusted price based on the type of financial instrument offered. The option adjusted price is updated periodically rather than on a continuous basis so that there is a sufficient period of time in which the price of the instrument is stable and during which time the traders can confidently execute a trade against such instrument. A timer, which is constantly visible to traders using the electronic trading system, displays the amount of time remaining until displayed adjusted prices will be updated.","The intermediary computer system is also operable to communicate directly with selected traders or groups of traders in the form of directed messages to the trader terminals. The directed messages allow traders to receive real time information regarding trade confirmations or to receive the terms of a transaction. Directed messages can also be used to communicate warning information to the traders. For example, a warning message may be transmitted to a trader terminal if the intermediary computer system receives an order better than what had previously been communicated to the trader terminal.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the Figures. A preferred embodiment of a system for trading financial instruments is shown in . As shown in , the system preferably comprises an intermediary computer system  and a plurality of trader terminals . Trader terminals  are adapted to communicate with intermediary computer system  via suitable communication means such as a private line , virtual private networks , and the Internet . Intermediary  preferably comprises one or more processors and storage media suitable for implementing the architecture and processing described below. Also shown in  is a clearing institution  adapted for transferring funds between system participants.","Aspects of the system shown in  are shown in more detail in . As shown in , each trader terminal  preferably comprises an API (application programming interface)  to provide an interface for communication with intermediary . In the embodiment of , traders access the intermediary through a suitable network gateway . A marketplace back end  receives orders entered via trader terminals  and stores them in electronic storage medium . An information dissemination back end  disseminates information concerning executed trades to network gateway . Deal capture  collects and stores in electronic storage medium  all transactions executed on the intermediary system.","A preferred embodiment of the operation of the present system will now be described in connection with .  depicts a preferred embodiment of a graphical user interface for display to a trader. As shown in , the graphical user interface preferably comprises a stack window and a log book window.","The stack window preferably displays a table that includes information concerning a plurality of instruments available to trade. Each row in the table preferably displays information concerning a particular security. In the embodiment shown in , each displayed instrument is a callable agency security such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac GSE security with an embedded European-style call option. Other embedded option styles (e.g., American, Bermuden) may alternatively be employed.","The table further preferably comprises a plurality of columns for displaying information concerning each security. In particular, the \u201cSecurity\u201d column identifies the security and specifies its coupon, maturity date, and the benchmark swap leg for dynamic hedging purposes. The \u201cSecurity\u201d column may also include the call date of the security. The \u201cOAP Bid\u201d column displays the current option adjusted price of the bid displayed in the \u201cBid\u201d column, as described below. The \u201cBSize\u201d column depicts the available volume at the best current bid price. The \u201cBid\u201d column specifies this best current bid price.","The \u201cOffer\u201d column depicts the best current offer price\/spread for the security. The \u201cOSize\u201d column depicts the size available at that price\/spread. The \u201cOAP Offer\u201d column depicts the option adjusted price of the offer displayed in the \u201cOffer\u201d column, as described below. The \u201cLast\u201d column depicts the price of the last or current transaction for this particular security. The \u201cLSize\u201d column depicts the size of the last or current transaction, and the \u201cVolume\u201d column depicts the total volume traded for that instrument in that trading day.","One of the securities in , \u201cXFN 2.750 8\/062Y,\u201d is shown as currently trading. During an active trade, the bid or offer price is preferably made to flash and a \u201ctake\u201d or \u201chit\u201d indication is displayed on the screen.","The \u201cX\u201d in the title of the security is used to denote that this particular security is a callable security. The next two letters are used to describe the type of security (e.g., \u201cFN\u201d for \u201cFannie Mae\u201d or \u201cMC\u201d for \u201cFreddie Mac\u201d).","The number following the security type (e.g., \u201c2.750\u201d) denotes the security's coupon. The date (e.g., \u201c08\/06\u201d) specifies the security's maturity date. The abbreviation following the underscore (e.g., \u201c2Y\u201d) describes the swap leg, or hedge, for this security. In this example, \u201c2Y\u201d stands for a two year treasury bond.","Each row in the stack window also has a plus sign at the far left. The user may click this sign to expand the display and view the full order book for that security.","The stack window in  also preferably comprises an order entry panel below the list of securities. When a particular security is selected from the above list, the order entry panel allows the user to enter appropriate trading commands for the security such as bid\/offer or hit\/take. The order entry panel may also comprise numbered buttons to facilitate the entry of specified sizes.","The \u201cOAP Bid\u201d and \u201cOAP Offer\u201d columns preferably display option adjusted bid and offer prices for each security that account for the value of the security's price as it corresponds to the spread of that instrument and the updating yield curve, swaption volatility, and calculation feeds. These prices may be calculated in accordance with a predetermined algorithm such as the adjusted-price convention for callable securities proposed by the Bond Market Association (BMA). The BMA formula uses four inputs to determine an option adjusted bid or offer price: the details of a particular security, an option adjusted spread, a skew adjusted volatility, and the designated yield curve. A preferred embodiment for calculating OAP bids and OAP offers that differs somewhat from that proposed by the BMA, which may be used to calculate OAP bids and offers in the present system, is described below.","In a preferred embodiment, displayed OAP bid and OAP offer prices are not updated on trader screens on a continuous basis. Instead, at periodic intervals determined by the intermediary, the intermediary determines whether or not any input utilized to calculate an OAP price has changed, and if so, updates the displayed OAP price. In a preferred embodiment, the periodic interval may be 15 seconds for the securities shown in . Other appropriate periods may be selected for other securities. For example, a longer period may be appropriate for different types of embedded options (puts\/calls) or other products such as callable bonds, municipal bonds, derivatives or mortgage backed securities. Securities such as CMOs (collateral mortgage obligations), for example, have complex properties including optionality, monthly payments, structures, less liquidity, etc, where a trader may need more time to evaluate the intermediary's option adjusted prices against their own internal option models. Therefore, more time may be need so traders can make rational decisions to execute a transaction or not. However, in some instances, traders may need less time to make rational decisions of whether to execute a transaction. The timer intervals are therefore flexible and able to reflect the needs of traders and the many products that use embedded options or outright options.","Periodic, rather than continuous, updating of OAP prices facilitates trading by providing a time period of sufficient duration during which prices will not fluctuate and traders may execute against them. Continuously fluctuating OAP prices may cause traders to freeze, become confused and therefore resist trading, or not trade at all, in essence making it difficult for traders to complete a trade at any specified price.","Periodic price updating, however, may create confusion for traders concerning when a price will be updated and may discourage traders from trading on the basis of a displayed price if they fear that it may be updated shortly. To address this problem, a preferred embodiment of the present system further comprises a timer which is constantly visible to traders using the electronic trading system and displays the amount of time remaining until displayed adjusted prices will be updated.","The timer preferably uses color in addition to the numerical display of time to inform the user of the length of time before the next update of market price. For example, the timer may be displayed as green until three seconds remain before a potential price update, and then be changed to red to indicate the possibility of an imminent OAP price change. A red timer warns traders that displayed option adjusted prices may change imminently, and that aggressive orders, if entered during this period, may not execute before the price update and therefore may trade at a price different than that currently shown in the stack window.","When the data feed fails to update as per the timer, the timer stops at 1 second for a time period determined by the intermediary. During this predetermined period, the timer turns gray, thus alerting the trader that updates are not occurring, although many other methods of alerting traders are possible.","One preferred manner of displaying the timer is shown near the upper-right-hand corner of . In , the timer is at 15 seconds (\u201c15 s\u201d).  illustrates the timer at 12 seconds, and  at 3 seconds. In , the background of the timer display is preferably red. The timer may be displayed in any desired form such as an hour glass, sliding bar, clock and may use any desired display technique such as fading colors to display the passage of time.","As noted, the Bond Market Association (BMA) has proposed a convention for calculating option adjusted prices derived form the model developed by Fischer Black. In a preferred embodiment, a model may be used to determine OAP prices that differs from that proposed by the BMA in the following respects:","Yield Curve: Points on the raw mid-yield curve are found using Act\/365 number of years to maturity. Then these yields are interpolated using a tension spline to the Constant Maturity Debt Index (CMDI) points using the Fannie Mae (FNMA) recommendation endorsed by the BMA. However, the CMDI calculation is dynamic\u2014as opposed to BMA recommendation to use yesterday's closing offsets- and \u201coffsets\u201d are recalculated every 15 seconds. Number of years-to-maturity are always found from the regular settlement date for that trading day\u2014(even if the callable bond is traded When Issued or has a different settlement date). The system may be adapted to handle any specified yield curve using any day count convention, e.g., actual\/365, actual\/actual, 30\/360, actual\/360, etc.","Swaption Volatility: Years to expiry is found from regular settlement date for the given trading day to the Call Date of the bond, using Actual\/365 number of years. Years for Swap Tenor (the difference in time between the maturity date and the call date) is computed as the number of Act\/Act years from the Call Date to Maturity Date. Interpolation to find Base Volatility is done using the BMA recommended interpolation procedure, followed by the skew adjustment recommended by BMA.","Cash Flows Periods: For OAP to Price calculation, Cash Flow Periods follow a 30\/365 day count and use the Callable Bond's actual settlement date as the starting point.","Call Date: When using the BMA model, the Call Date must coincide with a regular coupon payment date, otherwise OAS to Price calculation will fail. However, when using other OAS models, off cycles can be calculated accurately.","Short\/Long First Coupon: These are allowed as long as the First Coupon Date is not the Call Date.","Short\/Long Last Coupon: When using the BMA model, these are not allowed and will produce invalid results from the model. There are OAS models that can handle these kinds of situations, and the system of the present invention can support such OAS models. The timer feature can be used in these situations.","DV01: DV01 (Dollar Value 01) is computed by doing OAP to Price calculation by shifting the yield curve by one basis point up and one basis point down and then finding the average of the two DV01 estimates.","Hedge Price: The Hedge Price can be an exact price\/yield produced from the model input or the trading markets, and can be rounded to the nearest decimal or fraction. For Agencies, this is the price corresponding to the raw mid-yield on the Yield curve used to compute OAP-to-Price. Settlement date used is the regular settlement date of the hedge instrument. For Treasuries, this is the midprice in the BrokerTec Indicative Pricing Engine which is based on the intermediary's treasury markets.","Compounding: The first coupon period is compounded the same way as the rest of the coupon periods. This differs from the BMA recommendation.","Returning to , as noted, the graphical user interface further preferably comprises a log book window. In a preferred embodiment, this window comprises a tab for displaying directed messages. These may comprise specific messages generated from trading activity conducted via the intermediary and broadcast to selected traders or groups of traders using an internal API. For example, directed messages may be used to broadcast to a selected group of traders the terms of a transaction as it occurs in real time or to transmit trade confirmations to traders for complex products. Examples of directed messages concerning transaction terms are shown in the messages window in . Each directed message preferably includes all information used to calculate the OAP bid or offer price. Directed messages displaying transaction information may also, at the user's election, be displayed in a scrolling format across the top of the screen, as depicted in .","Directed messages may also be used to communicate alarm or warning information in text format and to supplement other alarm and warning methods. For example, filters may be used to detect changes to one trading page (e.g., an off-the-run swap page) while a trader is viewing another page (e.g., an actives page). A tab for the off-the-run swap page may be caused to turn to red to indicate that some change has occurred, but the trader would typically have no way of knowing what the change was without clicking on the tab and returning to the page where the change occurred. Using directed messages, however, a text message indicating the nature of the change may be displayed to the trader (e.g., locked market, order against, order better than, etc.).","While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that numerous alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art of the foregoing description."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
