{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/376,321, filed Aug. 24, 2010, the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for presenting electronic text and associated information to electronic device users.","Electronic books, or e-books, are text and image-based publications in digital form produced on, published by, and readable on computers or other electronic devices. E-books are often read on dedicated hardware devices, such as e-book readers or e-book devices. Personal computers, mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablet computers, and other suitable devices may also be used for reading e-books.","Readers often do not finish reading an e-book, or other electronic text of significant length, in a single sitting or reading session. Readers often need multiple reading sessions to finish reading an e-book. In some cases, busy readers may have only a limited time that they can dedicate to reading an e-book in one reading session. Such readers may end up reading longer than planned, as they may lose track of time or, for example, a plot development keeps them interested in continuing to read the e-book beyond an allotted time period. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide techniques for improving readers' ability to manage their time when reading electronic text.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Disclosed herein are systems and methods for suggesting a pause position within electronic text. According to an aspect, a method may include receiving identification of a current user position within electronic text residing on an electronic device. For example, a current user position may be a page of an e-book that is currently being displayed to a reader or user. The method may include determining a suggested pause position within the electronic text based on the current user position and\/or other information. For example, the suggested pause position may be determined based on the reader's profile, a reading behavior of other readers, metadata, or combinations thereof. A reader profile may include, for example, but is not limited to, an available read time for the reader, a calendar of the reader, a reading behavior of the reader, a current time, a reading speed of the reader, a location of the reader, an activity of the reader, the like, and combinations thereof. The method may also include presenting the suggested pause position on a user interface of the electronic device. For example, an e-book may display a graphic corresponding to a suggested pause position for indicating the suggested pause position. In another example, a speaker of an e-book may be controlled to emit a sound in response to determining that the current position of the e-book is the suggested pause position.","The present disclosure is described with specificity to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or elements similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover, although the term \u201cstep\u201d may be used herein to connote different aspects of methods employed, the term should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.","Embodiments of the present disclosure enable an electronic device, such as an e-book reader, to receive identification of a current user position within electronic text residing on an electronic device, to determine a suggested pause position within the electronic text based on the current user position, and to present the suggested pause position to the user of the electronic text. For example, an e-book reader may identify a page of an e-book that is currently being displayed to a user. Further, the e-book reader may determine a suggested pause position within the electronic text of the e-book based on the current user position. The e-book reader may then, for example, display or otherwise present the suggested pause position to the user by use of a user interface. As a result, the reader can plan to stop reading at the suggested pause position when he or she reaches it during a reading session. The suggested pause position may be a position in the electronic text where the reader can stop and, for example, avoid crossing a major plot development or start of a new topic.","As referred to herein, the term \u201celectronic device\u201d should be broadly construed. It can include any type of device capable of presenting electronic text to a user. For example, the electronic device may be an e-book reader configured to present an e-book to a user. Example e-book readers include, but are not limited to, the KINDLE\u00ae and NOOK\u00ae e-book readers. In another example, an electronic device may be a mobile device such as, for example, but not limited to, a smart phone, a cell phone, a pager, a personal digital assistant (PDA, e.g., with GPRS NIC), a mobile computer with a smart phone client, or the like. An electronic device can also include any type of conventional computer, for example, a desktop computer or a laptop computer. A typical mobile device is a wireless data access-enabled device (e.g., an iPHONE\u00ae smart phone, a BLACKBERRY\u00ae smart phone, a NEXUS ONE\u2122 smart phone, an iPAD\u00ae device, or the like) that is capable of sending and receiving data in a wireless manner using protocols like the Internet Protocol, or IP, and the wireless application protocol, or WAP. This allows users to access information via wireless devices, such as smart phones, mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, communicators, and the like. Wireless data access is supported by many wireless networks, including, but not limited to, CDPD, CDMA, GSM, PDC, PHS, TDMA, FLEX, ReFLEX, iDEN, TETRA, DECT, DataTAC, Mobitex, EDGE and other 2G, 3G, 4G and LTE technologies, and it operates with many handheld device operating systems, such as PalmOS, EPOC, Windows CE, FLEXOS, OS\/9, JavaOS, iOS and Android. Typically, these devices use graphical displays and can access the Internet (or other communications network) on so-called mini- or micro-browsers, which are web browsers with small file sizes that can accommodate the reduced memory constraints of mobile wireless devices. In a representative embodiment, the mobile device is a cellular telephone or smart phone that operates over GPRS (General Packet Radio Services), which is a data technology for GSM networks. In addition to a conventional voice communication, a given mobile device can communicate with another such device via many different types of message transfer techniques, including SMS (short message service), enhanced SMS (EMS), multi-media message (MMS), email WAP, paging, or other known or later-developed wireless data formats. Although many of the examples provided herein are implemented on an e-book reader, the examples may similarly be implemented on any suitable electronic device, such as a computer or smart phone.","As referred to herein, the term \u201celectronic text\u201d should be broadly construed. Example electronic text can be presented and stored in the form of book pages that may be browsed using an electronic device such as, for example, an e-book reader or tablet computer. The electronic text may be stored in any suitable format, such as, but not limited to, portable document format (PDF), hypertext markup language (HTML), extensible markup language (XML), EPUB, or any suitable e-book or word processing format.","As referred to herein, a \u201cuser interface\u201d is generally a system by which users interact with an electronic device. An interface can include an input for allowing users to manipulate an electronic device, and can include an output for allowing the system to present information (e.g., electronic text) and\/or data, indicate the effects of the user's manipulation, etc. An example of an interface on an electronic device includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with programs in more ways than typing. A GUI typically can offer display objects, and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation to represent information and actions available to a user. For example, an interface can be a display window or display object, which is selectable by a user of a mobile device for interaction. The display object can be displayed on a display screen of an electronic device and can be selected by, and interacted with by, a user using the interface. In an example, the display of the electronic device can be a touch screen, which can display the display icon. The user can depress the area of the display screen at which the display icon is displayed for selecting the display icon. In another example, the user can use any other suitable interface of a mobile device, such as a keypad, to select the display icon or display object. For example, the user can use a track ball or arrow keys for moving a cursor to highlight and select the display object.","Operating environments in which embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented are also well-known. In a representative embodiment, a mobile electronic device, such as an e-book reader, is connectable (for example, via WAP) to a transmission functionality that varies depending on implementation. Thus, for example, where the operating environment is a wide area wireless network (e.g., a 2.5G network, a 3G network, or a 4G network), the transmission functionality comprises one or more components such as a mobile switching center (MSC) (an enhanced ISDN switch that is responsible for call handling of mobile subscribers), a visitor location register (VLR) (an intelligent database that stores on a temporary basis data required to handle calls set up or received by mobile devices registered with the VLR), a home location register (HLR) (an intelligent database responsible for management of each subscriber's records), one or more base stations (which provide radio coverage with a cell), a base station controller (BSC) (a switch that acts as a local concentrator of traffic and provides local switching to effect handover between base stations), and a packet control unit (PCU) (a device that separates data traffic coming from a mobile device). The HLR also controls certain services associated with incoming calls. Of course, embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure may be implemented in other and next-generation mobile networks and devices as well. The mobile device is the physical equipment used by the end user, typically a subscriber to the wireless network. Typically, a mobile device is a 2.5G-compliant device, 3G-compliant device, or 4G-compliant device that includes a subscriber identity module (SIM), which is a smart card that carries subscriber-specific information, mobile equipment (e.g., radio and associated signal processing devices), a user interface (or a man-machine interface (MMI)), and one or more interfaces to external devices (e.g., computers, PDAs, and the like). The electronic device may also include a memory or data store.","The presently disclosed subject matter is now described in more detail. For example,  illustrates a schematic diagram of a system  for suggesting a pause position within electronic text according to embodiments of the present disclosure. Referring to , the system  includes an e-book reader  and an e-book services server . The e-book reader  may be any type of electronic device capable of presenting electronic text to a user. Further, the e-book reader  may include a number of functional components. This representation of the e-book reader  is meant to be for convenience of illustration and description, and it should not be taken to limit the scope of the present disclosure as one or more functions may be combined. Typically, these components are implemented in software (as a set of process-executable computer instructions, associated data structures, and the like). One or more of the functions may be combined or otherwise implemented in any suitable manner (e.g., in hardware, in firmware, in combined hardware and software, or the like). The e-book reader  may include a media manager  for managing storage of electronic text (e.g., one or more e-books) in a media item store  and for controlling presentation of electronic text to a user. The e-book reader  may include a user interface  capable of receiving user input and of presenting content to a user. For example, the user interface  may include a display capable of presenting electronic text of an e-book to a user and a touch screen for accepting user input. The media item store  may be a suitable memory device.","The e-book reader  may also be configured to communicate with other devices. For example, the e-book reader  may include a network interface  configured to communicate with the server  via the Internet  or any other suitable network, such as a wireless network or local area network (LAN). In another example, the e-book reader  can be Internet-accessible and can interact with the server  using Internet protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and the like. The server  is shown as a single device but this is not a requirement, whereas one or more programs, processes, or other code may comprise the server and be executed on one or more machines in one or more networked locations. Further, the server  may include a processor  and a network interface  for implementing functionality as described herein and for communicating with the Internet . The e-book reader  may also be configured to communicate with other electronic devices via the Internet  or another suitable network.","The operation of the system can be described by the following example. As shown in , the e-book reader  includes various functional components and associated data stores to facilitate the operation. The operation of the disclosed methods may be implemented using system components other than as shown in .","A user of the e-book reader  may use an application (often referred to as an \u201capp\u201d) residing on the e-book reader  to interact with an e-book  stored in the media item store . The application may reside on the e-book reader  and be a part of the media manager . The user may, for example, input commands into the user interface  for opening the e-book  and for interacting with the e-book . The application may present text and\/or images of the e-book  to the user via a display of the user interface . The user may suitably interact with the e-book reader  to control the display of different portions of the e-book's content. For example, the user may touch the display, such as by use of a \u201cswiping\u201d motion on the surface of the display, to command the media manager  to \u201cturn\u201d pages of the e-book as will be understood. The user may turn or otherwise select pages for display by any other suitable technique as will be understood.","In another example, the user may interact with a display of the e-book reader  for selecting one or more portions of the e-book for display. The user may select a portion of the e-book by touching or swiping a desired portion of the e-book displayed to the user. For example, the user may touch or swipe a word, one or more paragraphs, or any location on a displayed page for selecting that portion or adjacent portions for display. The displayed portion of the e-book may be identified as a current user position within the e-book. The media manager  may receive identification of the current user position and, in response, determine a suggested pause position within the e-book based on the current user position. Further, the media manager  may control the user interface  to present the suggested pause position to the user of the e-book reader .","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure,  illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method for suggesting a pause position within electronic text. The method of  is described with respect to the example system  shown in , although the method may be implemented by any suitable system or electronic device. The steps of  may be implemented entirely, or in part, by a pause position manager  residing on the e-book reader  shown in . The pause position manager  may be implemented by software, hardware, firmware, or combinations thereof.","Referring to , the method includes receiving identification of a current user position within electronic text residing on an electronic device (step ). For example, the pause position manager  of the e-book reader  may determine a page, paragraph, or other portion of the e-book  that is currently being presented to a reader via the user interface  (e.g., a display of the user interface ). The user position within the e-book  may correspond to the portion of the e-book  that is currently being presented to the reader, or that has recently been presented to the reader. A current user position within electronic text may be identified by, for example, but not limited to, a page number, a paragraph number, a word number, a chapter number, the like, and combinations thereof.","The method of  includes determining a suggested pause position within the electronic text based on the current user position (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may determine a suggested pause position within the e-book  based on a page currently being displayed to a reader via the user interface . In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, the e-book  may include metadata identifying the suggested pause position. The pause position manager  may use a page number, for example, to extract the suggested pause position from the metadata of the e-book . The suggested pause position in the metadata may be indexed or otherwise organized based on a position within the e-book . For example, the pause position manager  may use the current user position to look up the suggested pause position within the metadata.","In an example, the metadata may store more than one suggested pause position based on a current user position. In this case, the reader may be presented with multiple suggested pause positions based on his or her current position within electronic text. The reader may then decide where to stop reading based on the suggested pause positions. In an example, if the reader has an extended period of time available to read the electronic text, the reader may decide to stop reading at a suggested pause position that is furthest from his or her current position than other suggested pause positions. In contrast, if the reader has only allotted a few minutes for reading in this session, the reader may decide to stop reading at a suggested pause position that is nearest to his or her current position within the electronic text. In this way, the reader may select from multiple pause positions based on his or her time available for reading during the current reading session.","In another example of determining a suggested pause position, the suggested pause position may be received from a server via a communications network. For example, the pause position manager  may request a suggested pause position from the server  via the Internet . The request may specify the e-book , or a current user position within the e-book . In response to the request, the server  may communicate a response to the e-book reader  that indicates one or more suggested pause positions within the e-book reader . For example, the response may indicate one or more suggested pause positions for various positions within a specified e-book. In another example, the response may indicate one or more suggested pause positions for a specified user position within an e-book. In response to receipt of the suggested pause position(s), the e-book  may present the suggested pause position(s) to a reader.","In another example of determining a suggest pause position, one or more suggested pause positions may be determined based on reading behavior of multiple other users. For example, the reading behavior may be the reading behavior of other readers that have read or are currently reading an electronic text such as the e-book  shown in . For example, metadata of the e-book  or the server  may store information indicating actual pause positions in the e-book  where others have paused when reading the e-book . These pause positions may indicate good positions at which other readers may pause when reading the same e-book. The pause position manager  may determine one or more suggested pause positions based on actual pause positions of other users. For example, the pause position manager  may designate as suggested pause positions, the actual pause positions that follow after the current user position within the e-book . More specifically, for example, if actual pause positions are pages , , and , and the current user position is page , the suggested pause positions may be  and\/or .","In another example of determining a suggested pause position, one or more suggested pause positions may be determined based on a user profile. For example, the pause position manager  may determine one or more suggested pause positions based on a user profile of a reader of the e-book . In an example, the e-book reader  may store a user profile of the reader. A user profile may include, but is not limited to, an available read time for the user, a calendar of the user, a reading behavior of the user, a current time, a reading speed of the user, an activity of the user, the like, and combinations thereof. The suggested pause position may be determined based on the current user position and the user profile.","In an example of an available read time for a user, the user may specify a time that the user has available to read electronic text. For example, the user may use the user interface  for specifying his or her available time for reading the e-book . Alternatively, the pause position manager  may automatically determine the available read time based on one or more criteria such as, for example, but not limited to, a user's historic reading behavior. For example, the user's routine may be to read for about an hour before bedtime (e.g., between about 10:30 pm and 11:30 pm each night). The pause position manager  may record a length of time that a user spends reading electronic text on the e-book reader  and a time of day when the reader reads the electronic text. In this case, the pause position manager  may recognize patterns in the user's reading behavior. For example, the pause position manager  may average the reading times at particular times of day to determine an average read time for the user. The pause position manager  may also determine how much content the reader reads during the times. When the reader begins reading at the time of day, the pause position manager  may determine a suggested pause position based on the user's reading behavior. For example, the pause position manager  may determine a suggested pause position based on the time of day when the reader is reading electronic text and the average read time for the reader. The pause position manager  can predict where in the electronic text that the reader can reach during the average read time. The suggested pause position may be a stored suggested pause position for the electronic text that is near the position where the reader is predicted to reach.","In an example of a calendar of a user, the pause position manager  may determine an amount of time that the user has available to read electronic text based on entries in the user's calendar. For example, the user's calendar may be stored on the e-book  and may include one or more entries for meetings. In response to a reader opening the e-book , the pause position manager  may determine that the reader has a time period from a current time up until a start time of the next scheduled meeting to read the e-book . Next, the pause position manager  can predict the amount of content of the e-book  that the reader can read before the start of the next meeting. The pause position manager  may then determine a suggested pause position based on a current position of the reader in the e-book  and the predicted amount of content that can be read. The pause position manager  may select a pause position that is near a position where the reader can reach.","In an example of an activity of a user, the pause position manager  may determine an activity of a user based on input into an electronic device. For example, a global positioning system (GPS) device on an electronic device may detect that the device is moving. In this case, the pause position manager  may infer that the user is traveling and may have only a limited time to read an opened e-book. In this example, the pause position manager  may select a suggested pause position among multiple suggested pause positions that is near to the current user position. The suggested pause position can be a position where the reader can be expected to reach within the time available to read.","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a suggested pause position may be determined based on a content of electronic text. For example, the pause position manager  may apply semantic analysis to the content of electronic text for determining one or more suggested pause positions. Particularly, for example, the pause position manager  may apply semantic analysis to the content of the e-book  that follows a current user position for determining one or more suggested pause positions.","In an example of applying semantic analysis for determining suggested pause positions, the pause position manager  may determine a portion of electronic text content that relates to a plot point and\/or subject change. For example, the plot point may be at a portion of the e-book  where the theme of a story changes. In an example, the subject change may be at a portion of the e-book  where the subject described in the e-book  changes to another subject, such as in non-fiction works. Any suitable semantic analysis technique may be used for determining the portion of text associated with an important plot point or subject change. Next, the pause position manager  may assign a position of the plot point or subject change as a suggested pause position.","In another example of applying semantic analysis for determining suggested pause positions, the pause position manager  may determine a similarity score between text subgroups within electronic text. For example, different portions of the e-book  may include words and\/or phrases that are similar. The similarity score may be determined based on, for example, but not limited to, a number of words and\/or phrases that are similar or the same in the different portions. Note that similarity may be determined based on relations of terms in an ontology rather than simply text matching. Next, the pause position manager  may determine whether the similarity score is less than a predetermined threshold. In response to determining that the similarity score is less than the predetermined threshold, a position between the text subgroups may be assigned as the suggested pause position. For example, if the number of similar or same words and phrases is less than a predetermined number, the position between the portions of text may be assigned as the suggested pause position. In another embodiment, other methods, such as latent semantic analysis, may also be used to determine the similarity or semantic relatedness of portions of text. In this case, it may be assumed that if the portions of text are dissimilar, then that position in the text may be a good position for pause by the reader.","The method of  includes presenting the suggested pause position to the user of the electronic device (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may control a display of the user interface  to display a graphic corresponding to one or more suggested pause positions for indicating the suggested pause position(s).  illustrates a front view of an exemplary e-reader  displaying content of an e-book along with a graphic  indicating a suggested pause position in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.","Referring to , the tablet computer  displays a page  of an e-book. The e-book  also displays the graphic  within the text of the page  for indicating a suggested pause position within the e-book. In this example, the graphic  is a \u201cdot\u201d positioned within the text of the page . A graphic for indicating a pause position may be any suitable image of any suitable shape or size for indicating a position within an e-book. The graphic may be, for example, displayed in any suitable location within the text of an e-book  for indicating that its position is the suggested pause position.","In another example, the pause position manager may control the e-book to alter a portion of content of electronic text at the suggested pause position for indicating the suggested pause position to the reader. For example, the font style, size or the like of text at the pause position may be altered from that of surrounding font for indicating the position. The pause position manager of the e-book may control the display of the tablet computer  to display the graphic  at this position.","Also, referring to , the tablet computer  may display graphics and\/or text for indicating other suggested pause positions within an e-book. In this example, the tablet computer  displays a window  including text and indicia for indicating suggested pause positions within the currently-displayed e-book. The user may interact with the user interface of the tablet computer  for displaying the window . The window  may include selectable criteria for displaying suggested pause positions. For example, the user may select one or more boxes , , , and  for selecting one or more sources for suggested pause positions. In this example, the user may suitably interact with the user interface for selecting box  to present pause positions recommended by an author of the e-book. In another example, the user may suitably interact with the user interface for selecting box  to present pause positions recommended by an editor of the e-book. In another example, the user may suitably interact with the user interface for selecting box  to present pause positions recommended by other readers. In another example, the user may suitably interact with the user interface for selecting box  to present pause positions determined by text analysis (e.g., semantic analysis). The suggested pause positions of the author, editor, and\/or other readers may be stored in the e-book's metadata or at a remote server. In response to selection of one of the boxes within the window , the pause position manager may present the suggested pause positions that correspond to the selections. For example, the window  may display text indicating the page numbers of suggested pause positions. In this example, the window  includes text indicating that suggested pause positions for the selected boxes are at pages , , , , and . Further, for example, if a suggested pause position is on a currently displayed page, the pause position manager may display a graphic, such as the graphic , for indicating the suggested pause position.","In another example of presenting a suggested pause position, the pause position manager  may control a speaker of the user interface  to emit a sound for indicating the suggested pause position(s). Further, in this example, in response to determining that a current position of the reader within the e-book  is located at or near a suggested pause position, the pause position manager  may control the speaker to emit the sound for notifying the reader that he or she has reached the suggested pause position.","In another example of presenting a suggested pause position, the pause position manager  may control a vibratory device of the user interface  to vibrate the e-book  for indicating the suggested pause position(s). Further, in this example, in response to determining that a current position of the reader within the e-book  is located at or near a suggested pause position, the pause position manager  may control the vibratory device to vibrate the e-book  for notifying the reader that he or she has reached the suggested pause position. The vibratory device may include, for example, a suitably-configured flywheel motor or other suitable mechanism configured to vibrate the e-book  in response to control by the pause position manager .","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure,  illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method for suggesting a pause position within electronic text. The method of  is described with respect to system  shown in , although the method may be implemented by any suitable system or electronic device. The steps of  may be implemented entirely, or in part, by the pause position manager  residing on the e-book reader  shown in . The pause position manager  may be implemented by software, hardware, firmware, or combinations thereof.","Referring to , the method includes returning to a bookmarked position within an e-book residing on an e-book reader (step ). For example, a reader of the e-book  may enter one or more input commands selecting the e-book  and for opening the e-book  at a bookmarked page.","The method of  includes opening an application residing on the e-book for presenting one or more suggested pause positions for the e-book (step ). For example, a reader may interact with the user interface  of the e-book reader  for opening the application.","The method of  includes adjusting settings for determining and presenting one or more suggested pause positions (step ). For example, the application may include a preferences feature for allowing the reader to adjust settings for determining and presenting the suggested pause position(s). In an example, the user may select to present suggested pause positions recommended by the author, the editor, the publisher, a reader community, the like, and combinations thereof. Further, suggested pause positions may be determined in accordance with the other examples provided herein. In an example, factors for determining suggested pause positions may include, for example, but are not limited to, spoiler avoidance, thematic continuity, scene continuity, and the like. Semantic analysis or other suitable analysis techniques may be used for applying such factors. In another example, the reader may select to present suggested pause positions based on information from crowd-sourced input from any suitable source such as, for example, but not limited to, an online bookstore where the e-book was purchased.","The method of  includes determining suggested pause position(s) based on the settings (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may determine suggested pause positions based on metadata of the e-book  or data stored at the server  as described in the example set forth herein. The suggested pause positions may also be determined based on a current position with the e-book  as described in the examples presented herein. The pause position manager  may then present the suggested pause position(s) to the reader of the e-book (step ).","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a reader may explicitly or implicitly enter his or her recommended pause positions for an e-book. For example, the reader may use the user interface  for explicitly entering one or more page numbers. In this example, the pause position manager  may receive the recommended pause positions and communicate a message to the server . Alternatively, the pause point manager  may automatically infer implicit recommended pause points from a user's reading behavior. As an example, if the user ends a reading session by ceasing reading for an extended period of time at a particular location in the e-book, that location may be assumed to be a candidate for pause point recommendation. In another example, a user may bookmark a location to resume reading at a later time. The bookmark location may also be a useful pause point recommendation. When detecting implicit pause points, the pause point manager  may also consider the structure and organization of the text to infer a more ideal pause point. For example, if the reader's implicit pause point is shortly after the end of a chapter or a paragraph, the pause point manager  may adjust the inferred recommended pause point to the location of the end of the chapter or paragraph. This may be based on the reasoning that the reader, without the benefit of foresight, may often continue reading past a chapter break, which may be a structure deliberately imposed on the text by the author or editor, only to discover later that the reader had passed the ideal pause point. As another example, if the reader's implicit pause point is located at a portion of text that is significantly dissimilar or unrelated to a portion of text preceding it, the inferred recommended pause point may be adjusted to the location at the end of the portion of the preceding text. This may be based on the reasoning that a reader, without the benefit of foresight, may need to read a portion of the content following a significant subject change, plot development or narrative shift before realizing it, and that the location at which the change occurs may be a more ideal pause point. These implicit pause point recommendations may thus be automatically communicated to the server  without requiring manual user input. The server  may collect the recommended pause positions along with other readers' recommended pause positions for use in suggesting pause positions to other readers of the e-book in accordance with embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. For example, statistical analysis of pause positions submitted to the server  may be used for determining one or more pause positions for other readers.","In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure, a reader may specify a time constraint and\/or focus control for a current reading session. For example, the user interface  of the e-book reader  may present to the user an interface with which the reader may interact for specifying a time constraint and focus control for a current reading session. For example, the reader may specify that he or she has 25 minutes available for this reading session. Further, for example, the reader may specify that his or her focus on reading is 90%. A high percentage of focus may mean that the reader does not expect to be disturbed at all or very little during the reading session. In an example, based on the time constraint and\/or focus control information, the pause position manager  may determine how much content of an e-book from a current position that the reader can read in the current reading session. The pause position manager  may also use other factors, such as, but not limited to, an amount, type, and density of content between a current position and pause positions. Another example that may be applied for determining a suggested pause position includes a user profile of the reader (e.g., a reading speed of the reader for a given content density). The pause position manager  may then present the suggested pause position to the reader in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","118","102","118"]},"Referring to , the method includes initiating reading of an e-book (step ). For example, a reader may interact with the user interface  of the e-book reader  to open the e-book .","The method of  includes determining an available reading time (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may determine an available reading time based on a current time and sources such as, but not limited to, the reader's calendar, the reader's past reading history for a given time of day, manual reader input, the like, and combinations thereof.","The method of  includes determining a reading speed of the reader (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may determine a current reading speed (e.g., an average speed) or a historical reading speed of the reader. The reading speed may be in the form of, for example, number of pages read per hour or number of words read per minute.","The method of  includes applying the reading speed of the reader to content of the e-book positioned immediately after a current position of the reader in the e-book for determining one or more candidate pause positions (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may determine how much content the reader can cover after the current position based on the reading speed and an available reading time of the reader. Further, for example, the pause position manager  may determine how much content can be read based on the type of content of the entirety of the e-book, or only a portion of the e-book immediately following the current position. In this example, the pause position manager  may determine that the reader cannot read content having a higher difficulty level as efficiently as content having a lower difficulty level. In another example, the pause position manager  may apply other criteria for determining candidate pause positions such as, but not limited to, determining whether the content immediately following the current position includes a major plot development, includes the start of a new topic, and the like.","The method of  includes selecting one or more suggested pause positions from among the candidate pause positions (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may merge, rank, and\/or filter candidate pause positions for generating a list of suggested pause positions. More particularly, for example, the pause position manager  may determine that the reader can read about 25 pages from a current position within an available reading time and based on an average reading speed of the reader. In this example, the suggested pause positions may be filtered from the candidate pause positions to include only those pause positions located within the 25 pages following the reader's current position. Further, for example, the pause position manager  may merge pause positions from various sources such as, for example, but not limited to, metadata of the e-book and a remote server. In another example, the pause position manager  may rank pause positions based on, for example, but not limited to, how close the pause position is located to the position where the reader can be expected to reach within the available reading time. Further, in this example, the pause positions located closest to where the reader can be expected to reach can be given a higher ranking than the pause positions located further away.","The method of  includes displaying suggested pause positions (step ). For example, the pause position manager  may control the display of the user interface  to display a list of the suggested pause positions. In this example, the pause positions may be listed in accordance with their ranking. In another example, the pause position manager  may control the display of the user interface  to display graphics or icons at the locations of the pause positions within the e-book for indicating the pause positions to the reader.","The method of  includes displaying a suggested pause position and an estimated reading time until the next suggested pause position (step ). For example, as a current position of the reader within an e-book approaches a suggested pause position, the pause position manager  may control the display to highlight the suggested pause position and indicate the estimated reading time until the reader reaches the next suggested pause position. For example, the pause position manager  may determine the reading time until the reader reaches the next suggested pause position based on a current reading speed of the reader and content (e.g., difficulty level of the content) between the current position and the next suggested pause position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","104","115","120","104"]},"Referring to , the method includes receiving one or more recommended pause positions from an electronic device (step ). For example, a user of the e-book reader  may interact with the user interface  for specifying a recommended pause position. In this example, the pause position manager  may receive the specified pause position for the e-book  and may, in response to receipt of the specified pause position, communicate to the server  a message identifying the e-book  and indicating the suggested pause position. In another example, the pause position manager  may automatically determine a suggested pause position based on an action by a reader. In this example, the pause position manager  may determine that a reader has closed the e-book  and may determine that the position where the e-book  was closed is a suggested pause position. Such information may be received by the server  and stored in a pause position store .","The method of  includes receiving reader context information (step ). For example, the server  may receive reader context information such as, but not limited to, starting and current positions of a reader within an e-book, an estimated reading time (e.g., a difference between a start and stop time of a reader), a reading speed of a reader, time of day the reader has read, and the like.
