The charging member usually includes an elastic body such as rubber or elastomer of which surface is provided with a surface layer of, for example, cross-linked urethane. A conducting agent is dispersed in the surface layer so as to impart conductivity.","Due to electric energy intermittently applied to the charging member in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus (hereinafter also referred to as \u201celectrophotographic apparatus\u201d), the electric resistance of the charging member gradually changes, causing uneven charging and charging defects, which result in image defects in some cases.","In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-9380, a technique for suppressing the occurrence of charging defects by addition of a hindered phenol material to the surface layer for suppression of deterioration of the surface layer material is disclosed.","As a result of investigation by the present inventors of the technique described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-9380, however, it was found that the charging member by the technique in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-9380 still caused charging defects due to changes in electric resistance over time in some cases. The present inventors assume the following cause.","A high voltage is usually applied to the charging member in an electrophotographic apparatus, which discharges electricity to a photosensitive member to be charged, resulting in generation of discharge products such as ozone and nitrogen oxides including NO. In the case of antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-9380, the antioxidizing ability under the presence of NOis inhibited by NOin some cases. The reason is believed that the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material itself causes chemical reaction with NO, so as to form a stable quinone, losing the function as antioxidizing agent. In other words, the charging member by the technique of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H03-9380 has reduced antioxidizing ability of the hindered phenol compound due to generation of NOduring charging, resulting in changes in electric resistance over time. Consequently the charging evenness is impaired.","The present invention is, therefore, directed to providing a charging member of which the electric resistance hardly changes even in a long-term use so as to hardly cause image defects due to changes in electric resistance over time. The present invention is directed to providing a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus, capable of stably forming a high-quality electrophotographic image.","The charging member of the present invention includes an electroconductive support and an electroconductive surface layer. The surface layer contains at least one compound selected from the group consisting of a compound represented by the following formula (1), a compound represented by the following formula (3), and a compound represented by the following formula (4), a binder resin, and a conducting agent.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0012"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"36.24mm","wi":"63.42mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (1), Rrepresents a hydroxyl group or a substituent represented by the following formula (2), and Rto Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"30.14mm","wi":"53.59mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (2), * represents a bonding portion with the 3-position carbon atom of a compound represented by the formula (1).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"36.32mm","wi":"63.33mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (3), Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and a methoxy group, wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"36.32mm","wi":"63.33mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (4), Rto Reach independently represent an atom or a group selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and a methoxy group, wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.","The present invention also provides an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having an electrophotographic photosensitive member and a charging member arranged to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member, wherein the charging member is the above-described charging member.","Furthermore, the present invention provides a process cartridge which integrally supports the charging member and at least one selected from the group consisting of an electrophotographic photosensitive member, a developing unit, a transferring unit, and a cleaning unit, and is detachably mountable to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus.","The present invention provides a charging member of which the electric resistance hardly changes even in a long-term use so as to hardly cause image defects due to changes in electric resistance over time.

Although the description is focused on the charging member in a roller shape (hereinafter also referred to as charging roller) in the following, the present invention is not limited thereto.","The charging member of the present invention includes an electroconductive support and an electroconductive surface layer. A schematic cross-sectional diagram of a charging member according to an example of the present invention is illustrated in . The charging member  illustrated in  is a charging roller having an electroconductive support , an elastic layer  formed on the support, and an electroconductive surface layer  formed on the elastic layer.

These compounds include a benzene ring basic skeleton, which usually has a hydroxyl group.","The hydroxyl group is referred to as phenolic hydroxyl group. Although many parts of the detailed reaction mechanism are unknown yet, it is assumed that the phenolic hydroxyl group supplies an electron or hydrogen atom to a radical molecule generated in a binder resin so as to form a phenoxy radical, which is eliminated through resonance structure stabilization or polymerization into a dimer, so that oxidative degradation of the material is prevented.","It is also assumed that the compounds have excellent radical elimination capability and antioxidative effect, since the structure derived from the basic skeleton itself other than the phenolic hydroxyl group imparts an electron or hydrogen atom to a radical generated in a binder resin.","Furthermore, being different from the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material, these compounds have strong antioxidative effect even under presence of nitrogen oxides as discharge products, so that free radicals formed from nitrogen oxides can be eliminated. In addition, being different from the antioxidizing agent of hindered phenol material, these compounds have no bulky alkyl group adjacent to a hydroxyl group, so that the reaction rate with radicals can be increased due to the small steric barrier. It is therefore assumed that the resistance increase of a charging member is efficiently suppressed, so that a high-quality image can be maintained for a long period. One kind of these compounds may be used singly or a plurality of kinds of the compounds may be used in combination.","Flavans (Also Including Flavanols)","Examples of the compound represented by the formula (1) include compounds described in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0054"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00009","num":"00009"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00009","he":"36.32mm","wi":"62.91mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00009.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (1), Rrepresents a hydroxyl group or a substituent represented by the following formula (2), and Rto Reach independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, wherein at least one of Rto Ris a hydroxyl group.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"11"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"R","R","R","R","R","R","R","R","R","R"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"10","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"11"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Epicatechin","OH","OH","H","OH","H","H","H","OH","OH","H"]},{"entry":["Epicatechin gallate","Formula 2","OH","H","OH","H","H","H","OH","OH","H"]},{"entry":["Epigallocatechin","OH","OH","H","OH","H","H","OH","OH","OH","H"]},{"entry":["Epigallocatechin","Formula 2","OH","H","OH","H","H","OH","OH","OH","H"]},{"entry":"gallate"},{"entry":["Afzelechin","OH","OH","H","OH","H","H","H","OH","H","H"]},{"entry":["Flavanol","OH","H","H","H","H","H","H","H","H","H"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"11","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In Table 1, H represents a hydrogen atom, OH represents a hydroxyl group, and Formula 2 represents a substituent represented by the following formula (2).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0058"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00010","num":"00010"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00010","he":"30.06mm","wi":"53.59mm","file":"US09632446-20170425-C00010.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the formula (2), * represents the bonding portion with the 3-position carbon atom of a compound represented by the formula (1).

With an amount added of 10 parts by mass or less, reduction in strength of a binder resin may be easily prevented.","The total amount of these flavonoids in the surface layer can be 0.005 mass % or more in considering of the effect for suppressing degradation due to electric conduction, and can be 5 mass % or less in considering of the film formability of the surface layer and moldability.","In the case of using flavans, flavanones and flavones in combination, the compounding ratios thereof are properly set without specific limitations.","(Identification Method of Flavonoids)","Any structure of the compounds for use in the present invention represented by the formula (1), formula (3), and formula (4), respectively, can be identified by NMR.","(Binder Resin)","As the binder resin for use in the surface layer, a known binder resin in the field of electrophotographic apparatus such as a thermosetting resin and a thermoplastic resin may be used. More specifically, examples of the resin include a fluororesin, a polyamide resin, an acrylic resin, a polyurethane resin, an acrylic urethane resin, and a butyral resin.","These binder resins may be used singly, or two or more kinds of these may be mixed for use. The binder resin may be a homopolymer of one monomer or a copolymer of a plurality of monomers. Among these, a thermosetting resin can be used as the binder resin for use in the surface layer from the view point of high release properties without causing contamination of a photosensitive member or other members.","The specific flavonoid for use in the present invention is a compound having excellent antioxidizing ability, and the ability is expected to be shown not depending on the kind of binder resin to be added. These flavonoids tend to be rather hydrophilic, so that a binder resin to be added having relatively low polarity tends to have affinity with the flavonoid, compared to a resin having extremely high polarity. Consequently, urethane resins are preferred among binder resins, satisfying requisite characteristics for a charging member besides charging evenness. Among the urethane resins, an acrylic urethane resin is preferred in particular.","(Conducting Agent)","Examples of the conducting agent include an electron conducting agent and an ionic conducting agent.","Examples of the electron conducting agent include: metallic fine particles of such as aluminum, palladium, iron, copper, and silver; metal oxides such as titanium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, and silicon oxide; the metal oxides and the above-described metallic fine particles doped with a substance such as a dissimilar metal or a dissimilar metal oxide; composite particles of metal oxide with surface treatment such as electrolysis, spraying, and mixing\/shaking; and carbon particles (carbon black) such as furnace black, thermal black, acetylene black, ketjen black, PAN (polyacrylonitrile) based carbon, and pitch based carbon.","Examples of the furnace black include SAF-HS, SAF, ISAF-HS, ISAF, ISAF-LS, I-ISAF-HS, HAF-HS, HAF, HAF-LS, T-HS, T-NS, MAF, FEF, GPF, SRF-HS-HM, SRF-LM, ECF, and FEF-HS. Examples of the thermal black include FT and MT.","Examples of the ionic conducting agent include: an inorganic ionic material such as lithium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate, and calcium perchlorate; a cationic surfactant such as lauryl trimethylammonium chloride, stearyl trimethylammonium chloride, octadecyl trimethylammonium chloride, dodecyl trimethylammonium chloride, hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride, trioctyl propylammonium bromide, and modified aliphatic dimethyl ethyl ammonium ethosulfate; a zwitterionic surfactant such as lauryl betaine, stearyl betaine, and dimethyl alkyl lauryl betaine; a quaternary ammonium salt such as tetraethyl ammonium perchlorate, tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate, and trimethyl octadecyl ammonium perchlorate; and an organic lithium salt such as lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate.","These conducting agents may be used singly or in combinations of two or more kinds. The amount of the conducting agent added may be properly adjusted within the range allowing the desired electric resistance of a charging member to be obtained.","(Other Additives)","Other than the flavonoids, the binder resin, and the conducting agent, additives such as a filler made of inorganic compound may be added to the surface layer on an as needed basis.","<Elastic Layer>","In the present invention, an elastic layer may be arranged between the electroconductive support and the surface layer as described above.","The material for use in the elastic layer (material for forming the elastic layer) may include a polymer such as rubber and resin and various kinds of additives. Examples of the polymer include an epichlorohydrin rubber, an acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR), a chloroprene rubber, a urethane rubber, a silicone rubber, and a thermoplastic elastomer such as a styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) block copolymer and a styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer, any of which can be used. Among them, the use of polar rubber is more preferred, allowing for easy adjustment of resistance. Among the polar rubbers, the use of epichlorohydrin rubber or NBR is particularly preferred, having advantages allowing for more easy control of the resistance and hardness of an elastic layer. These polymers may be used singly or a plurality of kinds may be used in combination.","The polymer itself of epichlorohydrin rubber has a conductivity in the medium resistance range, capable of, for example, easily having excellent conductivity even with a small amount of conductive particles added. Furthermore, the epichlorohydrin rubber allows the variation of electric resistance in positional difference to be reduced, being suitable for use as a polymer elastic body. Examples of the epichlorohydrin rubber include an epichlorohydrin homopolymer, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide copolymer, an epichlorohydrin-allyl glycidyl ether copolymer, and an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer. In particular, an epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer can be used among them, having stable conductivity in the medium resistance range. The degree of polymerization and the composition ratio of the epichlorohydrin-ethylene oxide-allyl glycidyl ether ternary copolymer are arbitrarily adjusted, so that the conductivity and the workability may be easily controlled.","The elastic layer may include an epichlorohydrin rubber alone, or may include an epichlorohydrin rubber as main component (component having the highest content in the elastic layer) and other common rubbers and thermoplastic elastomers on an as needed basis. Examples of the other common rubbers include an ethylene propylene rubber (EPM), an ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) copolymer, NBR, a chloroprene rubber, a natural rubber, an isoprene rubber, a butadiene rubber, a styrene butadiene rubber, a urethane rubber, and a silicone rubber. Examples of the other thermoplastic elastomers include SBS and SEBS.","Other than the polymers, the elastic layer may also include additives such as a conducting agent (e.g. conductive particles), a plasticizer, an extender, a vulcanizing agent, a vulcanizing accelerator, an antiaging agent, and a foaming agent.","<Characteristics as Charging Member>","The charging member of the present invention can usually have an electric resistance of 1\u00d710\u03a9 or more and 1\u00d710\u03a9 or less under an environment at 23\u00b0 C.\/50% RH (relative humidity), so as to achieve excellent charging of a photosensitive member.","An example of the measurement method of the electric resistance of a charging member (the elastic layer and surface layer part, in particular) is illustrated in . A shaft bearing (not shown in drawing) allows the exposed parts of the electroconductive support at both ends of a charging roller  to be contacted in parallel with a cylindrical metal . The cylindrical metal  is rotated with a motor (not shown in drawing) in this state, and the contacting charging roller  is rotary driven, to which a DC voltage of \u2212200 V is applied from a stabilized power source . On this occasion, the current flowing in a reference resistance  is measured with an ammeter , so as to calculate the resistance of the charging roller. On this occasion, the load applied to each of both ends of the charging roller  is set at 4.9 N for one end, and the rotation speed of the cylindrical metal  is set at a circumferential velocity of 45 mm\/sec.","<<Manufacturing Method of Charging Member>>","A charging member of the present invention may be prepared by a manufacturing method including the step of applying a surface layer forming material which contains at least one of the compounds represented by the formula (1), formula (3), and formula (4), respectively, a binder resin, and a conducting agent onto an electroconductive support, for the formation of an electroconductive surface layer.","In the case of forming an elastic layer, the method may include, prior to the above-described step, the steps of: forming an elastic layer on the electroconductive support; and grinding the surface of the produced elastic layer.","<Elastic Layer Forming Step>","Firstly, a polymer and various additives are kneaded with a kneader so as to prepare a raw material rubber composition (elastic layer forming material). Examples of the kneader include a ribbon blender, a Nauta mixer, a Henschel mixer, a super mixer, a Bambury mixer, and a pressure kneader.","Subsequently, the raw material rubber composition is applied onto the electroconductive support (e.g. surface) so as to form an elastic layer. More specifically, the following method may be employed. For example, using an extrusion forming device having a cross head as illustrated in , an electroconductive support  applied with an adhesive is fed to a cross head  with an electroconductive support feeding roll . Meanwhile, the raw material rubber composition is extruded from an extruder , so that the electroconductive support as central shaft is coaxially coated with the raw material rubber composition in a cylindrical shape. The electroconductive support and the elastic layer forming material are thus integrally extruded to form the preformed body  of a charging member.","The cross head is a device commonly used for covering electrical cables and wires, being attached for use to a rubber discharge part of the cylinder of an extruder.","In an alternative method, a rubber tube made of the raw material rubber composition is formed, to which an electroconductive support coated with an adhesive is inserted in the tube to be bonded. In another alternative method, an electroconductive support coated with an adhesive is covered with an unvulcanized rubber sheet made of the raw material rubber composition so as to be vulcanized in a mold. As described above, the heating operation (vulcanizing operation) may be performed during formation of an elastic layer, according to the material for use in the raw material rubber composition.","<Grinding Step>","Subsequently, the surface of the produced elastic layer may be polished on an as needed basis. As a grinding device, a cylindrical grinding machine for forming a predetermined outer diameter may be used. Examples of the cylindrical grinding machine include a traverse-type NC cylindrical grinding machine and a plunge-cut type NC cylindrical grinding machine. A plunge-cut type NC cylindrical grinding machine is preferred, capable of reducing the processing time through use of a wider grinding stone compared to a traverse-type machine, with a smaller change in diameter of the grinding stone.","<Surface Layer Forming Step>","Subsequently, a coating liquid of the surface layer forming material is applied onto the produced elastic layer (onto the electroconductive support in the case of no elastic layer) so as to form the surface layer. Examples of the coating method include a vertical ring coating method, a dip coating method, an immersion coating method, a spray coating method, a roll coating method, a curtain coating method, and a gravure printing method. Among them, a vertical ring coating method and a dip coating method are most commonly used.","The charging member of the present invention is thus produced.","<<Electrophotographic Apparatus>>","The schematic constitution diagram of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus having the charging member of the present invention is illustrated in .","An electrophotographic photosensitive member  is a rotary drum type, having a photosensitive layer on a conductive substrate. The photosensitive member is rotary driven in the arrow direction at a predetermined circumferential velocity (process speed).","The charging device includes a contact type charging roller  to be arranged in contact with the photosensitive member  with a predetermined pressing force. A charging roller  is rotary-driven, following the rotation of the photosensitive member. The photosensitive member is chargeable to a predetermined potential by applying a predetermined DC voltage to the charging roller  from a power source for charging .","As a latent image forming device (not shown in drawing) for forming an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive member , for example, an exposure device such as a laser beam scanner is used. The evenly charged photosensitive member is irradiated with exposure light  corresponding to the image information so as to form an electrostatic latent image.","A developing device  includes a developing roller  arranged adjacent to or in contact with the photosensitive member . The developing roller  allows the toner electrostatically treated in the same polarity as the charged polarity of the photosensitive member to form a toner image from the electrostatic latent image through reversal development.","A transferring roller  transfers the toner image from the photosensitive member to a transfer material  (the transfer material is conveyed by a paper supply system having a conveying member). A cleaning device including a blade-type cleaning member  and a collection container mechanically scrapes off the toner remaining after transferring on the photosensitive member for collection after transferring.","A fixing device  including a heated roll and the like fixes the transferred toner image on the transfer material , which is discharged outside the machine.","The electrophotographic apparatus of the present invention may also include, for example, the following process cartridge, exposure device, and fixing device.","<Process Cartridge>","The electrophotographic apparatus of the present invention may also use a process cartridge of the present invention which integrates (integrally supports) the charging member and at least one selected from the group consisting of a electrophotographic photosensitive member, a developing device (developing unit), a transferring device (transferring unit), and a cleaning device (cleaning unit), being designed to be detachably mountable to the electrophotographic apparatus. An example of the process cartridge is illustrated in . In the process cartridge, the charging member (charging roller ) is integrated with a member to be charged (photosensitive member ) and detachably mountable to a main body of the electrophotographic apparatus. As the charging member, the charging member of the present invention is used. The reference signs  and  represent an elasticity restricting blade and a toner seal, respectively.","An elastic roller having an elastic layer on an electroconductive support was manufactured as follows.","To a stainless steel rod having a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 252.5 mm was coated with a thermosetting adhesive (trade name: METALOC U-20, made by Toyokagaku Kenkyusho Co., Ltd.), which was then dried for use as the electroconductive support.","In manufacturing a raw material rubber composition for the rubber elastic layer, the materials shown in the following Table 4 were kneaded for 15 minutes with a closed type mixer having a capacity of 6 litters, adjusted at 50\u00b0 C.
