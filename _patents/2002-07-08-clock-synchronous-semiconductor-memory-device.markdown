Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a clock synchronous semiconductor memory device for transferring data and taking in an external signal synchronously with a clock signal. Particularly, the invention relates to a structure of a data input\/output section in a synchronous semiconductor memory device that operates in a DDR (Double Data Rate) mode of transferring data at both rising and fall edges of a clock signal. More particularly, the invention relates to a structure for operating the data input\/output section at a rate faster than an external clock signal.","2. Description of the Background Art","In a high-speed data processing system, it is required to transfer data between a memory and a processor at high speed. As such a memory for transferring data at high speed, a clock synchronous semiconductor memory device to transfer data synchronously with a clock signal is known. Since data is transferred synchronously with a clock signal such as a system clock, the data transfer rate is determined by the clock signal and high-speed data transfer can be achieved.","In the clock synchronous semiconductor memory device, a control signal instructing an operation mode is merely required to satisfy the condition of set up and hold timings relative to the clock signal. It is unnecessary to consider a skew among control signals, and it is unnecessary to determine an internal timing in consideration of the margin for the skew among the control signals. Thus, the internal operation start timing can be set faster, and high speed access can be achieved.","Such a clock synchronous semiconductor memory device comes to be widely used. However, to achieve higher-speed data transfer, a semiconductor memory device operating in a DDR (Double Data Rate) mode of transferring data synchronously with both the rising and falling edges of a clock signal is implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 81","FIG. 81"]},"The read command for instructing data reading operation is applied synchronously with the rising edge, for example, of an external clock signal Ext.CLK. Internally, an internal clock signal CLKP is generated in response to the rising edge of external clock signal Ext.CLK, and an internal clock signal CLKN is generated synchronously with the falling edge of external dock signal Ext.CLK.","When the read command is applied, selection of a memory cell and reading of internal data are internally executed synchronously with an external clock signal. At this time, data of two bits is read in parallel per data output terminal. The 2-bit data read in parallel is converted to serial data in accordance with clock signals CLKP and CLKN, and the serial data is sequentially transferred.","Subsequently, an output circuit operates in response to an output clock signal CLKO generated synchronously with internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN, and produces external read data Dout from the internal read data. Since the column latency CL is 2 and the burst length BL is 4, after elapse of two clock cycles since the read command is applied, external read data Dout is produced, and data of four bits per data output terminal is successively output synchronously with output clock signals CLKO.","As shown in , in the case of the DDR mode, data is output synchronously with the rising and falling edges of external clock signal Ext.CLK, so that data can be transferred at a frequency twice as high as that of external clock signal Ext.CLK. Thus, data can be transferred at higher speed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 81"},"Output clock signal CLKO is generated in data reading, after elapse of column latency, synchronously with internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 82","FIG. 82"],"b":["950","956","952","954","950","958","956"]},"Edge detecting circuits  and  each are formed of, for example, a differential amplifier, and perform complementary edge detecting operations to each other. Specifically, edge detecting circuit  outputs a signal which goes high when external dock signal Ext.CLK is higher than complementary external clock signal Ext.CLKB. Edge detecting circuit  outputs a signal which goes high when complementary external clock signal Ext.CLKB attains higher than external clock signal Ext.CLK.","One-shot pulse generating circuit  generates a one-shot pulse signal having a predetermined time width in response to the rising edge of the output signal of edge detecting circuit  and generates internal clock signal CLK. One-shot pulse generating circuit  generates clock signal CLKP for output control having a predetermined time width in the form of a one-shot pulse in response to the rising edge of the output signal of edge detecting circuit .","One-shot pulse generating circuit  generates clock signal CLKN for output control by generating a one-shot pulse signal having a predetermined time width in response to the rising edge of the output signal of edge detecting circuit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 83","FIG. 83"],"b":"82"},"When external clock signal Ext.CLK becomes higher than external clock signal Ext.CLKB, edge detecting circuit  generates an H-level signal. Accordingly, one-shot pulse generating circuit  generates a one-shot pulse signal, and internal clock signal CLKP is generated. Therefore, internal dock signal CLKP is generated synchronously with the rising edge of external clock signal Ext.CLK and the falling edge of complementary external clock signal Ext.CLKB.","On the other hand, edge detecting circuit  outputs an H-level signal when external clock signal Ext.CLK goes low and complementary external clock signal Ext.CLKB goes high. One-shot pulse generating circuit  generates a one-shot pulse signal in response to the rising edge of an output signal of edge detecting circuit , to generate internal clock signal CLKN.","Therefore, internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN are generated synchronously with the rising and falling edges, respectively, of external clock signal Ext.CLK, so that their phases are shifted from each other by a half cycle of external clock signal Ext.CLK.","In data reading, under control of a not-shown reading control circuit, output clock signal CLKO is generated synchronously with internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 84","FIG. 84","FIG. 84"],"b":["960","0","962","1","964","960","962","965","0"]},"In the semiconductor memory device, synchronously with internal clock signal CLK generated according to external clock signal Ext.CLK, reading of internal data (selection of a memory cell and amplification and transfer of internal read data) is performed. Internal read data RD and RD are transferred in parallel to register circuits  and . Multiplexer  generates internal read clock signals CLKEV and CLKOD from internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN in accordance with address signal bit A. For example, when address signal bit A is \u201c0\u201d, according to internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN, internal read clock signals CLKEV and CLKOD are generated. In this case, therefore, internal read data RD stored in register circuit  is transferred first.","Output drive circuit  transfers data generated synchronously with internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN and transferred from register circuits  and  externally. Output clock signal CLKO is therefore generated synchronously with the rising and falling edges of external clock signal Ext.CLK, and external output data Dout is transferred at the rising and falling edges of external clock signal Ext.CLK.","As shown in , on the inside, the internal circuit is operated at the cycle of external clock signal Ext.CLK, to perform selection of a memory cell, transference of memory cell data, and then a so-called \u201cparallel to serial conversion\u201d for transference in the data reading section. In this way, the internal circuit can operate stably also for a high-speed clock signal, and data can be transferred externally at a period twice as short as that of the external clock signal.","A data writing section also has a configuration similar to that of the data reading section. A serial-to-parallel converting process of receiving data supplied synchronously with both the rising and falling edges of external clock signal Ext.CLK from the outside of the memory device, and transmission of internal write data to selected memory cells in parallel are performed. In data writing as well, therefore, the internal circuit operates in cycles of the external clock signal. Data supplied in the cycle twice as short as that of the external clock is received, and data can be written to the selected memory cells.","In the semiconductor memory device, a function test has to be carried out to assure the reliability of the product. In the case of performing the test, a tester (testing apparatus) has to generate a clock signal and apply it to a synchronous semiconductor memory device to be tested.","When the operating speed of the semiconductor memory device increases and the frequency of the clock signal becomes high, there is such a case that the tester cannot generate a required high-speed clock signal. Particularly, in the case where there is no large change in the contents of a test while the operating speed of the synchronous semiconductor memory device increases due to alteration of generations or the like, a higher-speed synchronous semiconductor memory device is tested by using the tester used for the synchronous semiconductor memory device of the previous generation, in order to reduce the cost of the test or for other reasons.","In such a case, in the semiconductor memory device, generally, the internal clock signal is generated synchronously with both the rising and falling edges of an external clock signal, and the internal circuit is operated in the cycle twice as short as that of the external clock signal.","Between the semiconductor memory device and the tester, data is transferred synchronously with a relatively low-speed external clock signal generated by the tester. For a semiconductor memory device with an SDR (Single Data Rate) mode of transferring data synchronously with the rising edge or falling edge of the external clock signal, an internal clock signal of a frequency twice as high as that of the external clock signal is generated to operate the internal circuit in synchronization of the internal clock signal, so that an actual operation of the internal circuit can be tested by using the low-speed tester.","However, in the semiconductor memory device with the DDR mode of transferring data synchronously with the rising and falling edges of the external clock signal, data input\/output sections already operate at a frequency twice as high as that of the external clock signal. Even when the internal dock signal of a frequency twice as high as that of the external clock signal is generated, read clock signal CLKO shown in , for example, is similarly a clock signal of a frequency twice as high as that of the external clock signal. Even when the frequency of the external clock signal is internally multiplied to generate an internal clock signal having a doubled clock frequency, the data input\/output section cannot be operated in the DDR mode at a frequency twice as high as the internal clock.","For example, in a signal waveform diagram of , when internal clock signal CLKP is generated synchronously with both the rising and falling edges of external clock signal Ext.CLK, internal clock signals CLKP and CLKN become the same clock signal, so that the internal circuit cannot be operated accurately. In addition, output clock signal CLKO merely turns signal having the same frequency as that of internal clock signal CLKP, and the input\/output circuitry cannot be operated in the DDR mode.","In the semiconductor memory device with the SDR mode as well, in the case of generating the internal clock signal synchronously with both the rising and falling edges of the external clock signal, only the internal clock signal of the frequency twice as high as that of the external clock signal can be generated, and an even higher-speed internal clock signal cannot be generated.","In addition to a test such as a function test, stress acceleration cannot be accurately performed by operating a data input\/output circuit at high speed in an acceleration test, and a problem such that time required to perform a stress acceleration test such as a burn-in becomes long occurs.","An object of the invention is to provide a synchronous semiconductor memory device capable of operating an input\/output section at a frequency at least four times as high as that of the external clock signal in a specific operating mode.","Another object of the invention is to provide a DDR mode semiconductor memory device that can be tested accurately by using a low-speed tester.","Further another object of the invention is to provide a DDR mode semiconductor memory device which operates at a frequency four times as high as that of the external clock signal in a specific operating mode.","A semiconductor memory device according to a first aspect of the invention includes a pulse generating circuit receiving a plurality of clock signals different in phase from each other and generating a one-shot pulse signal in a cycle shorter than that of each of the plurality of clock signals, and a data interface circuit inputting or outputting data synchronously with a pulse signal generated by the pulse generating circuit.","A semiconductor memory device according to a second aspect of the invention includes an internal strobe signal generating circuit receiving signals from a plurality of signal terminals including a strobe terminal for receiving a data strobe signal providing a data strobe timing and, in a specific operation mode, generating an internal strobe signal obtained by frequency-multiplying the signal of the strobe terminal, and a data input circuit for taking in external data and generating internal write data in accordance with the internal strobe signal.","A semiconductor memory device according to a third aspect of the invention includes an internal data transmission bus having a width of a plurality of bits, a data pattern generating circuit for generating a data pattern having a predetermined pattern in a specific operation mode, and a switching circuit for transmitting data corresponding to output data of the data pattern generating circuit in parallel to the internal data transmission bus in the specific operation mode.","A semiconductor memory device according to a fourth aspect of the invention includes a strobe terminal for receiving a strobe signal providing a data strobe timing, an internal data line for transmitting a signal of a plurality of bits, and an internal data generating circuit for, in a specific operation mode, taking in data applied to a data input terminal in response to a change in the signal applied to the strobe terminal, generating data of a plurality of bits from the data taken in response to each change, and transmitting the generated data in parallel to the internal data line.","By using a plurality of external signals, an internal clock signal having a frequency higher than a doubled frequency of an external clock signal can be generated. Therefore, a semiconductor memory device with a DDR mode can be allowed to perform data input\/output operation in the DDR mode at high speed even by using a low-speed tester. Thus, the semiconductor memory device with the DDR mode that operates at high speed can be accurately tested by using a low-speed tester.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","First Embodiment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","1","3","4","3","5","1","4","6"]},"A test mode instruction signal TM is applied to internal clock generating circuit  and in the test mode, internal clock generating circuit  generates internal clock signals CLKP, CLKN, and CLK each having a frequency twice as high as that of external clock signal Ext.CLK.","Input\/output circuit  inputs\/outputs data in a DDR mode.","To input\/output circuit , a data strobe signal DQS and a data mask instruction signal DQM are applied.

According to the method of specifying the test mode, it is unnecessary to designate the \u201ctest mode exit\u201d in order to complete one test mode, so that the test mode can be changed at high speed.","In the normal operation mode, output signal TDQS of AND circuit  is at the L level, output pulse signal PU of EXOR circuit maintains the L level, and latch circuit  does not operate.","In the configurations shown in , latch circuit  may latch external address signal bit Ext.A synchronously with the rising or falling edge of data strobe signal Ext.DQS and generate internal address signal bit Int.A.","In the case of the configuration of taking in an externally applied address signal bit in accordance with the external data strobe signal and generating the test mode specifying signal, in the test mode, test mode specifying signals TM and TM can be set to a definite state at a desired timing. Thus, in the test mode, the test mode specifying signals can be set with a sufficient margin to execute the designated test mode.","Third Configuration of Test Mode Specifying Signal Generating Section",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0464","num":"0463"},"figref":["FIG. 78","FIG. 78"],"b":["70","230","100","232","0","230","0"]},"Command decoder  takes in external control signals \/RAS, \/CAS, \/WE, and \/CS at the rising edge of an external clock signal (or internal clock signal), identifies an operation mode designated according to the logic levels of the control signals and activates, when a command of designating the writing operation mode is supplied, write operation instruction signal \u03c6w.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0466","num":"0465"},"figref":["FIG. 79","FIG. 79","FIG. 78"],"b":["232","78","232","232","0","230","2332","232","232","232","0","232","232","232"],"i":["a ","b ","a","c ","b ","d ","b ","b.

In the case where address signal bit Ext.A is set to the H level, internal address signal bit Int.A is at the H level, and test mode specifying signal TM goes high.","On the other hand, when the write command is supplied and external address signal bit Ext.A is set to the L level, latch circuit  sets internal address signal bit Int.A to the L level in accordance with external address signal bit Ext.A in response to activation of write operation instruction signal \u03c6w. In this state, test mode specifying signal TM turns active.","In the test mode, when the write command instructing writing of data is supplied, according to currently applied external address signal bit Ext.A, internal address signal bit Int.A changes and accordingly, states of test mode specifying signals TM and TM are set. In the test mode, data of two bits is generated per data input terminal according to a signal supplied at the rising edge of the external clock signal, the generated 2-bit data is transmitted in parallel to internal data signal lines and , and test write data DIL and DILL to memory cells is generated.","Therefore, in the input circuit, it is unnecessary to use internal address signal bit A to determine the order of latching external data and in the test mode, internal address signal bit A to the latch circuit is set to an invalid state. Consequently, in the configuration of generating 2-bit data from 1-bit data, the least significant internal address signal bit is not used. Therefore, external address signal bit Ext.A, concurrently applied with the write command in the data writing operation, is used as a signal for setting a data pattern. Without using an extra pin terminal, in the test mode, a data pattern can be set always in the data writing operation. Only by an alteration of the address signal bit, the test data pattern can be changed, and a 4-bit checker pattern, a 2-bit checker pattern, and the like can be easily generated.","As described above, according to the 27th embodiment of the invention, transfer data to memory cells in adjacent columns are set to be the same or inverted. Consequently, the flexibility of the data pattern can be increased, and a highly reliable test can be achieved.","Other Embodiments","As a semiconductor memory device of the invention, what is required for a semiconductor memory device is to transfer data synchronously with the rising and falling edges of an external dock signal. The semiconductor memory device may be a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) or an SRAM (Static Random Access memory).","A test operation mode may be a test mode of performing a functional test for writing data into a memory cell and determining whether the memory cell is defective or normal, or may be a stress acceleration test of operating an input\/output circuit at high speed to accelerate a stress in a burn-in mode.","As described above, according to the invention, an internal signal which changes at a cycle twice as short as an external clock signal or external data strobe signal is generated and the data input\/output circuit is operated synchronously with the rising and falling edges of the internal signal. Thus, the high-speed semiconductor memory device can be operated in the DDR mode by using a low-speed tester.","By configuring the semiconductor memory device to generate a test data patter internally in the test mode, the tester is not required to transfer the input data for the test data, but the input data can be generated internally in accordance with a double-speed dock signal. Thus, test data in the DDR mode can be accurately generated.","Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of
