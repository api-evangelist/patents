{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on application No. 2008-159150 filed in Japan, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an image-forming apparatus of an electrophotographic system and a developing device used for such an image-forming apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","With respect to developing systems used for the image-forming apparatus of an electrophotographic system, a mono-component developing system using only toner as a main component of a developer and a two-component developing system using a toner and a carrier as main components of a developer have been known.","A developing device of the mono-component developing system is provided with a toner supporting member that supports toner thereon and transports the toner and a toner-regulating blade that is made contact with the toner supporting face of the toner supporting member. Upon passing through the contact position with the toner-regulating blade, the toner, supported on the toner supporting member, is made friction-contact with the toner-regulating blade to be formed into a thin film, and also charged to a predetermined polarity. In this manner, since the mono-component developing device carries out a toner-charging process through the friction-contact with the toner-regulating blade, the resulting advantage is that the structure is simple, small, and inexpensive. Moreover, since only the toner layer having an upper limit value of 10+several micron meters in thickness is formed on the toner supporting member, the toner supporting member and the photosensitive member can be designed with a fine gap maintained therebetween, and consequently, a high toner transporting speed can be achieved by setting a strong electric-field so that high image quality with high precision can be obtained. However, toner degradation tends to occur due to a high stress in the regulating portion, and the quantity of charge of toner tends to be lowered in endurance use. Moreover, the charge-applying property to the toner is lowered by contamination of the toner-regulating blade and the surface of the toner supporting member due to the toner and external additives to cause problems of fogging and the like, with the result that it becomes difficult to prolong the service life of the developing device.","Since the developing device of the two-component developing system charges the toner and the carrier to predetermined polarities by making them in friction-contact with each other, the stress to be applied to the toner is smaller in comparison with that of the mono-component developing device. Since the surface area of the carrier is larger in comparison with that of the toner, the carrier is less vulnerable to contamination due to adhesion of the toner. However, the length of a magnetic brush formed on a developer supporting member by the carrier is 20 to 50 times thicker than the thickness of the toner layer on the toner supporting member of the mono-component developing system, and the magnetic brush becomes uneven from the microscopic viewpoint. As a result, inevitably, a weaker electric field needs to be set in comparison with that of the mono-component developing system by taking into consideration prevention of leak or the like, and at least one portion of the magnetic brush needs to be made in contact with the photosensitive member. Consequently, since the toner transporting speed becomes slower, and since scraping off of the toner image on the photosensitive member by the carrier occurs, the image quality becomes inferior to that of the mono-component developing system.","As a developing system that adopts the advantages of the two developing systems, a hybrid developing system has been proposed in which an electric field is formed between a transporting roller (first transporting member) on which a developer charged by the two-component developing system is held and a developing roller (second transporting member), and only the toner is consequently separated to form a toner layer on the developing roller so that a mono-component developing process is carried out (Japanese Patent-Application Laid-Open No. 2003-15380). In this developing system, at an opposing portion between the developing roller and the transporting roller, only the toner is selectively supplied from the transporting roller to the developing roller, and residual toner is recovered from the developing roller to the transporting roller. This system makes it possible to achieve both of the long service life of the apparatus and high image quality. In this system, however, at the opposing portion between the developing roller and the transporting roller, the toner supplying and recovering processes become insufficient to cause a new problem in that the toner layer on the developing roller is not sufficiently reset. For this reason, an image memory occurs due to differences in the toner amounts per unit area between the new and previous toner layers on the developing roller as well as in the quantities of charge in the toner. This problem is caused by difficulty in achieving the two directly-opposed functions that, while a new toner is being supplied from the transporting roller to the developing roller, residual toner on the developing roller after the developing process has to be recovered by the developer on the transporting roller, at an area close to the transporting roller and the developing roller. In the case when the toner supply is preferentially set so as to provide high quality images, high speed and the like of the apparatus, the occurrence of image memory becomes particularly conspicuous. For example, in an attempt to meet the recent trend of high charge quantity per unit mass so as to achieve a small size of the toner and also meet demands in the market for high quality image, when the adhering strength (mirror image strength) to the developing roller is increased, or when the toner amount of supply to the developing area per unit time is increased so as to meet the demands for high speed, the recovering property is lowered, with the result that the occurrence of image memory tends to become conspicuous. In contrast, when the toner supply is insufficient, the image density consequently becomes insufficient.","The present invention is to provide a hybrid developing device and an image-forming apparatus that can produce images in which a sufficient image density is achieved and the occurrence of image memory is sufficiently prevented, for a long period.","The present invention relates to a developing device, which visualizes an electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image-supporting member by using a developer containing a toner and a carrier, and comprises:","a developer that contains a toner and a carrier so that the toner is charged to a first polarity, while the carrier is charged to a second polarity that is different from the first polarity, by mutual frictional contact between the toner and the carrier;","a first transporting member placed at an opening portion of a developer vessel used for housing the developer;","a second transporting member that faces the first transporting member with a first area interposed therebetween, and also faces an electrostatic latent image-supporting member with a second area interposed therebetween;","a first electric-field-forming unit used for forming a first electric field between the first transporting member and the second transporting member so that the toner in the developer held by the first transporting member is transferred onto the second transporting member; and","a second electric-field-forming unit used for forming a second electric field between the second transporting member and the electrostatic latent image-supporting member so that the toner held by the second transporting member is transferred onto the electrostatic latent image on the electrostatic latent image-supporting member to visualize the electrostatic latent image,","wherein the first electric field, formed between the first transporting member and the second transporting member, includes at least an ac electric field, and the second transporting member has a surface that is charged to the same polarity as the charged polarity of the toner by friction-contact with the carrier, and a volume resistance value of 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710(\u03a9), and","an image-forming apparatus equipped with the developing device.","A developing device of the present invention is a developing device, which visualizes an electrostatic latent image on an electrostatic latent image-supporting member by using a developer containing a toner and a carrier, and comprises:","a developer that contains a toner and a carrier so that the toner is charged to a first polarity, while the carrier is charged to a second polarity that is different from the first polarity, by mutual frictional contact between the toner and the carrier;","a first transporting member placed at an opening portion of a developer vessel used for housing the developer;","a second transporting member that faces the first transporting member with a first area interposed therebetween, and also faces an electrostatic latent image-supporting member with a second area interposed therebetween;","a first electric-field-forming unit used for forming a first electric field between the first transporting member and the second transporting member so that the toner in the developer held by the first transporting member is transferred onto the second transporting member; and","a second electric-field-forming unit used for forming a second electric field between the second transporting member and the electrostatic latent image-supporting member so that the toner held by the second transporting member is transferred onto the electrostatic latent image on the electrostatic latent image-supporting member to visualize the electrostatic latent image,","wherein the first electric field, formed between the first transporting member and the second transporting member, includes at least an ac electric field, and the second transporting member has a surface that is charged to the same polarity as the charged polarity of the toner by friction-contact with the carrier, and a volume resistance value of 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710(\u03a9).","An image-forming apparatus of the present invention comprises the above-mentioned developing device.","In the hybrid developing device of the present invention, the second transporting member is provided with a surface that is charged to the same polarity as the toner charged polarity when the toner and the carrier are made in friction-contact with each other, due to frictional contact with the carrier, and also has a specific resistance value. With this arrangement, since the carrier to be charged to a specific polarity by the frictional contact with the toner is further effectively charged to the corresponding polarity also by the frictional contact with the surface of the second transporting member, the carrier charge quantity at the time of toner recovery is increased. At this time, a first electric field including an ac electric field is formed between the first transporting member and the second transporting member, the carrier is allowed to further effectively recover the toner by an electrostatic force at the time of toner recovery, and the carrier is allowed to supply a sufficient amount of toner at the time of toner supply. For these reasons, it is possible to provide images in which a sufficient image density is achieved and the occurrence of image memory is sufficiently prevented, for a long period. These effects are also efficiently exerted even when the image-forming apparatus is prepared as a high-speed machine, when a small-size toner is used so as to achieve high-precision images, or when the image-forming apparatus is operated under a low-moisture environment.","Referring to the attached drawings, the following description will discuss preferred embodiments of the present invention. In the following description, terms indicating specific directions (for example, \u201cup\u201d, \u201cdown\u201d, \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d and other terms including these, as well as \u201cclockwise\u201d and \u201ccounterclockwise\u201d) are used; however, these terms are used only for easiness of understanding of the present invention by reference to the drawings, and the present invention is not intended to be interpreted in a limited manner by the meanings of these terms.

In the present embodiment, the charging device  is shown as a roller having a cylindrical shape; however, instead of this, a charging device of another mode (for example, a brush-type charging device of a rotation type or a fixed type, or a wire discharging-type charging device) may be used. The exposing station  is provided with a passage  that allows imaging light , emitted from an exposing device  placed near the photosensitive member  or at a position apart from the photosensitive member , to proceed toward the outer circumferential face of the charged photosensitive member . On the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member  that has passed through the exposing station , an electrostatic latent image, which is made of portions where the electric potential has been decayed by the imaging light projected thereto and portions where the charged electric potential has been virtually maintained, is formed. In the present embodiment, the portions having the decayed electric potential correspond to an electrostatic latent image portion, and the portions that virtually maintain the charged electric potential correspond to an electrostatic latent image non-image portion. The developing station  has a developing device  that visualizes the electrostatic latent image by using a powder developer. The developing device  will be described later in detail. The transferring station  is provided with a transferring device  that transfers the visible image formed on the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member  onto a sheet  such as paper and a film. In the present embodiment, the transferring member  is shown as a roller having a cylindrical shape; however, a transferring device of another mode (for example, wire discharging-type transferring device) may be used. The cleaning station  is provided with a cleaning device  that recovers untransferred toner remaining on the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member , without having been transferred onto the sheet  in the transferring station , from the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member . In the present embodiment, the cleaning device  is shown as a plate-shaped blade; however, instead of this, a cleaning device of another mode (for example, a rotation-type or fixed brush-type cleaning device) may be used.","Upon forming an image by using the image-forming device  with this structure, the photosensitive member  rotates clockwise by the driving operation of the motor (not shown). At this time, the outer circumferential portion of the photosensitive member that has passed through the charging station  is charged by the charging device  to a predetermined electric potential. The charged outer circumferential portion of the photosensitive member is exposed by the imaging light  in the exposing station  so that an electrostatic latent image is formed. The electrostatic latent image is transported to the developing station  together with the rotation of the photosensitive member , and visualized therein by the developing device  as a developer image. The developer image thus visualized is transported to the transferring station  together with the rotation of the photosensitive member , and then transferred onto a sheet  by the transferring device . The sheet  on which the developer image has been transferred, is transported to a fixing station, not shown, where the developer image is fixed onto sheet . The outer circumferential portion of the photosensitive member that has passed through the transferring station  is then transported to the cleaning station  where the developer that remains on the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member  without being transferred onto the sheet  is recovered.","Developing Device","The developing device  is provided with a developing vessel (housing)  that houses a two-component developing agent  containing a toner and a carrier as well as various members, which will be described below. For easiness of understanding of the present invention, one portion of the developing vessel  is omitted so as to simplify the drawings. The developing vessel  is provided with a series of opening portions (, ) that are opened toward the photosensitive member , and a developing roller  serving as a toner transporting member (second transporting member) is placed in a space  formed near the opening portion . This developing roller , which is a cylindrical member (second rotation cylindrical member), is rotatably placed in parallel with the photosensitive member , with a predetermined developing gap  interposed relative to the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member .","In the present invention, the developing roller  has a surface that is charged to the same polarity as the charged polarity of the toner upon frictional contact between the toner and the carrier, by a frictional contact with the carrier. From the viewpoint of preventing fogging due to the generation of a reversely charged toner, the developing roller  is preferably provided with a surface that causes hardly any exchange of charges, even when made in frictional contact with the toner. The expression that \u201ccauses hardly any exchange of charges\u201d indicates that, at least, apparently, there is little change in the quantity of charge due to exchanges of charges.","For example, in the case when a toner to be charged to negative polarity by frictional contact with the carrier is used, the developing roller is prepared as one having a surface layer to be charged to the negative polarity by frictional contact with the carrier, and such a roller that has a surface layer that causes hardly any exchange of charges upon frictional contact with the toner is used as a desirable developing roller. Examples of such a negatively chargeable surface layer include a negatively chargeable organic layer made of a fluorine-containing resin and a negatively chargeable inorganic layer made of silicon fluoride glass. Not particularly limited as long as it is a polymer containing fluorine atoms, examples of the fluorine-containing resin include a fluorine-containing olefin resin, a fluorine-containing acrylic resin and the like.","Specific examples of the fluorine-containing olefin resin include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride and the like. Polytetrafluoroethylene is available as PTFE851-212 made by DuPont Corp.","Specific examples of the fluorine-containing acrylic resin include polymethacrylate fluoride and the like.","The negatively chargeable organic layer may contain a negative-charge controlling agent that is charged to the negative polarity when made in contact with the carrier. A negative-charge controlling agent, which will be exemplified in the following description of charged-particles, may be used. When the negative-charge controlling agent is contained in the negatively chargeable organic layer, the constituent resin of the organic layer is not limited by the above-mentioned fluorine-containing resin or the like, and another resin, such as polyester, epoxy resin and styrene-methacrylate ester copolymer, may be used.","From the viewpoint of easiness of production, the negatively chargeable surface layer is preferably prepared as an organic layer, and from the viewpoint of effectively suppressing the consumption of the charged-particles, an organic layer made from a fluorine-containing silicone resin, in particular, made of PTFE, is preferably used.","Preferable combinations of a resin forming the negatively chargeable surface layer, a resin forming the carrier (positively chargeable) and a binder resin forming the negatively chargeable toner are described as follows:","(Negatively chargeable surface layer-Carrier-Negatively chargeable toner)","(Fluorine Resin-Acrylic Resin-Styrene Acrylic Resin)","(Polymeric polyethylene resin-Acrylic resin-Styrene acrylic resin)","(Fluorine Resin-Silicone Resin-Styrene Acrylic Resin)","For example, in the case when a toner that is positively charged when made in frictional contact with the carrier is used, the developing roller is prepared as one having a surface layer to be charged to the positive polarity by frictional contact with the carrier, and such a roller that has a surface layer that causes hardly any exchange of charges upon frictional contact with the toner is used as a desirable developing roller. Examples of such a positively chargeable surface layer include a positively chargeable organic layer made of a nitrogen-containing resin and a positively chargeable inorganic layer made of strontium titanate, barium titanate and alumina.

A positive-charge controlling agent, which will be exemplified in the following description of charged-particles may be used. When the positive-charge controlling agent is contained in the positively chargeable organic layer, the constituent resin of the organic layer is not limited by the above-mentioned nitrogen-containing resin or the like, and another resin, such as styrene-methacrylate copolymer and epoxy resin, may be used.","From the viewpoint of easiness of production, the positively chargeable surface layer is preferably prepared as an organic layer, and from the viewpoint of effectively suppressing the consumption of the charged-particles, an organic layer, made of a nitrogen-containing silicone resin, a nitrogen-containing acrylic resin, or polyimide, in particular, an organic layer, made of an amino-modified silicone resin indicated by the above-mentioned formula (I), a polyamino acrylate resin indicated by the above-mentioned formula (II), or polyimide, is preferably used.","Preferable combinations of a resin forming the positively chargeable surface layer, a resin forming the carrier (negatively chargeable) and a binder resin forming the positively chargeable toner are described as follows:","(Positively chargeable surface layer-Carrier-Positively chargeable toner)","(Polyamide Resin-Acrylic Resin-Styrene Acrylic Resin)","The organic layer can be produced by processes in which a predetermined resin is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is applied onto the surface of a predetermined aluminum pipe or stainless (SUS) pipe to be dried thereon. When a resin such as PTFE that hardly dissolves in a solvent is used, the resin in an emulsion state may be used, and after the coating process, the resulting layer is baked so that the organic layer is produced.","The inorganic layer can be produced by using a predetermined inorganic substance and by carrying out a vapor deposition method or the like thereon.","The developing roller  has a volume resistance value of 1\u00d710to 1\u00d710(\u03a9), preferably 5\u00d710to 5\u00d710(\u03a9). When the resistance value is too low, the quantity of charge (quantity of transferred charge) becomes smaller upon allowing the carrier to charge through friction between the developing roller  and the carrier, with the result that the recovery of toner on the developing roller  after a developing process becomes insufficient to cause an image memory. When the resistance value is too high, the effective value of a toner supplying electric field to be formed between the developing roller  and the developer transporting member is lowered due to an increase in the quantity of surface charge of the developing roller  caused by friction between the developing roller  and the carrier, with the result that an insufficient quantity of transported toner onto the developing roller  occurs upon carrying out endurance printing processes, and the image density is consequently lowered.","The resistance value of the developing roller can be found by using a HIRESTA\u00ae made by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp., so that volume resistance measurements between the metal shaft portion of the developing roller and the electrode made in contact with the surface layer are carried out. In this case, however, the measuring device is not particularly limited by this, as long as the same principle is applied.","Although not particularly limited as long as the object of the present invention can be achieved, the thickness of the surface layer possessed by the developing roller  is preferably set in a range from 10 to 50 \u03bcm, from the viewpoints of ensuring the memory erasing effect during the service life of the developing device and of more effectively preventing a reduction of image density.","Another space  serving as an opening portion is formed behind the developing roller . In this space , a transporting roller  serving as a developer transporting member (first transporting member) is disposed in parallel with the developing roller , with a predetermined supply\/recovery gap  being interposed between it and the outer circumferential face of the developing roller . The transporting roller  is provided with a magnet member  secured thereto so as not to rotate, and a cylindrical sleeve  (first rotation cylindrical member) supported so as to rotate around the periphery of the magnet member . Above the sleeve , a regulating blade , which is fixed to the developer vessel , and extends in parallel with the center axis of the sleeve , is placed face to face therewith, with a predetermined regulating gap  interposed therebetween.","The magnet member  has a plurality of magnetic poles that are aligned face to face with the inner face of the transporting roller , and extended in the center axis direction of the transporting roller . In the present embodiment, the magnetic poles include a magnetic pole S that faces the upper inner circumferential portion of the transporting roller  located near the regulating blade , a magnetic pole N that faces the inner circumferential portion on the left side of the transporting roller  located near the supply\/recover gap , a magnetic pole S that faces the lower inner circumferential portion of the transporting roller , and two adjacent magnetic poles N and N having the same polarity that face the inner circumferential portion on the right side of the transporting roller .","A developer stirring chamber  is formed behind the transporting roller . The stirring chamber  is provided with a front chamber  formed near the transporting roller  and a rear chamber  apart from the transporting roller . A front screw , which serves as a front stirring transport member that transports the developer from the surface of the drawing toward the rear face thereof while stirring the developer, is placed in the front chamber  so as to rotate therein, and a rear screw , which serves as a rear stirring transport member that transports the developer from the rear face of the drawing toward the surface thereof while stirring the developer, is placed in the rear chamber  so as to rotate therein. As shown in the Figure, the front chamber  and the rear chamber  may be separated by a partition wall  placed between the two chambers. In this case, a partition wall portion located near the two ends of the front chamber  and the rear chamber  is removed to form a communication passage so that the developer that has reached the end portion on the downstream side of the front chamber  is sent to the rear chamber  through the communication passage, while the developer that has reached the end portion on the downstream side of the rear chamber  is sent to the front chamber  through the communication passage.","The following description will discuss operations of the developing device  structured as described above. Upon forming an image, the developing roller  and the sleeve , driven by motors not shown, are allowed to rotate respectively in directions of arrows  and . The front screw  rotates in a direction of arrow , while the rear screw  rotates in a direction of arrow . Consequently, the developer , housed in the developer stirring chamber , is stirred, while being transported and circulated between the front chamber  and the rear chamber . As a result, the toner and carrier contained in the developer are made friction-contact with each other to be charged to respectively reversed polarities. In the present embodiment, it is defined that the carrier is charged to the positive polarity and that the toner is charged to the negative polarity. Since the carrier particle is considerably large in comparison with the toner particle, the toner particles negatively charged are allowed to adhere to the periphery of each of the carrier particles positively charged, mainly through an electrical suction force exerted between the two particles.","The developer , thus charged, is supplied to the transporting roller , while being transported through the front chamber  by the front screw . The developer , supplied onto the transporting roller  from the screw , is held onto the outer circumferential face of the sleeve  near the magnetic pole N by the magnetic force of the magnetic pole N. The developer , held on the sleeve , forms a magnetic brush along lines of magnetic forces formed by the magnet member , and is transported counterclockwise due to the rotation of the sleeve . The developer , held by the magnetic pole S on an opposing area (regulating area ) to the regulating blade , is regulated by the regulating blade  so that the amount thereof to be allowed to pass through the regulating gap  is regulated to a predetermined amount. The developer  that has passed through the regulating gap  is transported to an area (supply\/recover area)  opposing to the magnetic pole N, where the developing roller  and the transporting roller  are made face to face with each other. Mainly at an area (supply area)  on the upstream side of the supply\/recovery area  relative to the rotation direction of the sleeve , the toner adhering to the carrier is electrically supplied to the developing roller  due to the presence of the first electric field formed between the developing roller  and the sleeve . Mainly at an area (recovery area)  on the down stream side of the supply\/recovery area  relative to the rotation direction of the sleeve , toner on the developing roller  that has not been consumed by the developing and has been returned to the supply\/recovery area  is scraped by the magnetic brush formed along the lines of magnetic forces of the magnetic pole N, and recovered by the sleeve .  is an enlarged schematic view showing the supply area  and the recovery area  in . More specifically, as shown in , the carrier  is held on the outer circumferential face of the sleeve  by a magnetic force of the magnet member , and is transported to the supply area  by the rotation movement of the sleeve , with the toner  being held thereon, so that the toner  is supplied to the developing roller  by a first electric field, which will be described later, in detail. Thereafter, the carrier  is charged to the reversed polarity to the toner charged polarity on the developing roller , by a frictional contact with the developing roller  having the above-mentioned surface so that, by a Coulomb force exerted between the toner charge and the carrier charge, the separation of the toner from the developing roller  is accelerated and the residual toner is sufficiently recovered in the recovery area  by the first electric field. The carrier, which is held onto the outer circumferential face of the sleeve  by the magnetic force of the magnet member , is not transferred to the developing roller  from the sleeve . The developer , which has passed through the supply\/recovery area , is held by the magnetic force of the magnet member  so that, when having reached the opposing area (releasing area ) between the magnetic poles N and N after having passed through the opposing portion to the magnetic pole S along with the rotation of the sleeve , the developer  is released from the outer circumferential face of the sleeve  toward the front chamber  by its own gravity, at an area with no magnetic force being exerted between N and N, and mixed with the developer  that is being transported through the front chamber .","The toner , held by the developing roller  at the supply area , is transported counterclockwise along with the rotation of the developing roller  so that, at an area (developing area)  where the photosensitive member  and the developing roller  are made face to face with each other, the toner  is allowed to adhere to an electrostatic latent image portion formed on the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member . In an image-forming apparatus of the present embodiment, a predetermined electric potential Vof the negative polarity is applied to the outer circumferential face of the photosensitive member  at the charging device , and by means of the exposing device , the electrostatic latent image portion to which imaging light  has been projected is decayed to a predetermined electric potential V, while the electrostatic latent image non-image portion to which no imaging light  has been projected by the exposing device  is allowed to maintain virtually the charged electric potential V. Therefore, in the developing area , the toner  charged to the negative polarity is allowed to adhere to the electrostatic latent image portion by a function of an electric field formed between the photosensitive member  and the developing roller , so that this electrostatic latent image is visualized as a developer image.","When the toner  has been consumed from the developer  in this manner, it is preferable to supply toner at an amount corresponding to the consumed amount to the developer . For this reason, the developing device  is provided with a means used for measuring a mixed ratio between the toner and the carrier housed in the developing vessel . A toner supplying unit  is placed above the rear chamber . The toner supplying unit  has a container  used for housing the toner. An opening portion  is formed on the bottom portion of the container , and a supplying roller  is placed on this opening portion . The supplying roller  is connected to a motor, not shown, so as to be driven, and the motor is driven based upon an output of the means for measuring the mixed ratio of the toner and carrier so that the toner is allowed to drop and supplied to the rear chamber . In the present invention, since the consumption of the charging particles can be sufficiently suppressed, the supply toner can be set in a manner so as to reduce the rate of the charged-particles in comparison with the rate of content of the charging particles to the toner in the developer that has been first charged.","In the present invention, as shown in , at an opposing portion to the transporting roller  inside the developing roller , a magnet, which has the magnetic pole different from the magnetic pole placed at an opposing portion to the developing roller  inside the transporting roller , is desirably placed. With this arrangement, after the toner supply at the supply area , the carrier is effectively made in friction-contact with the surface of the developing roller  so that residual toner can be more effectively recovered in the recovery area . In , the magnetic pole to be placed at the opposing portion to the developing roller  inside the transporting roller  is the N pole, and the magnetic pole to be placed at the opposing portion to the transporting roller  inside the developing roller  is the S pole; however, not limited to this structure, when the magnetic pole to be placed at the opposing portion to the developing roller  inside the transporting roller  is the S pole, the magnetic pole to be placed at the opposing portion to the transporting roller  inside the developing roller  is set to the N pole.","Electric-Field Forming Unit","In order to efficiently transfer the toner  from the transporting roller  to the developing roller  in the supply area  and also to efficiently transfer the toner  from the developing roller  to the transporting roller  in the recovery area , a first electric field is formed between the developing roller  and the transporting roller  by the first power supply for the developing roller and the second power supply for the transporting roller that serve as a first electric-field-forming unit .","The first electric field includes at least an ac electric field, and is normally prepared as a composite electric field composed of an ac electric field and a dc electric field.
