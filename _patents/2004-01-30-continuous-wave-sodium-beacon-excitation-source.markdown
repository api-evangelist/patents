title: Continuous wave sodium beacon excitation source
abstract: 1064-nm and 1319-nm light respectively generated by two lasers is combined and injected into a doubly resonant sum-frequency generator. The optical path length of the sum-frequency generator is adjusted responsive to feedback of the 1319-nm light to maintain 1319-nm resonance. Feedback of 1064-nm light is concurrently used to adjust the 1064-nm laser responsive to the optical path length to maintain 1064-nm resonance. Light output from the sum-frequency generator is compared to the sodium Dwavelength i.e., approximately 589 nm, and the 1319-nm laser is responsively adjusted to eliminate any differential. This abstract is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract, and is intended to allow a searcher or other reader to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The conditions under which this invention was made entitle the Government of the United States, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, to the entire right, title and interest therein, including foreign rights, pursuant to paragraph I(a) of Executive Order 10096.","This invention relates to lasers and nonlinear optics and, more particularly, uses several laser beams in conjunction with sum-frequency generation to produce a high-power beam having a desired wavelength, e.g., the sodium Dspectral line.","The earth's atmosphere distorts light traveling through it because of time and spatially varying fluctuations in its refractive index. Such distortion limits the resolution of terrestrial telescopes, and was the motivation for launching the successful, but very expensive, Hubble telescope into earth orbit. However, ground-based telescopes can achieve a resolution surpassing that of the Hubble space telescope by means of adaptive optics, a technique whereby the surface of a deformable telescope mirror is changed as a function of time to compensate for atmospheric distortion.","Measuring the distortion requires that there be a bright optical source in the sky, such as a bright star, located close to the object to be observed. Since natural stars of sufficient brightness are too rare to permit compensated imaging except over a tiny fraction of the sky, an alternative is to produce one or more artificial guide stars by means of back-scattered light from a laser beam or similar source of coherent radiation directed from the site of the telescope into the area of the sky proximate to the object to be observed. Such guide stars can be produced by exciting resonance fluorescence at a 589-nm wavelength, i.e., at the sodium Dspectral line, from a layer of sodium atoms that circumscribes the earth in the mesosphere at an altitude of approximately 90 km.","Although high-power dye lasers can be operated at this wavelength to excite the sodium layer, they are inefficient, bulky, expensive, and use chemicals which are toxic and which degrade over time, concomitantly resulting in degradation of performance. The desirability of an all-solid-state sodium beacon excitation source has long been recognized. W. Happer, G. J. MacDonald, C. E. Max, and F. J. Dyson, \u201cAtmospheric-turbulence compensation by resonant optical backscattering from the sodium layer in the upper atmosphere,\u201d , Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 263\u2013276 (January 1994). However, the goal of building a reliable and efficient device that generates sufficient power with good beam quality has been elusive, despite over a decade of endeavor.","By a natural coincidence, sodium resonance radiation at \u03bb=589 nm can be produced by sum-frequency generation of the Nd:YAG laser lines at \u03bb=1064 nm and \u03bb=1319 nm. This has motivated the development of pulsed sources using single-pass sum-frequency generation in lithium triborate (LiBO). T. Jeys and V. Daneu, \u201cDiode-pumped, Nd:YAG source of sodium-resonance radiation for atmospheric adaptive optics,\u201d , Garching, Germany (Jun. 23\u201326, 1997); and a low-power continuous-wave source using doubly resonant sum-frequency generation in lithium niobate (LiNbO). J. D. Vance, C.-Y. She, and H. Moosmuller, \u201cContinuous-wave, all-solid-state, single frequency 400-mW source at 589 nm based on doubly resonant sum-frequency mixing in a monolithic lithium niobate resonator,\u201d , Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 4891\u20134896 (Jul. 20, 1998). The pulsed sources have proved too unreliable for use in conjunction with adaptive optics, whereas absorption in lithium niobate precludes the generation of high power in this crystal.","Various theoretical studies have been completed comparing the efficiency of different pulse formats, including continuous wave. J. M. Telle, P. W. Milonni, and P. D. Hillman, \u201cComparison of pump-laser characteristics for producing a mesospheric sodium guidestar for adaptive optical systems on large aperture telescopes,\u201d in -, S. Basu, Editor, , Vol. 3264, pp. 37\u201342 (January 1998).","The advantages of continuous wave are high duty cycle and narrow bandwidth. Both effects enhance the sodium fluorescence return, as long as saturation is avoided. Continuous wave sources have been used, but have only been able to generate low beam power, i.e., power too low for astronomical imaging using adaptive optics to correct atmospheric distortion.","It follows that there is a need in the art for a terrestrial apparatus capable of generating an artificial guide star by means of back-scattered light from a laser beam or similar source of coherent radiation and, more particularly, by creating such a guide star by exciting resonance fluorescence from a layer of sodium atoms that circumscribes the earth in the mesosphere. The present invention has fulfilled this need in the art.","Briefly, the invention is comprised of an injection-locked 1064-nm laser, an injection-locked 1319-nm laser, a doubly resonant sum-frequency generator (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSFG\u201d), and a heated sodium-vapor cell for measuring Doppler-free fluorescence. Each of the injection-locked lasers includes a single-frequency high-power ring oscillator containing a pair of Brewster-cut Nd:YAG rods. The ring oscillators are respectively injection locked by low power, single-frequency, linearly-polarized lasers using the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique, and are unidirectional when so injection-locked. Resonance of the respective laser frequencies in the oscillators is maintained by electronic feedback servo circuitry.","The 1064-nm and 1319-nm light, respectively generated by the two injection-locked lasers, is combined by a dichroic mirror and, after being mode matched, is injected into the SFG comprised of a bowtie resonator that includes a lithium triborate (LiBO) crystal for generating 589-nm light and a scraper mirror for extracting the 589-nm light.","The optical path length of the SFG is adjusted responsive to feedback of the 1319-nm light to maintain 1319-nm resonance. Feedback of 1064-nm light is concurrently used to adjust the 1064-nm low-power laser responsive to the foregoing changes in the SFG optical path length, to maintain 1064-nm resonance in the SFG.","The extracted 589-nm light is directed towards the desired celestial area. It has the wavelength and power required to generate sodium Dfluorescence in the mesospheric sodium layer. A small portion of the 589-nm light is directed through the heated sodium-vapor cell, where Doppler-free spectral features of the sodium fluorescence are detected. The 1319-nm low-power laser is responsively adjusted, either manually or by an automatic mechanism, to maintain the output from the SFG at the desired sodium Dwavelength, i.e., approximately 589.159 nm. The spectral linewidth of the extracted 589-nm light is of the order of 10 kHz, much narrower than the 1 GHz spectral linewidth of atmospheric Dresonance and the 10 MHz spectral linewidth of Doppler-free Dresonance.","Another embodiment employs an additional 1064-nm low-power laser. One of the two 1064-nm low-power lasers is tuned such that the light output from the SFG has a wavelength at the center of the sodium Dspectral line, while the other low-power laser is detuned such that the output from the SFG has a wavelength slightly off of the spectral line. The two light beams are oriented with orthogonal polarization states and then co-axially combined.","An electro-optic polarization rotator switches between the two beams and only the selected beam proceeds through the remainder of the apparatus, as previously described. Where the selected beam is the one at the sodium Dspectral line, the mesospheric sodium layer becomes fluorescent, while no fluorescence is produced when the other beam is selected. This allows the Rayleigh background light from the lower atmosphere to be measured and subtracted from the fluorescence of the mesospheric guide star.","Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"4"},"Excitation source  is comprised of four interconnected modules, modules , ,  and . Module  comprises a 1064-nm injection-locked laser. Module  includes laser , which produces a low-power, single frequency, linearly polarized, continuous-wave 1064-nm beam. The wavelength of laser  can be adjusted over a limited range. Lightwave Electronics Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., manufactures a device of this type. As will be explained in conjunction with the subsequent discussion of module , doubly resonant SFG  generates 589-nm light and servo amplifier  electronically adjusts the frequency of laser  to maintain locking of the 1064-nm light to SFG .","It is also to be noted that the wavelengths mentioned herein, i.e., 1064, 589, and 1319 nm, are approximations accurate to 1 nm. As will become clear, the respective wavelengths output by the described optical elements are controlled to a resolution better than 5\u00d710nm during the operation of the invention by virtue of feedback loops that enable the invention ultimately to generate a high-power laser beam having the precise wavelength and stability that is desired.","The 1064-nm light from laser  passes through Faraday isolator  to prevent light from counter-propagating back into laser . The light then passes through half-wave plate , which rotates the polarization direction; through mode-matching lens ; and then through electro-optic radio frequency phase modulator .","Local oscillator  produces an 18 MHz sine-wave voltage, which is applied to phase modulator  to produce phase sidebands on the 1064-nm light. These sidebands are used for Pound-Drever-Hall locking of 1064-nm high-power ring oscillator  to laser , and also for locking the output of module  to SFG . Input coupler  for ring oscillator  and input coupler  of SFG  reflect the phase sidebands because the sidebands are not resonant with either ring oscillator  or SFG  while the foregoing two components are locked onto the resonance of the wavelength of laser . The voltage from the local oscillator  is also applied to mixer  in module  and mixer  in module .","After traversing Faraday isolator , half-wave plate , mode-matching lens , and turning mirrors , the low-power 1064-nm beam from laser  passes through the partially transmitting input coupler  and is injected into ring oscillator . The reflective surfaces of input coupler  and mirrors  and  of ring oscillator  are flat. Mirrors  and  are highly reflective at 1064 nm. Mirror  is mounted on piezoelectric transducer . The latter element is capable of translating mirror  to adjust the length of the optical path of ring oscillator .","Piezoelectric transducer  is driven by servo amplifier , which in turn is controlled by the zero-crossing error voltage output of mixer . Servo amplifier  includes proportional-integral analog circuitry to supply proper negative feedback to piezoelectric transducer , and provides gain roll-off and phase margin sufficient to avoid exciting the first mechanical resonance of piezoelectric transducer .","Ring oscillator  also includes intracavity concave lenses  and Nd:YAG rods . A combination of focusing by lenses  and thermal lensing in rods  obtains a stable cavity. Rods  are cut at the Brewster angle, helping to ensure linearly polarized operation of ring oscillator . Diode arrays (not shown) pump rods  transversely.","The high-power output of ring oscillator  is transmitted through input coupler , whereupon it joins the phase sidebands reflected from input coupler . The output and sidebands then pass through polarizing beam splitter  to enhance the degree of linear polarization over that obtainable from ring oscillator  alone. A small fraction of the beam power is reflected from beam splitter  and impinges on light detector . The radio frequency output of light detector  is applied to mixer , where it is mixed in quadrature with the signal from local oscillator , i.e., a 90\u00b0 phase difference between the radio frequency input from  and the signal from local oscillator , to produce the input to servo amplifier .","The output of mixer  is generated using the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique, a laser frequency stabilization technique well known to those skilled in optics. The output of servo amplifier  is applied to piezoelectric transducer , which adjusts the optical path length of ring oscillator  to maintain resonance in the cavity, i.e., the cavity optical path length must be an integral number of light wavelengths. The resonance of ring oscillator  with respect to the output of laser  maintained by means of the aforementioned feedback loop causes the former to lase unidirectionally at the central frequency of the 1064-nm beam emanating from laser . In this regime of operation, ring oscillator  is said to be injection locked to the output of laser .","Module  comprises a 1319-nm injection-locked laser. Module  includes laser , which produces a low-power, single-frequency, linearly polarized, continuous-wave 1319-nm laser beam. Lightwave Electronics Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., manufactures such a device. The wavelength of laser  can be adjusted over a limited range. The low-power light from  passes through Faraday isolator  to prevent light from counter-propagating back into laser . The 1319-nm light then passes through half-wave plate , which rotates the polarization direction, through mode-matching lens , and then through an electro-optic radio frequency phase modulator .","Local oscillator  generates a 21 MHz sine-wave voltage, which is applied to phase modulator  to produce phase sidebands on the 1319-nm light. These sidebands are used for Pound-Drever-Hall locking of 1319 nm high-power ring oscillator  to laser , and also for locking SFG  to the output of module . Input coupler  for oscillator  and input coupler  of SFG  reflect the sidebands because the sidebands are not resonant with either ring oscillator  or SFG  while the foregoing two components are locked onto the resonance of the wavelength of laser . The voltage from local oscillator  also is applied to mixer  of module  and mixer  in module . After traversing Faraday isolator , half-wave plate , mode-matching lens , and turning mirrors , the low power 1319-nm beam from laser  passes through partially transmitting input coupler  and is injected into ring oscillator .","Mirrors  and  of the cavity for ring oscillator  are highly reflective at 1319 nm. The reflective surfaces of input coupler  and mirrors  and  are flat. Input coupler  and mirrors  and  are specially coated to reflect light at 1319 nm, and to be highly transmissive at 1064 nm to prevent lasing at the latter wavelength. Mirror  is mounted on piezoelectric transducer . The latter element is capable of translating mirror  to adjust the cavity optical path length.","Piezoelectric transducer  is driven by servo amplifier , which is in turn controlled by the zero-crossing error voltage output of mixer . Servo amplifier  includes proportional-integral analog circuitry to supply proper negative feedback to piezoelectric transducer , and provides gain roll-off and phase margin sufficient to avoid exciting the first mechanical resonance of piezoelectric transducer . Ring oscillator  also includes intracavity lenses  and Nd:YAG rods . A combination of focusing by lenses  and thermal lensing in rods  is used to obtain a stable cavity. Diode arrays (not shown) pump rods  transversely.","Ring oscillators  and  are each an example of a power oscillator to be frequency-locked to lasers  and , respectively. Each of ring oscillators  and  could be replaced by a ring oscillator having a number of rods other than two, or by a power oscillator having a completely different configuration, e.g., a Nd:YAG slab or fiber.","The high-power output of ring oscillator  is transmitted through input coupler , whereupon it joins the phase sidebands reflected from input coupler . The output and sidebands then pass through polarizing beam splitter  to enhance the degree of linear polarization over that obtainable from ring oscillator  alone.","A small fraction of the beam power is reflected from beam splitter  and impinges on light detector . The radio-frequency output of detector  is applied to mixer , where it is mixed in quadrature with the signal from local oscillator  to produce the input to servo amplifier . The output of mixer  is obtained by using the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique.","The output of servo amplifier  is applied to piezoelectric transducer , which adjusts the optical path length of ring oscillator  to maintain resonance in the cavity. The resonance of ring oscillator  with respect to the output of laser  maintained by means of the aforementioned feedback loop causes the former to lase unidirectionally at the central frequency of the 1319-nm beam emanating from laser . In this regime of operation, ring oscillator  is said to be injection locked to the output of laser .","Alternatively, high-power amplifiers could be used to increase the low power of lasers  and , instead of high-power ring oscillators  and , respectively. Such an alternative embodiment would not require internal feedback loops using beam splitter , light detector , mixer  and servo amplifier , with respect to ring oscillator ; or beam splitter , light detector , mixer  and servo amplifier , with respect to ring oscillator . Another embodiment of the invention would involve respectively replacing modules  and  with high-power single-frequency lasers. Each of the high-power lasers would have to be frequency controllable.","Turning to module , each of the infrared beams from modules  and  pass through convex mode-matching lenses , half-wave plates  and polarization beam splitters , to allow independent adjustment of the power of the infrared beams ultimately impinging on SFG . The 1064-nm beam emanating from module  is reflected onto this path by turning mirrors , and after traversing the aforementioned optical elements it impinges on dichroic mirror . The 1319-nm beam emanating from module  is reflected by turning mirror  to impinge on dichroic mirror  after traversing a separate set of the aforementioned optical elements having optical properties appropriate to the 1319-nm wavelength, i.e., appropriate anti-reflection coatings and an appropriate design for half-wave plate . The two beams respectively impinge on opposite surfaces of dichroic mirror , with the two surfaces being respectively coated to reflect the 1064-nm beam and transmit the 1319-nm beam, thus combining them into a single co-axial beam.","Doubly resonant SFG  consists of two highly reflective concave mirrors , lithium triborate (LiBO) crystal , flat input coupler  which partially transmits both 1064-nm and 1319-nm light, and flat highly reflective mirror  mounted on piezoelectric transducer . As an example, crystal  is 2 cm long and uses noncritical type-I phase matching. As previously noted, input coupler  reflects the phase sidebands from both the 1064-nm and 1319-nm light because the sidebands are not resonant with SFG  while it is locked onto resonance with the wavelengths (center frequencies) of lasers  and .","The end surfaces of crystal  are anti-reflection coated for wavelengths of 1064 nm, 1319 nm, and 589 nm; thus, the ends transmit light of all three foregoing wavelengths with minimal loss. The fold angle \u2296 of SFG  should be kept as small as possible to minimize aberrations. Moreover, the optimal choice for the reflectivities of input coupler  depends on the available power of the beams produced by the lasers of modules  and .","Scraper mirror  is inserted at the Brewster angle in the resonator between curved mirrors  such that the light in SFG  passes through crystal  before impinging on scraper mirror . Scraper mirror  has a coating on its front surface onto which light is incident, to highly transmit the p-polarized infrared light, i.e., the 1064-nm and 1319-nm light, and highly reflect the s-polarized 589-nm light. This extracts the s-polarized 589-nm light from SFG .","Input coupler  transmits a portion of the infrared light circulating within SFG  and incident on input coupler  from within SFG . This transmitted light, together with the phase sidebands and the portion of the externally incident infrared light at the central frequencies reflected by input coupler , is directed by turning mirror  onto dichroic beam splitter , which separates it into 1064-nm and 1319-nm beams. The 1319-nm beam passes through dichroic beam splitter , reflects off of turning mirror , and passes through half-wave plate  and polarization beam splitter  before impinging on light detector . The angular rotation of half-wave plate  is set so as to reduce the infrared power impinging on detector  to a level that avoids saturating this detector. Polarization beam splitter  shunts the superfluous power to a beam dump (not shown).","Detector  produces a voltage signal based on the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique. Mixer  mixes in quadrature the signal from light detector  with the signal from local oscillator  to produce a zero-crossing error voltage input to servo amplifier . Responsive to the signal from servo amplifier , piezoelectric transducer  translates mirror  to adjust the length of the optical path of SFG  to keep it locked onto resonance with the 1319-nm output of module . Servo amplifier  includes proportional-integral analog circuitry to supply proper negative feedback to piezoelectric transducer , and provides gain roll-off and phase margin sufficient to avoid exciting the first mechanical resonance of piezoelectric transducer .","Dichroic beam splitter  reflects the 1064-nm beam through half-wave plate  and polarization beam splitter , and onto light detector . The angular orientation of half-wave plate  is set so as to reduce the infrared power impinging on detector  to a level that avoids saturating this detector. Polarization beam splitter  shunts the superfluous power to a beam dump (not shown).","Detector  produces a voltage signal based on the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique. Mixer  mixes in quadrature the signal from light detector  with the signal from local oscillator  to produce a zero-crossing error voltage input to servo amplifier .","The wavelength of the 1064-nm light produced by laser  is adjusted responsive to the signal from servo amplifier , to maintain the locked resonance of the output of module  to SFG . Servo amplifier  includes proportional-integral analog circuitry to supply proper negative feedback to a frequency actuating transducer (a piezoelectric element) included within laser , and provides gain roll-off and phase margin sufficient to avoid exciting the first mechanical resonance of the frequency actuating transducer of laser .","An alternative configuration (not shown) eliminates dichroic beam splitter  and instead sends both infrared wavelengths reflected from input coupler  to a single light detector. The signal produced by the single detector is then split and applied to mixers  and , respectively. The optical path length of SFG  and the wavelength of the light emitted by laser  are then adjusted as previously described.","The 589-nm light reflected from scraper mirror  reflects off turning mirrors  and traverses collimating lens  before impinging on beam-splitting mirror . Mirror  reflects most of the light as output light beam  to be directed towards the desired celestial area. Output beam  creates the desired artificial guide star by impinging on the mesospheric sodium layer and exciting the sodium atoms to cause fluorescence. Photon return from the mesosphere is enhanced by converting output beam  to circular polarization before propagating the light to the mesosphere. This conversion can be accomplished by passing output beam  through a quarter-wave plate (not shown).","Using a fold angle \u2296 of 7\u00b0, reflectivities for input coupler  of 0.954 at 1064 nm and 0.925 at 1319 nm, and with the lasers of modules  and  generating power of 24 watts and 15 watts, respectively, the power of output beam  was 22.5 watts of 589-nm light. The beam quality was diffraction limited. Lower reflectivities of input coupler  would be preferable if the power of the infrared beams generated by the lasers of modules  and  were higher. If, in this circumstance, the input coupler reflectivities are lowered this would broaden the infrared resonance bandwidth of SFG  and, consequently, necessitate that the radio frequencies applied to phase modulators  and  be increased so that the phase sidebands would lie well outside the resonance of SFG . Also, the frequencies should be chosen to have a high common multiple to avoid any cross-talk noise in the event that a single light detector for SFG  were to be used.","Beam splitting mirror  transmits the remaining, unreflected portion of the 589-nm light onto turning mirror , whereupon the light beam passes through telescoping and collimating lenses  and into heated sodium-vapor cell . Highly reflective mirror  reflects the light back through cell  in the direction opposite to the direction from which it entered. The counter-propagating beams in cell  produce Doppler-free spectral features in the sodium fluorescence, which are sensed by side-port fluorescence detector . The signal from detector  is used to form a zero-crossing error signal to apply negative feedback to laser . The wavelength of laser  is adjusted responsive to the signal from detector  to stabilize and maintain the 589-nm light of output beam  at the center of the sodium Dspectral line.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["155","5","156","5","156","157","159","161","163","165","167","169","155","6","7","8","4"]},"Lasers  and  are tuned to slightly different wavelengths, such that output beam  generated using one of them is tuned to the center of the sodium Dspectral line, while output beam  generated using the other low-power laser is tuned off of this resonance wavelength so as not to produce an artificial guide star. Half-wave plates  and  are rotated such that the beams from lasers  and  both impinge on polarization beam combiner  with orthogonal linear polarizations.","The combined beam then passes through electro-optic polarization rotator , which, depending on the voltage applied to it, either leaves the polarizations at the two wavelengths unchanged or interchanges them. Electro-optic polarization rotator  switches between the beams from lasers  and  such that only the beam with the selected polarization, i.e., wavelength, proceeds through polarization beam splitter . One of the two emerging beams next passes through lens  to phase modulator , and then on to the remainder of the elements of excitation source , as previously described in conjunction with excitation source .","Switching between these two wavelengths thus switches the fluorescence from the mesospheric guide star on and off, while leaving the Rayleigh scattering from the lower atmosphere essentially unchanged. This allows the Rayleigh background to be subtracted from the fluorescence of the mesospheric guide star. Replacing electro-optic polarization rotator  by a half-wave plate and manually rotating the plate by 45\u00b0 would produce the same switching effect, but the electro-optic switching is much faster.","The intervals when the frequency of output beam  is switched off of the sodium resonance frequency would typically be too brief for the wavelength of laser  to be adjusted responsive to the signal from detector , to maintain the 589-nm light of output beam  at the sodium Dspectral line, i.e., the off interval would be over before laser  could respond by changing its output wavelength. Alternatively, the signal from detector  could be switched off, e.g., by opening or disconnecting the connection from detector  to laser , concurrent with switching output beam  off of the sodium resonance frequency.","To facilitate rapid frequency switching of output beam , rapid switching between lasers  and  is required while maintaining locking to both ring oscillator  and SFG . To ensure such locking, the free spectral ranges of these elements (the speed of light divided by the optical path length) should be commensurate, i.e., the optical path lengths of ring oscillator  and SFG , as well as the difference in frequency between lasers  and , are chosen such that this difference in frequency is an integer multiple of the free spectral range of the cavity of ring oscillator  and an integer multiple of the free spectral range of the cavity of SFG .","Alternatively, a second low-power 1319-nm laser juxtaposed with laser , along with a Faraday isolator, half-wave plate, directional mirror, polarization beam combiner, electro-optic polarization rotator, and polarization beam splitter, could be used in conjunction with laser  to switch output beam  on and off of the sodium resonance frequency. These elements would cooperate with laser  as previously described with respect to the switching function of 1064-nm laser  used in conjunction with laser , to the same effect.","To minimize the absorption of infrared light, all optical elements transmitting high-power 1319-nm light are made of INFRASIL\u00ae 301 optical quartz glass (fused silica). (INFRASIL is a registered trademark owned by Hereaus Corporation.) If too much light were to be absorbed, thermal lensing might occur.","As noted with respect to excitation source , the optical path length of SFG  is changed to maintain locking with the output of module  and the output of module  is adjusted to keep it locked to the optical path length of SFG . It is to be understood that this locking relationship could be reversed. In such a reversed configuration, the optical path length of SFG  would be adjusted to maintain locking with the output of module . The output of module  would then be adjusted to keep it locked with the optical path length of SFG .","Furthermore, another technique could be used as an alternative to the Pound-Drever-Hall stabilization technique disclosed herein, e.g., the Hansch-Couillaud technique. Moreover, piezoelectric transducers ,  and  used for respectively adjusting optical path lengths are but one example of a number of apparatus that could be used for this purpose, e.g., voice coil actuators or stepper motors.","It should also be noted that the wavelength of output beam  might be varied from 589 nm to suit purposes other than creating a mesospheric guide star. For example, a different output wavelength could be obtained by substituting low-power lasers having wavelengths different than the 1064-nm and 1319-nm wavelengths of lasers  and , respectively. Such a substitution would necessitate modifying ring oscillators  and  to enable modules  and  to generate high-power single-frequency laser beams. Sodium-vapor cell  would also have to be replaced with an element for providing an appropriate wavelength reference standard for stabilizing output  at the desired reference wavelength.","Depending on the desired output wavelength, the composition of crystal  might also have to be changed. The low-power wavelengths necessary to obtain a high-power output beam  having a specific wavelength, together with the aforementioned requisite modifications to various elements of excitation source , could be calculated by or would otherwise be known to one skilled in optics.","It is to be understood that the preceding is merely a detailed description of several embodiments of this invention and that numerous changes to the disclosed embodiments can be made in accordance with the disclosure herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The preceding description, therefore, is not meant to limit the scope of the invention.
