No. 12\/076,299, filed on Mar. 17, 2008 by Takashi Ando, and entitled \u201cLow Dark Current Image Sensor\u201d.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to image sensors and the manufacture of image sensors having low dark current and more particularly to CMOS and CCD imaging sensors having low dark current characteristics.","2. Description of the Related Art","Modern digital cameras employ either CCD (charge coupled device) or CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image capture sensors. CCD and CMOS technologies offer alternative methods for capturing images onto digital media.","The architecture of the CCD is largely devoted to light capture and processing is done mostly off-chip. By contrast, CMOS sensor architecture is more complex than CCD architecture. Within CMOS imaging sensors, each pixel cell typically includes a circuit that transforms photons from a photoactive-diode to a digital charge. With each pixel doing its own conversion, the chip can be built to require less off-chip circuitry for basic operation.","While CCD and CMOS architecture differs, both CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS (complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor) image sensors convert light into electrons using a plurality of photoactive-diodes, also known as photo-diodes, cells, or photo-sites.","The photo-diodes are generally arranged in a 2-D lattice. Each photo-diode in the lattice transforms light into an electron charge. Within the lattice, each photo-diode corresponds to at least one pixel in the captured image. Photo-diodes exhibit a photoelectric effect, characterized by the ability of certain materials to release an electron when impacted by protons, thereby creating a charge. The more photons impact a given photo-diode, the more charge builds up. Each diode is bordered by a nonconductive boundary, which forces the charge to build while the diode is exposed to light from a camera aperture. In essence, each of the photo-diodes acts as a bucket, tracking the number of incoming photons making contact with the photo-diode. The accumulated charge in each diode is measured and recorded as a corresponding brightness value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","1","1","5","10","10","20","20","20","5","10","5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","5","15","20","50","20","55","65","60","20","15","55","5","20"]},"To reduce the dark current in the photo-diode, it may be beneficial to reduce the number of electrons at interface , thereby reducing the number of electrons entering sensing area . The conventional CMOS image sensor  attempts to do this by introducing the doped layer , however, electrons can pass through doped layer .","The CCD and CMOS are manufactured via a wafer fabrication process by which different electrical components and structures are formed on the silicon wafers. Fabrication encompasses a plurality of stages, including deposition, photolithography, etching, ion implantation, and annealing. Conventional photo-diodes have p-type doping (usually Boron) and are grown upon the substrate material.","During the deposition stage uniform coatings of thin films are applied to the wafers. Materials such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride and polycrystalline silicon can be deposited onto the wafers using a variety of techniques, such as evaporation, chemical vapor deposition and sputtering. In particular, photo-diodes can be generated by forming epitaxial silicon layers using a process known as chemical vapor deposition.","Photolithography and etching are the processes by which structures are created on the wafers. Photolithography commonly employs UV sensitive chemicals to form masks, which acts as stencils. Etching techniques are used to remove materials that decompose during the photolithography process.","The doping process introduces ions into the fabricated surfaces, thereby adding impurities and changing the electrical properties of the material into which the ions are implanted. During the doping process, the wafers are bombarded with ions which are thereby implanted into the silicon. The number of ions implanted via the bombardment process is controlled in order to produce surface layers with specific electrical properties.","Alternatively, an epitaxial layer can be doped during deposition by adding impurities to the source gas, such as arsine, phosphine or diborane. The concentration of impurity in the gas phase determines its concentration in the deposited film. As in CVD, impurities change the deposition rate.","In the annealing process, wafers are heated for a specific amount of time in a conditioned atmosphere (inert, oxidizing, reducing). This process serves to remove impurities (such as oxygen) from the surface layers and cause implanted ions to diffuse further into the silicon (called \u201cautodoping\u201d).","A common problem among imaging sensors is that even in the absence of light, some electrons will accumulate in the photo-diodes. This phenomenon is called \u201cdark current.\u201d Dark current within image sensors degrades the performance of the produced image. These dark currents are not generated by incoming photons, but are randomly generated by thermal excitation, current leaks within the imaging device, or from various other possible sources. When charges buildup in the photo-diode, the dark current is indistinguishable from charge resulting from the photoactive effect. This causes the dark current to effectively brighten areas of the captured image, and unevenly reduces contrast between dark and lighter areas of the image. Because dark current electrons are random with respect to each imaging device, their effects on each photo-diode is unpredictable, and thereby produces noise in the resulting image which is difficult to remove. Therefore, in order to provide clearer contrast and reliable color dark currents should be minimized.","The prior art attempts to address this problem by forming a hole accumulation diode using an ion-implantation. However, this method requires high temperature processes, and therefore narrows the options for manufacturing processes. In addition the implantation process itself causes defects in the sensing area of the imaging device.","The present invention is directed to image sensors and the manufacture of image sensors having low dark current. The SiGe or Ge layer is selectively grown on the silicon substrate of the sensing area using an epitaxial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. After the SiGe or Ge growth, a silicon layer may be grown by the same epitaxial CVD method in an in-situ manner. This facilitates the formation of the hole accumulation diode and reduces the defect density of the substrate, resulting in the device having a lower dark current.","One embodiment may include an image sensor comprising a silicon substrate, a first layer of Ge or SiGe, a second layer of silicon, and an antireflection layer. The first layer may have a thickness between about 1-10 nm. The second layer may have a thickness between about 1-3 nm, and the anti-reflection layer may have a thickness of up to 100 nm. The first layer and the second layer may be grown using epitaxial chemical vapor deposition.","The image sensor may also include a peripheral circuit adjacent to the silicon substrate, first layer, and second layer. The sensor may also include a light shield disposed over the peripheral circuit, but under the anti-reflection layer. Finally, a color filter may be disposed over the anti-reflection layer and overlapping the silicon substrate.","Another embodiment may be directed to a process for manufacturing an image sensor. The process may include producing a silicon substrate, growing a first layer on the silicon substrate in-situ, and growing a second layer of silicon on the first layer in-situ. The first layer, second layer or both may be grown using epitaxial chemical vapor deposition.","The first layer may include a Ge or SiGe, and may be grown to a thickness between about 1-10 nm. In cases where the manufacturing process may employ temperatures of up to 500, pure Ge may be used. However, in cases where the process employs a maximum temperature between 500 to 1000\u00b0 C., an SiGe having a Ge concentration between 10% and 40% may be used.","The present invention can be embodied in various forms, including business processes, computer implemented methods, computer program products, computer systems and networks, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, and the like.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth, such as flowcharts and system configurations, in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However, it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.","The present invention is directed to image sensors and the manufacture of image sensors having low dark current. The invention improves on pre-existing technologies by taking advantage of the narrower energy band gap of Ge and SiGe, as compared to imaging sensors employing conventional Si substrates.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","100","105","110","120","125","130","120","125","130","105"],"sub":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["125","105","130","125","120","155","165","160","155","150","120","125","150","120","125"]},"A hole accumulation layer is formed at the surface of the sensing area  (shown by a cross in ) due to a narrower energy band gap of SiGe compared to Si. As a result, the energy bands  bend upward as they approach the interface between the first layer  and the sensing area , which is a key to reducing dark current.","As a result of the SiGe or Ge in first layer , hole charges  (positive charge) build up in the first layer . This is done without p-type implantation. The hole charge  reduces the electron density within sensing area , negating the effects of the dark current. In essence, the interface between the first layer  and second layer  creates a buffer that traps stray electrons attempting to enter the sensing area , thereby reducing dark current. Furthermore, the amount of p-type implant species can be reduced and the density of the interface defects becomes lower.","The first layer  may have a thickness of up to 10 nm and may be selectively grown on the silicon substrate of the sensing area  using an epitaxial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in-situ. Ge concentrations in the SiGe should be determined based on the thermal budget of the manufacturing process. If the fabrication process will reach temperatures of up to 1000\u00b0 C., Ge concentration in the first layer  should be kept between 10% and 40%. If the process temperature will remain below 500\u00b0 C., pure Ge can be used instead. In order to further facilitate the formation of the hole accumulation diode, SiGe or Ge can be doped with p-type species like boron or BFin an in-situ manner.","The first layer  may be capped by the second layer  using an epitaxial chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in-situ.

Light shield layer  provides protection to the peripheral circuit  from the photons.","While embodiments herein are discussed primarily with respect to three embodiments of an imaging sensor, the present invention is not limited thereto.
