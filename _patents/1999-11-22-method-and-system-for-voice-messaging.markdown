In its primitive form, e-mail is managed by two kinds of computer software: namely, e-mail server software (referred to simply as \u201ce-mail servers\u201d) and e-mail client software (referred to simply as \u201ce-mail clients\u201d). E-mail servers reside on centrally accessed computers (referred to as \u201cserver computers\u201d), and manage incoming and outgoing e-mail for remote users who are authorized to use such server computers. E-mail servers maintain separate mail accounts for each authorized user, into which incoming mail is stored. E-mail clients reside on remote computers (referred to as \u201cclient computers\u201d) and manage incoming and outgoing mail for designated users. E-mail clients are responsible for downloading arriving mail items from the server computer at which they are located. E-mail clients are also responsible for transmitting outgoing mail from a remote client computer to a server computer. Examples of popular e-mail clients for personal computers are EUDORA R, INTERNET EXPLORER R and NETSCAPE R.","Standard e-mail uses a protocol named Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) for sending outgoing messages, and a protocol named Post Office Protocol (POP) for receiving incoming messages.

The e-mail is converted to speech and read to the user over the phone. Various selections can be made by pushing the buttons of the telephone, and the user can effectively scroll through his e-mail and choose the messages to listen to.","The present specification also describes a method and system for replying to e-mail through a telephone. The reply takes one or both of two forms: (1) a text e-mail reply, generated from the speech reply by a speech-to-text converter, and (2) an audio file that contains a recording of the speech reply therewithin. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the audio file is sent back to the original sender as a MIME attachment within a reply e-mail, in a standard audio format such as a WAV file.","When the original sender receives the reply e-mail, he can download the WAV file to his local computer and play the file to listen to the recorded reply. In another preferred embodiment the audio file is posted on an Internet web site in a streaming audio format such as REALAUDIO R, and a reply e-mail notification is sent to the original sender having an Internet link to the audio file therewithin. When the original sender receives the reply e-mail, he can click on the link to play the audio file. Streaming audio formats enable the user to play an audio file on-line, while it is being delivered, rather than have to wait until the entire audio file is downloaded. REALAUDIO is a registered trademark of Progressive Networks, Inc. Information about REALAUDIO files is available on the Internet at http:\/\/www.realaudio.com.","Advantages of the latter embodiment are (1) the e-mail reply is small in size, since it only contains a link to the audio file, rather than the file itself; and (2) the audio file is streamed for on-line playing. Advantages of the former embodiment are (1) the reply e-mail is self-contained, and the user does not have to use a web browser to listen to the voice reply; and (2) sensitive information is not being broadcast over the web. It should be pointed out that from an ergonometric point of view, both embodiments have the advantage that e-mail messages are being replied to with speech, and the replies are being listened to rather than read.","Dictating e-mail messages into a voice response unit over a telephone line is faster and simpler than typing a text message. For users who receive large volumes of e-mail on a daily basis, reading through e-mail is both time-consuming, and difficult on one's eyes. Many professionals spend hours daily reading and replying to e-mail messages. By listening to e-mail, rather than reading it, these professionals can work on other \u201cvision-intensive\u201d tasks while they are listening to their e-mail messages at the same time. This is analogous to working on a task while listening in on a conference call being played on the speaker of a telephone.","To assist in understanding the present invention, two simplified example sessions are described hereinbelow:","A mobile user who wishes to send a message to an another person whose name appears on a predefined list of contacts, such as a company directory, dials up to a voice response unit (VRU). The VRU responds 1. EMAIL 2. PERSONAL DIRECTORY. 3. COMPANY DIRECTORY. The user selects 3 and the VRU responds PLEASE ENTER THE FIRST THREE LETTERS OF THE CONTACT'S NAME. The user enters via the telephone touch pad the first three letters. The VRU responds TO SEND AN EMAIL TO <CONTACT> PLEASE PRESS 1. The User enters 1. The VRU responds PLEASE RECORD YOUR VOICE AT THE TONE, PRESS # WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED. The User records his voice and presses # to terminate the recording session.","The VRU then reads a second menu of options as follows: 1. ATTACH SPEECH REPLY AS A WAV FILE ATTACHMENT TO E-MAIL REPLY 2. POST SPEECH REPLY AS A REALAUDIO FILE AND A WAV FILE AND SEND NOTIFICATION WITH LINKS. Selecting option 1 instructs the VRU to attach the WAV file to an e-mail reply. Selecting option 2 instructs the VRU to (1) convert the WAV file to a REALAUDIO file, (2) to post both a WAV file and a REALAUDIO file on an Internet web site, and (3) to send a notification reply e-mail containing two links\u2014one link to the WAV file and one link to the REALAUDIO file.","A mobile user dials in to a voice response unit (VRU) by means of a telephone to access his e-mail remotely. The VRU reads out a message indicating that the user has e-mail in his inbox. Each e-mail item contains a unique identifier, data fields including FROM, RE and DATE, a text body, and one or more attachments. Each e-mail message is converted from text to speech by a text-to-speech converter within the VRU. The VRU reads out a first menu of options as follows:","1. ID:018, FROM:ANDY, RE:MEETING TOMORROW, DATE:mm\/dd\/yy 2. ID:004, FROM:BILL, RE:SUNDAY PICNIC, DATE:mm\/dd\/yy 3. ID:103, FROM:CHARLIE, RE:UPCOMING EXAM, DATE:mm\/dd\/yy 4. ID:075, FROM:DAN, RE:DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT, DATE:mm\/dd\/yy 5. <MORE>. Option 5, \u201c<MORE>\u201d, is used for menus that entail more information than is presented in a single list. By selecting \u201c<MORE>\u201d, the user requests additional lists of menu items. Correspondingly, successive lists could have a \u201c<BACK>\u201d option for returning to previous lists.","After listening to a specific e-mail message, the user can reply to the message and\/or route the message to his fax machine or to his pager. For reply purposes, the user speaks into his telephone and the VRU records the speech as a WAV file. The VRU then reads a second menu of options as follows: 1. ATTACH SPEECH REPLY AS A WAV FILE ATTACHMENT TO E-MAIL REPLY 2. POST SPEECH REPLY AS A REALAUDIO FILE AND A WAV FILE AND SEND NOTIFICATION WITH LINKS. Selecting option 1 instructs the VRU to attach the WAV file to an e-mail reply. Selecting option 2 instructs the VRU to (1) convert the WAV file to a REALAUDIO file, (2) to post both a WAV file and a REALAUDIO file on an Internet web site, and (3) to send a notification reply e-mail containing two links\u2014one link to the WAV file and one link to the REALAUDIO file.","In this case, the receiver has a choice of whether to download the WAV file to his local computer, or to stream it for on-line playing. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a choice between attaching a WAV file in a reply e-mail or posting a REALAUDIO file and a WAV file on an Internet site can be pre-programmed, thus avoiding the need for the second menu of options hereinabove. The pre-programmed choice of attach vs. post can be customized for each reply address.","Similarly, in another alternative embodiment of the present invention, when posting his reply on an Internet web site, the user can be given the choice of whether to post a WAV file or a REALAUDIO file, or both. For routing purposes, the VRU reads a third menu of options as follows: 1. FAX E-MAIL TO ME. 2. FAX E-MAIL ATTACHMENT(S) TO ME. 3. SEND TEXT ONLY TO MY PAGER. 4. <MORE>. Selecting option 1 instructs the VRU to fax e-mail, without attachments, to the user's fax machine. Selecting option 2 instructs the VRU to fax the e-mail attachment(s) to the user's fax machine. Selecting option 3 instructs the VRU to send the text body of the e-mail to the user's pager.","Reference is now made to , which illustrates a voice response computer  used for processing voice electronic mail in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Voice response computer  may include several components, as follows: A voice processing board  is used for processing incoming and outgoing voice messages. An example of such a board is the Dialogic D\/21H board for Windows, a description of which is available at: http:\/\/www.dialogic.com. An e-mail client  is used for pulling incoming e-mail messages from local or remote e-mail servers, and for sending outgoing e-mail messages to local or remote e-mail servers. A text-to-speech converter  is used for converting text messages into voice messages.","Use of text-to-speech converter  is now described. Each e-mail message may be converted from text to speech by means of text-to-speech converter  (FIG. A). In a preferred embodiment, the present invention uses Microsoft's SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface) version 4.0 toolkit for carrying out text-to-speech conversion. SAPI can be used with two well-known algorithms for text-to-speech conversion: Whistler, and Lernout & Hauspie. Reference information for Microsoft's SAPI 4.0 is available on-line via the Internet at Microsoft's web site http:\/\/www.Microsoft.com\/iit\/onlinedocs\/intro2sapi.html, and reference information on Lernout & Hauspie is available on the Internet at http:\/\/www.lhs.com. Other text-to-speech toolkits, such as the AcuVoice toolkit of Fonix Corp., are available and can be used instead of a Microsoft toolkit. Reference information on AcuVoice is available on the Internet at http:\/\/acuvoice.com.","Text-to-speech converter  () stores the resultant speech data in an audio file, such as a WAV file. WAV is a standard file format for audio files. Three common types of WAV files are PCM (pulse code modulation audio), which is used on compact disks (CDs), (2) mLaw compressed audio, and (3) Interactive Multimedia Association ADPCM (adaptive differential pulse code modulation) compressed audio.","In a preferred embodiment the present invention uses a raw uncompressed audio format such as PCM, with single channel audio sampled at 11 KHz with 8 bits per sample. Single channel audio 11 KHz with 8 bits per sample are standard sampling parameters for speech.","An encoder  is used to compress WAV and other audio files. Use of encoder  is described more fully with reference to  below. A speech-to-text converter is used for converting voice messages into text messages. Use of speech-to-text converter  is described more fully with reference to  below. An e-mail server  is used as a local intermediate mail server for outgoing mail from voice response computer . Use of e-mail server  is described more fully with reference to  below.","E-mail parser  is used for two purposes: (1) extracting messages and other fields from e-mail, and (2) breaking text into granular units such as sentences for managing threads that process text-to-speech tasks. Use of e-mail parser  is described more fully with reference to  below. An e-mail database  is used for storing e-mail for users of a voice response system. Use of e-mail database  is described more fully with reference to  below.","It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art upon reading the ensuing description that the present invention does not require use of all of the abovementioned components. Specifically, the first components, voice processing board  is required. The remaining seven components: e-mail client , text-to-speech converter , encoder , speech-to-text converter , e-mail server , e-mail parser  and e-mail database  are not required, but serve to provide additional functionality and enhancements as described hereinbelow.","Reference is now made to , which illustrates a method for accessing e-mail on an e-mail database using a voice response computer. A voice response computer  preferably includes a database proxy , which includes N threads and N persistent database connections, which manage these connections.","The voice response computer  also preferably includes a user interface  having M threads, where M>N.","When a thread of user interface  seeks to query a database , the query is queued on a queue  and the database proxy  is notified accordingly. The database proxy  removes the query from queue  and assigns it to one of its N threads. Should more than N queries be received, they are queued until one of the N database proxy threads are available.","The functionality of  is particularly useful when M is very large, inasmuch as it is difficult to retain M persistent database connections.","Reference is now made to , which are simplified illustrations of an e-mail management system that posts a recorded message as an audio file and posts a reply message as an audio file on an Internet web site, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention,  representing the functionality of posting a recorded message as an audio file and  representing the functionality of posting a reply message as an audio file.","It is appreciated that  show essentially a single system that has two functionalities. It is appreciated that the present invention is not limited to a system having both functionalities but extends as well to systems having only one of the two functionalities.","Reference is now made specifically to , which illustrates a message management system that posts a recorded message as an audio file on an Internet web site, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.","The user, employing a telephone , dials in to the voice response computer  () and selects a contact from his directory listing . The user then records a message into the voice response computer . The user then informs voice response computer , by means of the telephone pad, that he wishes to convert the recorded message into a streaming audio format, such as a REALAUDIO format, and to post it on an Internet web server . Internet web server  preferably contains an HTTP server , an e-mail server  and a REALAUDIO server .","In response to the user's instruction, voice response computer  sends an outgoing e-mail containing a WAV file attachment, to e-mail server , using the SMTP protocol. Upon receiving the e-mail containing the WAV file attachment, Internet web server  extracts the WAV file. If the user instructed voice response computer  to post WAV and REALAUDIO files, then Internet web server  converts the extracted WAV file into a REALAUDIO file, by means of REALAUDIO encoder  contained therewithin, and posts both files (the WAV file and the REALAUDIO file) on an Internet web site.","Internet web server  then sends an outgoing notification, typically in the form of an e-mail, to the contact, via the contact's e-mail server , using the SMTP protocol. As an alternative to an e-mail notification, the present invention may employ an alternative type of notification, such as a notification which employs POTs telephone voice messaging, a beeper, an AOL Interactive Messaging (AIM) client or an ICQ client. For the sake of simplicity and conciseness, reference is made hereinbelow only to e-mail notifications, notwithstanding that the invention is not limited thereto.","The notification e-mail contains links to the REALAUDIO file and to the WAV file. Internet web server  is better suited for sending the notification e-mail than is voice response computer , since the Internet web server knows precisely when the REALAUDIO file and the WAV are posted and available for remote access.","In order to send the outgoing e-mail containing the WAV file attachment from voice response computer  to e-mail server , it is only necessary for voice response computer  to use e-mail client  (FIG. A). However, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, voice response computer  also contains its own local e-mail server  (FIG. A). The outgoing e-mail containing the WAV file attachment is sent by voice response computer  to local e-mail server . E-mail server  then sends the e-mail containing the WAV file to e-mail server .","The advantage of using a local e-mail  server within voice response computer  is the time saving in waiting for an acknowledgment from the e-mail server receiving the e-mail. When an e-mail client sends e-mail, it must wait for an acknowledgment from an e-mail server. When e-mail contains a large attachment, such as a WAV file, there is a significant delay in waiting for the acknowledgment, due to bandwidth limitations of transmission over the Internet.","The system of  regularly sends e-mail messages with large WAV file attachments, and were the e-mail client required to wait for an acknowledgment each time a reply e-mail is sent, the latency of the system would be prolonged. When an e-mail message is sent to a local e-mail server, an acknowledgment is received almost immediately. Thus by sending the e-mail containing the WAV file attachment to its own local e-mail server  (FIG. A), voice response computer  achieves better throughput and performance.","From the contact's e-mail server , the notification e-mail is retrieved by an e-mail client on the contact's local computer , as an incoming e-mail, typically using the POP protocol. As described hereinbelow, the e-mail client resident in the contact's computer  may be an audio e-mail client  of the present invention. Upon receiving the notification e-mail, the contact clicks on a link contained in the notification e-mail to access the WAV file or the REALAUDIO file, using the HTTP protocol.","The contact's computer  contains a REALAUDIO player  for playing REALAUDIO files, and a WAV player  for playing WAV files. It may be the case that the contact is also a subscriber to the system of the present invention, as is the user.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the contact's voice response computer (not shown) has the capability to automatically download audio files linked to a reply e-mail, and to play the audio files to the contact.","In this embodiment, when a notification e-mail with a link to an audio WAV file arrives at the contact's e-mail server , and is thereafter received by the contact's voice response computer (not shown), the contact's voice response computer automatically downloads the WAV file linked to the reply e-mail and plays it to the contact when he dials in.","It can thus be appreciated that the contact who is also a subscriber to the system of the present invention does not need to download the WAV file from the Internet himself, and can listen to the contents of the WAV file simply by dialing in to his voice response computer. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, voice response computer  contains its own e-mail database  () for storing the user's e-mail. E-mail database  provides a structured directory-type facility for storing voice electronic mail. The user can save and organize his voice electronic mail into individual \u201cmailboxes,\u201d for future access.","Reference is now made to , which illustrates an e-mail management system that posts a reply message as an audio file on an Internet web site, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Elements in , which are identical to those in  are identified by the same reference numerals.","In the discussion of  that follows, it is being assumed that a \u201cuser\u201d receives an e-mail message from a \u201csender,\u201d and generates a speech reply. The term \u201cuser\u201d is indicative of the fact that the user under discussion is a subscriber to the system of the present invention.","There exist two alternative methods for providing e-mail to e-mail database , namely a pull method and a push method. These two methods may operate concurrently.","According to a first method, which is a pull method, e-mail client  () polls e-mail server  on a regular basis (for example, every ten minutes) to determine the contents of the user's current inbox of e-mail, and to synchronize the e-mail items in e-mail database  of voice response computer  with the e-mail items in server .","Specifically, voice response computer  pulls newly arrived e-mail that has not yet been downloaded from e-mail server  and places it in e-mail database  and purges from e-mails database  old e-mail, that has not been stored by the user in a mailbox for archiving. As described hereinbelow, e-mail database  () may be used to store and control the e-mail items in voice response computer .","According to a second method, which is a push method, an e-mail server , upon receiving an e-mail for a user, inserts the e-mail directly into e-mail database .","In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the user dials in to voice response computer  from telephone  to retrieve his e-mail from e-mail database . By pressing on the telephone pad in accordance with menu options read from the VRU, as illustrated in Example Session II, the user selects e-mail messages to be read to him by voice response computer .","After listening to an e-mail message, the user dictates a reply into the telephone, and voice response computer  records the reply. The user then informs voice response computer , by means of the telephone pad, that he wishes to convert the recorded reply into a streaming audio format, such as a REALAUDIO format, and to post it on an Internet web server . Internet web server  contains an HTTP server , an e-mail server  and a REALAUDIO server . As described hereinbelow, e-mail server  and e-mail server  may be the same e-mail server.","In response to the user's instruction, voice response computer  sends an outgoing reply e-mail containing a WAV file attachment to e-mail server , using the SMTP protocol. Upon receiving the reply e-mail containing the WAV file attachment, Internet web server  extracts the WAV file. If the user instructed voice response computer  to post WAV and REALAUDIO files, then Internet web server  converts the extracted WAV file into a REALAUDIO file, by means of REALAUDIO encoder  contained therewithin, and posts both files (the WAV file and the REALAUDIO file) on an Internet web site.","Internet web server  then sends an outgoing notification e-mail to the sender, via a sender's e-mail server , using the SMTP protocol. The notification e-mail contains links to the REALAUDIO file and to the WAV file. Internet web server  is better suited for sending the notification e-mail than is voice response computer  or e-mail server , since Internet web server knows precisely when the REALAUDIO file and the WAV file are posted and available for remote access.","In order to send the outgoing reply e-mail containing the WAV file attachment from voice response computer  to e-mail server , it is only necessary for voice response computer  to use e-mail client  (FIG. A). However, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, voice response computer  also contains its own local e-mail server  (FIG. A). The outgoing reply e-mail containing the WAV file attachment is sent by voice response computer  to local e-mail server . E-mail server  then sends the reply e-mail containing the WAV file to e-mail server .","The advantage of using a local e-mail server  within voice response computer  is the time saving in waiting for an acknowledgment from the e-mail server receiving the e-mail. When an e-mail client sends e-mail, it must wait for an acknowledgment from an e-mail server. When e-mail contains a large attachment, such as a WAV file, there is a significant delay in waiting for the acknowledgment, due to bandwidth limitations of transmission over the Internet.","The system illustrated in  regularly sends e-mail replies with large WAV file attachments, and were the e-mail client required to wait for an acknowledgment each time a reply e-mail is sent, the latency of the system would be prolonged. When an e-mail reply is sent to the local e-mail server , an acknowledgment is received almost immediately. Thus by sending the reply e-mail containing the WAV file attachment to its own local e-mail server  (FIG. A), voice response computer  achieves better throughput and performance.","From the sender's e-mail server , the notification e-mail is retrieved by an e-mail client on the sender's local computer , as an incoming e-mail, using the POP protocol. As described hereinbelow, the e-mail client resident in the sender's computer  may be an audio e-mail client  of the present invention. Upon receiving the notification e-mail, the sender clicks on a link contained in the notification e-mail to access the WAV file or the REALAUDIO file, using the HTTP protocol.","The sender's computer  contains a REALAUDIO player  for playing REALAUDIO files, and a WAV player  for playing WAV files. It may be the case that the sender is also a subscriber to the system of the present invention, as is the user. In this case the sender can also call in to server , by means of telephone , to retrieve his e-mail.","For simplicity, it is assumed in  that the sender's e-mail server  also functions as a voice response computer similar to voice response computer .

E-mail database  provides a structured directory-type facility for storing voice electronic mail. The user can save and organize his voice electronic mail into individual \u201cmailboxes,\u201d for future access.","E-mail database  is updated whenever e-mail client  () polls e-mail server  for the user's e-mail. When new e-mail has arrived at e-mail server , e-mail client  downloads it to voice response computer , and adds it to database . When old e-mail is removed from e-mail server , voice response computer  removes its copy of such old e-mail from database , if the old e-mail has not been stored by the user in a mailbox. In this way, database  maintains synchronization with e-mail server . Database  can be an SQL database with fields such as sender, subject and date. Voice response computer  can carry out user requests for searches within database . For example, a user may want to access the e-mail that was sent from a designated sender within a designated time period.","Reference is now made to , which illustrates an e-mail management system that sends an audio file attachment to an e-mail, such as a reply e-mail, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As above, the user dials in to voice response computer  from telephone  and dictates an e-mail to a recipient. The e-mail may or may not be a reply e-mail and the recipient may or may not be the sender of an e-mail to which a reply is being sent.","In the embodiment depicted in , the user informs voice response computer  that he desires to convert his recorded message, such as a reply, into an audio file, such as a WAV file, and to send it to an e-mail server  of a recipient, such as the sender, as an attachment to an e-mail, such as a reply e-mail. As described hereinabove with reference to , in a preferred embodiment of the present invention voice response system  sends the e-mail containing the WAV file attachment to its own local e-mail server  (FIG. A), and then e-mail server  sends it to e-mail server . This reduces network latency caused by the delay in waiting for an acknowledgment from a remote e-mail server.","The recipient's computer  pulls the e-mail as an incoming message from the recipient's e-mail server , typically using the POP protocol. By clicking on the reference to the WAV file attachment in the e-mail, the recipient can either save the file to his local disk, or play it using WAV player , or both. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention the audio file attached to a e-mail can be compressed as a self-extracting compressed file. Self-extracting files contain decompressors therewithin.","The recipient of an e-mail message with a self-extracting file attached therewithin can click on the reference to the file, and the compressed audio file automatically decompresses itself. For example, the present invention can attach a zipped WAV file to an e-mail. The attachment automatically unzips itself and regenerates the WAV file when a recipient clicks on the reference to the attachment. It is for the purpose of this alternative embodiment that voice response computer  contains encoder  () for compressing audio files.","Reference is now made to , which illustrates how a user can route his e-mail to a pager and\/or a fax machine, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The user can instruct voice response computer , from telephone , to route his incoming e-mail message by sending it as a text message to his pager , or to his fax machine , or to both pager  and fax machine .","If the user elects to route his e-mail to pager , voice response computer  typically sends an outgoing e-mail message to e-mail gateway , using the SMTP protocol. Gateway  operates by accepting e-mail as input and producing a message that can be delivered to a pager as output. Specifically, the Simple Messaging System (SMS) protocol is designed as a protocol for transferring text data to a thin wireless data terminal, such as a pager. E-mail gateway  converts the user's text e-mail into a form suitable for wireless transmission to pager . Alternatively, voice response computer  can communicate in the SMS protocol directly with pager .","If the user elects to route his e-mail to fax machine , voice response computer  typically sands an outgoing e-mail message to e-mail gateway , using the SMTP protocol.

Although it is the \u201cun-wired\u201d mobile user who typically accesses his e-mail through a telephone unit, the present invention is also advantageous to the \u201cwired\u201d user who accesses his e-mail through a computer connected to a network.","For reasons of convenience, and other reasons as well, a user with a computer may nevertheless prefer to reply to e-mail messages and send new e-mail messages using speech rather than text. An indicator of this is the emergence of IP phones for speech communication over the Internet.","The present invention also provides an audio e-mail client that manages incoming and outgoing audio messages. It enables a user to dictate a voice e-mail message by speaking into a microphone connected to his computer, and to convert the speech into an audio file. The audio file can then be either (1) sent as an attachment to a standard e-mail message, or (2) posted on an Internet web site. In the latter case, a notification e-mail message with a link to the audio file is sent. It can thus be appreciated that the present invention provides voice mail-like capability to a computer user.","The audio e-mail client of the present invention may enable a user to save an audio file that is in a streaming audio format on a remote server computer or on his local computer. This feature is not available in standard REALAUDIO players. Such players are used for listening to live broadcasts over the Internet, such as newscasts, and are typically used to play an audio file once. The present invention introduces a novel use of streaming audio files; namely, for voice e-mail messages, and in this context it is important to be able to save the voice messages for future reference. In a preferred embodiment, the audio e-mail client of the present invention provides a mail archive for voice messages that is structured hierarchically in files and directories, as is commonly done today for text e-mail messages using familiar e-mail clients such as EUDORA, MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER and NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR.","When an incoming voice e-mail message is saved, the user can direct it to a specific directory or sub-directory, for cataloging and indexing purposes. Moreover the incoming voice e-mail message can be saved in a variety of formats, such as REALAUDIO, WAV or compressed WAV.","Referring back to , in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the sender's computer  contains such an audio e-mail client , to play the REALAUDIO file posted by Internet web server  and to save the file on Internet web server  or on the sender's computer . A similar structure is applicable to a recipient using the functionality of FIG. A. In a preferred embodiment, the audio e-mail client of the present invention also carries out remote functions by posting voice e-mail messages on an Internet web server.","Specifically, a user can post voice e-mail messages on an Internet web site for retrieval by another person, or for purposes of archiving his own voice e-mail. Audio e-mail client  has the capability to manage RAM, hard diskspace and files on remote server computers, by using an appropriate protocol for uploading and storing REALAUDIO and other audio files on Internet web server . This is indicated in  by two-directional arrows between Internet web server  and audio e-mail client . Similarly, audio e-mail client  is used in the embodiment illustrated by  for the purpose of file management on a remote server computers.","Specifically, audio e-mail client  can archive and manage the WAV files it receives by storing them on a remote server computer such as Internet web server  (FIGS. A & B). The sender's voice electronic mail is thus stored on a remote computer, and accessible from his local computer. This is similar to the remote mail storage that Hotmail provides to its subscribers for text electronic mail.

User #1 dials in to voice response computer  by means of telephone , and user #2 dials in by means of telephone .","Voice response computer  is connected to two e-mail clients  that work in parallel. Were a single e-mail client to be used, there would be only one client pulling e-mail for user #1 and user #2. Voice response computer  may also contain multiple text-to-speech converters  () and multiple e-mail parsers  (FIG. A), for simultaneously handling multiple users, rather than processing the user messaging tasks in a single queue. For multi-user systems such as the systems of the present invention, the management of processing threads is a significant factor in overall system performance.","One of the recurrent processing tasks performed by the system of the present invention is the conversion of e-mail messages from text to speech by text-to-speech converter  (FIG. A). Voice response computer  routinely processes an enormous volume of e-mail messages. Were a separate processing thread to be allocated for each text-to-speech task, the proliferation of threads could choke the system, resulting in poor performance. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention uses a small number of threads and uses a waiting queue for text-to-speech tasks.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified illustration of a queue for text-to-speech processing tasks in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. For simplicity a single thread  is illustrated. Thread  handles each text-to-speech task, and carries out a function described as DO(t, f), where t is a text string and f is an audio file. The function DO converts text string t to speech, and saves the result in audio file f, using text-to-speech converter .","Shown in  are two e-mail text messages  and  that have been downloaded to voice response computer  by e-mail client  (FIG. A). Each e-mail message is to be processed by thread , for conversion from text to speech. The processing requests for messages  and  are temporarily stored in a waiting queue . As thread  completes each task, a new task is delivered by waiting queue .","One problem encountered by such a thread management system is that of \u201cblocking.\u201d Blocking occurs when a task that requires a large amount of processing blocks other tasks that require little processing. For example, suppose message  is a large message and message  is a short message, and that message  is ahead of message  in queue . Then the text-to-speech processing for message  would be deferred until message.  is completely converted into speech.","The present invention overcomes the problem of blocking, in a preferred embodiment, by parsing each message into small units, such as individual sentences, by e-mail parser . Each sentence is then individually sent to queue  for input to thread  as a separate text-to-speech conversion task. In this way, the short message  may enter queue  at a queue position between the sentences of message , and thus be processed by thread  before the processing of message  is finished. E-mail parser  may use punctuation marks as a basis for parsing messages into individual sentences.","E-mail parser  may include a pre-parsing module which, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented as a PERL module. The pre-parsing module may perform text substitutions, insertions and deletions which may improve the understandability of text to speech conversions.","It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that other methods of parsing may be used instead, and that messages may be parsed into units other than sentences as well. For example, for uniformity of size, messages may be parsed into units of consecutive words whose total size does not exceed 100 characters. It should also be apparent to those skilled in the art that multiple e-mail parsers  may be present within voice response computer , in order to process multiple e-mail messages in parallel.","The present invention is also useful within a \u201cbuddy system.\u201d Such a system is based upon a \u201cbuddy list,\u201d which is a list of friends, or members, who wish to be notified when any members of the list are on-line. An example of such a system is the Mirabilis ICQ (\u201cI seek you\u201d) system for notifying the other members when a member of the list is connected to the Internet.
