title: Flexible assignment scheme for financial statement items in an automated accounting system
abstract: An automated accounting and reporting system supports flexible assignments of accounting objects to financial statements. At a reporting time, financial statement items may be generated from accounting objects by surveying the stored accounting objects and copying and aggregating key figures from the accounting object to the financial statement items. The financial statement items form the basis of the financial statements. The copying and aggregating may occur as specified in a plurality of rule sets. To change assignments between the accounting objects and financial statements, it is sufficient to provide a replacement rule set that specifies different copy and aggregation operations.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to computerized accounting systems and to reporting sub-systems therein.","Most modern firms use computers to monitor their financial operations. These firms generate computerized records that represent various transactions that the firm performs during the course of its operation. For example, banks typically store electronic records representing various loans that they manage and securities that they buy and sell. For large firms, there may be several million electronic records generated per year during the ordinary course of the firms' operations. These computer systems also may perform financial analysis and reporting functions to support internal accounting operations and the like.","In one reporting process, a computer system may generate financial statements from its transaction records. A variety of financial statements conventionally are prepared in accounting, such as balance sheet statements, profit\/loss statements, a variety of notes and internal reports. Known computer systems require an operator to assign a transaction to a general ledger account at the time that the transaction is \u201cposted,\u201d e.g., when the posting document representing the transaction is created and stored in the computer system. Financial statement are directly based on these general ledger accounts. In this manner, a transaction's financial statement assignment is directly linked to the transaction record itself. When the time comes for the computer system to generate financial statements, the computer system assembles the financial statements using the hard coded assignments present in the transaction records.","The hard coding of financial statement assignments is cumbersome and inflexible. Some companies experience changes in their structure or legal type (e.g., from a bank to a capitalized company), which can cause the form and format of their reporting structures to change. Although the key figures of the postings themselves would remain correct, the financial statement assignments would become obsolete. Changes in the legal type or in the country where a firm is located also may affect the reporting of their business partners. It is very common to report e.g. which portion of the receivables is from banks or non-banks, which portion is from domestic and from foreign business partners. In such a case additional postings have to be made in order to reflect the change of country of a business partner. Known systems support only in rare cases the creation of mass postings. Accordingly, manual postings often are required. The applicant perceives a need in the art for an automated accounting and reporting system that provides flexible assignments between stored accounting records and financial statements prepared therefrom.","Embodiments of the present invention provide an automated accounting and reporting system that supports flexible assignments of key figures of accounting objects to financial statements. According to these embodiments, accounting objects may be posted to a financial database without requiring general ledger accounts or financial statement assignments also to be stored therein. At a reporting time, financial statement items may be generated by surveying the stored accounting objects and copying key figures from the accounting object to the financial statement items and aggregating data therein. The financial statement items form the basis of the financial statements. The copying and aggregating may occur as specified in a plurality of rule sets. To change assignments between the accounting objects and financial statements, it is sufficient to provide another rule set that specifies different copy and aggregation operations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","120","130"]},"Embodiments of the present invention provide a financial statement item generation process (\u201cFSI generator\u201d)  that surveys records present in the records database  or, alternatively, the financial database  (herein, such records are called \u201caccounting objects\u201d) and generates financial statement items therefrom. The financial statement items (\u201cFSIs\u201d) may be stored in a reporting database . Typically, the records present in the reporting database  form the basis of financial statements, electronic or printed reports, that the firm generates in the course of its operations.","The FSI generator  may operate in conjunction with one or more rule sets , which define conditions upon which FSIs may be generated from stored accounting objects. Each rule may include a condition field which identifies the types of accounting objects to which the rule is relevant. Also complex conditions based on any logical expression combining elementary conditions on characteristics as well as on key figures are permissible. Each rule also may include a rule steps field that identifies operations to be performed on key figure data from the accounting object to generate a corresponding FSI.","The system  may accommodate multiple rule sets . Each rule set defines operations that are to be performed to generate FSIs from the accounting objects. Typically, the different rule sets may define different reporting systems that a firm might use for different firm structures. For example, if a firm were operating as a bank, it would be subject to predetermined reporting requirements for its financial positions data. If the firm changed its operating structure to that of a capitalized company, the form and format of its reporting requirements likely would change. In the system  of , different rule sets might be defined to accommodate the different reporting requirements. During operation, one of the rule sets would be selected to generate FSIs from the stored accounting objects.","As can be appreciated, the rule sets  define relationships between FSIs and the accounting objects from which they are generated. The relationships typically will be many to many. That is, a single accounting object may match conditions for multiple rules of a rule set and, therefore, contribute to generation of multiple FSIs. Additionally, a single FSI may receive contributions from multiple accounting objects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","220","250"]},"The method of  finds application where the system is run to develop FSIs for the most complete financial reporting possible. Of course, scenarios may arise where a system operator needs only to generate FSI for a subset of financial reports or may desire to generate financial reports for only a subset of stored accounting objects. In such situations, it is permissible to run the operations of  on some but not all of the stored accounting objects or to enable some but not all of the rules in a rule set. The principles of the present invention accommodate such variations.","Consider operation of the foregoing embodiments in connection with exemplary accounting objects and rules set forth in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1 provides a simple example of exemplary accounting objects that might be stored in one of the databases  or . Here, the accounting objects reflect balances of bank transactions. Each accounting object includes fields to record characteristics data or key figure data. \u201cKey figures\u201d are numbers representing parameter data of FOB records; they are the numbers that represent financial information to be reported by the system. \u201cCharacteristics\u201d are semantic identifiers of key figure data; they may identify various parameters of records (e.g., object ID, security ID) or may provide for differentiation among reporting entities (e.g., a legal entity, a profit center, an instrument type).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["CHARACTERISTICS","KEY FIGURES"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"AO","COUNTRY","CURREN-","BOOK","INTEREST"]},{"entry":["ID","TYPE","CODE","CY CODE","VALUE","REVENUE"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","Loan","01",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u221210","million","0.5","million"]},{"entry":["2","Loan","01",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u22125","million","0.2","million"]},{"entry":["3","Loan","01",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u22125","million","0.2","million"]},{"entry":["4","Loan","10",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u221220","million","1.2","million"]},{"entry":["5","Loan","10",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u221220","million","1.2","million"]},{"entry":["6","Bond","01",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u221210","million","0.6","million"]},{"entry":["7","Bond","01",{"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007","he":"2.79mm","wi":"1.44mm","file":"US07752091-20100706-P00001.TIF","alt":"custom character","img-content":"character","img-format":"tif"}}},"\u22125","million","0.25","million"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Seven accounting objects are illustrated in the example of Table 1.

Further processors (not shown) may be provided to assemble the financial statement items into appropriate financial statements according to conventional processes.","Returning to , in another embodiment, the FSI generator  may operate according to cardinality rules  that permit the generator  to run consistency checks on FSI objects generated from accounting objects. Cardinality rules  specify limitations on use of key figure data as specified in rules . Cardinality rules  help to ensure that operation of a set of rule steps do not inadvertently perform operations that are disruptive to a reporting function for which the rules were defined. For example, a cardinality rule  may confirm that a debit-credit key figure is assigned once to a balance sheet FSI. Alternatively such a rule  may confirm that a statistical key figure is not assigned to a balance sheet FSI or to a profit\/loss statement FSI. The structure and nature of the cardinality rules  may be determined by the accounting system for which they are defined; they are grounded in business logic of the respective accounting system.","Typically, rules  may be defined when the accounting system  is customized for use in a specific installation. That is, the rules \u2014the conditions and rule steps therein\u2014are directed to data elements that may be unique for a given user. Because individual accounting objects may satisfy conditions of multiple rules, they are subject to errors, which can lead to erroneous reporting. It is expected that the cardinality rules  will be defined prior to customization, will be subject to more rigorous testing and, therefore, will be subject to a lower likelihood of error. Accordingly, the cardinality rules  provide a consistency check mechanism to operation of one or more rule sets .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310","300","320","330","340"]},"Once an accounting object has been considered against all rules in the rule set, the method considers the cardinality rules. It compares the key figure-to-FSI mappings and determines if they satisfy requirements of the cardinality rules (box ). If so, the method may copy the key figures to the FSIs and aggregate them as described herein. Otherwise, the method  may copy the key figures to a default FSI (box ). When integrating the data from the default FSI into the reporting structure, an operator may check whether the total amount stored in this default FSI exceeds a certain level. If so, it may indicate an error within the rule definitions which can reviewed and corrected before generating a revised set of financial statement items. Minor levels in the default FSI may indicate errors that can be ignored. Optionally, the method  may generate an alert (box ) to indicate to an operator that a cardinality rule was violated during generation of the FSIs.","Functionality of the foregoing embodiments may be provided on various computer platforms executing program instructions.
