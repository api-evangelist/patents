title: Providing contextually sensitive tools and help content in computer-generated documents
abstract: A method and system are provided for creation, implementation, and use of computer-generated “smart” documents to which functionality is attached for providing contextually sensitive tools, controls and help content to users of those documents. Portions of documents are annotated with Extensible Markup Language (XML) tags and structure so that when a user enters those portions, such as by placing a computer cursor in those portions, the user is provided contextually sensitive tools, controls and/or help content. A document tools pane may open on the user's computer screen adjacent to the document being edited for providing the document tools, controls or help content related to the context of the text or data in which the cursor is located. If the user moves the cursor to another portion of the document, the user may obtain information associated with the context of the new portion of the document in which the cursor is located.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10\/164,960, filed Jun. 6, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,356,537 which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates to the provision of contextually sensitive tools and help content in computer-generated documents.","Computer software applications allow users to create a variety of documents to assist them in work, education, and leisure. For example, popular word processing applications allow users to create letters, articles, books, memoranda, and the like. Spreadsheet programs allow users to store, manipulate, print, and display a variety of alpha-numeric data. Such applications have a number of well-known strengths, including rich editing, formatting and calculation.","However, documents created by such software applications do not provide users with contextually sensitive tools, help content, or support. That is, as the user is entering text or data into such software applications, these applications do not provide the user with helpful tools or assistance based on the context of the text or data being entered by the user. Internet web-based applications attempt to solve some business problems through the creation and deployment of web-based templates with which users may enter information that may be transmitted to a back-end web server for the purpose of registering the user for some type of service. Such web-based applications often may include links with which the user may navigate to a separate web site for helpful information or assistance with the current web-based application or document in use by the user. However, such web-based applications suffer compared to the aforementioned software application documents in that modern web-based applications seldom offer rich editing, formatting, printing, and calculation.","By way of example, in a typical setting, a user may decide to prepare a resume using a word processing application loaded on her home computer. As the user prepares the resume, she likely will fill in such sections such as \u201cpersonal information,\u201d \u201ceducation,\u201d \u201cexperience,\u201d and \u201cextra-curricular activities.\u201d As the user is completing each of those sections, she may require assistance, including information on the preferred ordering of the sections, information on the preferred number of past jobs to place in the \u201cexperience\u201d section, and the like. In order to receive such assistance, the user likely must read a book on resumes, or go online to an internet-based resume help site for the information.","In contrast, the user may enter an internet-based resume site to complete a resume using a web-based resume template. The user may be allowed to enter specific information in given data fields, and the user may be provided with internet web site links for navigating to sites where she may obtain assistance with various sections of the document. When the user has completed preparation of the web-based resume, the user may be allowed to submit the resume to some web-based job service, or the user may be able to print the template. However, the functionality of the user's word processing application, such as rich editing and formatting of the resume, is likely not available to the user given the limitations of the web-based application in contrast to the user's computer-based word processor.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The present invention provides a method and system for creating, implementing and using computer-generated documents that provide contextually sensitive tools, controls and help content to the user(s) of those documents. Generally described, a schema is attached to a document defining permissible data content, data type and data structure for the document. The document is structured to associate the document with the schema, and a solution is associated with the document structure. A plurality of software components is assembled for providing the solution to the document, and the document is enabled to call the plurality of software components for providing the solution to the document based on an editing position in the document.","After the document is created, a software application for opening the document may be booted to initiate opening the document. A determination is made as to whether the document refers to the solution. A determination is made as to whether the plurality of software components for providing the solution is present in a library of software components. If so, the plurality of software components is called for providing the solution to the document.","Once the document is opened for use, focusing document editing in a particular portion of the document, such as by placing the cursor in a particular portion of the document, causes the generation of a list of Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements enclosing a position of the editing focus. A determination is made as to whether any available solutions are associated with the list of XML elements. If any available solutions are associated with the list of XML elements, each associated solution is called and is obtained for use by the document. Preferably, the solutions comprise help content and document tools associated with the context of the editing position in the document. A graphical user interface is launched for displaying each solution obtained for use by the document.","These and other features, advantages, and aspects of the present invention may be more clearly understood and appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and by references to the appended drawings and claims.","The present invention is directed toward creation, implementation and use of computer-generated \u201csmart\u201d documents to which functionality is attached for providing contextually sensitive tools, help content and controls to users of those documents. According to an embodiment of the invention, portions of documents are structured so that when a user enters those portions, such as by placing a computer cursor in those portions, the document points to a solution that may provide the user contextually sensitive tools and\/or help content. For example, if a user is preparing a resume to assist her in obtaining a job, the user may place her computer cursor in the \u201ceducation\u201d section the resume. According to the present invention, the placement of computer cursor in the \u201ceducation\u201d section may provide the user with contextually sensitive information. The document may point to an overall solution, e.g., a resume document solution, or individual portions of the document may point to contextual subsets of the solution, e.g., and \u201cexperience\u201d section solution of a resume document solution. A document tools pane may open on the user's computer screen adjacent to the document being edited and may provide a narrative on suggested approaches for the completion of the \u201ceducation\u201d section. If the user moves the cursor to another portion of the document, for example to the \u201cobjectives\u201d section of the resume, the user may obtain information associated with that context, such as examples of proper employment objectives statements.","It should be understood that the contextually sensitive tools and help content provided to a user in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may be provided for a variety of software application programs, including word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, text editors, and the like. Moreover, the types and content of helpful information and tools provided to a user according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a variety of tools and actions and help information as desired by the creator of the software applications in use by the user.","Referring to , a computer screen display is illustrated showing an exemplary software application  with which a document and associated document tools pane providing document tools and help content is illustrated. The document  depicted in  shows an employee annual performance review template with which an employ may complete her annual performance review or with which she may complete a performance review of one of her employees. The application  depicted in  is a word processing application used for displaying and editing the document , but as should be understood by those skilled in the art, the application  could include other software applications, including spreadsheet applications, text editing applications, and the like. Moreover, the document  illustrated in  depicts an annual performance review document, but the document  could include a variety of other documents and templates edited by the user, including resume templates, will templates, desktop publishing documents, letters, financial spreadsheets, and the like.","Referring to the exemplary document shown in , the word processing application  provides typical functionality associated with a word processor, accessible via drop down menus such as, File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, etc. The document  is displayed in the work area of the application , and a document tools pane  is illustrated to the right of the document . As should be understood, the display illustrated in  is by way of example only, and the components illustrated in  may be organized in a variety of different ways pleasing to the user. That is, the document tools pane may be located on the bottom of the screen display, to the left of the document , or according to other orientations allowed by the application .","A detailed discussion of the creation and implementation of the \u201csmart\u201d document  illustrated in  follows below, but generally described according to an embodiment of the present invention, once the user places her computer cursor within a particular section of the document , for example the \u201cobjectives\u201d section  illustrated in , the user is provided with tools and help content in the document tools pane . For example, if the user places her computer cursor in the \u201cobjectives\u201d section , the user may be provided with \u201cObjective Writing Tips\u201d  shown in the document tools pane . Selection of the \u201cObjective Writing Tips\u201d , as illustrated in , causes a display of \u201cObjective Writing Tips\u201d text  that provide the user with helpful information as to how to complete the \u201cobjectives\u201d section the performance review document , illustrated in . If the user moves the cursor to a different section of the document, for example the personal information section , information provided in the document tools pane  will be provided to give the user assistance with the completion of the personal information section .","In addition to helpful information to assist the user, a variety of document tools and actions  are provided. For example, the \u201cSubmit Review\u201d action may allow the user to submit the completed document  to her supervisor or to her employee after completion of the document. The \u201cOpen Last Review\u201d action may allow the user to open the last performance review so that she may determine whether she completed her objectives as set forth in the last review. If the document in use by the user is some other type of document, for example a resume document, helpful information in the document tools pane might include information on preparing the \u201ceducation\u201d section, the \u201cexperience\u201d section, and\/or the \u201cpersonal information\u201d section. A will document  might be associated with helpful information regarding legal rules for preparation of wills, rules regarding estate beneficiaries, and the like.","In addition to the document actions and help content illustrated in the pane , a variety of document controls may be provided, including radio buttons, text boxes, check boxes, ActiveX controls, XML tree controls, and the like. For example, a text box may be provided to allow a user to select from a list of pre-written text items. Or, the user may be allowed to enter text in a list box provided in the pane  that will then be inserted into the document or used by the application with respect to some other functionality of the application. A radio button or check box may be provided to allow the user to select from different choices of document actions or help content. For example, if the document is a will, check boxes may be provided with which the user may select \u201cmarried,\u201d \u201csingle,\u201d etc., to obtain help information based on the user's personal will and estate profile.","Referring to , a general system architecture for creating and utilizing a \u201csmart\u201d document  in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. A software application , as described above, is opened on the user's computer  to create or edit a document  according to the present invention. A schema library  is provided for containing all of the executable files required for providing the contextually sensitive functionality to the document . For example, the schema library may include a variety of components, including individual modular software routines that have been compiled and dynamically linked and that are ready to use by the application  for providing contextually sensitive functionality to the document .","Such components may include a number of dynamically-linked libraries (dll), which include executable files or routines stored separately from the software application . The dlls are loaded by the software application  only when they are needed to provide functionality to the document . Additionally, as described in detail below, the schema library  may include a number of Extensible Markup Language (XML) files for providing contextually sensitive functionality in association with XML structure that has been applied to the document .","A solution property  is included in the document  for pointing the document to a particular solution contained in the schema library . The solution location property  provides the document  and the application  with information as to the location of the solution property in the schema library or to a remote location provided via a distributed computing environment, such as is provided from a web-based server via the Internet.","According to the present invention, and as described in detail below, when a user focuses on a particular portion of the document , such as the \u201cobjectives\u201d section of the performance review  illustrated in , a solution property  points the document to the \u201cobjectives\u201d section help solution illustrated in the document tools pane . The solution location  provides the document  and the application  with the location of the components, dlls, or XML files necessary for implementing that solution. As should be understood, exemplary components may include components for drawing the document tools pane , components for displaying the information associated with the particular context, in this case the \u201cobjectives\u201d section, and components for executing document actions such as \u201cSubmit Review\u201d action .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"With reference to , an exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a conventional personal computer , including a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus  that couples the system memory to the processing unit .

At step , a determination is made as to whether the document  refers to a solution. That is, at step , a determination is made as to whether the document  is annotated with pointers to a solution or to multiple solutions for providing contextually sensitive tools and help information to the document, as described above. As a part of the check to determine whether the document  points to a solution or to multiple solutions, a determination is also made as to whether a schema has been attached to the document as described above. If the document does refer to a solution, for example a solution for providing the user with assistance in preparation of the user's employee review document , the method proceeds to step  and the application  calls the schema library  to determine whether the solution referred to by the document  is stored in the schema library . At the schema library, the determination includes a determination as to what components in the schema library are necessary; that is, what components are associated with the solution I.D. For example, the document  may have a schema attached to define the rules governing the XML structure of the document , but that was created without reference to a particular solution.","At step , a determination is made as to whether the solution is stored in the schema library. As should be understood, multiple solutions may be attached to the document . For example, a first solution might include helpful information and actions to provide contextually sensitive information regarding completion of the document  by a particular user. A second solution may be attached to the document  for providing information to a supervisor of the user so that the contextually sensitive information provided to the supervisor will give the supervisor information as to how to evaluate each section of the employee's review document.","If multiple solutions are referred to by the document , a prompt may be provided to the user, such as the dialog box , illustrated in , to notify the user that multiple solutions are available for this document. The user may then select one solution from the list of solutions for providing the desired functionality to the user after the document opens.","At step , a determination is made as to whether the user actually wants the solution to be provided to the user after the document  is opened. As should be understood, a dialog box similar to the dialog box  may be presented to the user to query the user as to whether she desires the help content and tools functionality. The user may have completed the document  on numerous occasions and may not now desire additional help functionality or action functionality. If desired, the user may elect to always receive the solution upon opening the document . Similarly, the user may elect to have the document  via the application  check for updates to the solution each time the document  is opened.","If the user declines the solution, the method proceeds to step , and the document is opened without \u201csmart\u201d document solutions according to the normal procedures required and implemented by the application . If the user does desire the functionality of the solution referred to by the document , the method proceeds to step , and the solution is loaded for use by the application  and document . As should be understood by those skilled in the art, loading the solution includes calls from the document  via the application  to all necessary files, dlls, component add-ins, and XML files associated with the solution and stored in the schema library .","Upon being called by the document , each called file is registered with the application  via the computer's operating system, and a path is established between each called file and the application  and document  for provision of the functionality associated with each file. For example, if a particular dll that is used for drawing the document tools pane  must be assigned a registry key for proper communication with the application  and document , this registration process is performed during the load solution step . At step , the \u201csmart\u201d document  is opened and is displayed on the user's computer screen, as illustrated in .","Referring back to step , if the document does not refer to a solution, the method proceeds to step , and a determination is made as to whether a schema has been attached to the document. If the document has an attached schema, but no reference to a particular solution, the method proceeds to step  and a \u201ccheck\u201d is made of the schema library as to whether a solution does exist that may be associated with the schema that is attached to the document . That is, even where no solution is referred to in the document , the schema library may have solutions that have been obtained by the user of the computer  subsequent to the creation of the document  that may be utilized by the document  even though the document  was not originally created to refer to the solution.","If a solution does exist in the schema library for the document , the method proceeds to step , and the steps thereafter, as described above. If a schema is not attached to the document , the method proceeds to step , and the document is opened without \u201csmart\u201d document solutions.","Referring back to step , if no solution(s) are found in the schema library associated with the solution referred to by the document  or associated with the attached schema, the method proceeds to step , and a determination is made as to whether the user would like to download a solution. At step , the user may be \u201cprompted\u201d by the application  and informed that the document  will work more efficiently, or will be more useful, if the user downloads certain help and action functionality to the user's document . The user may be provided with a \u201cprompt\u201d in the form of a dialog box, such as the dialog box  illustrated in . A number of queries may be made to the user to ask the user whether the user would like components comprising the desired solution to be downloaded according to a number of methods. If the user declines to download solution functionality and components, the method proceeds back to step , and the document is opened without \u201csmart\u201d document solutions as described above.","If the user desires to download the solution(s) offered to the user, the method proceeds to step . At step , components necessary for providing the desired solution(s) to the document  are downloaded to the user's computer  from some remote source, such as a remote web-based server. In order to locate the remote source, the application  uses the solution location pointer  from the document  to locate and obtain the necessary solution components.

The position of the cursor within the XML hierarchy is located, and the X-path expression to get to the position where the cursor is located is determined. For example, referring to the simplified XML code set forth above, the cursor may be located within the \u201ce-mail\u201d tag and inside the larger XML tree within the \u201cemployee review\u201d tag.","At step , a determination is made as to which tools and help content should appear in the document tools pane . To make this determination, the application  enters a look-up table stored on the client computer  that contains information about which XML elements have which particular tools, help content, controls, etc., associated with those XML elements. For example, if the cursor is located in the \u201ce-mail name\u201d element within the \u201cpersonal information\u201d section , the application  will enter the look-up table to determine which particular tools or help content are associated with the e-mail name element.","Each document action, help item, and control associated with each element is populated with a unique identification (ID) associated with each XML element to which it is applied so that the application  may readily locate the actions, help items, or tools associated with the XML element. At step , a determination is made as to whether any of the actions, help items, or controls are dynamic. A control may appear differently based on the context or background information for the context. The \u201cobjectives\u201d section of the review document  may be associated with a \u201cSubmit Review\u201d button when the section is completed. On the other hand, if the section is not completed, the \u201cSubmit Review\u201d button may not appear in the pane  because the document should not be submitted without the completed \u201cobjections\u201d section. Accordingly, the \u201cSubmit Review\u201d button in this case may be identified as dynamic at step , and the method then proceeds to step . At step , the document  via the application  calls the component representing the \u201cSubmit Review\u201d button and provides that component with the context of the cursor position, for example, whether the \u201cobjectives\u201d element has been completed or not.","At step , after a determination has been made that the actions, help content, or controls are static or dynamic, the contents of the document tools pane  are drawn on the user's computer screen adjacent to the document , as illustrated in . At step , a determination is made as to whether the cursor is moved to a new context. For example, after the user completes an entry in the \u201cobjectives\u201d section , the user may move the cursor to the \u201cpersonal information\u201d section  to complete that section. If the cursor does not move, the method proceeds to step  and ends. That is, as long as the cursor stays in the current context, no additional changes are made to the content of the document tools pane . If the cursor is moved to a new context within the document, the method proceeds back to step  where a new list of XML elements containing the cursor is generated, and the method proceeds on as described above to provide new content in the document tools pane  associated with the new position and context of the cursor.","Referring back to , the following is a description of the tools and help content drawn in the document tools pane . The particular text and controls illustrated in  are by way of example only, and vary with the context of the cursor position as described above. The name  is a name for the document XML element associated with the actions and tools shown in the document tools pane . The name may refer to the schema that is attached to the document, for example, employee performance review form, or the name  may refer to the XML element in which the cursor is currently located. For example, if the cursor is located in the \u201cobjectives\u201d section, the name  may be re-drawn as \u201cobjectives section.\u201d The document actions  are displayed based on the cursor context and based on whether the actions are static or dynamic. As set forth above, the \u201cSubmit Review\u201d action, for example, may be a dynamic action that is not displayed in the document actions pane  if all required sections of the document  have not been completed. The \u201cLast Years Objectives\u201d help topic  is shown in a collapsed display. Selecting the \u201c+\u201d expands the help topic to display additional sub-topics contained therein. The \u201cObjective Writing Tips\u201d help topic is shown in an expanded view, showing the full content  available under that help topic. If an XML element within the document  has no \u201csmart\u201d document actions or tools associated with it, that XML element is not shown or identified in the document tools pane .","Help topics and tools may be nested, meaning that sub-help topics and sub-actions may be included in help topics and document tools. If the cursor is in multiple elements because of nesting, then the number of sections in the document tools pane  can be greater than two. In this case, the nested elements are shown in order of nesting where the outermost element is at the top of the document tools pane  and innermost element is at the bottom of the document tools pane . If the elements, actions, tools, and help content do not fit on one page, a scroll bar may be provided, as illustrated in , that will extend over the entire document tools pane . Action and help content are listed in the order in which the dlls, or components that provide them to the document  return their names in response to a call from the application . According to one embodiment, XML elements that are not associated with actions, controls or help topics are not shown to the user. If desired, however, all XML elements may be shown in the pane  to make the user aware of the complete XML structure of the document .","Accordingly, after the document  is opened, and the \u201csmart\u201d document solution is loaded and implemented as described above, the user of the document  may now enter the document and complete the document with the help of the \u201csmart\u201d document functionality provided in the document tools pane . As the user moves the computer cursor through various sections of the document that are tagged with XML structure, the user may be provided with helpful information and tools associated with that portion of the document.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications or variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.
