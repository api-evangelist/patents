{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) from commonly owned U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/228,814 filed Jul. 27, 2009, entitled LIQUID METAL CLAMP AND FIBER CLEAVING USING SAME, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present inventive concepts relate to the field of fiber optics, and more particularly to the field of system and methods for preparing and processing optical fibers.","In conventional fiber cleavers, a first portion of a fiber is mechanically clamped by a first clamp and then a second portion of the fiber is mechanically clamped by a second clamp. Once both clamps are secured to the fiber, one clamp is selectively moved away (or translated) from the other clamp until a proper amount of tension is applied to the fiber, between the clamps.","Once the proper amount of tension is applied, a surface of the fiber is scored with, for example, an ultrasonic diamond blade. Given the tension, the scoring of the fiber surface causes a crack to propagate through the fiber\u2014achieving a cleave of the fiber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","2","3","4","3"]},"The stripped portion of the fiber  is held by two clamps  and . A first portion of fiber  is positioned in a bottom portion of clamp  and then a top portion of clamp  is closed to secure the first portion of fiber . Fiber  is clamped in clamp  the same way. That is, a second portion of fiber  is positioned in a bottom portion of clamp  and then a top portion of clamp  is closed to secure the second portion of fiber . Clamp  can be translated away from clamp  to apply a controlled and accurate amount of tension to the fiber , between the clamps , .","Presuming the fiber is tensioned between the two clamps  and , the stripped portion of the fiber  between the clamps , can be cleaved. A slider  includes a hard, sharp blade (e.g., an ultrasonic vibrating diamond blade) that gets placed in contact the with the fiber  when the slider is moved in the direction of the fiber, within tracks . The blade  scores a surface of the fiber and the tension applied to the fiber causes a crack originating at the score to propagate through the fiber, resulting in a cleave.","In an ideal situation, the cleave is perfectly perpendicular to a central axis (and surface) of the fiber. However, the ideal is not practically achievable, largely because clamping with the second clamp causes a small, yet important, torsion to the fiber. The torsion causes the propagation of the crack to be slightly off perpendicular.","When the ends of two fibers being spliced together are not perfectly perpendicular with respect to their surfaces, the imperfect junction of the fibers adversely impacts the transmission properties of the spliced fiber.","The problem of torsion from the second clamp exists with fibers having a circular cross section. This problem is further exacerbated with fibers having other than circular cross sections and multi-strand or bundled fibers.","In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, provided is a clamp system. The system includes a first clamp configured to hold a first portion of a set of fibers and a second clamp configured to hold a second portion of the set of fibers. The second clamp includes a liquid metal that takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of the second portion of the set of fibers and that takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the second portion of the set of fibers.","The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.","The system can further comprise a temperature controller arranged to transition the liquid metal to the first temperature.","The temperature controller can include a Peltier heat pump.","The temperature controller can be further arranged to transition the liquid metal to the second temperature.","The system can further comprise a container arranged to contain the liquid metal in the liquid form.","The set of fibers can be vertically oriented and the container can be a bowl.","Alternatively, the set of fibers can be horizontally oriented and the container can be a trough.","The liquid metal can be a metal alloy.","The metal alloy can consist of a Bi\u2014In\u2014Sn fusible alloy, wherein the state change temperature can be about 174\u00b0 F.","The set of fibers can be a single fiber.","The single fiber can be a large diameter fiber having a diameter of at least 40 \u03bcm.","The single fiber can have a non-circular cross section.","The set of fibers can comprise multiple fibers.","The multiple fibers can comprise a center fiber and a plurality of fibers distributed about the center fiber.","The liquid metal can apply a substantially uniform compressive force to the set of fibers.","The liquid metal can take an initial form of an ingot.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a method of clamping a set of fibers. The method comprises clamping a first portion of the set of fibers with a first clamp and clamping a second portion of the set of fibers with a second clamp that is a liquid metal clamp. Clamping the second portion of the set of fibers with a second clamp includes: providing a liquid metal in a liquid form at a first temperature; positioning the second portion of the set of fibers in the liquid metal in the liquid form; and transitioning the liquid metal to a second temperature so that the liquid metal takes a solid form, thereby securing the second portion of the set of fibers.","The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a fiber clamp, comprising a liquid metal disposed in a container, wherein the liquid metal takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of a portion of a set of fibers and takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the portion of the set of fibers.","The clamp can further comprise a temperature controller arranged to transition the liquid metal to the first temperature.","The temperature controller can include a Peltier heat pump.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, provided is a fiber cleaver. The cleaver includes a first clamp configured to hold a first portion of a set of fibers, a second clamp configured to hold a second portion of the set of fibers. and a blade configured to score the at least one fiber to generate a cleave in the at least one fiber. The second clamp includes a liquid metal that takes a liquid form at a first temperature for receipt of the second portion of the set of fibers and that takes a solid form at a second temperature to secure the second portion of the set of fibers.","The first temperature can be above a state change temperature of the liquid metal and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.","The clamped set of fibers is maintained with an amount of torsion such that the cleave can be off from perpendicular relative to a surface of the fiber by 0.2 degrees or less.","The system can further include a heat pump arranged to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature.","The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature in response to a first voltage.","The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the second temperature in response to a second voltage.","The second voltage can have about the same magnitude as the first voltage, with an opposite polarity.","The first temperature can be about 40\u00b0 F. higher than the second temperature.","At least one of the first and second clamps can be configured to tension the set of fibers.","The tensioning can be controlled by a controller and the tension can be a predetermined amount of tension for the set of fibers.","The set of fibers can be a single fiber.","The set of fibers can be multiple fibers.","Hereinafter, aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith, with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments, detailed descriptions of well-known items, functions, or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another, but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example, a first element can be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element can be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., \u201cbetween\u201d versus \u201cdirectly between,\u201d \u201cadjacent\u201d versus \u201cdirectly adjacent,\u201d etc.).","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding,\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Spatially relative terms, such as \u201cbeneath,\u201d \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cupper\u201d and the like may be used to describe an element and\/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and\/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and\/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d and\/or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements or features would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["5","3","7","8"]},"In the various embodiments, the fiber  can be a single fiber of small or large diameter, e.g., diameters above 40 \u03bcm. The fiber  can have a circular cross section or a non-circular cross section (e.g., oval). The fiber  can be a plurality of fibers, e.g., a ribbon or bundle of fibers. The plurality of fibers can, for example, include a center fiber and a plurality of fibers distributed about the center fiber (in parallel). The fiber or plurality of fibers can be collectively referred to as a \u201cset of fibers.\u201d The set of fibers can include any known fiber or plurality of fibers, and those developed hereafter.","Unlike , in  the fiber ,  (or set of fibers) and holding and cleaving elements are vertically oriented so that a second portion of the fiber  can be positioned in the liquid metal clamp  of this embodiment. Fiber  is fiber  without the casing or cladding (e.g., stripped). Liquid metal clamp  includes a bowl  within which a liquid metal  is maintained. In this embodiment, the liquid metal  can take a liquid form at a first temperature and take a solid form at a second temperature. The first temperature can be above a state change temperature and the second temperature can be below the state change temperature.","A temperature controller  can be included and arranged to bring the liquid metal  to the first temperature that is above the state change temperature, so that the liquid metal  takes a liquid form. When the liquid metal is in the liquid form, a second portion of the fiber is positioned in the liquid metal , within bowl . The liquid metal is then brought to a second temperature, above the state change temperature, so that it takes a solid form.","The liquid metal can be allowed to cool to reach the second temperature or it can be cooled using a cooling mechanism, e.g., using temperature controller  or a cooling mechanism that generates a flow of cool air or a gas (e.g., using a fan). If unassisted cooling is used, the temperature controller can be used to bring the liquid metal just above the state change temperature, e.g., by 10 degrees F. or less, so that it transitions below the state change temperature more quickly. This approach could be used with assisted cooling as well. Ten degrees F. above state change temperature is not, however, a restriction for purposes of the present invention.","In the preferred form, the liquid metal is a Bi\u2014In\u2014Sn fusible alloy, Bi is Bismuth, In is Indium, and Sn is Tin. In this embodiment, the Bi\u2014In\u2014Sn fusible alloy includes 57% Bi, 26% In, and 17% Sn, which has a state change temperature of about 174\u00b0 F. One advantage of this alloy is that it is free of hazardous materials, making its handing, use, and disposal relatively uncomplicated by special hazardous material requirements and procedures.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many other alloys could be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, the liquid metal could be a Bi\u2014Sn solder alloy, e.g., with 58% Bi and 42% Sn, and a state change temperature of 138\u00b0 F. As another example, the liquid metal could be a Bi\u2014In\u2014Pb\u2014Sn fusible alloy, e.g., with 59% Bi. 21% In, 18% Pb (Lead), and 12% Sn, and a state change temperature of 136\u00b0 F. As another example, the liquid metal could be a Bi\u2014Pb\u2014Sn alloy, e.g., with 52.5% Bi, 32.0% Pb, and 15.5% Sn. At the end of this specification are Addendum datasheets providing examples of metal alloys that can be used for the liquid metal clamping, in accordance with the present invention.","In the preferred form, the selection criteria for a metal alloy are:\n\n","The Bi\u2014In\u2014Sn fusible alloy properties presently seem to be the best with regard to the above criteria. But other criteria could lead to a different selection.","There is another class of materials which might be used as the liquid metal, i.e., metals which are liquid at or near room temperature (or even below). These include Gallium and many of its alloys. In this case, it would not be necessary to heat the material to melt it, only to cool it for solidification. Mercury also might be considered, but is undesirable due to its very high toxicity. It is also possible that Mercury would not function well as a clamp, as it is known to exhibit negligible wetting of glass, unlike Gallium which wets glass aggressively or Indium which does so to a lesser degree.","In other embodiments, the liquid metal could include non-metals, such as glues, epoxies, etc. Thus, the term \u201cliquid metal\u201d as used herein can encompass non-metals. In such cases, if the non-metal is initially in a liquid form, the temperature controller could be used to produce either heating or cooling, as required, to bring the non-metal to a solid form.","The temperature controller  can be a Peltier heat pump, as an example, which is known in the art. The heat pump can be configured to bring the liquid metal to the first temperature in response to a first voltage. The heat pump can also be configured to bring the liquid metal to the second temperature in response to a second voltage. The second voltage can have about the same magnitude as the first voltage, with an opposite polarity. The first temperature can be about 40\u00b0 F. higher than the second temperature, in one embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 2","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"],"b":["50","56","56","52","52","56","2","56"],"sup":"3"},"For small diameter fibers (e.g. less than 40 \u03bcm in diameter), a cleave that is two degrees or less off perpendicular is desirable.

The clamp achieved by the liquid metal  when achieving the solid state provides a fiber-confirming, substantially uniform force clamp\u2014substantially torsion free.
