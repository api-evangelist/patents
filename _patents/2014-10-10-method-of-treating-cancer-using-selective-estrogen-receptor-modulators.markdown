The present invention also relates to methods of treating subjects suffering from a cancer that is resistant to an estrogen receptor modulator by administering a SERM to the subject.","The estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand dependent transcription factor whose expression confers upon target cells the ability to respond to estrogens. In the absence of an activating ligand, ER resides in the cell in an inactive form within a large inhibitory protein complex. Upon binding ligand, however, the receptor undergoes an activating conformational change resulting in its release from the inhibitory protein complex, spontaneous dimerization and subsequent interaction with enhancers located within target genes. Depending on the promoter context of the bound receptor, and the co factors that are recruited to the receptor in a particular cell, it can either positively or negatively regulate target gene transcription. Thus, the same ER-ligand complex can have very different activities in different cells, an observation that explains how estrogens, generally considered to be reproductive hormones, exhibit activities in bone, the cardiovascular system and in brain that are unrelated to reproductive function.","Whereas the molecular determinants of ER action differ considerably between target cells, it has been anticipated that the exploitation of this complexity will yield pharmaceuticals with process or tissue selective activities. The first evidence in support of this hypothesis came from studies that probed the pharmacological activities of the \u2018antiestrogen\u2019 tamoxifen. Identified as a high affinity antagonist of ER and developed as a treatment for ER-positive breast cancer, it soon became apparent that whereas tamoxifen could oppose estrogen action in the breast it exhibited agonist activity in the bone, uterus and in the cardiovascular system. Reflecting this spectrum of activities, tamoxifen was reclassified as a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM).","The increasing incidence of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) is an emerging challenge in the treatment of advanced breast cancer patients. The growing success of improved treatments of systemic disease has allowed the manifestation of BCBM that previously would not have impacted the morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer. The privileged environment of the brain, maintained by the relatively non-porous blood brain barrier, presents a significant impediment to the successful targeting of BCBM, leading to the use of gamma knife surgery and\/or whole brain radiation in an attempt to shrink or ablate brain lesions. The benefit of these treatments must be carefully balanced with neurological deficit as a result of treatment.","Although considerable advances have been made in targeting the estrogen signaling axis for the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis, similar progress has unfortunately not yet been accomplished in the development of safe and effective treatments for the climacteric conditions or vasomotor disturbances that are associated with estrogen deprivation. There is considerable interest in developing novel SERMs that can be used to treat vasomotor symptoms but which do not exhibit mitogenic activities in the breast or the uterus.","While tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors have proven effective in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, the incidence of resistance remains significant, particularly in the advanced\/metastatic breast cancer setting. An additional class of estrogen receptor targeting therapy, selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), has recently come to prominence. These agents have proven effective in pre-clinical models of breast cancers that are resistant to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, leading to their evaluation in clinical trials. However, these agents also do not readily pass the blood brain barrier, suggesting that they will be ineffective in targeting BCBM. It would be beneficial to have other treatment options that can penetrate the blood brain barrier and\/or selectively target tissue specific activities responsive to ER activation.","The present invention is directed to a method of treating estrogen receptor positive cancers of the brain in a subject.

The methods involve administering to the subject a SERM, such as RAD 1901. RAD 1901 exhibits desired pharmacological activities and exhibits significant brain penetrance when evaluated in post-menopausal women, in particular a unique dose response, with lower doses of the drug being more effective at relieving hot flashes. RAD 1901 induces hot flashes in healthy postmenopausal women in a dose dependent manner, thus RAD 1901 may effectively inhibit estrogen receptor action in the brain.","Turnover of ER\u03b1 is significantly increased upon binding RAD1901, an activity that is more pronounced at higher drug concentrations (). This drug exhibits some of the characteristics that are generally attributed to selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). Thus, at lower doses RAD1901 exhibits partial agonist activity, i.e., SERM activity, allowing for relief of hot flashes, but the SERD activity of the compound dominates when the receptor is exposed to higher concentrations. The present disclosure describes in vitro the mechanism by which RAD1901 impacts ER expression and investigates the possible result of such action in vivo.","As exemplified below, RAD 1901 surprisingly has the ability to degrade the estrogen receptor. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have since shown that the antagonist activity of this ligand correlates with estrogen receptor degradation in a dose dependent manner. RAD 1901 also inhibits estrogen dependent growth of breast cancer xenograft tumors and may be used to treat breast cancer, such as tamoxifen resistant breast cancer.","RAD 1901 is unique among both SERMs and SERDs in that this drug accumulates in the brain, an environment in which SERM penetration has been historically regarded as quite low. Estrogen receptor activity has been found to be important in the growth of tumors resistant to aromatase inhibitors and\/or tamoxifen, and treatment with SERDs has been shown to have clinical benefit. While the revelation that RAD 1901 exhibits SERD activity certainly suggests potential utility in the treatment of progressing ER+ breast tumors, which was unappreciated prior to the present disclosure, the targeting of ER activity for the treatment of ER+ brain cancers represents a new frontier for the use of both SERMs and SERDs, as RAD 1901 represents the first SERM\/SERD that can sufficiently penetrate the brain to exhibit efficacy. Because BCBM is generally diagnosed late in the disease progression of ER+ metastatic breast cancer, patients will in general have already been treated with endocrine therapeutics (i.e. tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors). Thus, while SERMs such as tamoxifen have low brain penetration and have exhibited efficacy in anecdotal cases of BCBM that are detailed in the literature, the SERD activity of RAD 1901 becomes key to the therapeutic potential of this compound for treatment of BCBM, as SERDs have been found to be effective in breast cancers that are resistant to SERM or aromatase inhibitor therapy.","The terms \u201ccomprise(s),\u201d \u201cinclude(s),\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201chas,\u201d \u201ccan,\u201d \u201ccontain(s),\u201d and variants thereof, as used herein, are intended to be open-ended transitional phrases, terms, or words that do not preclude the possibility of additional acts or structures.

An effective amount of the compound may be administered.","(a) Dosages","In general, the dosage of administered SERM will vary depending upon such factors as the patient's age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition and previous medical history. Typically, it is desirable to provide the recipient with a dosage of SERM which is in the range of from about 1 pg\/kg to 10 mg\/kg (amount of agent\/body weight of patient), although a lower or higher dosage also may be administered as circumstances dictate. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be tested; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the present invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.","An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the SERM is a dose of between 0.1 and 200 mg\/kg, for example between 0.1 and 10 mg\/kg, or about 20 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg. The therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the SERM may be between 1 and 200 mg\/kg, 10 and 200 mg\/kg, 20 and 200 mg\/kg, 50 and 200 mg\/kg, 75 and 200 mg\/kg, 100 and 200 mg\/kg, 150 and 200 mg\/kg, 50 and 100 mg\/kg, 5 and 10 mg\/kg, or 1 and 10 mg\/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated.","In some embodiments, the SERM can be administered to a patient in an amount of about 10 mg\/day to about 500 mg\/day, about 10 mg\/day to about 200 mg\/day (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 mg\/day), 20 mg\/day to about 100 mg\/day, 100 mg\/day to about 200 mg\/day, or about 200 mg\/day to about 500 mg\/day (e.g., 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, or 700 mg\/day), inclusive of any single or multi-dose daily administration regimen that falls within that total daily dose range. In some embodiments, the dose is from about 20 mg\/day to about 100 mg\/day. Additionally, one of ordinary skill in the art would also know how to adjust or modify variables such as dosage, dosage schedules, and routes of administration, as appropriate, for a given subject.","Further, the SERM dose may be determined by a person skilled in the art and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the SERM to elicit a desired response in the individual. The dose is also one in which toxic or detrimental effects, if any, of the SERM are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.","(b) Rad 1901","The SERM may be RAD 1901. Although RAD 1901 may effectively treat vasomotor symptoms, its pharmacology is complex. Treatment of ER positive breast cancer cells with RAD 1901 in MCF7 and BT483 cells resulted in a pronounced dose dependent down regulation of the receptor expression. RAD 1901 is a unique SERM in that it apparently has a relative agonist\/antagonist activity in the brain that is determined by dose. At low doses RAD 1901, behaves as a SERM as it exhibits estrogenic activity. At high doses, RAD 1901 may function as a SERD, reversing the response.","While targeting of the estrogen signaling axis has proven effective in the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis, implementing a safe therapy that mitigates the vasomotor. While efforts are being made to address this unmet medical need using tissue specific estrogen complexes (TSECs) that combine estrogens and SERMs with the intention of inhibiting estrogen action only in some tissues (i.e. breast and uterus), preliminary clinical data suggest that RAD 1901 may accomplish the same medical goal without exposing the patient to estrogen. The apparent dose dependent down regulation of ER by RAD1901 suggest that at a therapeutic (low) dose, RAD1901 may be mediating some level of agonist activity, while a higher dose results in more extensive SERM activity and an effective blockade in estrogen signaling, thereby exacerbating vasomotor symptoms.","In some embodiments, a low dose of RAD 1901 may be about 0 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 0 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 0 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 0 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 0 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg, about 2 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 2 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 2 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 2 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 2 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg, about 3 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 3 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 3 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 3 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 3 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg, about 4 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 4 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 4 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 4 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 4 mg\/kg to about 5 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg to about 25 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 5 mg\/kg to about 7.5 mg\/kg.

In some embodiments, the dose is from about 20 mg\/day to about 100 mg\/day. Additionally, one of ordinary skill in the art would also know how to adjust or modify variables such as dosage, dosage schedules, and routes of administration, as appropriate, for a given subject.","The methods described above may be used to treat an estrogen receptor positive cancer of the brain. In some embodiments, the cancer may include subtypes of brain tumors that may express ER, such as Breast Cancer Brain Metastases (BCBM), Astrocytoma, Chondrosarcoma, Craniopharyngioma, Glioblastoma, Glioma, Hemangioma, Medulloblastoma, Meningioma, Neurofibroma, Neuronal and Mixed Neuronal-Glial Tumors, Oligoastrocytoma, Pituitary Tumor, PNET\u2014(primitive neuroectodermal tumor), Schwannomak, or Leptomeningeal metastases.

ER expression is retained in 50-65% of BCBM that arise from ER+\/PR+ tumors, despite treatment of the initial tumor with endocrine therapies. As many as 50% of BCBM express the estrogen receptor, and the brain is an environment rich in aromatase activity, suggesting that estrogen levels and signaling may be of importance in the establishment and maintenance of BCBM. Therefore, the availability of the SERM, such as RAD 1901 or a similar SERM with significant brain penetrance, that can induce estrogen receptor turnover in BCBM may provide therapeutic benefit in the treatment of BCBM.","(b) Astrocytoma","Astrocytoma is a type of cancer of the brain that originate in astrocytes, which are a particular kind of glial cells, start-shaped brains cells in the cerebrum. Low ERb expression has been shown to be associated with the progression of astrocytoma.","(c) Chondrosarcoma","Chondrosarcoma is a type of tumor that affects the bones and joints.

Glioma may be responsive to tamoxifen treatment.","(g) Hemangioma","Hemangioma is a benign and usually self-involuting tumor (swelling or growth) of the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. Hemangioma is characterized by increased number of normal or abnormal vessels filled with blood. Human vascular endothelial cells express ER isoforms and are responsive to tamoxifen treatment. Hemangioma may be intracranial hemangiomas or cutaneous hemangiomas.","(h) Medulloblastoma","Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant primary brain tumor that originates in the cerebellum or posterior fossa. Medulloblastomas may originate from immature or embryonal cells at their earliest stage of development. Medulloblastoma may express ER isoforms.

Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), etc. Methods of administering a prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the SERM include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural administration, intratumoral administration, and mucosal administration (e.g., intranasal and oral routes).","The methods described above may include a combination treatment of the compound of formula I with other drugs and\/or other conventional cancer therapies, such as hormone therapy.","(a) Combination Drugs","The methods may further include administering an effective amount of at least one compound of a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor (CDK4\/6 inhibitor), an antiestrogen, a ligand of retinoic acid or retinoic X receptor, an antiprogestin, an antiandrogen, vitamin D or metabolite thereof, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, a PPAR\u03b1 or gamma agonist and a MAP kinase inhibitor.","(b) Conventional Cancer Therapies","Conventional cancer therapies may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Examples of surgery include open craniotomy with maximal excision, which may be followed by radiation therapy. Examples of radiation therapy include whole-brain irradiation, fractionated radiotherapy, and radiosurgery, such as stereotactic radiosurgery, e.g., Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Examples of chemotherapy include anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Doxil), epirubicin (Ellence), and daunorubicin (Cerubidine, DaunoXome), capecitabine (Xeloda), carboplatin (Paraplatin), cisplatin, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), eribulin (Halaven), fluorouracil (also called 5-fluorouracil or 5-FU; Adrucil), gemcitabine (Gemzar), ixabepilone (Ixempra), methotrexate (Amethopterin, Mexate, Folex), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), mutamycin (Mitomycin), taxanes, such as paclitaxel (Taxol, Abraxane), and docetaxel (Taxotere), thiotepa (Thioplex), vincristine (Oncovin, Vincasar PES, Vincrex), and vinorelbine (Navelbine). Examples of targeted therapy include trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib (Tykerb), bevacizumab (Avastin), pertuzumab (Perjeta), and everolimus (Afinitor).","i. Endocrine Therapy (Hormone Therapy)","Endocrine therapy, also known as hormonal therapy, hormone therapy, and hormone treatment, is a treatment that adds, blocks, or removes hormones. For example, hormones may be given to adjust low hormone levels. Synthetic hormones or other drugs may be given to block the body's natural hormones to slow or stop the growth of certain cancers (such as prostate and breast cancer). Endocrine therapy may also include surgery to remove the gland that makes a certain hormones.","Examples of hormone therapy include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, endoxifene, toremifene, lasofoxifene, pipendoxifene, bazedoxifene, and ospemifene, aromatase inhibitors, such anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, formestane, fadrozole, aminoglutethimide, and testolactone, a HER2 intervention drug, such as a HER2 inhibitor, such as Herceptin (trastuzumab), pertuzumab, and lapatinib, and estrogen-receptor downregulators, such as fulvestrant (ICI 182,780).","The methods described above are directed to treating a subject with a SERM. The subject treated by the methods described above may be a subject or patient suffering from or at risk of suffering from an estrogen receptor positive cancer of the brain, such as BCBM, or a cancer that is resistant to an estrogen receptor modulator, such as tamoxifen resistant breast cancer. The subject may be diagnosed or identified as having or at risk of having cancer using known methods and assays, such as a biopsy. The subject may be treated with SERM alone or in combination with another drug and\/or conventional cancer therapy, as described above. The subject may be treated with the SERM as a neoadjuvant therapy or post-surgery. The present invention has multiple aspects, illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.","The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following examples, which are presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","48 hours prior to treatment, MCF7 cells were plated in phenol red free DMEM\/F12 media supplemented with 8% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. After 20 hours of treatment with the indicated ligands, i.e., estradiol (\u201cE2\u201d; Sigma-Aldrich), antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (\u201cICI\u201d; Sigma-Aldrich), and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (\u201c4OHT\u201d; Sigma-Aldrich), (0-1 \u03bcM), cells were washed and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 0.02% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA). 50 ug of cleared lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot detection of ER\u03b1 or cytokeratin 18 (loading control), as illustrated in .","A total of 90 female Nu\/Nu mice were ovariectomized and implanted subcutaneous simultaneously with an estrogen pellet (Innovative Research of America) releasing 0.72 mg estradiol (E2) over 60 days. 2 days later an approximately 6 mmfragment of an MCF7 xenograft tumor (isolated from a recently sacrificed estrogen treated nu\/nu mouse) was inserted subcutaneous into the axial mammary gland. Tumor growth (by caliper measurement) and animal body weight were monitored 3\u00d7 weekly until tumor volume reached \u02dc0.2 cm. Mice (n\u02dc10) were randomized to the following groups: estrogen control (corn oil vehicle), E2+RAD 1901 (20 mg\/kg; Radius Health, Inc.), E2+Tamoxifen (20 mg\/kg; Sigma-Aldrich). Treatments were formulated in sterile corn oil and were administered daily by subcutaneous injection. After 3 weeks of treatments, animals were euthanized and serum and tissues saved for analysis.  depicts tumor volume analyzed using non-linear curve fit and exponential growth calculation (Graphpad Prism), followed by two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni analysis.","While the reduced levels of ER following treatment with RAD 1901 results in receptor degradation, whether the drug influences the transcriptional activity of the gene encoding ER was determined. () MCF7 cells were pre-treated with Vehicle (Veh) or translation (cyclohexamide\u2014CHX, 10 \u03bcg\/ml), proteasome (MG132, 30 \u03bcM) or transcription (Actinomycin D\u2014Actin. D, 100 ng\/ml) inhibitors for 2 hours prior to 6 hours of treatment with RAD 1901 (0.1 or 1 \u03bcM), or 0.1 \u03bcM ICI 182,780 (ICI) or raloxifene (Ral).  shows ER\u03b1 protein expression in whole cell extracts was analyzed by immunoblot, as in Example 1.  shows cells treated, as indicated, were washed in PBS prior to lysis. RNA isolation (BioRad) and reverse transcription (iScript; BioRad) were performed per kit manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR of cDNA was done using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) per kit instructions and performed using the iCycler optical system with associated software (Bio-Rad). mRNA abundance was calculated using the \u0394\u0394CT method to normalize ER\u03b1 mRNA expression to similarly detected housekeeping gene 36B4.","A series of short peptides whose ability to interact with ER\u03b1 is influenced by the nature of the bound ligand were previously identified (see Chang et al. Methods Enzymol. (2003) 364:118-42; Huang et al. Mol Endocrinol. (2002) 16(8):1778-92; Connor et al. Cancer Res. (2001) 61(7):2917-22; Chang et al. Mol Cell Biol. (1999) 19(12):8226-39; and Norris et al. Science (1999) 285(5428):744-6). The interaction of these \u201cconformational probes\u201d can be measured in vitro or within intact cells and thus enables the definition of ligand induced conformational changes in the receptor. This is significant, since differences in receptor conformation facilitate the engagement of different coregulatory proteins resulting in different pharmacological activities. Application of this technology has led to the determination that their impact on receptor structure is a distinguishing feature of ER ligands.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0163"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"The complex pharmacological activities exhibited by RAD 1901 suggest that it will exhibit a unique gene expression profile in target cells. A recent extensive microarray analysis has identified \u201csentinel\u201d subsets of ER-responsive genes that can differentiate between ER agonists, SERMs and SERDs. For example, some of these are responsive to only the SERM tamoxifen, while others display a graded response to SERMs with varying agonist\/antagonist potential, and yet others are repressed by agonists or SERMs and are induced only by SERDs. RAD 1901 exhibits dose dependent agonist\/antagonist regulation of ER transactivation of target genes (). MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated 24 hours with RAD 1901 (0-1 \u03bcM) in the presence or absence of 17\u03b2-estradiol (1 nM). RNA isolation and the analysis of the expression of target genes Anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) and KCNK6 was conducted as in Example 3.","It is understood that the foregoing detailed description and accompanying examples are merely illustrative and are not to be taken as limitations upon the scope of the invention, which is defined solely by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
