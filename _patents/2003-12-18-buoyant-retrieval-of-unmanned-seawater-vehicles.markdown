title: Buoyant retrieval of unmanned seawater vehicles
abstract: An unmanned sea vehicle is provided with a canister storing therein a net assembly in a deflated condition attached to the sea vehicle through the canister by a lanyard in a folded condition. The net assembly is connected to an inflation gas generator through which it is inflated to initiate retrieval of the unmanned sea vehicle. Inflation of the net assembly effects ejection thereof from the canister afloat onto a body of seawater, while connected to the canister on the sea vehicle by the unfolded lanyard. The floating net assembly is thereby positioned for engagement by a grappling hook lowered from a helicopter for example so as to lift it with the sea vehicle suspended therefrom by the lanyard from the sea water surface and transferred to the deck of a retrieval sea vessel.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to retrieval of unmanned vehicles from a body of water.","Systems or methods currently provide for retrieval of floating objects or vehicles such as small boats from a body of seawater, involving use of a crane on a retrieval ship from which an attachment device, such as a hook, is lowered into engagement with the floating object to life it from the body of seawater.","Current retrieval systems involve personnel controlled hook attachment to and operator controlled maneuvering of the floating object to be retrieved such as a small boat, in an effort to reduce substantial movement of the floating object relative to the retrieval ship under high sea states caused by sea waves and winds. Such retrieval systems frequently exhibit difficulties in performance of their retrieval functions, which are rendered slow and inefficient.","It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a system for retrieval of small unmanned vehicles from seawater onto the deck of a retrieval ship in a more simple and efficient manner. Toward those ends, the unmanned sea vehicle to be retrieved has a storage canister installed thereon within which a net assembly is stored in a deflated condition connected to a rope or cable lanyard in a folded condition and connected to a gas generator. Such unmanned sea vehicle undergoes retrieval from a location, either afloat on the seawater or submerged therein. Retrieval is initiated by inflation of the net assembly with pressurized gas from the gas generator causing ejection to the net assembly from the storage canister a substantial distance determined by the length of the unfolding lanyard, sufficient to accommodate engagement of the expanded net assembly when afloat on the body of seawater by a grappling hook selectively dropped thereon from a retrieval ship or helicopter. The net assembly is then lifted from the seawater through the grappling hook with the sea vehicle to be retrieved suspended therebelow by its attachment thereto through the lanyard, for transfer onto the deck of the retrieval ship.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrates an unmanned sea vehicle  afloat on a body of seawater , with a storage canister  mounted on the vehicle  through which it is to be retrieved pursuant to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , the canister  encloses and stores therein a buoyant net assembly  in a deflated condition. Such deflated net assembly  is shown directly connected to a gas cylinder  for inflation thereof, and is connected by a rope or cable lanyard  in a folded condition to the canister . The lanyard  maintains the net assembly  attached to the canister  when injected from the canister  by inflation with pressurized gas from the gas cylinder . When the net assembly  is fully inflated as shown in , it acts as an inflated life raft floating on the body of seawater  and attached by the unfolded lanyard  to the sea vehicle  through the canister .","The net assembly  includes an outer tube ring  attached to the lanyard . Such ring  is formed from a tube inflated to a diameter (d) of 6\u201312 inches for example so as to extend into its overall ring shape of approximately 20 to 30 feet in length (l) as shown in . Suspended inside the ring  is netting  of a strength sufficient to support the weight of the vehicle  when suspended therebelow by the lanyard  which is also of sufficient strength for such purpose as hereinafter explained.","The lanyard  is long enough to allow the inflated net assembly  to float on the surface of the body of seawater  spaced from the unmanned vehicle  with clearance as shown in . The floating net assembly  has a low flexible profile to provide a large target for a grappling hook  shown being lowered onto the net assembly  by a cable  from a suitable location thereabove such as a ship deck, a crane, a harpoon gun or a helicopter. Once the grappling hook  engages the netting  of the net assembly , it lifts the net assembly  through the cable  with the unmanned vehicle  suspended therefrom by the lanyard  as shown in . The vehicle  is thereby deposited onto the deck of a retrieval ship  as shown in .","According to another embodiment as illustrated in , the canister  is positioned on a submerged vehicle \u2032, from which the net assembly  is deployed and floats onto the surface of the body of seawater . The deployed net assembly  may then be engaged by the grappling hook  to lift the vehicle \u2032 out of the body of seawater  for deposit onto the retrieval ship . Thus, the submerged type of unmanned vehicle \u2032 may be retrieved from its underwater location without surfacing before grappling hook  is lowered into engagement with the floating net assembly  to lift it from the seawater surface with the sea vehicle \u2032 suspended therebelow by the lanyard .","It will therefore be apparent from the foregoing description that the floating unmanned vehicle  or the underwater vehicle \u2032 may be retrieved from the body of seawater  in low or high sea states, by lowering of the grappling hook  onto a relatively large area of the netting  when the net assembly  is deployed without effecting attachments after such deployment of the net assembly  in its inflated condition.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
