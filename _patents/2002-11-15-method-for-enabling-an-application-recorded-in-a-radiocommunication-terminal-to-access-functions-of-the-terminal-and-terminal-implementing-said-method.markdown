Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method of enabling at least one application stored in a radiocommunications terminal to access functions of the terminal. The invention also relates to a radiocommunications terminal implementing the method.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","A non-exclusive field of application of the invention is that of radiocommunications terminals operating in a cellular radiocommunications network. The invention applies in particular to a system implementing the global system for mobile communications (GSM).","A mobile radiocommunications terminal may include stored applications. These applications can then implement data exchanges between the radiocommunications terminal and the network. An application exchanges data via the software interface of the terminal that is known as the application programming interface (API).","Furthermore, data exchanges between two pieces of data processing terminal equipment, e.g. between a radiocommunications terminal and a conventional portable terminal of the portable microcomputer type, can take place only with so-called AT commands being exchanged between the two terminals via a modem. These AT commands are described in the GSM standards.","AT commands are thus dedicated to configuring and controlling modems.","Until now, AT commands have never been used in an application context, i.e. when the user of a radiocommunications terminal seeks to make use of applications situated in the terminal.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method of enabling an application stored in a radiocommunications terminal to access functions of the terminal, and a terminal implementing the method that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","An object of the invention is to make the functions offered by AT commands available to any type of environment for executing applications in a radiocommunications terminal.","To this end, the invention provides a method of enabling at least one application stored in a radiocommunications terminal to access functions of said terminal, said terminal being suitable for enabling data to be exchanged in both directions in application of a data standard implementing a transfer channel that conveys so-called \u201cAT\u201d commands, said terminal including an AT command manager, the method being characterized in that access from the stored application to the terminal takes place by exchanging AT commands via said AT command manager.","In a particular embodiment, the AT commands are exchanged via the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).","The invention also provides a terminal for implementing the method, said terminal supporting at least one stored application and having means for enabling data to be exchanged in both directions in application of a data standard implementing a transfer channel conveying AT commands, and also having AT command management means, the terminal being characterized in that it includes means for enabling the application stored in said terminal to access functions of the terminal by exchanging AT commands via the AT command management means.","Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear on reading the following description of an embodiment of the invention given by way of non-limiting illustration, and with reference to the drawing specified below.","Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.","To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the method of enabling an application stored in a radiocommunications terminal to access functions of the terminal, and a terminal implementing the method includes a method of enabling at least one application () stored in a radiocommunications terminal () to access functions of said terminal (), said terminal () being suitable for enabling data to be exchanged in both directions in application of a data standard implementing a transfer channel that conveys so-called \u201cAT\u201d commands, said terminal () including an AT command manager (), the method being characterized in that access from the stored application () to the terminal () takes place by exchanging AT commands via said AT command manager ().","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10"]},"Conventionally, radiocommunications terminals include an AT command manager enabling them to behave like a modem with respect to other terminals such as a personal computer, thus enabling commands to be exchanged between the terminal  and the personal computer. In the invention, AT commands are exchanged within a given terminal .","In , the terminal  includes an AT command manager , a fixed or removable internal memory , and stored applications  and  of different kinds, for example of the banking type and of the commercial ordering type.","The stored applications  and  may be supplied with the terminal or they may be downloaded by the user from the radiocommunications network. After they have been downloaded, the applications  and  may be stored in the fixed or removable memory .","By downloading applications  and , the user of the terminal  can make use of applications  and  depending on the requirements of the user, whereas otherwise it would have been necessary to implement the applications in the terminal  even if the user does not use them.","These applications  and  may require access to the functions of the terminal  that relate to the field of telephony, for example access to the radiocommunications network in order to undertake operations with the environment outside the terminal . They therefore need to make use of the network access resources of the terminal .","The applications  and  access telephony functions using AT commands.","The AT command manager  enables AT commands to be handled. It receives requests and returns responses to and from the applications  or .","The AT command manger  is made accessible to the applications  and  via an HTTP server or via an interface protocol internal to the terminal so as to enable AT commands to be exchanged, these commands being encapsulated by the HTTP protocol within HTTP messages .","HTTP messages containing AT commands  comprise a header  and a body  which are described below.","An HTTP server has connection ports , some of which are used for access to the AT command manager .","When the applications  and  need to make use of the network access resources of the terminal , they contact the HTTP server on the port  in order to access the AT command manager .","The use of a plurality of ports  makes it possible to restrict usage of certain commands to certain applications as a function of a given level of confidence.","By way of example, the level of confidence can relate to the circumstances under which the applications  and  were downloaded, depending on where the applications come from or on whether or not a secure mechanism was used for downloading.","Each port gives access to a group of AT commands sharing a common level of sensitivity. The sensitivity of an application is defined as a function of its potential for harming a user, i.e. intrusion into the confidential portion of the subscriber identity module (SIM) card, or issuing accesses to the network that will lead to large bills. Sensitivity can be defined by the manufacturer or by the operator.","In the preset example, AT commands are exchanged in the form of a few strings of alphanumeric characters, thereby consuming little of the terminal's resources.","The HTTP server accepts connection requests made by an application  on the port  requested by the application to enable a request and the associated response to be exchanged in the form of AT commands encapsulated in an HTTP message .","For example, the application  opens a connection on the HTTP server with the AT command manager  over the port .","The application  builds the request HTTP message constituted by a header  and a body .","The application  then specifies in the header  of its HTTP message  the number of characters in the body . The body  of the HTTP message  comprises the AT command written as a sequence of alphanumeric characters.","The HTTP response message  from the AT command manager  is sent via the connection to the HTTP server.","The HTTP response message  has a header  specifying the status of the request. The body  of the HTTP response message  contains the response written as a sequence of alphanumeric characters.","When the user requests execution of the application , the application makes a connection to the HTTP server in order to access the AT command manager . It thus gains access to the telephony functions of the terminal  by exchanging AT commands via the HTTP server.","There follows an example of a JAVA type application  that has just been downloaded into a terminal  by the user of the terminal . The application  needs to discover the name of the manufacturer of the terminal .","This is an example of the request from the application  to the AT command manager :","GET\/HTTP\/1.1 (HTTP connection open)","Content-length: 7 (number of characters in the body  of the HTTP message , i.e. in the AT command)","AT+CGMI (AT command sent to the AT command manager )","This is an example of a response:","HTTP\/1.1<status value (200=OK)> (connection by the AT command manager  authorized via the HTTP server)","Content-length: 15 (number of characters in the body  of the HTTP message , i.e. in the AT command send by the AT command manager )","ALCATEL-MPD (AT command informing the application that it is running on a terminal made by ALCATEL)","OK","In the above example, the application  accesses information of very low sensitivity level (name of the manufacturer of the terminal ).","Nevertheless, the application  may require information or resources from a very sensitive level of the terminal , e.g. its SIM card.","To make this possible, the AT command manger  may offer an application  access to distinct groups of AT commands of greater or lesser sensitivity level via distinct ports.","The application  may be downloaded either from the operator of the radiocommunications network, the manufacturer, or a third party (e.g. a bank).","The level of confidence given to the application  will then depend on where it comes from: level of confidence will be higher for a download from the manufacturer than from the operator, and it will be higher from the operator than from a third party.","Depending on confidence level, the application  will or will not have access to groups of AT commands at a very sensitive level in the terminal .","The operating environment of the terminal  then verifies whether the application has user rights over the requested port, i.e. whether it can access the information requested.","The invention thus enables use to be made of an element that is already present in the radiocommunications terminal: namely the AT command manager, and in an applications context that is made secure.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the method of enabling an application stored in a radiocommunications terminal to access functions of the terminal, and a terminal implementing the method of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention.
