title: Secure payment instruction system
abstract: A method for providing secure payment instructions includes verifying a payer device for use in a transaction with a payee device. When a request is received from the payee device for payer information associated with a payment account being used by the payer device in the transaction, a security font is generated and associating in a database at least one payer information font character with payer information that is associated with the payer account. The at least one payer information font character is then provided to the payee device, and when a request for the security font is received and determined to be from the verified payer device, the security font is provided to the verified payer device such that the at least one payer information font character may be converted to the payer information for display on the payer device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Disclosure","The present disclosure generally relates to online and\/or mobile payments and more particularly to a secure payment instruction system for online and\/or mobile payments.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or online merchant or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an online or mobile payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on-line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.","Purchasing from an online merchant with the assistance of a payment service provider includes a payer selecting goods and\/or service for purchase and then performing a checkout process to provide payment for those goods and\/or service. The checkout process typically requires personal information such as, for example, a payer name, a payer shipping address, a payer payment account, and\/or a variety of other payer information known in the art, be provided by the payer as instructions to the payment service provider to make the payment. The need to provide such information raises a number of issues, as the online merchant may not be a trusted entity or the online merchant system may have been compromised such that any payer information sent to the online merchant is at risk.","Conventionally, the use of a payment service provider in the checkout process requires that the payer be redirected from the online merchant website to a payment service provider website in order to ensure that payer information is not put at risk. The payer will typically request to use the payment service provider to complete the checkout process, and the payer will then be redirected from the merchant website to the payment service provider website such that the payer information may be securely provided and displayed for selection in order to provide instructions for the payment to the online merchant. Such conventional checkout processes protect the payer information by ensuring that the payer information is only sent between the payment service provider and the payer. However, many online merchants would prefer to host the entire checkout process at their online merchant website, as it provides the online merchant with more control over the shopping experience of the payer, allows the online merchant to take advantage of upsell opportunities, and is less confusing to the payer.","Thus, there is a need for an improved secure payment instruction system.","According to one embodiment, a method for providing secure payment instructions includes a payment service provider device verifying a payer device for use in a transaction with a payee device. The verification may be performed by receiving payer credentials or detecting a cookie on the payer device. A request for payer information associated with a payer account is then received by the payment service provider device from the payee device, and a security font is generated to create at least one payer information font character that is associated with the payer information. The at least one payer information font character may then be provided by the payment service provider device to the payee device, and the payee device may then provide the payer device with a payee webpage that includes the at least one payer information font character. When provided the payee webpage, the verified payer device requests the security font from the payment service provider device, and that security font is used by the payer device to convert the at least one payer information font character to the payer information for display on the payer device. The payer device may then be used to select the payer information to send instructions to the payment service provider device to process the payment.","In an embodiment, the payment service provider device may also create a plurality of payment confirmation font characters from the security font and associate them with a plurality of payment confirmation section areas, one of which includes a pay button. The plurality of payment confirmation font characters are then provided to the payee device, and the payee device may then provide the payer device a payee webpage that includes the plurality of payment confirmation font characters in a payment confirmation section. When provided the payee webpage, the verified payer device requests the security font from the payment service provider device, and that security font is used by the payer device to convert the plurality of payment confirmation font characters to the payment confirmation section for display on the payer device. The payer device may then be used to select the payment confirmation section area that includes the pay button in order to confirm payment to the payee device.","As a result, a payer may provide a payment (e.g., by completing a checkout process) at a payee website while payer information that is displayed on the payer device through the payee website remains secure, as without access to the security font, the payer information font characters and the payment confirmation font characters are unreadable or nonsensical.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for providing secure payment instructions using payer information that is displayed on a payer device through a payee website over a network. A payment service provider device verifies the payer device in response to the payer device beginning a transaction checkout process with the payee device. The payee device then requests payer information for a payer account being used in the transaction, and the payment service provider device provides the payee device with at least one payer information font character that is associated with the payer information and that was created using a security font generated and stored by the payment service provider device. The payee device may then provide a payee webpage on the payee website that includes the at least one payer information font character. The at least one payer information font character may be converted into readable payer information using the security font, which is only retrievable over the network from the payment service provider device by the verified payer device. Once converted, the at least one payer information font character is readable by a user of the payer device, and may be used to select payment instructions to send to the payment service provider. The system and method allow a payee website to provide a checkout process that requires sensitive payer information, while ensuring that such sensitive information remains secure and readable only by the user of the payer device.","Referring now to , a method  for providing secure payment instructions is illustrated. The method  begins at block  where a payer device is verified. In an embodiment, a payer device (e.g., operated by a consumer) is connected to a payee device (e.g., operated by a merchant) over a network (e.g., the Internet) to purchase goods and\/or services displayed at a payee website, as is known in the art. After the desired goods and\/or services are selected, a checkout webpage , illustrated in , may be provided by the payee device over the network to be displayed on the payer device. The checkout webpage  includes a selected items section  (e.g., a \u201cshopping cart\u201d) and a payment options section . The selected items section  includes a plurality of products , , and that were selected from the payee website using the payer device (one of product A for $10.00, two of product B for $16.00, and one of product C for $45.00, for a total purchase amount of $71.00.) The payment options section  may include a plurality of payment options, such as a credit card payment option , a payment service provider payment option , and\/or a variety of other payment options known in the art. The payer device may be used to select the payment service provider payment option in order to begin a checkout process for the products in the selected items section  using a payer account with a payment service provider.","In response to receiving a selection of the payment service provider payment option , the payee device begins communicating with a payment service provider device over the network. For example, the payee device may make a server side call to a payment service provider device over the network that indicates the user of the payer device would like to use a payment account with the payment service provider to make a payment for a certain amount (e.g., $71.00 in the illustrated embodiment.) In response, the payment service provider device generates an opaque access token that is sent to the payee device. In an embodiment, the opaque access token is an encrypted payload and\/or other credential that the payment service provider is able to decrypt, while all other participants in the system with access to the opaque access token are unable to decrypt the opaque access token but have access to the opaque access token with the ability to send the opaque access token to other participants in the system. The payee device then provides the opaque access token to the payer device and redirects the payer device from the payee website to a payment service provider landing Uniform Resource Locater (URL) on a payment service provider website, such as, for example:","https:\/\/start.payservprovider.com\/?t=<token>&url=http:\/\/www.payee.com\/CheckOut\/?SESSION=324698","In an embodiment, one of skill in the art will recognize that the URL above may operate to link the payee device, the payer device's secure cookie, and the payment service provider device. The payment service provider device may then detect whether the payer device includes a secure cookie that verifies that a user of the payer device is logged into a payer account with the payment service provider. In an embodiment, the secure cookie may be replaced with some other secure token that the payer device may provide to the payment service provider device without it being known to the payee device (e.g., when used in a non-networked\/internet-based system involving physical media.) If the payment service provider device detects the secure cookie, the opaque access token is linked to the payer account associated with the secure cookie on the payer device, and the payer device becomes a verified payer device and is redirected back to the payee website. One of skill in the art will recognize that if the user of the payer device is already logged into their payer account with the payment service provider, selection of the payment service provider payment option on the checkout webpage  will \u201cbounce\u201d the payer device to the payment service provider website and back (e.g., send the payer device from the payee website, to the payment service provider landing URL, and then quickly back to the payee website). Thus, in many instances, the trip from the merchant website to the payment service provider landing URL and back to the payee website may not be noticed by the user of the payer device (i.e., the user of the payer device will be unaware they have briefly left the payee website).","If the payment service provider device does not detect the secure cookie on the payer device, a login webpage  may be provided by the payment service provider device over the network for display on the payer device, as illustrated in . The login webpage  includes a login section  having a username input , a password input , and a sign in button . As is known in the art, the user of the payer device may provide a username and password in the username input  and password input , respectively, and then select the sign in button  to access or login to a payer account. In response to receiving such payer credentials and verifying that the user of the payer device is logged into a payer account with the payment service provider, the payment service provider device generates and provides a secure cookie to the payer device such that the payer device becomes a verified payer device and is redirected back to the payee website. The payment service provider device may also link the opaque access token to the payer account associated with the generated secure cookie.","In an embodiment, the payment service provider device does a check during the payer device verification of the payer, the payee, the total amount of the payment, and\/or a variety of other variables to determine whether to proceed with the method . For example, any discrepancies or warning flags may cause the payment service provider device to request other credential information from the user of the payer device to allow access to the payer account for making a payment.","The method  then proceeds to block  where a request for payer information is received from the payee device. The payee device may request payer information associated with the payer account being used in the transaction. For example, the payee device may request a payer name, one or more payer shipping addresses, and\/or one or more payment accounts over the network from the payment service provider device. In an embodiment, the payee device may provide the opaque access token received at block  of the method  along with the request for payer information. The method  then proceeds to block  where a security font is generated by the payment service provider device and at least one payer information font character is associated in a database with payer information in the payer account that is being used in the transaction and that was associated with the opaque access token. In an embodiment, the security font maps payer information font characters to vector renderings of the payer information. For example, the payment service provider may generate a font which selects a particular character (or set of characters) for each piece of payer information (e.g., the character \u201ce\u201d may be selected to represent a first name). As understood by one of skill in the art, a font is a mapping of code points (a number that identifies a particular character) to glyphs (a graphical representation of that character, e.g., in vector or bitmap format.) While conventional fonts describe a large number of code points, the security font of the present disclosure may include only glyphs for the code points selected to represent the payer information. Thus, in the example using the character \u201ce\u201d above, \u2018\u00eb\u2019 may be the codepoint U+00EB, and the security font may map U+00EB to a glyph rendering the first name of the payer. In an embodiment, the security font is generated \u201con-the-fly\u201d, e.g., in response to the request by the payee device for the payer information. While the illustrated embodiment discussed below uses Unicode characters as the payer information font characters for ease of reference and description, a variety of unprintable and\/or unreadable characters that are mapped to vector renderings of the payer information are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.","The method  then proceeds to block  where the payer information font characters are provided to the payee device. The payment service provider device provides the payer information font characters to the payee device over the network. In one embodiment, payer information font characters may be provided to the payee device using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). An example of a payer name and two payer payment accounts provided using JSON may include:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"{"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"fullName:"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"id: \u201cdb31b47ab\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"token: \u201c\u039e\u201d,"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"},"]},{"entry":[{},"payment Accounts:"]},{"entry":[{},"["]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"{"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"id: \u201c322bab2cd197\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"token: \u201c\u2009 \u2009\u201d"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"},"]},{"entry":[{},"{"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"id: \u201c987aed21f7aaa\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"token: \u201c\u03c6\u201d"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"}"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"],"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"Css: https:\/\/checkout.payservprovider.com\/css?id=PAYER"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The payee device may then use the payer information font characters to render a payee webpage.

Thus, the payee device may provide the payer device with a checkout webpage , illustrated in , and at block  of the method , the payer device will request the security font from the payment service provider device over the network. The checkout webpage  includes the selected items section , discussed above with reference to the checkout webpage  of , along with a payer welcome section , a payment option section , and a shipping address section .","The payer welcome section  includes payer information that is a payer information font character that has been converted using the security font such that the payer information is readable on the payer device. In the illustrated embodiment, the payer information font character \u039e has been mapped to the graphic indicated by element number in . As can be seen, the payer information includes a payer name (e.g., \u201cJohn Smith\u201d in the illustrated embodiment) and a security symbol . The payer welcome section  includes the character string \u201cWelcome back,\u201d immediately adjacent the payer information , and one of skill in the art will recognize that the payer information font character may be placed anywhere on a webpage provided by the payee device and adjacent any character strings, graphics, and\/or other webpage features using, for example, HTML as discussed above, in order to personalize the webpage as desired with the payer information ","As also discussed above, the payer information was sent by the payment service provider device to the payee device as an unreadable or nonsensical payer information font character (e.g., token: \u201c\u039e\u201d, in the embodiment discussed above), but when provided to the verified payer device on the checkout webpage  along with the URL (https:\/\/checkout.payservprovider.com\/font?id=PAYER in the embodiment discussed above), the verified payer device is operable to be served the security font from the payment service provider device that converts the unreadable or nonsensical font character (e.g., token: \u201c\u039e\u201d, in the embodiment discussed above) to the payer name and security symbol illustrated in  using the mapping for that unreadable or nonsensical payer information font character to the vector renderings of the payer information . One of skill in the art will recognize that common font standards support bitmap rendering in addition to vector rendering, and thus bitmap renderings may be used as well (e.g., to embed a logo or other image.)","In an embodiment, the payer information may include a number of features that were previously selected by the payer account holder. For example, the payer account holder may have selected the border, color, text style, security symbol (or other user selected image such as an image of the user themselves), and\/or a variety of other features of the payer information . Thus, the correct rendering of the payer information lets the user of the payer device know that the payer information is being provided by the payment service provider. In an embodiment, the security symbol may be a security symbol provided by the payment service provider device that indicates to the user of the payer device that the payer information has been provided by the payment service provider. For example, the security symbol may include the name of the payment service provider, a trademark of the payment service provider, and\/or a variety of other security symbols known in the art that let the user of the payer device know that the payer information is protected by the payment service provider.","The payment option section  includes payer information and that are payer information font characters that have been converted using the security font such that the payer information and is readable on the payer device. As can be seen, the payer information includes a first payment option (e.g., a credit card payment option in the illustrated embodiment) with a security symbol and a second payment option (e.g., the debit card payment option in the illustrated embodiment) with a security symbol . The payer option section  includes the character string \u201cSELECT A PAYMENT OPTION:\u201d immediately above the payer information and , and selection inputs and adjacent the payer information and , respectively. One of skill in the art will recognize that the payer information font characters may be placed anywhere on a webpage provided by the payee device and adjacent any character strings, graphics, and\/or other webpage features using, for example, the HTML as discussed above, in order to personalize the webpage as desired with the payer information and . Similarly as discussed above for the payer information , the payer information and was sent by the payment service provider device to the payee device as an unreadable or nonsensical payer information font character (e.g., token: \u201c\u201d and \u201c\u03c6\u201d in the embodiment discussed above), provided on the checkout webpage  by the payee device (e.g., using HTML), and converted by the verified payer device (e.g., using a URL to access the security font at the payment service provider device) to be displayed in the user-readable form illustrated in . The security features of the payer information and selected by the payer account holder and\/or provided by the payment service provider may be substantially similar to those discussed for the payer information above.","The shipping address section  includes payer information and that are payer information font characters that have been converted using the security font such that the payer information and is readable on the payer device. As can be seen, the payer information includes a first shipping address (e.g., a home shipping address in the illustrated embodiment) with a security symbol and a second shipping address (e.g., the work shipping address in the illustrated embodiment) with a security symbol . The shipping address section  includes the character string \u201cSELECT A SHIPPING ADDRESS:\u201d immediately above the payer information and , and selection inputs and adjacent the payer information and , respectively, and one of skill in the art will recognize that the payer information font characters may be placed anywhere on a webpage provided by the payee device and adjacent any character strings, graphics, and\/or other webpage features using, for example, the HTML as discussed above, in order to personalize the webpage as desired with the payer information and . Similarly as discussed above for the payer information , the payer information and was sent by the payment service provider device to the payee device as an unreadable or nonsensical payer information font character, provided on the checkout webpage  by the payee device, and converted by the verified payer device to be displayed in the user-readable form illustrated in . The security features of the payer information and selected by the payer account holder and\/or provided by the payment service provider may be substantially similar to those discussed for the payer information above.","Thus, the payer device displays a checkout webpage  that includes sensitive payer information (e.g., a payer name, payment accounts, and addresses) that is only readable on the verified payer device using the security font (which may only be retrieved from the payment service provider device by the payer device once the payer device has been verified.) The method  then proceeds to block  where the payment service provider device receives payer information that was selected using the payer device. In an embodiment, the payer device may be used to select a payment option (e.g., the credit card payment option using the selection input on the checkout webpage , as illustrated) and a shipping address (e.g., the shipping address using the selection input on the checkout webpage , as illustrated). Those selections are received as selections of the unreadable or nonsensical font characters by the payee device, and the payee device forwards the selected unreadable or nonsensical font characters over the network to the payment service provider device. The payment service provider device may then determine the payer information associated with those selected unreadable or nonsensical font characters.","The method  then proceeds to block  where payment confirmation font characters are provided to the payee device. The payment confirmation font characters are similar to the payer information font characters discussed above. A security font is generated (or reused after being generated for the payer information font characters) and associated with payment confirmation section areas. In an embodiment, the security font maps payment confirmation font characters to vector renderings of the payment confirmation section areas that make up a payment confirmation section, discussed below. In an embodiment, the security font is generated \u201con-the-fly\u201d, e.g., in response to the receiving the payer information selected using the payer device.","Thus, the payee device may provide the payer device with a checkout webpage , illustrated in , and at block  of the method , the payer device will request the security font from the payment service provider device. The checkout webpage  includes the selected items section , discussed above with reference to the checkout webpage  of , along with a payer thank you section  and a payment confirmation section .","The payer thank you section  includes payer information discussed above that is a payer information font character that has been converted using the security font such that the payer information is readable on the payer device. As can be seen, the payer information includes the payer name (e.g., \u201cJohn Smith\u201d in the illustrated embodiment) and the security symbol . The payer thank you section  includes the character string \u201cThank you,\u201d immediately adjacent the payer information , and illustrates how the payee device may position the payer information font character anywhere on a webpage provided by the payee device and adjacent any character strings, graphics, and\/or other webpage features using, for example, the HTML as discussed above, in order to personalize the webpage as desired with the payer information ","In an embodiment, the payment confirmation section  may be provided on the checkout webpage  by the payee device using HTML such as, for example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"{"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"checkout: \u201c<div id=234hjkbs><input id 80u0jj34"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"value=23jbf8e\/><\/div><div id 34hb737d><inputid=sjhjh234"]},{"entry":[{},"value=wjhj323\/><\/div><div id=jbwe3kj4><input id=wejbejj4"]},{"entry":[{},"value=3hg8sd9\/><\/div><div id=f423df4w><input id=dfd944ns"]},{"entry":[{},"value=f0f949e\/><\/div>\u201d"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","504","406","504","504","504","504","500","402","504","504","504","504"],"i":["a","b","c","d ","a","b","c","d ","a ","b ","c ","d ","a ","c","a","a","b","c","d ","a ","a","b","c","d "]},"The method  then proceeds to block  where selection of the payment confirmation is received. In an embodiment, the payer device is used to select one of the payment confirmation section areas , , , or (e.g., by \u201cclicking\u201d or selecting one of the payment confirmation section areas , , , or on the checkout webpage  using a mouse or other input device). That selection is received as a selection of an unreadable or nonsensical font character by the payee device, and the payee device forwards the selected unreadable or nonsensical font character over the network to the payment service provider device. The payment service provider device may then determine which of the payment confirmation section areas , , , or was selected using the payment device. In the illustrated embodiment, if the selected payment confirmation section area is the payment confirmation section area that was displayed on the payer device and included the total amount of the payment, the payment service provider device determines that the payment is authorized for the payer account associated with the secure cookie detected on or generated and provided to the payer device, and the method  proceeds to block  where the payment service provider device processes the payment and transfers funds from that payer account to a payee account of the payee. In response to the authorized payment, the payee device may provide a receipt webpage to the payer device over the network. Thus, in the event the user of the payer device is logged into their payer account with the payment service provider, the user of the payer device completes the checkout process (seemingly) without leaving the payee website.","If the selected payment confirmation section area is not the payment confirmation section area that was displayed on the payer device and included the total amount of the payment, the payment service provider device determines that the payment is not authorized for the payer account, and the payment service provider device will not process the payment or transfers funds from the payer account to a payee account of the payee. In an embodiment, in response to determining that the selected payment confirmation section area is not the payment confirmation section area that was displayed on the payer device and included the total amount of the payment, the payment service provider device may provide the payee device with different payment confirmation font characters having a different layout than the payment confirmation section  such that the payee device may provide the payer device with a modified checkout webpage  to re-attempt to confirm the payment. The checkout webpage  includes payment confirmation section  having payment confirmation section areas , , , and that are payment confirmation font characters that have been converted using the security font such that the payment confirmation section areas , , , and are readable on the payer device. As can be seen, the payment confirmation section  is similar to the payment confirmation section  discussed above, but with the layout changed such that the payment confirmation section area includes the shipping address selected using the payer device, the payment confirmation section area includes a security symbol, the payment confirmation section area includes total amount of the payment, and the payment confirmation section area includes the payment option selected using the payer device.","The payment confirmation sections  and  illustrate how payment confirmation sections may be provided on a website that includes payment confirmation section areas that display different information when their associated payment confirmation font characters are converted on the verified payer device. Thus, if only the payment service provider device and the payer device have access to the security font, the information in the payment confirmation section appears as unreadable or nonsensical font characters to the payee device or any third party that intercepts data sent between the payment service provider device and the payee device or between the payee device and the payer device, but may be displayed as readable and understandable information on the payer device. Furthermore, as the payment service provider device includes a database of the security font mapping of payment confirmation font characters to payment confirmation section areas, the payment service provider device can easily determine whether the payment confirmation section area selected using the payer device is the correct payment confirmation section area for confirming the payment from the payer account.","Referring now to , a checkout webpage  is illustrated that is substantially similar to the checkout webpages  and  with the provision of a modified payment confirmation section  that includes 16 payment confirmation section areas rather than the 4 payment confirmation section areas illustrated and discussed above. The payment confirmation section  of  includes 16 payment confirmation font characters that have been converted using the security font such that the payment confirmation section areas , , , and include readable information on the payer device and the remaining payment confirmation section areas are blank. As can be seen, the payment confirmation section  is similar to the payment confirmation sections  and  discussed above, but with payment confirmation section area including a security symbol, the payment confirmation section area including total amount of the payment, the payment confirmation section area including the payment option selected using the payer device, and the payment confirmation section area including the shipping address selected using the payer device. One of skill in the art will recognize that any number of payment confirmation sections areas may be provided in the payment confirmation section to increase security (e.g., by providing more selectable payment confirmation section areas to decrease the chances of guessing which area to select in order to confirm the payment).","In an embodiment, the payment service provider device may monitor the payee device or payee system for incorrect selections of payment confirmation section areas that may indicate fraud. For example, in the event selections of payment confirmation section areas are incorrect more than 1% of the time, the system and method discussed above may be disabled for the payee device. Additionally, in an embodiment, the payment confirmation sections , , and  may only be provided for the total amount of the payment initially provided by the payee device in block  of the method , and in the event the total amount of the payment changes, the payee device may be required to repeat the checkout process (e.g., by obtaining a new opaque access token).","Thus, a system and method are provided that allow a user of a payer device to complete a payment on a payee website using a payer account with a payment service provider while ensuring that payer information is secure and only displayable in a readable format on the payer device. This allows a payee to control the user experience during the checkout process for a payer using a payer account with a payment service provider, which provides the payee opportunities to upsell and presents a smoother checkout process than is provided in conventional systems that require the payer be redirected to a payment service provider website to provide payment instructions and complete the payment.","Referring now to , an embodiment of a networked system  used in the secure payment instruction system described above is illustrated. The networked system  includes a plurality of payer devices , a plurality of payee devices , a payment service provider device , and a plurality of account provider devices  in communication over a network .
