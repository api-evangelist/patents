title: Method and system for developing and administering subject-appropriate implicit-association tests
abstract: The current application is directed to developing and administering subject-appropriate ITAs. The various to developing and administering subject-appropriate ITAs evaluate many aspects of ITA content, content presentation, and administration with regard to particular categories of test subjects in order to develop subject-appropriate ITAs (“SAITAs”) and to administer SAITAs appropriately to the categories of test subjects for which the tests are developed. Aspects of SAITA presentation and administration that are evaluated include input devices, presentation formats, presentation language, presentation media, colors used in presentation of tutorials and stimuli, words, pictures, and symbols used in a presentation of tutorials and stimuli, the pace and length of various portions of SAITAs, human vs. computer administration of SAITAs, presentation of feedback to test subjects during SAITAs, ITAs and many other aspects of ITA content, content presentation, and administration. SAITAs employ systematic methods for both development and administration of SAITAs.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 12\/150,947, filed Apr. 30, 2008 now abandoned.","This invention has been made with Government support under Contract No. SBE-0354453, awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is related to psychological testing and, in particular, to a method and system for developing subject-appropriate implicit tests of associations and for administering subject-appropriate implicit tests of associations in subject-appropriate ways.","The implicit-association tests, first described in a 1998 publication, was developed to test the strength of subjects' mental associations between concepts and ideas based on the test subjects' performance on relatively simple, computer-proctored tests during which subjects categorize various computer-presented stimuli into different categories by manual input via a keyboard or other input device. Implicit-association tests (\u201cIATs\u201d) are described, in greater detail, in a following section. Please note that the term \u201csubject\u201d refers to a person to whom an IAT or other test is administered. Please also note that, although not currently used in the literature, a perhaps better name for the implicit association test is \u201cimplicit test of associations.\u201d The test is implicit, in the sense that the test does not query test subjects for explicitly-stated responses. However, it is often assumed that the adjective \u201cimplicit\u201d modifies the term \u201cassociation,\u201d which is incorrect. Therefore, in the following, the name \u201cimplicit test of associations\u201d (\u201cITA\u201d) is used, in preference to the commonly used \u201cimplicit association test.\u201d","While ITAs have proved effective in evaluating strengths of association between various concepts and categories held by reasonably well-educated, literate, non-disabled adults, the standard ITA format has proved difficult or impossible to administer to various other categories of test subjects, including preschool children, illiterate adults, people with various types of disabilities, and others. Furthermore, ITA development has been largely empirical, generally without a systematic approach to evaluating particular ITA suitability for various categories of subjects. ITA administrators and developers have recognized the need for methods and systems for more effective administration of ITAs to, and development of ITAs for, particular categories of subjects.","The current application is directed to developing and administering subject-appropriate ITAs. Various methods disclosed in the current application evaluate many aspects of ITA content, content presentation, and administration with regard to particular categories of test subjects in order to develop subject-appropriate ITAs (\u201cSAITAs\u201d) and to administer SAITAs appropriately to the categories of test subjects for which the tests are developed. Exemplary categories of test subjects may include adults with a particular class of disabilities, preschool children, illiterate adults, elderly adults, and emigrants lacking exposure to computers and to the dominant culture of the society in which tests are developed and administered. Aspects of SAITA presentation and administration that are evaluated include input devices, presentation formats, presentation language, presentation media, colors used in presentation of tutorials and stimuli, words, pictures, and symbols used in a presentation of tutorials and stimuli, the pace and length of various portions of SAITAs, human vs. computer administration of SAITAs, presentation of feedback to test subjects during SAITAs, administration of Likert scales as a method of verification of correctly administered SAITAs, continuous monitoring of the test-subject's responses, attitudes toward the stimulus\/response interaction, attentiveness, and other characteristics to ensure that meaningful responses are being measured during the SAITA, additional continuously applied internal consistency checks and feedback loops, and many other aspects of ITA content, content presentation, and administration. Testing approaches to which the current application is directed employ systematic methods for both development and administration of SAITAs.","The current application is directed to development and administration of subject-appropriate implicit test of associations (\u201cSAITAs\u201d) based on previously developed implicit tests of associations (\u201cITAs\u201d). To facilitate description of the SAITAs disclosed in the current application, standard ITAs are first described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-F","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["103","104","108","106","112","110","114","116","118","120"]},"During the testing phase of an ITA, the test subject is instructed to depress the appropriate key in response to presentation of a stimulus, generally a picture or phrase that clearly belongs to one of the four concepts within the two pairs of concepts. In the case of the example of , each presented stimulus is clearly associated with, or belongs to, one of the four concepts: {flowers, insects, pleasant, unpleasant}.  illustrates an exemplary stimulus presentation. In , a picture of ice cream and candy  is displayed on the computer display device . At the instant at which the picture is displayed, a computational timing device  is initialized. As shown in , the user, in response to viewing the stimulus image, depresses  the key  appropriate for inputting a response to visual display a concept of the concept pair {flowers, pleasant} , since candy and ice cream clearly associate with the concept \u201cpleasant,\u201d and do not associate with the other concepts \u201cflowers,\u201d \u201cinsects,\u201d and \u201cunpleasant,\u201d at least to those without potentially fatal allergies to ice cream and candy. At the instant when the key is depressed by the subject, the elapsed time between display of the stimulus and the user response is measured via the computational timing device . The computational timing device is generally based on a hardware system clock and various related operating-system functions.","In general, an ITA test comprises two blocks, each block in turn comprising a fixed number of stimulus-presentation\/test-subject-response pairs, such as the stimulus presentation and response illustrated in . During the first block, the concept-pair\/response-key combinations remain constant. Then, the relationship between the keys to be depressed and the concepts or categories presented to the subject is changed. In a tutorial administered during the second block, the subject is instructed, as shown in , to depress a first key  when pictures or other visual stimuli related to the concept pair {flowers, unpleasant}  are presented to the subject and to depress a second key  when pictures or other visual stimuli related to the concept pair {insects, pleasant}  are presented to the subject. The subject is again provided with practice stimulus\/response interactions to facilitate learning the new concept-pair\/response-key combinations. As shown in , the stimuli, such as picture , are again presented, during the second block, and the elapsed time between stimulus presentation and subject response are again measured. In general, the target concepts, or concepts of the first conceptual dimension, are reversed, in the second block, although it is possible to reverse the attribute concepts, or the concepts of the second conceptual dimension, in alternative examples.","Often, the developer of an ITA begins with a hypothesis. For example, with regard to the ITA described with reference to , the developer may hypothesize that people generally have a preference for flowers over insects (i.e. associate flowers with pleasant emotions and insects with unpleasant emotions). Therefore, during the first block, the concept-pair\/response-key combinations reflect the hypothesized association between flowers and pleasant emotions and between insects and unpleasant emotions, and the first block is therefore referred to as the \u201ccongruent block.\u201d By contrast, the second block, during which the keys are associated with concepts that are hypothesized to be clashing, or discordant, is referred to as the \u201cincongruent block.\u201d While the concepts or categories paired in the congruent block may be generally hypothesized to reflect natural associations held by one or more classes of subjects and the concepts or categories paired in the incongruent block may be generally hypothesized to run counter to associations commonly held by one or more classes of subjects, the responses of any given subject during an ITA may indicate that the subject strongly associates the concepts or categories paired in the congruent block, weakly associates the concepts or categories paired in the congruent block, exhibits an equally strong association between the concepts or categories paired in the congruent block, weakly associates the concepts or categories paired in the incongruent block, or strongly associates the concepts or categories paired in the incongruent block. In certain ITAs, the test developer may not have a prior assumptions of the strength of association between the different concepts or categories for which strength of association is tested, in which cases the phrases \u201cfirst block\u201d and \u201csecond block\u201d may be preferred to the phrases \u201ccongruent block\u201d and \u201cincongruent block.\u201d  illustrates processing of elapsed times of response, or latencies, measured during administration of the exemplary ITA described with reference to . A first table  includes the elapsed times of responses to each of a series of pictures displayed in a practice session within the congruent block of the test, a second table  includes the elapsed times of responses to each of a series of pictures displayed in the test portion of the congruent block, a third table  includes the elapsed times of responses to each of a series of pictures displayed in a practice session within the incongruent block of the test, and a fourth table  includes the elapsed times for responses to pictures presented as stimuli in the test portion of the in congruent block. Note that the same pictures are presented in all four portions of the ITA, although the order of presentation may vary. Each entry in each table includes an indication of the stimulus to which the latency applies, as well as an indication of whether or not the response was correct. In general, a subject is required to provide a correct answer to each displayed stimulus. When the response is incorrect, a visual indication is displayed, and the subject is required to input the correct response. In general, latencies for initially incorrect responses are therefore greater in value than latencies for correct responses, due to the need to input a second, correct response following an initially incorrect response.","There are a variety of ways to compute meaningful scores. The validity of different scoring methods can be tested by comparing scores derived from ITA response latencies to subjects' preferences for, or identification with, concepts and categories measured by alternative, self-expression-based testing, such as Likert-type testing. One approach to scoring, for a two-block ITA test, each block of which includes a practice strength-of-association-test session (\u201cP\u201d) and a strength-of-association test (\u201cT\u201d) is next provided, with reference to .","First, four sets of data P, T, P, and T are defined as the latencies measured for the above-mentioned practice sessions and test, as shown in  and expressed below:\n\nP1={P, P, . . . , P}=\n\n","In other words, entries of the original table with latency values greater than a cutoff value, in the present case 10 seconds, are discarded to produce the four sets of data P ( in ), T ( in ), P ( in ), and T ( in ).","Next, a test is made to ensure that, after the elimination of the extreme values, there are sufficient remaining values to allow for a meaningful test score to be calculated:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0036"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":["if","test","invalid"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["n","threshold"],"mo":["<","<"],"mrow":{"mi":["practice_threshold","AND","m"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"OR"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["q","threshold"],"mo":["<","<"],"mrow":{"mi":["practice_threshold","AND","r"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}}}}}]}}}}},"br":{},"b":["1","1","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0037"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"4.4em","height":"4.4ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":":","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":"<","mrow":{"mi":["low_cutoff","_latency"],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-2","num":"00002.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"4.4em","height":"4.4ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["T","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":":","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":"<","mrow":{"mi":["low_cutoff","_latency"],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-3","num":"00002.3"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"4.4em","height":"4.4ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"},{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":[":","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"P","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":"<","mrow":{"mi":["low_cutoff","_latency"],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-4","num":"00002.4"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"4.4em","height":"4.4ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":["T","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"},{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":":","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"T","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":",","mi":"i"}},"mo":"<","mrow":{"mi":["low_cutoff","_latency"],"mo":"\u2062"}}}}],"mo":"="}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-5","num":"00002.5"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"numExtreme","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sizeof","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"sizeof","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"sizeof","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"sizeof","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","e"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}],"mo":["+","+","+"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002-6","num":"00002.6"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"4.4em","height":"4.4ex"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":["if","test","invalid"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"

the computed test score is \u201c0,\u201d or close to zero, there appear to be equally strong associations between the paired concepts or categories used in both blocks of the ITA. When the computed score is positive, and above a threshold value, then the subject appears to more strongly associate the paired concepts or categories used in the first block than the paired concepts or categories used in the second block. When the computed score is negative, with an absolute value above the threshold value, then the subject appears to more strongly associate the paired concepts or categories used in the second block than the paired concepts or categories used in the first block of the ITA.","ITAs have many significant advantages over more traditional types of psychological tests that require subjects to provide informational responses to questions. In many cases, a subject may intentionally or inadvertently respond insincerely, to particular types of questions, as a result of conscious or unconscious feelings, prejudices, and a sense of the test-taker's expectations. For example, a standard psychological test in which the test administrator questions the subject with regard to the subject's disposition towards members of different races may not elicit an honest expression of the subject's honest feelings and emotions, since the test is directed to a very controversial topic. As another example, a subject may assume that the test administrator is seeking certain types of responses, and may respond according to that assumption, rather than to the subject's true feelings with regard to the topic of the test. As a third example, the subject may indeed harbor an unconscious bias or prejudice, but answer explicit questions with regard to the subject's disposition towards members of different races based on the subject's conscious attitudes related to race, such as a conscious affinity to an unprejudiced, race-indifferent disposition. The ITA, by contrast, measures response time for the test subject's response to presented stimuli. When the responses require choosing input keys associated with matched, or concordant concepts, subjects generally require less time to respond to displayed stimuli than when the input keys are associated with clashing, or discordant concepts. Because the subject is encouraged to respond quickly and mechanically to the stimuli, response times tend to be far less influenced by subjects' expectations, assumptions, prejudices, and other factors that may lead to less useful results obtained in standard psychological tests.","Problems with the standard ITA were first noticed during development of an ITA-based approach to evaluating various concept associations in preschool children. The standard ITA was completely unsuitable. The standard ITA relies on subjects being literate and having sufficient familiarity with computers to be able to provide responses through standard keyboard keys, and to respond appropriately to various instructional screens and feedback. Therefore, it was necessary to re-evaluate the ITA and to develop an SAITA for preschool children. This undertaking revealed many of the aspects of generalized SAITA development and administration. For example, because ITAs measure the elapsed times for manual responses, rather than evaluate informative responses to questions, subtle effects and interferences related to stimulus presentation, ITA dynamics, particular words, colors, images, sounds, and other features of the ITA format, ITA structure, and other aspects of the ITA unrelated to the associations being evaluated may contribute to observed elapsed response times and lead to inaccurate conclusions about the strengths of associations for which the ITA is designed to evaluate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-B","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["302","304","306","308","310","312","314","316"]},"By way of example, many of the innovations applied to developing and administering an SAITA directed to preschool children are next described. These innovations illustrate the general principals of SAITA development and administration.  illustrates various innovations regarding input devices as well as stimulus and information presentation. As shown in , for preschool children, the standard computer keyboard is modified or replaced by a subject-appropriate input device . The subject-appropriate input device includes only two, very large keys or pads  and . The two keys, or pads,  and  have two different colors. As discussed further, below, the colors are chosen to be neutral, without introducing unnecessary conceptual dimensions to the SAITA. As one example, an SAITA directed to preschool children may be developed to test various gender-related hypotheses. Were the two input keys  and  colored blue and pink, the standard, social association of pink with girls and blue with boys would almost certainly introduce an unintended, third conceptual dimension to the SAITA.","Although any color may have unintended associations, for a particular SAITA, secondary colors orange, green, and purple tend to be generally most neutral for preschool children. For other categories of subjects, alternative types of input devices may be most effective. For people lacking use of arms, due to disabilities of birth defects, spoken responses detected by a microphone or directional orientation of the visual axis, detected by a video camera, may be appropriate.  includes depictions of audio speakers  and , in addition to the display device . The standard ITA relies purely on textual and graphical visual display of both tutorial information and the presentation of stimuli during stimulus\/response interactions. However, modern personal computers and workstations are capable of playing music and sounds, and audio presentation proves to be useful, particularly for non-literate subjects.","The standard ITA relies on textual concept pairings during key-association instruction and tutorials. In the standard ITA, the words \u201cflowers\u201d and \u201cpleasant\u201d might be shown together, on the left portion of a screen, and the words \u201cinsects\u201d and \u201cunpleasant\u201d might be shown on the right-hand portion of the screen, indicating that the left-hand key is associated with the concepts \u201cflowers\u201d and \u201cpleasant,\u201d while the right-hand key is associated with \u201cinsects\u201d and \u201cunpleasant.\u201d This concept-pair\/response-key combination presentation relies on a subject being able to read the words, and also relies on the subject being able to make mental associations between the display-screen positions of the word pairs representing concept pairs and the designated input keys on the keyboard. For preschool children, seeing and understanding the concept pairings and mentally establishing the concept-pair\/response-key combinations by positions of displayed text is simply too formidable a task.","In an SAITA directed to preschool children, conveyance of the concept-pair\/response-key combinations includes using colors and pictures, and matching input-key colors.  illustrates a visually displayed screen that has been developed to test strengths of association tested by the standard ITA in . Pictures representing flowers - are shown as a collage of all exemplars used to represent the category of flowers, above a colored band  having the same color as the left-hand input key ( in ). Similarly, pictures depicting insects - are shown as a collage of all exemplars used to represent the category insects above a second colored band  having the same color as the right-hand input key ( in ). Thus, the target-concept\/response-key combinations are naturally and graphically presented in the visual display by matching of the input-key colors to colored bands  and  and the picture collages associated with the colored bands. Thus, in an SAITA, a specially tailored input device can be combined with matching visual-display features to facilitate a non-verbal imparting of the concept\/response-key combinations in at least one conceptual dimension. Similar techniques may be used for the second conceptual dimension. For example, in the visual display shown visual display shown in , a collage of pictures depicting the affective dimension \u201cpleasant\u201d may be display below the colored bar , and a collage of pictures representing the emotion \u201cunpleasant\u201d may be displayed below the colored bar , so that the concept-pair\/response-key combinations are displayed visually. Alternatively, one conceptual dimension may be visual, as in , and the second conceptual dimension may be provided by audio information presented during instruction regarding the concept-pair\/response-key combinations. In this case, the subject may be trained by audio stimulus to depress the left-hand key when pleasant words are spoken and the right-hand key when unpleasant words are spoken. Various combinations of visual and audio presentation may be appropriate for different categories of subjects. For preschool children, it has been found that representing concept\/response-key combinations related to a first conceptual dimension by visual means, and representing concept \/response-key combinations related to a second conceptual dimension by audio means, may be most effective in conveying to the subject the concept-pair\/response-key combinations that are to be employed by the subject during each block.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIGS. 1A-F"],"b":"602"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["702","520","522"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["802","804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A-B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"],"b":["902","904","906"]},"For the SAITA directed to preschool children, stimuli directed to the first conceptual dimension, such as the target concepts {flowers, insects} in the exemplary test of  and -B, are always presented visually, as displayed pictures, while stimuli directed to the second conceptual dimension, such as the attribute concepts {pleasant, unpleasant}, are presented in an audio medium, such as by recorded enunciation of a word or phrase.

Subject-appropriate introduction may include certain types of positive stimulus, to engage the subject. For example, visual displays may employ certain types of colors that are found to be conducive to attracting the subject's attention and encouraging cooperation. Audio stimuli, including attractive music or other attention-attracting and positive-response-inducing stimuli may be presented. For certain categories of subjects, human administration may be important, rather than relying solely on automated administration of the SAITA through a computer interface. For the SAITA directed to preschool children, a human administrator is always present, to add explanations, monitor the test subject's attitude, performance, and understanding of test procedures, and to provide positive feedback. Test goals, general test procedures, and other aspects of the SAITA may be described in subject-appropriate manners, using examples, words, images, and other presentations of information appropriate to the category of subject. In step , the internal routines are configured for the congruent case. In step , a subject-appropriate concept-pair\/response-key-combination training with monitoring is invoked in order to establish the concept-pair\/response-key-combinations used in the current block of the test.

For example, additional instruction may be necessary, or a break with toys and other recreational activities may be needed, in the case of preschool children. In the case of disabled subjects, attention may need to be paid to various input procedures and information displays to ensure that the disabled subject disabled subject can properly receive and respond to presented information and stimuli.

Such explicit information, derived from Likert-type tests, is used to evaluate scoring methods for ITA tests, as mentioned above. As one example,  illustrate a Likert-type testing method adapted for preschool children, an example of a subject-appropriate Likert-type testing method (\u201cSALTM\u201d), that solicits explicit responses from subjects related to gender and math skills. The exemplary SALTM shown in  comprises 6 panels displayed on a computer screen, such as panel  in , each panel comprising two images, such as images - in . Each image is associated with two input features, such as input features  and  associated with image  in . Selection of the larger input feature  indicates  indicates strong agreement by a subject with a proposition posed by the test administrator related to the image , and selection of the smaller input feature  indicates less strong agreement by the subject with the proposition. In general, for each displayed panel, the subject is asked to select one image from the two images that bests answers or relates to a proposition, and then selects the appropriate input feature to indicate the strength of agreement by the subject that the selected image answers or relates to the proposition.","The panels shown in  comprise two three-panel tests, directed to a female subject, the panels of which are directed to: (1) perceived gender identity; (2) perceived gender stereotype; and (3) perceived mathself-concept. For example, after display of the first panel, shown in , the two children in the two images are described by name, e.g. Michael and Emily, and the subject is then asked which image is most like the subject, to assess the subject's perceived gender identity. Then, the subject is asked to indicate to what degree the selected images represent the subject. After display of the first panel, shown in , the characters in the two images are described by name, e.g., Jacob and Sarah, as working on a math problem, and the subject is then asked which character more enjoys working on the math problem, to assess the subject's degree of gender stereotyping with respect to math ability. After display of the third panel, shown in , the characters in the two images are described by name, e.g., Jessica and Ashley, as reading and working on a math problem, respectively, and the subject is then asked which character is most similar to the subject, to assess the subject's perceived math self-concept. The next three panels, shown in Figures D-F, are directed to assessing the same concepts, but change the order of, or activities of, the characters in the images. The subject's responses can be used to determine the subject's explicitly indicated strength of association between gender and math ability, to facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of a subsequently administered SAITA test for strength of association between gender and math ability.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["2102","2105","2108","2110","2112","2110","2114","2116","2118","2120","2122","2127","2127","2128"]},"The magnetic disk platters, optical disks, or solid-state electronic memories of mass-storage devices are one example of a computer-readable medium on or within which data can be stored and from which stored data can be retrieved by a computer system.
