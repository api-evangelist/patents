title: Wireless communication device configured to enter an active state based upon a detection of a potential request for communication session resources
abstract: Embodiments are directed to determining whether one or more physical user interactions are present, at a wireless communication device, that indicate a near-future potential communication session resource request. Before the determination, a communication interface of the device is in a dormant state characterized by the device not being permitted to engage in a communication session with a wireless communication network. The device transitions the communication interface, after the determination, from the dormant state to an active state. In the active state, the device performs one or more actions to reduce a delay associated with a transmission of the potential communication session resource request in the event that the potential communication session resource request is actually transmitted by the device. For example, in the active state, the device can power-up or wake-up a radio bearer or modem to reduce a delay before transmission of the potential communication session resource request.

Field of the Invention","Embodiments are directed to a wireless communication device that is configured to enter an active state based upon a detection of a physical user interaction indicating a near-future potential request for communication session resources.","2. Description of the Related Art","In modern wireless communication devices, a user interacts with various user interfaces of the device to request that a communication channel be opened so that the user can communicate to one or more other communication devices. Physical user interfaces, such as a key pad or push-to-talk (PTT) button, allow the user to dial in information or select information from a graphic user interface (GUI), such as the input of a phone number or selection of a another device from an appropriate screen, and the device will open a communication channel and signal to the intended communication device.","The wireless communication device includes several components that control the opening and maintenance of a communication channel, and these components typically sit in an inactive state on the device so as to conserve power during idle periods. Thus, when the user requests to communicate, the communication components are powered on and then the communication channel is opened (and\/or resources are requested). However, this set up time for the components transition to the active state delays the actual opening of the communication channel. In an application that is very time-sensitive to the communication channel setup, such as a PTT communication request, this delay can be noticeable and can impede the immediacy required for the communication.","Some existing communication devices have attempted to alleviate this problem by anticipating that the user is going to request to communicate and preemptively opening a communication channel even though the user has not expressly issued a channel request. For example, one existing communication device is configured to open a communication channel upon the user opening the \u201caddress book\u201d application resident on the communication device without the user actually having requested to communicate with a device shown in the address book. This anticipatory communication channel opening can be problematic, however, in that resources are requested and allocated from the wireless communication network, yet the user might not request a communication channel, potentially wasting the resources of both the device and the wireless communication network.","Embodiments are directed to determining whether one or more physical user interactions are present, at a wireless communication device, that indicate a near-future potential communication session resource request. Before the determination, a communication interface of the device is in a dormant state characterized by the device not being permitted to engage in a communication session with a wireless communication network. The device transitions the communication interface, after the determination, from the dormant state to an active state. In the active state, the device performs one or more actions to reduce a delay associated with a transmission of the potential communication session resource request in the event that the potential communication session resource request is actually transmitted by the device. For example, in the active state, the device can power-up or wake-up a radio bearer or modem to reduce a delay before transmission of the potential communication session resource request.","Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.","The words \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d are used herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d and\/or \u201cexample\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise, the term \u201cembodiments of the invention\u201d does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage or mode of operation.","Further, many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by, for example, elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)), by program instructions being executed by one or more processors, or by a combination of both. Additionally, these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus, the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms, all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition, for each of the embodiments described herein, the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as, for example, \u201clogic configured to\u201d perform the described action.","A High Data Rate (HDR) subscriber station, referred to herein as an access terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, referred to herein as modem pool transceivers (MPTs) or base stations (BS). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, referred to as a modem pool controller (MPC), base station controller (BSC) and\/or packet control function (PCF). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals.","The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called a reverse link or traffic channel. The communication link through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward link or traffic channel. As used herein the term traffic channel can refer to either a forward and\/or reverse traffic channel.","Further, in this description, the terms \u201ccommunication device,\u201d \u201cwireless device,\u201d \u201cwireless communications device,\u201d \u201cPTT communication device,\u201d \u201chandheld device,\u201d \u201cmobile device,\u201d \u201caccess terminal\u201d and\/or \u201chandset\u201d are used interchangeably. The terms \u201ccall\u201d and \u201ccommunication\u201d are also used interchangeably, and can be used to refer to a call between two or more parties, or alternatively to a data transport session that may not correspond to a call between two or more parties. The term \u201capplication\u201d as used herein is intended to encompass executable and non-executable software files, raw data, aggregated data, patches, and other code segments. All methods of interaction between applications are intended to be encompassed herein, to include all forms of invocation, execution, calling, and data exchanging. Further, like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, unless otherwise specified in the description.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  is a representative diagram of one embodiment of a system  with a wireless communication network in a common cellular telecommunication configuration, with communications occurring between the wireless communication devices ,,,. The system  here also includes a series of group communication computer devices (group communication servers)  that support a PTT system. The wireless network is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules communicate over-the-air between and among each other and\/or between and among components of a wireless network, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and\/or servers. A series of group communication servers  are shown here as connected to a group communication server LAN , but other computer devices can be accessible to the LAN  to provide functionality to any component on the network. Wireless communication devices ,,, can request packet data sessions from the group communication server(s)  using a data service option.","The back-office computer devices, such as the group communication server(s) , are connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PDSN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d) . The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art. It should also be noted that carrier boundaries and\/or PTT operator network boundaries do not inhibit or prohibit the sharing of data as described herein.","Cellular telephones and mobile telecommunication devices, such as wireless telephone ( in ), are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held PDAs. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless device. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can download many types of applications, such as web pages, applets, MIDlets, games and data. In wireless devices that have designated a communication group, the wireless communication device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, all such direct communications will occur through, or at the control of, the group communication computer server(s) . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication computer device  itself, but the group communication computer device  is able to ultimately control the communication. Thus, group communication sessions within the system  may herein be referred to as server-arbitrated group communication sessions, as conventionally group communication computer device  is the server-side  component that is aware of and\/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the communication group, or direct the identity of the members of a communication group to another computer device. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN , or across the wireless network, or Internet generally, are not limited.","In addition to voice communications between the wireless communication devices, other media can be sent such as graphic media, to include pictures in JPEG, TIF, and the like, audio files such as MP3, MP4, WAV, and the like. The media can also be streaming media, such as a multimedia application (e.g., Powerpoint, MOV file, and the like). The group-directed media can also be streaming media, or an interactive session on another computer device on the wireless communication network, such as a hosted game or private bulletin board. Also, for PTT and\/or push-to-transfer (PTX) communications, the group-directed communication could be half-duplex audio and\/or video conferencing among members of the communication group in substantial real-time, or in delay.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":["74","78","14","80","14","14","82","82","84","84","84","86","84","88"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a mobile telephone , with a graphics display , but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform  as known in the art, such as a mobile device , or even a separate computer platform  that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk. The graphics display  can present not only information about the ongoing group call, but also the information on the group-directed media, to include a file preview as is more fully described herein.","In this embodiment of the wireless device, the computer platform  also includes a direct communication interface  (e.g., a radio bearer) that can open the direct communication channel from the wireless device. The direct communication interface  can also be part of the standard communication interface for the wireless device which ordinarily carries the voice and data transmitted to and from the wireless device. The direct communication interface  typically is comprised of hardware as is known in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["82","74","82","100","102","104","104","100","104"]},"The PTT Client  is an application that offers access to PTT services through an external interface, here shown at a PTT-aware UI . The PTT Client includes all the functions required to enable mobile operating system  applications, such as the other resident applications . In addition to providing access to PTT services with the PTT Client , the PTT Client  can act as an isolation layer between all PTT-aware applications and the interface to the group communication computer device . In this embodiment, the PTT Client  maintains access to PTT services, responds to group communication requests, processes all PTT-aware mobile operating system applications requests for PTT services, processes all outgoing PTT requests, collects and packages vocoder packets for originating PTT talk spurts, and parses packets of vocoder data for terminated PTT talk spurts.","In one embodiment, a handler will provide direct access to the external communication interface, or here, an AMSS  interface. The media handler responds to PTT requests for group-directed services by invoking the appropriate APIs, such as those from other resident applications , and can service the requests from the user and informs the user the result of any group-directed media request. The handler can be invoked to have the AMSS  interface brought to an active state and ready to broadcast on the network, as is more fully described herein. Thus, the AMSS  or other communication interface typically has a dormant state and active state such that resources are only requested from the wireless communication network in the active state of the communication interface, e.g. the device components are powered-up and ready to transmit.","The wireless communication device  includes one or more user interfaces with which the user physically interacts with the wireless communication device, such as the PTT button , numerical press-button key set , or soft key , as shown in . The user interaction may include requesting a communication channel from the communication interface . In an example, a predetermined physical interaction by the user with a user interface indicative of a forthcoming request for communication, the communication interface  will change to an active state without requesting resources from the wireless communication network, such as fully opening a communication channel (e.g., a traffic channel). The wireless communication device  can also activate one or more applications  in preparation for the opening of a communication channel in addition to the communication interface  being changed to an active state. For example, if the user is invoking a resident application for another function that is likely to be used in conjunction with the opening of the communication channel, such as a data compression program, such application can be invoked at the receipt of the physical interactions. The different states (e.g., active state, dormant state and communication state) of the communication interface  will be described in more detail below with respect to .","As embodied here, where at least one user interface is a pressable button , the predetermined physical interaction is a button-press. Another UI present on the wireless communication device  is a series of pressable numeric keys, and the predetermined physical interaction can also be a set number of key presses, such as dialing the first three numbers of an area code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4A","b":["74","92","74","120","120","92","74","74","74","92","122"]},"For example, a physical user interaction from which a potential communication session resource request can be inferred within the threshold period of time can be the user expressly requesting the opening of a communication channel. In another example, the physical user interaction (e.g., a predetermined physical interaction) may correspond to a user of the device  beginning to press numeric keys indicative of a phone number being dialed, with the device  being programmed to anticipate that once the user completes entry of the phone number, the user will request a call to be initiated.","Upon entry into state , the wireless communication device  loads applications and\/or takes other actions, such that the wireless communication device  can open a communication channel or request resources upon receipt of request to open the communication channel more quickly than if the device  had remained in the dormant state . For example, the applications and\/or other actions that occur upon entry into the active state may include bringing up the radio bearer (i.e., transitioning the radio bearer of the communication interface  from an inactive or dormant to an active state), which involves waking up the communication interface  (e.g., a modem antenna) of the device . For example, in EV-DO, the device  wakes up the radio bearer by executing a \u2018searcher\u2019 program. In an example, the radio bearer can transition from a dormant or inactive state to an active state in approximately 20 milliseconds (ms).","In active state , if the user does not request to initiate a communication session (e.g., the user does not trigger a communication session resource request) after the elapse of a predetermined period of time, the wireless communication device  will transition the communication interface  back to dormant state . Otherwise, if the user requests to initiate a communication session (e.g., by pressing a \u2018Send\u2019 or \u2018Connect\u2019 button after designating a party or parties to be called, etc.), or originally requested initiation of a communication session, then the wireless communication device  transitions to communication state  and opens the communication channel and\/or sends a request for resources (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) resources) to facilitate the communication session. It will be appreciated that, alternatively, the communication interface  may advance from dormant state  directly to communication state  if the detection of physical user interaction indicative of a potential communication session resource request is concurrent with the detection of an actual communication session resource request or communication session initiation instruction from the user.","In communication state , once the communication channel is closed (e.g., after a call is dropped, after a user pressed an \u2018End\u2019 button on the wireless communication device , etc.), the wireless communication device  will transition the communication interface  back to the dormant state . It should be noted that firmware or software can be configured to control the state transitions of the communication interface  between dormant state , active state  and communication state .","As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, conventionally, the device  would wake up the radio bearer of the communication interface  either periodically (e.g., to check a downlink paging or control channel for potential or actual pages of the device ), or when the user of device  indicates an express request to open a communication channel and send data to an access network. However, as shown in , in an embodiment of the invention the device  first enters the active state  and wakes up the communication interface  before the express request by the user. This means that the device  need not wait for the radio bearer to be established when an actual user command to open a communication channel and send data occurs upon entry into the communication state . In an example, as noted above, the radio bearer of the communication interface  takes approximately 20 milliseconds (ms) to bring up from an inactive to an active state. Thus, per data transmission, having the bearer channel pre-established when a user command to send data is received saves 20 ms per data transmission (e.g., except when the user command overlaps with the periodic wake-up to check for downlink data). This assumes, of course, that the device  begins in the dormant state  and is not already engaged in communication sessions where its radio bearer is already active.","Further, it will be appreciated that if the user requests to initiate a communication session while in active state  and the process for bringing up the radio bearer has not yet completed, the active state  still changes to the communication state  and the device  continues to wake up the radio bearer for the communication session. Thus, the time savings before data can be sent from the device  in this case corresponds to the amount of time the device  was in the active state  before the transition to the communication state , which may be within the range of 0 to 20 ms, assuming 20 ms corresponds to the total time for waking up the radio bearer.","An illustrative example of the state transitions of  during communication session setup will now be described with respect to . Accordingly,  illustrates a communication session setup process based on the state transitions of  according to an embodiment of the invention.","Referring to , assume that the communication interface  is in dormant state  when a user of the device  pushes a PTT button to initiate a PTT communication session, . Accordingly, the process of  advances to blocks  and  in parallel. In , the device  wakes up the radio bearer and the communication interface  thereby transitions from the dormant state  to the active state . In , the device  launches a runtime environment (e.g., BREW, as discussed above). After launching the runtime environment in , the device  further launches a communication session management program (e.g., a QChat client for handling group communication sessions) within the runtime environment. Next, the communication session management program prepares data for transmission to an access network on a reverse link (e.g., a request for resources to support the communication session), and sends the prepared data to the radio bearer for transmission, . At this point, the communication interface  transitions from the active state  (i.e., a state wherein the interface  is ready to send data but is not actually sending data) to communication state , and transmits the data, . As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, because the radio bearer is already awake due to block , an additional delay associated with waking up the radio bearer after the data preparation block  can be reduced and\/or avoided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4A"],"b":["140","74","82","142","144","92","122","120","144","140","142","74","142","74","142","142"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["92","122","74","74"]},"Referring to , the wireless communication device  determines whether a physical user interaction has been detected that indicates a potential communication session resource request (e.g., a request for a traffic channel, QoS resources, etc.), on the part of the user of the device , is likely to occur within a threshold period of time (e.g., 200 ms, 2 seconds, 5 seconds, etc.). For example, the physical user interactions checked for by the wireless communication device  may correspond a predetermined or preset listing of physical user inputs known to be associated (e.g., from an empirical study, from a history of a particular user's interaction with the device , etc.) with likely communication session resource requests within the given time frame, or threshold time.","In , if one or more of the predetermined physical user interactions are detected based on the determination of , then the communication interface  is transitioned to an active state  as shown at step , and then a determination is made as to whether a communication channel has been requested (e.g., when the potential communication session is actually requested to be initiated by the user), as shown at decision . As noted above with respect to , upon transitioning to the active state  from the dormant state  may correspond to a preemptive wakeup of the radio bearer, or antenna, of the device  before a user explicitly requests data to be transmitted to an access network by requesting a communication channel. Otherwise, if the one or more predetermined physical user interaction are not detected at decision , then a determination is likewise made at decision  as to whether one or more communication session resources (e.g., a communication or traffic channel, a given amount of Quality of Service (QoS) resources, etc.) have been requested by the user.","If communication session resources have not been requested at decision , a determination is then made as to whether a predetermined period of time has elapsed, as shown at decision . Otherwise, if communication session resources have been requested by the user of the device  at decision , then the communication interface  transitions to the communication state , and communication session resources are requested and\/or opened,  (e.g., a communication channel is opened, QoS resources are requested, etc). As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the communication state  can be transitioned to in  either from the active state  (e.g., if the physical user interaction indicative of a potential communication session resource request is detected in \/), or from the dormant state  (e.g., if the physical user interaction indicative of a potential communication session resource request is not detected in \/).","After transitioning to the communication state , the user of the wireless communication device  engages in the communication session after the communication session resources are allocated (e.g., the user listens to a multicast session while a floor-holder is speaking, the user him\/herself is the active floor-holder for the multicast session, the user participates in a non-multicast direct call to one other call participant, the user participates in a non-call data transport session, etc.). Also, after transitioning the communication interface  to the communication state , the wireless communication device  determines, , when the communication session has ended. When the wireless communication device  determines that the communication session is over (e.g., the call has dropped, the user has pressed an \u2018End\u2019 button to cancel the call or data transport session, etc.), the process advances to .","Returning to , if the communication resources have not been requested or opened at decision , then a decision is made as to whether a predetermined period of time has elapsed (e.g. 5 seconds) since the communication interface  transitioned to active state . As will be appreciated, this grants the user of the device  a brief period to consider whether to initiate a communication session after the physical user interaction is detected in  and . If the predetermined period of time has not elapsed at decision , then the process returns to determine if communication session resources (e.g., a communication channel, QoS resources, etc.) have been requested at decision . Otherwise, if the predetermined period has elapsed at decision , or once the communication session is determined to have stopped at decision , the communication interface  transitions back to the dormant state , as shown at step , and the process terminates, as shown at termination .","Accordingly, in an embodiment of the invention, the wireless communication device  includes one or more user interfaces (e.g., such as PTT button  or key set ) with which the user physically interacts with the wireless communication device , such interaction to include requesting a communication channel (or other communication session resources) from a communication interface  of the wireless communication device , including the steps of receiving a predetermined physical interaction by the user at a user interface indicative of a forthcoming request for communication, and changing the communication interface  to an active state (such as state  in ), the communication interface  having at least a dormant state , active state  and communication state, wherein communication session resources are prepared to be requested from a wireless communication network in the active state, whereas the communication session resources are only actually requested from the wireless communication network in the communication state. Accordingly, a potential, near-future communication session resource request can be inferred from a given physical user interface input.","Embodiments can further include, during the \u2018active\u2019 state  for the communication interface, activating one or more applications  (e.g., a searcher program to wake-up the radio bearer) in preparation for the opening of a communication channel from the communication interface  in addition to the communication interface  being changed to an active state. If the wireless communication device  includes a user interface with a pressable button, such as PTT button , then receiving a predetermined physical interaction may correspond to receiving a button-press of the PTT button  in at least one example. If the mobile telephone  includes a user interface having a plurality of numeric keys (e.g., key set ), then the predetermined physical interaction may correspond to receiving a given number of key presses of the numeric keys (e.g., in a given sequence that is consistent with a phone number in a contact list maintained by the mobile telephone , etc.). If the user interface is embodied as in , with a pressable soft key  on a graphic user interface  of the wireless communication device , receiving the predetermined physical interaction may correspond to pressing the soft key .","The transition of the communication interface  to an active state based upon the detected physical user interaction(s) indicative of a potential communication session resource request can be controlled by firmware or software applications of the wireless communication device . Likewise, in the active state , upon detection of an actual indication that the user wishes to initiate the communication session, the firmware of software applications of the wireless communication device  can transition the communication interface  to the communication state and request an open communication channel, or other communication session resources such as QoS resources. The firmware of software applications of the wireless communication device  can also be configured to transition or change the communication interface  back to a dormant state  from the active state  after the elapse of a predetermined period without the user requesting to initiate the communicate session, as shown in .","In view of the methods being executable on a mobile device computer platform, the method can accordingly be performed by a program resident in a computer readable medium, where the program directs the mobile device or other computer device having a computer platform to perform the steps of the method. The computer readable medium can be the memory of the device, a server, or can be in a connective database. Further, the computer readable medium can be in a secondary storage media that is loadable onto a wireless communications device computer platform, such as a magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, hard disk, flash memory, or other storage media as is known in the art.","In one or more exemplary embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.

Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium.
