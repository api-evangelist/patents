title: Methods for real-time and near real-time interactions with robots that service a facility
abstract: In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a service robot and methods for controlling such a robot are provided. In particular, the robot is configured to sense the presence of a person and to take a next action in response to sensing the presence of the person. As examples, the robot could leave the area, await commands from the person, or enter an idle or sleep state or mode until the person leaves.

No. 61\/024,019 filed on Jan. 28, 2008 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present inventive concepts relate to methods for optimal interactions between people and service robots, including robotic cleaners, while they are servicing a facility.","One of the advantages of service robots is that they can do the dull and dirty jobs in human facilities, such as homes, commercial and industrial buildings, and institutions. However, that very action of robotic service itself may be unpleasant, inconvenient, disruptive, or even dangerous to a human that comes into proximity of the working robot.","Previous service robots have ignored this problem. As an example, current robot cleaners blithely treat humans the same way they treat the leg of a stool; usually by bumping into it, going around, it and continuing their work.","Although some robots built for human interaction have included the ability to recognize humans in their proximity, to date this has been used to further the interaction itself, but not to further a distinct service agenda.","The present invention has been conceived to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art. In accordance with aspects of the present invention, provided is a system and method that allows a robot to service a facility while more effectively interacting with people.","In order to achieve the above aspects, there is provided various methods of enabling the robot to optimally respond in the presence of a person.","The robot can be configured to have a work pause, whereby when the robot senses the proximity of a person it stops working and remains still and silent.","The robot can be configured to move out of the way, whereby when the robot senses the proximity of a person it stops working and actively moves into a position of the room that is least disturbing the person. This may be away from the person or nearer the person, depending on other factors.","The robot can be configured to move out of the room, whereby when the robot sense the proximity of a person it moves to another area of the facility where it is no longer in proximity to people.","The robot can be configured to look to a person to point things out when the person enters the room. This can provide a seamless way to improve the decision making process of the robot.","The robot can be configured to keep track of a work stoppage, so that it can restart work in the area once the person has left.","Hereinafter, aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith, with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments, detailed descriptions of well-known items, functions, or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.","It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another, but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example, a first element can be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element can be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201con\u201d or \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or \u201cdirectly connected\u201d or \u201cdirectly coupled\u201d to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., \u201cbetween\u201d versus \u201cdirectly between,\u201d \u201cadjacent\u201d versus \u201cdirectly adjacent,\u201d etc.).","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms \u201ccomprises,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d and\/or \u201cincluding,\u201d when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and\/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and\/or groups thereof.","Spatially relative terms, such as \u201cbeneath,\u201d \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201clower,\u201d \u201cabove,\u201d \u201cupper\u201d and the like may be used to describe an element and\/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and\/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and\/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as \u201cbelow\u201d and\/or \u201cbeneath\u201d other elements or features would then be oriented \u201cabove\u201d the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.","In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a robotic cleaner (or other type of service platform) can be configured to implement a method of more effectively interacting with people while servicing a space. The platform and method can determine that the platform is in the presence of people and implement a different servicing pattern or behavior as a function thereof. The determination that the robotic platform is in the presence of people can be accomplished using any one or more of a plurality of types of sensors mounted on, integral with, or coupled to the robotic platform or mounted elsewhere in the environment and in communication, directly or indirectly with the robotic platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"In step  the robot is in the process of servicing (e.g., cleaning) a room (or area). In step  the robot senses whether or not a person has entered the room. A variety of different types of sensors could be used, such as, for example, motion detection sensors, video camera sensors, acoustic sensors and so on.","If in step  a person was not sensed, the process continues in step , where the robot continues to clean, in this example. Thus, the sensing can serve as an interrupt condition to the servicing condition of the robot. If in step  the answer was \u201cyes\u201d then the process continues to step  where the robot stops and sits still. The robot can then can then transition to a quiet, sleep, or inactive mode where it makes little or no noise and uses minimum power, e.g., at least enough to power the sensors.","In step  the robot senses whether the person left the room or area.

In step  the robot moves to another area to service (e.g., clean) that area. In step  the robot returns to the original area to finish cleaning.","In the various service robot methods, therefore, the robot can be configured to keep track of the work stoppage, so that it can restart work in that area once the person has left.","As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a service robot (e.g., vacuum) includes a memory for storing instructions and data, and a processor for executing the instructions.
