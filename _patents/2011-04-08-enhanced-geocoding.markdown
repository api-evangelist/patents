{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is related to U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/083,139, which was concurrently filed with this application, and which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Aspects of the invention generally relate to enhanced geocoding capabilities. In particular, various aspects of the invention include methods and systems for locating predetermined addresses on a map grid.","Geocoding refers to the process of finding the correct geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and\/or longitude coordinates) from data such as street addresses, zip codes, postal codes, etc. Over the years, various geocoding techniques involving address interpolation, the use of land parcel centroids, and the use of global positioning systems (GPS) have been developed.","However, problems remain with using these systems\/methods for practical geocoding applications. For instance, a geocoding system may fail when several different addresses may be listed under similar names and\/or when a given address encompasses an area beyond a threshold value.","Thus, advanced geocoding systems\/techniques are needed for pinpointing the location of physical addresses close to a reference point.","In light of the foregoing background, the following presents a simplified summary of the present disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description provided below.","Aspects of the disclosure address one or more of the issues mentioned above by disclosing methods, computer readable media, and apparatuses for locating physical addresses close to an entity on a single street. An enhanced geocoding module may be used to locate physical addresses close to a predetermined location.","With another aspect of the disclosure, an enhanced geocoding module may return physical addresses that are on a predetermined street, lane, road, alley, or some other thoroughfare. This feature may be implemented as a hardware module either in a mobile device and\/or a fixed-location computing device. In either scenario, a user of the device may specify a location (e.g., latitude\/longitude coordinates, street address, etc.) that the enhanced geocoding module may use as a base location or address in returning other addresses or locations situated on a single street and close to the base location or address. Alternatively, a location tracking system (e.g., global positioning system (GPS), etc.) embedded within the device may first determine the current location of a user and use the current location to return other addresses or locations situated on a single street and close to the current location or address.","Aspects of the disclosure may be provided in a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions to perform one or more of the process steps described herein.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. The Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","As discussed above, there are problems associated with the way addresses are currently located on a map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","100","101","103","101","105","107","109","115"]},"I\/O  may include a microphone, keypad, touch screen, and\/or stylus through which a user of the enhanced geocoding module  may provide input, and may also include one or more of a speaker for providing audio output and a video display device for providing textual, audiovisual and\/or graphical output. Software may be stored within memory  and\/or storage to provide instructions to processor  for enabling module  to perform various functions. For example, memory  may store software used by the device , such as an operating system , application programs , and an associated database . Processor  and its associated components may allow the device  to run a series of computer-readable instructions to generate a rectangular grid for determining the physical addresses that are closest to a given location. For instance, when the geocode of a mobile device is determined, processor  may create a grid with the geocode of the mobile device at the center of the grid. In addition, processor  may create several coordinate points around the center of the grid so that a reverse geocoding server may be called to reverse the geocodes of the various coordinate points into physical addresses.","The server  may operate in a networked environment supporting connections to one or more remote computers, such as terminals  and . The terminals  and  may be personal computers or servers that include many or all of the elements described above relative to the computing device . Alternatively, terminal  and\/or  may be a reverse geocoding server called by module  to reverse the geocode of various coordinate points on a grid into physical addresses. The network connections depicted in  include a local area network (LAN)  and a wide area network (WAN) , but may also include other networks. When used in a LAN networking environment, the server  is connected to the LAN  through a network interface or adapter . When used in a WAN networking environment, the server  may include a modem  or other means for establishing communications over the WAN , such as the Internet . It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are illustrative and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used. The existence of any of various well-known protocols such as TCP\/IP, Ethernet, FTP, HTTP and the like is presumed.","Additionally, an application program  used by the enhanced geocoding module  according to an illustrative embodiment of the disclosure may include computer executable instructions for invoking functionality related to creating a rectangular grid for locating addresses on a single street.","Enhanced geocoding module  and\/or terminals  or  may also be mobile terminals, such as smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. including various other components, such as a battery, speaker, and antennas (not shown).","The disclosure is operational with numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations. Examples of well known computing systems, environments, and\/or configurations that may be suitable for use with the disclosure include, but are not limited to, personal computers, server computers, hand-held or laptop devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based systems, set top boxes, programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and distributed computing environments that include any of the above systems or devices, and the like.","The disclosure may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The disclosure may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked, for example, through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.","Referring to , an illustrative system  for implementing methods according to the present disclosure is shown. As illustrated, system  may include one or more workstations\/servers . Workstations  may be local or remote, and are connected by one or more communications links  to computer network  that is linked via communications links  to the enhanced geocoding module . In certain embodiments, workstations  may be different servers that reverse the geocode of coordinate points provided by module , or, in other embodiments, workstations  may be different computing devices (e.g., mobile devices) mapped by enhanced geocoding module . In system , the enhanced geocoding module  may be any suitable server, processor, computer, or data processing device, or combination of the same.","Computer network  may be any suitable computer network including the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), or any combination of any of the same. Communications links  and  may be any communications links suitable for communicating between workstations  and server , such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, etc.","The disclosure that follows in the Figures may be implemented by one or more of the components in  and\/or other components, including other computing devices.","In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, methods, computer-readable media, and apparatuses are disclosed in which an enhanced geocoding module  may locate addresses located on a single street, lane, alley, gulley, road, or other thoroughfare. To accomplish this task, the geocode of the enhanced geocoding module  may be extracted. In some embodiments, the geocode of a predetermined point specified by a user using enhanced gecoding module  may be extracted. The geocode may refer to any of several geospatial attributes, including latitude, longitude, altitude, date, time, and\/or internet protocol (IP) address. Then the enhanced geocoding module  may create a grid with a predetermined granularity around the extracted geocode. The granularity of a grid may refer to the distance between any two coordinate points of the grid. The extracted geocode of enhanced geocoding module  may be located at the center of the grid; then enhanced geocoding module  may create several coordinate points around the grid. Next, enhanced geocoding module  may make a batch request to a server (e.g., via an application programming interface (API) of a server such as one maintained by Google, Microsoft, etc.) to reverse the geocodes of each of the coordinate points on the grid into physical addresses.","Once a call is made to the reverse geocoding server (e.g., terminals \/ and\/or workstations ) to reverse the geocode of a given coordinate point, this coordinate point and its associated physical address may be saved in a memory of the enhanced geocoding module  to avoid having to make repeated calls to the reverse geocoding server for the same physical address.","Enhanced geocoding module  may then sort the physical addresses in order of how far they are from the enhanced geocoding module . The physical addresses that are the closest to the enhanced geocoding module  may then be presented to a user on a display screen of the enhanced geocoding module . All of the physical addresses located on a single street may be grouped and presented to a user in an order consistent with how far the physical addresses are from the user of the enhanced geocoding module  or consistent with how far the physical addresses are from some other user specified location. In this way, the enhanced geocoding module  may present physical addresses to a user via a two-tiered sorting technique-first the addresses may be sorted by street and then these same-street addresses may be sorted by distance from the enhanced geocoding module .","In addition, enhanced geocoding server  may overlay various icons related to the returned physical addresses on a map representing the addresses. These icons may be supplied to the enhanced geocoding server  by the reverse geocoding server, along with the physical addresses. The icons may be used to represent physical addresses (e.g., homes, business addresses, etc.) that may have a record in a database (e.g., workstation ) maintained by an entity using the enhanced geocoding module .","In an alternate embodiment, enhanced geocoding module  may use a predetermined global positioning system (GPS) coordinate to draw a circle around the GPS coordinate and determine the radial distances of the nearest physical addresses to the GPS coordinate. Therefore, instead of drawing a grid, enhanced geocoding module  may use various points within the circle to make a batch request to a reverse geocoding server for physical addresses associated with one or more GPS coordinates within the circle.","One of the drawbacks of this technique is that by looking at the radial distances to a given GPS coordinate, the reverse geocoding server may return physical addresses that are not located on the same street, alley, road, gulley, and\/or other thoroughfare. Thus, these addresses may not in fact be the closest physical addresses to a given location, as determined by the amount of time that it takes to walk, drive, etc. to the addresses.","As opposed to techniques involving the use of radial distances from a given GPS coordinate, the approach of using grids for finding the nearest physical address allows addresses on the same street, lane, alley, gulley, road, or other thoroughfare to be located.","The distance between grid points may be variable and may be presented in any distance units, including miles, kilometers, feet, yards, etc. For instance, the coordinate points of the grid may be close together when mapping densely populated urban areas and may be farther apart when mapping sparsely populated rural areas. In other embodiments, the distance between grid points may be an average value, regardless of the area being mapped.","The grid itself may be a rectangular grid. In some aspects, the size of the grid may be created so as to minimize the number of calls to the reverse geocoding server. For some applications, the grid may include 81 coordinate points.","The geographical area covered by the grid points may be determined by a zoom level, as set by the enhanced geocoding server . An appropriate zoom level may need to be chosen in order to allow the proper coordinate points to be returned by the reverse geocoding server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","204","204","302","204","304","300","306","204","204"]},"The statistics in statistics section  may be displayed over various time periods, including a day, week, month, or pay period. Statistics in statistics section  may be shown for a given individual\/group (e.g., a user of enhanced geocoding module ), as well as the average value of various statistics for an entire group and the identity of the leader of each statistic. The statistics may include a given salesperson's sign-ups, close rate, attempt rate, contact rate, attempts, contacts, hours, and sign-ups per hour. The salesperson's sign-ups may relate to the number of customers that the salesperson actually convinced to signup for services\/products provided by the company, the close rate may represent the number of sign-ups attributed to a given salesperson compared to the total number of potential customers visited, the attempt rate may refer to the total number of potential customers that a given salesperson visits, the contact rate may refer to the total number of potential customers that a given salesperson contacts using any communication modality (e.g., phone, mail, etc.), the attempts may refer to the total number of attempts made by a given salesperson at acquiring new customers, the contacts may refer to the total number of contacts or leads for potential customers as developed by a given salesperson, the hours may refer to the total number of hours that a given salesperson spends mining for potential customers, and the sign-ups per hour may refer to the number of sign-ups attributed to a given salesperson per hour on the job.","The display screen  may also display a physical addresses section  in which various physical addresses that are shown on the map  are shown, sorted by street and distance from the enhanced geocoding module . In displaying the physical addresses section , the display screen  may also use various color codes (e.g., red, yellow, green) to represent the status of potential customers\/customers located at the physical address. In one embodiment, red may be used to designate physical addresses that house current customers of a company using enhanced geocoding module , yellow may be used to designate physical addresses that house former customers of the company, and green may be used to designate physical addresses that house potential customers of the company.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["204","401","204","403","204"]},"The process may then move to step  where the enhanced geocoding module  may determine several coordinate points of interest on the grid. These coordinate points may represent locations that are close to the present location of the module . The enhanced geocoding module  may then make a batch request to a reverse geocoding server to provide the street-level addresses of the coordinate points in step .","Once the request is made, the reverse geocoding server may return the physical addresses of the coordinate points in step . The geocodes along with the returned physical addresses may be cached in the enhanced geocoding module  in step . The process may then move to step  where the enhanced geocoding module  may sort the returned physical addresses based on the street location and based on the distance from the enhanced geocoding module  and\/or the distance from a user-specified point (e.g., in the case where the enhanced geocoding module  is a fixed computing device requesting addresses around a given coordinate point).","Finally, the process may move to step  where the enhanced geocoding module  may display a map, statistical information, and street-sorted physical addresses to a user. As described earlier, the map may include icons that indicate the status of various potential groups\/individuals that may or may not be customers of an entity using the enhanced geocoding module . The statistical information may detail various statistics on individuals\/groups associated with the entity (e.g., customer sign-ups, hours logged, etc.).","Aspects of the invention have been described in terms of illustrative embodiments thereof. Numerous other embodiments, modifications and variations within the scope and spirit of the appended claims will occur to persons of ordinary skill in the art from a review of this disclosure. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the steps illustrated in the illustrative figures may be performed in other than the recited order, and that one or more steps illustrated may be optional in accordance with aspects of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example and is not limited in the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
