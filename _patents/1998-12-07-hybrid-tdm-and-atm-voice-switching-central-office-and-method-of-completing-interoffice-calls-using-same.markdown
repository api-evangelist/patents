title: Hybrid TDM and ATM voice switching central office and method of completing inter-office calls using same
abstract: A hybrid central office for serving a plurality of subscriber lines while serving as a virtual access tandem to a subnetwork of central offices having a connection to an ATM backbone network is described. The hybrid central office includes a computing module having a messaging interface to the ATM network, an inter-working trunk interface to the ATM network and a trunk connection to the PSTN. The hybrid central office serves as a tandem switch for other central offices connected to the subnetwork. Other central offices are preferably connected to the subnetwork by a signal large trunk group. All inter-office call routing is therefore handled by the hybrid central office. The hybrid central office also provides a gateway to the PSTN. Inter-office calls originated and terminated within the subnetwork are set up by the virtual access tandem but after call set up, the virtual access tandem is not involved in the call. The advantage is the utilization of spare processing capacity in a central office to off-load inter-office trunking congestion, as well as a significant reduction in trunking maintenance costs.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention, relates to the transfer of voice and voice grade telephone data over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) facilities and, in particular, to a novel subnetwork arrangement in which a central office serves a plurality of subscriber lines while serving as a virtual access tandem to a subnetwork of central offices having a connection to an ATM backbone network.","The introduction of the Internet to the general public and the ensuing explosion of interest and demand for access to the Internet through telephone service provider networks has placed considerable strain on existing telecommunications infrastructure. Telephone service provider networks are now being overwhelmed by the explosion of data traffic over an infrastructure that was not intended for and is not capable of supporting the exponential increase in demand currently being experienced. This exponential increase in demand is particularly responsible for the exhaustion of resources at the access tandem level of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).","Concurrently with the explosion and demand for telephone services, most regulatory authorities have now opened the telephone service market to competition. Consequently, the incumbent service providers no longer enjoy a monopoly which makes massive capital investment in infrastructure attractive. There has therefore been a notable interest in new methods for increasing call handling capacity and reducing overhead and operating costs. Voice and voice grade data services over ATM networks have been proposed by several equipment providers as an alternative architecture for new infrastructure to augment the PSTN. The inherent advantages and disadvantages of ATM networks are well known. ATM offers flexible routing solutions which enable more efficient use of resources than the traditional hierarchical structure which has evolved in the PSTN. However, current ATM switches are incapable of call set up rates expected by the general public. Nonetheless, the diligent application of ingenuity has substantially overcome the disadvantages of the use of ATM to support voice and voice grade data services and ATM subnetworks are being constructed to off-load portions of the bearer traffic contributing to congestion in the PSTN.","A principal focus of the technical developments respecting the use of ATM networks to relieve congestion in the PSTN has been the use of ATM networks as a transport backbone for voice and voice grade data. While this focus has lead to the invention of many valuable tools useful in providing reliable service at competitive rates, the problem of inter-office trunking growth has only been partially addressed. There therefore exists a need for a method and apparatus capable of handling trunking growth economically, while reducing overhead maintenance costs in order to enable the provision of telephone services at competitive prices.","It is therefore a primary object of the invention to provide a hybrid central office for serving a plurality of subscriber lines while also serving as a virtual access tandem to a subnet of central offices connected to an ATM backbone network.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a subnetwork of central offices in which each of the central offices are connected by a trunk group to an ATM-based virtual access tandem, which is responsible for routing all calls originating in or terminating in the subnetwork.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a subnetwork in which the virtual access tandem is responsible for routing calls originating and terminating in the subnetwork.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a telephone subnetwork which utilizes an ATM backbone for completing switched telephone calls in which a plurality of central offices are connected to the ATM backbone by interfaces for converting pulse code modulated (PCM) data to ATM cells and vice versa, and one of the plurality of central offices is adapted to function as a virtual tandem for the subnetwork.","It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a method of completing an inter-office call originating at a central office in a subnetwork that includes a plurality of central offices which respectively serve a plurality of subscriber lines, a one of the central offices serving as a virtual tandem for the subnetwork.","The invention therefore provides a hybrid central office for serving a plurality of subscriber lines while serving as a virtual access tandem to a subnetwork of central offices having a connection to an ATM backbone network, comprising an inter-working bearer traffic interface to the ATM backbone network to permit the hybrid central office to receive bearer traffic from and transfer bearer traffic to any one of the central offices in the subnetwork, the inter-working bearer traffic interface being adapted to convert pulse code modulated (PCM) data to ATM cells and vice versa; a trunk interface to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to permit the hybrid central office to receive PCM data from and transfer PCM data to the PSTN; and a computing module having a signaling interface to the ATM backbone network to permit the computing module to send messages to and receive messages from any one of a plurality of distributed-access bearer traffic interfaces respectively associated with the central offices in the subnetwork, the computing module being adapted to access information for routing inter-office calls originated at or terminated at any one of the central offices.","In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a telephone subnetwork which utilizes an ATM backbone for completing switched telephone calls, comprising in combination a plurality of central offices connected to the ATM backbone by respective interfaces for converting PCM data to ATM cells and vice versa, each of the central offices being respectively adapted to serve a plurality of subscriber lines; and a one of the plurality of central offices being further adapted to function as a virtual tandem for the subnetwork and to control inter-office call routing for calls that originate or terminate in the subnetwork.","In yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of completing an inter-office call originating at a central office in a subnetwork that includes a plurality of central offices which respectively serve a plurality of subscriber lines, each of the central offices being connected to an ATM backbone network by an interface that converts PCM data to ATM cells and vice versa, a one of the central offices serving as a virtual tandem for the subnetwork, comprising the steps of:","a) at the originating central office, formulating an IAM relating to the inter-office call, the IAM containing a destination point code (DPC) of the virtual tandem;","b) receiving the IAM at the virtual tandem and translating a called number in the IAM to determine a next hop destination for the call;","c) modifying the IAM to change an originating point code (OPC) to the point code of the virtual tandem and the destination point code (DPC) to the point code of the next hop destination for the call, and forwarding the modified IAM to the next hop destination for the call;","d) formulating a fabric control message and sending the fabric control message through the ATM backbone to a terminating interface in the subnetwork to enable a virtual circuit through the ATM backbone to transfer the call; and","e) sending a connection message from the terminating interface in the subnetwork to an interface associated with the originating central office to enable the virtual circuit for transferring the call through the ATM backbone.","The invention therefore provides a novel structure for a subnet of central offices connected to an ATM backbone which is adapted to relieve inter-office trunking congestion while providing an efficient network structure that enables competitive pricing of telephone services. In accordance with the novel subnetwork structure, a plurality of central offices are connected by interfaces to an ATM backbone network. One of the central offices, preferably one having the most idle computing capacity, is designated as a virtual tandem for the subnetwork. That central office can maintain time division multiplexed (TDM) trunk groups connected to other central offices. Each of the central offices in the subnetwork are connected to the ATM backbone via interfaces which convert pulse code modulated (PCM) data to ATM cells and vice versa. Each of the central offices in the subnetwork are preferably connected to the respective interfaces by a single large trunk group. Consequently, all inter-office calls originated at any one of the central offices aside from the virtual access tandem are routed to the large trunk group. A link set associated with the large trunk group points to the virtual access tandem. As a result, the virtual access tandem is responsible for the routing of all inter-office calls originated within or terminated within the subnetwork. Routing and translation tables for the subnetwork are therefore centralized in the virtual access tandem. Consequently, translation and routing table maintenance is centralized and more efficient. Furthermore, maintenance costs for the physical trunking at each central office are significantly reduced because the only trunking required is a large high capacity trunk, which may be a high speed optical link between each central office and the respective interface(s).","The invention therefore provides a cost effective, efficient apparatus and method for relieving congestion in the PSTN which utilizes existent infrastructure in a very efficient and effective way.","This invention relates to a subnetwork of telephone central offices connected through interfaces to an ATM backbone network. A one of the central offices is adapted to serve as a virtual access tandem in the subnetwork so that inter-office trunk congestion is relieved in the subnetwork.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["20","22","24","20","26","22","24","28","32","26","26","28","32","34","7","7"]},"In order to ensure that incumbent infrastructure is utilized as efficiently as possible, the hybrid central office  is modified only to an extent required to enable it to perform the functions required of the hybrid central office  which serves as a virtual access tandem in the subnetwork . Each central office includes computing module (CM)  and a TDM switch fabric  which provides a link between subscriber lines and trunks for switching bearer traffic. Attached to the switch fabric  are digital trunk controllers (DTC)  which provide an interface to the PSTN  and inter-working multi-service platforms (IW-MSP)  which provide an interface to the ATM network . The interfaces to the ATM network perform several functions which will be described below in more detail. One of their primary functions is to convert pulse code modulated (PCM) voice and voice grade data to ATM cells, and vice versa.","The computing module  has a signaling interface  with the ATM backbone network  to permit the computing module  to send messages to and received messages from distributed access MSPs (DA-MSP)  which serve as interfaces to the ATM network  for the respective central offices . As described in Applicant's co-pending patent application entitled APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR COMPLETING INTER-SWITCH CALLS USING LARGE TRUNK GROUPS which was filed by the Applicant on Dec. 2, 1998 and is now U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,342, each of the central offices  is preferably connected to the ATM backbone network  by a single large trunk group . Configuring each of the end offices  with a single large trunk group has several distinct advantages as thoroughly explained in Applicant's co-pending patent application, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["40","20"]},"The principal functional components added to the computing module  include inter-working translation and routing, connectivity control and messaging connectivity, each of which is briefly characterized as:\n\n","As shown in , interfaces are required between the central offices ,  in the subnetwork  and the ATM backbone network . A principal function of the interfaces ,  is to convert PCM data to ATM cells and vice versa. For purposes of clarity, the interfaces are identified as IW-MSP  and DA-MSPs . The reason for the distinction is that there is some difference in functionality as will be explained below. It should be understood, however, that the interfaces ,  may be implemented on the same platform and require substantially identical hardware functionality.","The IW-MSP  provides an interface between the hybrid central office  and the ATM backbone . Its principal functions are to provide a bridge between the TDM fabric  and the ATM fabric . It is also responsible for initiating application instances which own inter-working bridges established through the TDM fabric  for inter-working calls and the TDM to ATM mapping associated with such calls. The IW-MSP also includes a functional entity hereinafter referred to as a \u201cconnection broker\u201d which serves the functions of TDM component connection control; inter-working bridge connection control; ATM component connection control; the ATM-to-TDM interface and ATM-to-TDM path conversion.","The IW-MSP  connection broker may provide SVC caching services for TDM fabric to ATM bridged calls. ATM SVCs are switched virtual connections through the ATM network, which are preferred over permanent virtual connections because they permit more efficient use of network resources. In this context, the majority of the connection broker functionality actually resides in the DA-MSP  which is preferably delegated as master of the SVC cache between itself and the IW-MSP , as will be explained below in more detail. It should be understood, however, that cached SVCs are not required and an SVC may be set up for each call routed through the ATM fabric . The IW-MSP  also supports an ATM signaling interface and the connection broker must be adapted to interact with an ATM signaling stack for the purposes of cached SVC control. However, the IW-MSP  preferably only terminates cached SVCs which are controlled by the DA-MSPs . In order to support TDM fabric to ATM bridged calls, the IW-MSP  supports a connection to the TDM switch fabric  and a connection to the ATM backbone network . A messaging interface between the IW-MSP  and the DA-MSPs  is also required. Call processing requires that messages be exchanged between the interfaces in order to start integrity checking, report integrity failures, etc.","The DA-MSPs  likewise support a trunk interface connection to the central offices  and an ATM link to the ATM backbone network . The DA-MSPs  also include a functional component referred to as the connection broker. The connection broker preferably, but not necessarily, has responsibility for SVC caching to facilitate call set up response. In order to enable SVC caching, the connection broker must support an ATM messaging stack and an application programming interface (API) which permits the DA-SPM connection broker to maintain SVC caches. The DA-MSPs  also supports all the functionality described above with reference to the IW-MSPs, except for the inter-working bridge functionality.","Call-Type Determination",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["40","24","28","24","52","28","54","56","58","60","52","62","64","66"]},"Intra-Subnetwork Call Example",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["20","68","70","72","74","22"]},"A call is originated at the central office  when, for example, a subscriber goes off-hook and dials a called number. In response to the dialled digits, the central office  consults its translation and routing tables and determines that the call is an inter-office call. Inter-office calls may be routed over the TDM trunks  or the single large trunk group connected to the ATM network . In this example, the routing tables direct the central office  to route the inter-office call over the single large trunk group connected to the DA-MSP , for example, because all TDM trunks that could be used for the call are busy. Consequently, the central office formulates an SS initial address message (IAM) containing the called and the calling numbers, as well as other information well known to persons skilled in the art. The common channel signaling network routes the IAM to the point code of the hybrid central office  in a first step indicated by the numeral  shown on the dashed line representing the signaling path through the common channel signaling network . On receipt of the IAM, the hybrid central office  examines its translation tables and determines that the dialled digits are served by central office , also a part of the subnetwork . Consequently, the hybrid central office  modifies the IAM by:","1) replacing the originating point code (OPC) with its own point code;","2) replacing the destination point code (DPC) with the point code of the central office ;","3) consulting a table respecting the occupation state of the single large trunk group connected to the DA-MSP  and selecting an available trunk member to serve the call. The available trunk member identification (TID) is inserted in the circuit identification code (CIC) field of the IAM.","It should be understood that the hybrid central office  maintains an occupation state table for each trunk member of each trunk group connected to a central office in the subnetwork . Occupation state tables are normally maintained and updated by central offices for all trunk groups which terminate on the office. Consequently, enabling the hybrid central office  to perform this function is a simple matter using facilities already available to the computing module  (). After sending the modified IAM through the CCS network  to the central office  in the step indicated by numeral , the computing module  uses information accumulated from translating the contents of the IAM to formulate messages to be transferred through the ATM backbone network  to enable an ATM-related fabric connection to serve the call. Consequently, in the step indicated by the numeral , the computing module  of the hybrid end office  formulates a fabric-control message (FCM) which is forwarded to the terminating DA-MSP . The fabric control message conveys the following information:\n\n","Optionally, the computing module  transfers the same information in a second FCM to the originating DA-MSP  in the step indicated by numeral . The signaling step  is not strictly required and may be omitted since the terminating DA-MSP  has all the information required to enable an ATM fabric connection. In either event, the terminating DA-MSP uses information in the FCM to formulate a message which can be transferred using an ATM operations and management (OAM) cell, or using ATM UNI signaling, to communicate with DA-MSP . The message is used to enable an SVC through the ATM backbone  or to synchronize an idle SVC removed from a cache, as explained in Applicant's co-pending patent application entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REDUCTION OF CALL SETUP RATE IN ATM NETWORK which was filed on Oct. 2, 1998, the entire specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. Although not illustrated in , it will be well understood in the art that the remaining steps in call set up and release involve the generation of Address Complete (ACM), Answer (ANM), Release (REL) and Release Complete (RLC) messages which are formulated at central office  and passed back through the common channel signaling network  to the central office , as will be explained below with reference to . It should also be understood that the order of the messages set out above is exemplary only. The FCMs may be sent prior to sending the modified IAM, as will be shown below in .","As is apparent from the diagram of , although the hybrid central office  performs the functions of a virtual tandem by enabling the completion of the inter-office call between the central offices  and , only the messaging and computing module functions of the hybrid central office  were used in the virtual tandem function. No trunking or fabric facilities were occupied during the process and no trunk or fabric facilities were tied up for the duration of the call. Consequently, the subnetwork  permits extremely efficient use of resources in completing inter-office calls which originate and terminate within the subnetwork .","Inter-Working Call Example",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["32","68","32","1","24","24","68","24","72","24","2","68","40","3","72","40","40","4","44","44","72","5","44","22","32","68","44","44","72"]},"Intra-Subnetwork Message Sequence",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["68","40","24","7","40","24","72","72","40","40","74"]},"Subsequently, the computing module  formulates a Connection Request message which it forwards to the terminating interface (DA-MSP ). In response to the Connection Request message, the DA-MSP  formulates an SVC Request message. In the signaling sequence shown in , it is assumed that cached SVCs are used for enabling connections through the ATM backbone network . It is further assumed that the DA-MSP  is master of a cache of SVCs maintained between the respective DA-MSPs , . Consequently, the DA-MSP  must request an SVC from the master end. This procedure is explained in Applicant's co-pending patent application referenced above. On receipt of the SVC Request message, the DA-MSP examines its cache and extracts an idle SVC. A Synchronize message is returned over the idle SVC to test the SVC and synchronize the two interfaces. On receipt of the Synchronized message, the DA-MSP  returns an Acknowledgement message (SynchAck).","Concurrently, the computing module  modifies the IAM, as described above, and forwards it to the central office . On receipt of the IAM, the central office  verifies that the subscriber line is idle and available and returns an address complete (ACM) message. On receipt of the ACM message, the computing module  formulates an ACM Advisory message which it forwards through the ATM backbone network  to a DA-MSP  and the DA-MSP . ACM Acknowledgement messages are returned from each of the interfaces. On receipt of the respective acknowledgements, the computing module  forwards the ACM to the central office . Meanwhile, central office  applies ringing (not illustrated) to the subscriber line which is returned through the call path indicated by the heavy dashed line in , which passes through the ATM backbone network  to the central office  where the ringing is heard by the calling subscriber. When the called subscriber answers the telephone, the central office  formulates an ANM message which is sent to the computing module  of the hybrid central office . Computing module  responds by dispatching an ANM Advisory messages to each of the interfaces (DA-MSP , ) and acknowledgements are returned from the respective interfaces. Computing module  there forwards the ANM message to the central office  and billing, if appropriate, commences for the call.","Conversation between the calling and called party ensues. In the example shown in , the called party terminates the call by going on-hook, which prompts the central office  to formulate and send a Release (REL) message to the hybrid central office . The REL message is received by the computing module  which responds by sending Release Advisory messages to the respective interfaces, (DA-MSP , ). The respective interfaces respond with Release Acknowledgement (REL ACK) messages. On receipt of the REL ACKs, the computing module  forwards the REL message to the central office  which applies dial tone (not shown) to the calling party line and returns a Release Complete (RLC) message to the hybrid central office . On receipt of the RLC message, the computing module formulates RLC Advisory messages which are forwarded to the DA-MSPs , . No acknowledgement is expected to an RLC Advisory message. As explained above, a cached SVC was used to enable a connection through the ATM backbone network . The cache master at DA-MSP , on receipt of the RLC Advisory message, checks its cache size and determines that the idle SVC should be returned to cache. Consequently, the DA-MSP  formulates a message which is transferred through the ATM backbone network  to the DA-MSP  advising it to cache the SVC. The DA-MSP  preferably returns a Cache Acknowledgement message after releasing the cross-connect between the TDM end and the SVC and recording the idle status of the SVC in its cache table.","Inter-Working Message Sequence",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["32","32","32","24","40","44","72","40","72","40","44","44"]},"Concurrently, the DA-MSP  selects an idle SVC from its SVC cache and sends a synchronized message over the SVC to the IW-MSP. The synchronized message identifies the call to the IW-MSP and it responds with a Synch Ack message indicating that it has identified the SVC and mapped it to the TDM end of the call. Consequently, the computing module  of the hybrid central office  forwards the IAM to the central office . On receipt of the IAM, the central office  translates the called number and verifies that the subscriber line is in-service and available. On verification, the central office  returns an ACM message to the hybrid central office . In response, the computing module  of the hybrid central office  formulates and dispatches ACM Advisory messages to both the DA-MSP  and the IW-MSP . Each interface responds with a ACM ACK message. On receipt of the responses, the computing module  forwards the ACM message to the access tandem . After sending the ACM message, the central office  applies ringing to the subscriber line (not illustrated) which travels back through the connection established through DA-MSP , ATM backbone network , IW-MSP , hybrid central office  and access tandem  to be heard by the calling party, as is well understood in the art. When the called party answers the ringing signal, the central office  formulates an ANM message which it returns to the hybrid central office . The hybrid central office  sends ANM Advisory messages to each of the interfaces which return ANM ACK messages.","On receipt of the ANM ACK messages, the hybrid central office  forwards the ANM message to the access tandem  which forwards the messages to the originating switch (not illustrated) in the PSTN and billing for the call commences.","Thereafter, conversation between the parties ensues. The release sequence for the call is substantially identical to the release sequence described above with reference to . As is explained above, the called party terminates the conversation by going on-hook which prompts the central office  to formulate and send a release message through the common channel signaling message  () to the hybrid central office . The hybrid central office  responds by sending REL Advisory messages to each of the interfaces which return REL ACK response messages. The hybrid central office  then forwards the REL message to the access tandem  which forwards it through the PSTN as described above. The hybrid central office  then returns a RLC message to the central office  which releases all resources. A RLC message is also returned from access tandem  which prompts the computing module  to formulate and send RLC Advisory messages to each of the interfaces. No response to the RLC Advisory Messages is expected. On receipt of the RLC Advisory message, the DA-MSP , who is master of the SVC cache checks cache size and determines that SVC used for the released call should be cached for future use in call set up. The DA-MSP  therefore adds the SVC to cache and sends a Cache SVC message to the IW-MSP  which responds with a Cache ACK message indicating that the terminating end of the SVC has been cached for reuse.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5"],"b":["44","32","72","44","42","44"]},"As shown in , an IAM generated within the PSTN  is received by the hybrid central office . The computing module of the hybrid central office  responds by sending an IAM advisory message to the IW-MSP . The IW-MSP  responds with an IAM ACK message. On receipt of the acknowledgement, the computing module  forwards a connection request to the IW-MSP  providing the connection information for establishing an inter-working bridge between the DTC  and the IW-MSP  using an inter-working bridge resource as explained above. On receipt of the connection request, the IW-MSP establishes the inter-working bridge and returns an acknowledgement message (ACK). Thereafter, the computing module  formulates and forwards a second IAM advisory to the IW-MSP . The second IAM advisory sent to the IW-MSP  contains information related to the ATM leg of the call. Thereafter, the messaging sequence follows the steps described above with relation to  with the exception that the ISUP ACM and ANM messages are not returned to the PSTN  until corresponding ACM ACK and ANM ACK messages are received by the ATM leg of the call. On receipt of the ACM ACK message, the computing module  forwards an ACM back to the originating switch in the PSTN . On receipt of the ANM ACK, the computing module  forwards an ANM back to the originating switch in the PSTN . Both actions are shown on the lower left of . The call release sequence may also follow the steps described above with reference to .","Although in the call examples described above, call processing was controlled by the computing module  of the hybrid central office , it should be understood that the interfaces ,  and  may be connected to the common channel signaling network  and may control all call setup and call processing. In that case, the IW-MSP  is responsible for call processing rather than the computing module .","Changes and modifications to the above-identified embodiments will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art.
