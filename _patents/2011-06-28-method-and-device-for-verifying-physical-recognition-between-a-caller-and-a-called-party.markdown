It makes it possible to verify the existence of prior personal contacts before being connected. This authentication of a calling party is in particular intended for audiovisual communications by people with no knowledge of information technology and\/or who do not have a computer. This invention also relates to a system for checking the connection identity between two people, irrespective of the technical means used for the connection.","There are many systems that allow at least two users, at a distance from each other, to communicate and exchange during a voice, video and\/or text conversation. Many websites and Internet communications systems allow computer users to organize videoconferences by means of a digital camera, called \u201cwebcam\u201d, a microphone or similar peripherals connected to these users' computers. All these instant messaging systems share the drawback of requiring the use of a computer for each user who wants to communicate with another user. These communications techniques are therefore not suitable for elderly persons or for people who have difficulties in using computers.","Using the conventional telephone network is also known as a way of realizing a video and voice conversation between several users. In this case, the various users who wish to take part in the conversation need only be equipped with relatively sophisticated telephones comprising a built-in camera and microphone and to perform the steps required by the telephone service provider to have access to this service.","One of the drawbacks of videoconference systems utilizing telephony networks is that it incurs a non-negligible cost to the calling party, compared to videoconferencing based on Internet technologies.","In any communications system, there is also the risk that third parties will send unsolicited messages, commonly called \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cjunk mail\u201d, which, after having become a nuisance to e-mail users, are now expanding to the use of short messages (\u201cSMS\u201d), of telephony and of videotelephony.","Document US 2008209223 is known; as stated in its paragraph 1, it relates to the access security of a computer environment and more specifically to generating a visual recognition question to check that the user is a human being. The purpose of this document is therefore to prevent an automated system (\u201crobot\u201d or \u201cbot\u201d) from accessing a resource over the Internet. More specifically, this is about preventing optical character recognition from reading the glyphs in a frame whose position is known (see paragraph 39). In this security system, users are shown a single image, which represents a sequence of symbols (e.g. a secret code shared between the user and the authorization server) that has been distorted and placed in a variable position on a background, then the users are asked to recognize these symbols (see ,  and  to ).","Traditionally, access to a resource or to a person is based on:\n\n","Thus, none of the traditional access authorization methods is suitable either for filtering out calls between relatives or for use by young children, elderly persons or persons with impaired faculties.","The document \u201cDialByPhoto\u201d by Tunji Afonja, (internet URL: http:\/\/www.gx-5.com\/products\/dialbyphotoforiphone\/index_full.php, is known: it describes a means of selecting contacts based on their photograph. This device does not guarantee that the calling party knows the called party, i.e. is able to physically identify the called party. In particular, this system allows unsolicited calls to be made by using telephone numbers. In addition, randomly associating photos to telephone numbers to be called allows unsolicited calls to be made. For example, during a telephone prospection campaign, the absence of a relation between a photo and a telephone number does not change the operation of the system and does not makes it possible to protect the called parties from these unsolicited calls.","This invention aims to remedy all or part of these drawbacks.","To this end, according to a first aspect, this invention envisages a method as described in claim .","Thanks to these provisions, only a person who knows the called party, their photograph or voice can identify them and consequently authenticate themselves as a legitimate calling party.","In the embodiment of this invention in which images are utilized, the calling party is shown a plurality of undistorted photographs and this calling party designates the called party's photograph with a single mouse click.","Implementing this invention makes it possible for the calling party to certify that they know the called party physically before being connected. In this way, this invention slows the growth in undesirable contacts, telephone annoyances, spam, junk mail and scams, irrespective of the means of communication used, by only allowing a calling party to be connected once they have been able to physically identify the called party.","According to particular features the step of requesting a message to be transmitted comprises a step of requesting a password from the calling party; the presentation step is only performed if the calling party does not supply the expected password.","According to particular features, if the media element selected by the calling party represents the called party, a password is supplied to the calling party.","Thanks to each of these provisions, a calling party to whom a password has been sent and who is therefore a user authorized to call the called party, can avoid the called party's prior recognition procedure.","According to particular features, if the media element selected by the calling party represents the called party, a unique address for the calling party is stored on a network linking the calling party to the called party; the calling party can then make calls to the called party by utilizing said unique address without the presentation and selection steps being utilized.","The stored address is, for example, a fixed IP address or a telephone line number. Thanks to these provisions, the calling party who has previously recognized the called party does not need to recognize them each time the calling party wants to contact the called party.","According to particular features, each unique address used by the called party to call another user is stored; the calling party can then make calls to the called party by utilizing said unique address without the presentation and selection steps being utilized.","Thanks to these provisions, the contacts that the called party has tried to call are automatically authorized to contact the called party without having to perform the prior called party recognition.","According to particular features, at least one said media element is a fixed image, undistorted following said image's capture, said image representing the called party's face and\/or an object that is a regular part of their surroundings.","According to particular features, at least one said media element is a video sequence, undistorted following said sequence's capture, said sequence representing the called party's face and\/or an object that is a regular part of their surroundings.","Thanks to each of these provisions, visual, therefore very fast, recognition is realized.","According to particular features, at least one said media element is an audio media element representing the called party's voice, undistorted following the capture of said voice.","Thanks to these provisions, any telephone can be utilized to contact the called party.","According to particular features, the method that is the subject of the invention comprises in addition a step in which the called party supplies said media element.","Thanks to these provisions, the called parties themselves supply the images or sound and\/or visual recordings that will be used to recognize them.","According to particular features, a plurality of media elements representing the called party are stored in memory and, during the presentation step, if the calling party has not selected the media element representing the called party in the previous message transmission request, the media element representing the called party is a different media element from that presented to the calling party at the time of the previous message transmission request.","Thanks to these provisions, those who make unsolicited calls cannot obtain any useful information from the previous failed attempt.","According to particular features, the method that is the subject of the invention comprises in addition a step of picking random other media elements from a database to constitute said plurality of media elements to be presented during the presentation step.","Thanks to these provisions, the media elements are different for different called parties, limiting the information obtained from a failed attempt.","According to particular features, the message transmission step comprises a step of detecting the image display capability of the calling means used by the calling party and:\n\n","According to particular features, during the step of detecting the image display capability, the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) of the calling means used by the calling party is utilized.","Thanks to each of these provisions, the media type is selected automatically according to the capabilities of the calling means.","According to particular features, where the calling party does not select the media element representing the called party after a predefined number of consecutive attempts, the calling party is connected to a voicemail of the called party.","Thanks to these provisions, the calling party can leave a message, even when they are not authorized to contact the called party directly.","According to a second aspect, this invention envisages a system for authorizing a transmission of a message. The system comprises a processing unit associated with a called part, a user device and a server. The user device is utilized by a calling party to select an identifier of a called party and to request the transmission of a message to the processing unit of the called party over a communications network. The server verifies that the calling party is able to recognize the called party from one of a plurality of identifiers selected by the called party. The server presents a plurality of audiovisual media elements on the user device of the calling party. One of the plurality of audiovisual media elements being representative of a physical characteristic of the called party. Other audiovisual media elements of the plurality of the audiovisual media elements being similar in form to the audiovisual media element representative of the called party. The user device receives one audiovisual media element selected by the calling party from the audiovisual media elements presented on the user device. The server authorizes the transmission of the message to the processing unit of the called party from the user device of the calling party when the selected audiovisual media element is representative of the called party. The server denies the request to transmit the message to the processing unit of the called party from the user device of the calling party when the selected audiovisual media element is not representative of the called party.","As the particular characteristics, advantages and aims of this device are similar to those of the method that is the subject of this invention, as described in brief above, they are not repeated here.","The terms \u201ccalling party\u201d and \u201ccalled party\u201d are used for all types of contact and for all types of communications: telephone, SMS, e-mail, videotelephony, etc.","\u201cCalled party biometrics\u201d refers to any physical characteristic, in particular voice or face, which makes it possible to confirm that the calling party has physically recognized the called party.","In the description, two physical characteristics are utilized as examples:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","110","112","110","115"]},"A set of servers, jointly called \u201ccentral server\u201d  is also connected to the network . The central server  is used by various units  and by remote computer terminals , which communicate periodically with one or another of these units .","Each unit  comprises the means required for it to operate, in particular: an electric power supply ; a stand-alone data processing unit ; a non-volatile data storage unit , e.g. a hard disk or flash memory components; a connector  to link the unit  to the modem ; a connector  to link the unit  to a television  and a loudspeaker . Each unit is also associated with at least one digital camera , an ambient microphone  and possibly sensors , in particular in the case of the extension of its applicability to telemedicine and\/or remote monitoring.","Preferably, the unit  is made of the main components and circuits of a computer; its remote control  is in fact a cordless keyboard and its screen is the television . In the remainder of the description, this cordless keyboard is called \u201cremote control\u201d because of its ergonomics, suitable for being held in one hand to press a few keys. In other words, the remote control  constitutes a cordless digital keyboard emulator that sends codes, e.g. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Thanks to this characteristic, no driver is required for the central processing unit of the unit , which is based on the architecture of general-purpose computers, e.g. PC (\u201cpersonal computer\u201d), to process the commands transmitted by the remote control. The computer\/unit  then only listens out for the codes transmitted by its keyboard\/remote control . For example, a Flash Player (registered trademark) program listens out for keyboard events.","The unit  is a product designed in particular for elderly or hospitalized persons. It is a unit connected to one of its user's televisions, which makes it possible to communicate with their surroundings by means of the digital camera  and at least one microphone. Its users see on their television screen  and discuss life with their family and friends, wherever they may be in the world, with no time limit. Elderly persons therefore benefit from a social and emotional bond. To remove any difficulty of use, all commands go through the remote control , which is very simple, with large color keys whose colors match colored areas and messages displayed on the television screen . Using the television screen  as the interface makes it easier for the elderly to adopt this product, as televisions are already a part of their lifestyle, unlike touch-screen computers, for example.","Other functions, described below, allow messages, hypertext links and media elements (photos, audio and audiovisual) to be transmitted to the user of the unit  and to capture medical events or conditions regarding this user or safety conditions of the premises in which the unit  is located.","The unit  makes it possible, in different embodiments, to use one or more of the following modules:","\u201cTelemedicine\u201d Module:","The relatives or staff can access, subject to their being authorized, certain items of information regarding the state of the elderly person's health and can be warned if the system detects abnormalities. The physical data captured may comprise: temperature, pulse, blood pressure, position in space (i.e. lying down, sitting, standing position), hydration, food, atmospheric conditions in the user's environment.","The telemedicine module utilizes dedicated sensors  to acquire medical information regarding the user. It transmits the medical items of information to the physician, allows the user to communicate with healthcare personnel, allows the healthcare personnel to set the parameters of the module with the user (defines measures to be taken, information to be shared, etc.), alerts the rescue services or relatives in case the user's health is poor. Among the sensors specific to the telemedicine module, the following can be cited: a Bluetooth (registered trademark) sphygmomanometer, Bluetooth scales, a wireless oxymetry sensor, a wireless glucose meter and a wireless multifunction medical belt. The data items captured may comprise: cardiac rhythm; respiratory rhythm; respiratory amplitude; skin temperature; position of the user's body (standing, face on the ground, on the back, on the side, upside down, etc.); level of activity (not active, light activity, intensive activity) and shock detection.","\u201cGeolocation\u201d Module:","The relatives or healthcare personnel are alerted when an elderly person goes outside a predefined perimeter or shows abnormal behavior.","\u201cHome Automation\u201d Module:","The system detects abnormalities (gas leaks, leak detection, temperature detector, electrical consumption meter, smoke detection, outside door opened, presence detector, triggering a siren, etc.) in the user's environment and alerts the user and those relatives allowed access to this type of information. This module also makes possible simplified management of the house (fully or partly automated).","The home automation module consists of installing measurement sensors  to monitor the condition of the user's home and possibly actuators to automate it, simplify the user's life and, if necessary, to monitor the user for their own safety (for people with mental impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease).","Starting up the sensors and actuator can be achieved by plugging into an electric outlet or by inserting batteries for the others.","The alarm system operates in real time (SMS, MMS, e-mail, Voice call, Fax).","\u201cInteractive Image Capture\u201d Module:","The users take videos\/photos of their surroundings with a mobile camera and the resulting media elements are immediately made available for visualizing by their relatives in each user's own virtual space.","The unit  provides a common hardware base for the modules (processor, memory storage space, connections, etc.)","The remote control , shown in  inserted into a base unit , which possibly supplies power to it, comprises in particular a switch  and a microphone . The remote control  only comprises the microphone , but no loudspeaker. The remote control is then able to transmit to the unit  a signal representing the sound captured by this microphone . Preferably, an echo cancellation process is applied to the captured signal. In effect, if the remote contact uses an ambient microphone, a disagreeable echo effect may occur because the microphone  in the remote control  also operates as an ambient microphone.","The switch , which is preferably located on the back of the remote control , causes the microphone  to operate when this switch  is pressed. In embodiments, the switch  then also causes the ambient microphone  to stop operating.","In this way, as soon as the user puts the remote control  down on a flat surface, or presses this switch  while holding the remote control, sound is captured closer to them than if it were captured by the ambient microphone .","Preferably, the sound signal coming from the remote contact is emitted by a loudspeaker  separate from that in the television, to allow the user of the unit  to hear the sound of the television program they are watching even when there is an incoming call on the unit .","Therefore, in embodiments, this invention utilizes a remote communication device that comprises:\n\n","The user is therefore not encouraged to place the remote control means near their ear but, on the contrary, to hold it in their hands, pressed up against a base or to put it down on such a base. Consequently, the microphone is in the vicinity of the user and does not require them to raise their voice. In addition, this avoids the user tiring their arms and having to wear a headset.","It should be noted that the loudspeaker utilized in these embodiments can be that of the unit  or of the television , controlled by the unit .","The switch  makes it possible to use the remote control  \u201chands-free\u201d by triggering the operation of the microphone  and the echo cancellation of the signal provided by this microphone . Consequently, it is located preferably on the back of the remote control .","In embodiments, a means of calling all the user's contacts is added to the unit , operating when an alarm button (not shown) is selected on the remote control and\/or on the unit .","In embodiments, a means of detecting that the user has fallen is added to the unit ; such a detection requests all the contacts to be called. The fall detection can, for example, use: voice or noise recognition; an accelerometer built into the remote control; a unit worn by the user; or image processing of the images captured by the camera  associated with the unit .","The user controls the unit  with the remote control . To change from their TV program to displaying the signal emitted by the unit , they must press the AV button (\u201cAudio\/video\u201d or \u201cauxiliary\u201d) on the television remote control.","Since the unit  has to connect to the various servers of the central server , all the connections and flows are secure. For this purpose, the following, for example, are utilized:\n\n","The unit  starts up automatically and logs in the Linux user automatically. The unit  stays switched on permanently.","When the unit  connects to the server  it behaves as a thin client. Via DHCP (\u201cDynamic Host Configuration Protocol\u201d\u2014a network protocol designed to automatically configure a workstation's IP parameters, in particular by automatically assigning an IP address and subnet mask to it. DHCP can also configure the address of the default gateway, the DNS domain name servers), the server is assigned an address.","At the time of installation, the start page of the Internet browser (Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. registered trademarks) is specified (i.e. the electronic address or \u201cURL\u201d of the video server of the central server ) and a certificate is imported.","Even though the term \u201ccentral server\u201d  can physically designate a single server, preferably, the central server  comprises of a plurality of servers designed to communicate among themselves, which comprise, as illustrated in :\n\n","As illustrated in , these virtual servers, whose operations are supervised by the hypervisor , can be assembled into three servers ,  and .","The administration server  for all of the units  allows the following tasks to be performed, among others:\n\n","In this way the server  preferably uses a secure communications protocol, e.g. HTTPS (\u201cHyperText Transfer Protocol Secure\u201d). The connection between a unit  and a computer  is secured thanks, for example, to an OpenSSL server (registered trademark) that the server  comprises. To this end, each unit  is configured beforehand, i.e. a unique identifier and password are associated with each of the computers  that are authorized to communicate with each of the units . These items of information are stored in a database , utilizing e.g. MySQL (registered trademark) integrated in the server . Registration of the identification of the various computers is performed with a network management interface that is remotely accessible and configurable by a computer connected to the network . Access to this network interface is protected by the identifier assigned to the unit  and by the password associated therewith.","Preferably, the central server  includes SIP (\u201cSession Initiation Protocol\u201d, a multimedia protocol that enables, for example, voice over an IP network).","The flash interface is stored on the central server . However, while the unit  is being configured, remote communications are generally not functioning. To solve this problem, a web server (not shown) is installed and configured on the unit  as a localhost. Its purpose is to allow the unit  to be configured.","The entire configuration of the unit , together with its storage, is centralized firstly on the central server  and secondly on the local server. The configuration and the local site are stored in flash memory in the unit , as well as the commands that enable communications with the central server .","Personalization is performed and stored remotely from the unit , making restorations and updates easier.","As illustrated in , to install the unit , it is plugged into the local installation server ; the BIOS (\u201cBasic Input Output System\u201d) of the unit  is accessed to allow a LAN boot, i.e. a network boot (see Bootp, ).","To generate a unique key for each unit , during the unit's installation, the MAC address of the unit  is used to obtain a PKI (\u201cPublic Key Infrastructure\u201d) certificate from the PKI server .","This certificate, generated and installed by the unit  is integrated in the unit's browser.","This certificate is then used to realize a passive identification at each connection between the unit and the server. The unit then sets up an encrypted tunnel and the server takes control. All the communications are then encrypted using, for example, the https protocol (\u201csecure hypertext transfer protocol\u201d). In this way, taking control is performed without port forwarding or opening ports or parameterization of replicated servers. In addition, a user's unit  can easily be changed in this way.","Then comes the upgrade stage, with the installation of a \u201cpackage\u201d that allows the standard distribution to be modified and to change it via the update server.","This stage comprises integrating the security and authentication systems such that:\n\n","The autologin phase then occurs without prompt.","VNDBoxTV updates are automated. At each start-up, the installed version is compared to the current version stored in the update server (via the flash stack, PHP, MySQL) If they are not the same, the update is launched.","Each system updates itself separately, but it is possible to launch a global update for a number of units.","For contacts to be able to communicate, preferably, the user of the unit is required to take a photo of themselves or of their surroundings, or to record their voice, or to film themselves (step  in ). In general, an audiovisual media element representing the user is constituted in this way, so that they can be called. This media element is transmitted to the central server  in a step .","It should be noted that the user may change this media element at any time.","For relatives to be able to identify themselves to the central server  and to communicate with the user of the unit , this user supplies to these relatives the internet address of a site hosted on the central server  and a number (unique identifier) printed on the unit  in a step .","When these relatives (also called \u201ccontacts\u201d in the rest of the description) want to be able to communicate with the user, they access, using a computer terminal , typically a computer, the site hosted on the long-distance computer network's server (step ). They then supply an identifier of the user of the unit  or of the unit  (step ).","In a step , the server then presents to this relative a page containing a photograph of the user of the unit  and many other photographs selected at random (step ) from a database of photographs that possibly comprises photographs of other users. In a text message, this page requests the contact to click on the photograph if the user of the unit .","To authenticate themselves, the contact must then click on the photograph of the user of the unit  during a step . If the selection matches the photograph supplied by the user, as determined in a step , the contact obtains a password, for example transmitted by e-mail or by minimessage in a step . Possibly, the contact also obtains, during this step , a login, if the latter is not an identifier they already know, e.g. their e-mail address. If the selection is negative, the contact is requested again to click on the user's photograph, by going back to step . If an incorrect selection is made three times in a row, which is determined in a step , the network address of the computer  is invalidated and stored as such in a database of invalid addresses kept by the server in a step .","Generally, in particular when it is not a photograph that is taken by the user of the unit , to authenticate the calling party, they identify the called party and select an audiovisual media element representing the called party among a plurality of media elements. The other presented media elements are picked randomly from a media database. The central server  validates the calling party's identifier as being authorized to call to the user of the unit  only if the media element selected by the caller matches the called party. In this way, only a person who knows the called party, their photograph or voice can identify them and consequently be authenticated as a legitimate calling party.","Thanks to the utilization of this authentication procedure, \u201cspam\u201d (unsolicited communications from third-parties) is prevented from reaching the user. Invalidated addresses may be unblocked after a predefined period of time or by the manager of the site hosted by the server.","In variants, authentication by checking the calling party's recognition of a media element representing the called party is performed for every call made by the calling party.","It should be noted that this aspect of this invention is not limited to the use of a communications unit: on the contrary, it extends to any communications system, in particular to fixed or mobile telephony and to the transmission of e-mails and minimessages.","The various functions of the unit  will now be described.","In regards to remote control, this invention utilizes preferably a remote control system without port forwarding for the units.","It should be noted that in variants, only the video stream is transported according to a peer-to-peer (or \u201cP2P\u201d) protocol, but the rest of the communications transit via the server (where it is possibly stored), allowing gains in latency.","The simplest function is receiving a call made by a relative. Initially, the unit  is in sleep mode. When a computer  attempts to connect to the unit  using the server , a PHP script checks by querying the database  that this computer  has been previously stored in this database  and that the identifier and password it has sent are those associated with the unit .","Two Scenarios Arise:\n\n","If the television  is not switched on, it must be switched on and the auxiliary input selected. Then, the remote control  makes it possible to accept or refuse the call. There are therefore two possible options:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0169"},"figref":"FIGS. 5 and 6"},"The unit  transmits a key to the servers ,  and  in the exchange of messages .

In this way, the remote contact can show and comment on a portion of the image.","To realize this \u201cmagnifier\u201d function at the computer  or the server : the coordinates of the media element are detected (e.g. two opposite corners of the image); the coordinates of the mouse cursor are retrieved; the homothety factors representing the position of this cursor in a reference space linked to the image are determined. These coordinates relative to the image are transmitted to the unit . On its side, the unit  retrieves these coordinates as well as those of the image and performs a homothety to find the center of the magnifier. A zoom is then applied in a predefined area surrounding the center of the magnifier. A similar zoom is applied by the computer  to the image under consideration.","For transmitting links, for example, the API (Application Programming Interface) supplied by YouTube (registered trademark) at the following address is utilized: http:\/\/code.google.com\/intl\/fr\/apis\/youtube\/overview.html.","A media element is then uploaded onto the server  or preferably access thereto is provided.","In embodiments illustrated in , at least one contact is allowed to force the unit  to pick up the line to view the premises and\/or the user for safety purposes, in cases where the user may be unconscious and for security of property purposes in case of absence.","To this end, the user of the unit  authorizes at least one contact to force the call pickup in a step .

If this is the case, it is determined whether the contact is authorized to force the call in a step . If not, only the option of leaving a message is proposed to the contact in a step . If so, it is proposed to the contact to \u201cforce the call\u201d, which corresponds to an automatic call pick-up mode in a step .

The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a number that makes it possible to uniquely identify each of the mobile telephony terminals. This IMEI number allows the network operator to identify the calling mobile phone and consequently to authorize its connection or not. In this way it allows emergency calls to be made without a SIM card in certain countries (e.g. the European emergency number ). Its best-known use is to be able to block a stolen mobile phone (gray list, black list) with all the operators that have subscribed to the database of IMEI numbers. By default, in particular if the IMEI is not available, for example in the case of a call from a fixed line, either the calling party is given the choice of visual recognition or audio recognition by sending them a text message, or it is considered that the telephone cannot display visual media elements.","If the system used by the calling party cannot display visual media elements, step , audio recognition is called up, step , and the steps explained with regard to interfaces  to  are performed in steps  et seq ().","If the system used by the calling party can display visual media elements, step , visual recognition is called up, step , and the steps explained with regard to interfaces  to  are performed in steps  et seq.","In a step , the calling party is shown several media elements, including one media element provided by the called party, and one waits for them to select one of these media elements.
