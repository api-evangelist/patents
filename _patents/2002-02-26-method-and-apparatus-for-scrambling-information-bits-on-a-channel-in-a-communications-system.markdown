title: Method and apparatus for scrambling information bits on a channel in a communications system
abstract: A control channel in a communication system transmits messages in a one or multiple-slot format. To assure consistency of a message, a content quality indicator is included in the message. Because a terminal receiving the message does not know the number of slots comprising the message, the terminal performs blind format determination by testing hypothesis for all slot formats. Unfortunately, the content of certain control messages results in control messages that appear to be valid in a sense that, the computed CRC is equal to the interpreted CRC. Consequently, the mobile station declares a valid control message, and a false-alarm event occurs. Moreover, the same control messages always result in the same false-alarm events. To prevent such repetitive incorrect determination, the content of the message is scrambled by a time-dependent scrambling sequence before transmission. Re-generating the scrambling sequence, and performing inverse to the scrambling then unscrambles the received message.

Field","The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and more specifically to a apparatus and an apparatus for scrambling information bits on a channel in a communication system.","2. Description of Related Art","Communication systems have been developed to allow transmission of information signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting information signal from the origination station over a communication channel, the information signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication channel. Conversion, or modulation, of the information signal involves varying a parameter of a carrier wave in accordance with the information signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated carrier is confined within the communication channel bandwidth. At the destination station the original information signal is replicated from the modulated carrier wave received over the communication channel. Such a replication is generally achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.","Modulation also facilitates multiple-access, i.e., simultaneous transmission and\/or reception, of several signals over a common communication channel. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of remote subscriber units requiring intermittent service of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication channel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA), and amplitude modulation multiple-access (AM). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms to the \u201cTIA\/EIA\/IS-95 Subscriber station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System,\u201d hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple-access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE-ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention.","A multiple-access communication system may be a wireless or wire-line and may carry voice and\/or data. An example of a communication system carrying both voice and data is a system in accordance with the IS-95 standard, which specifies transmitting voice and data over the communication channel. A apparatus for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,773, entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORMATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION\u201d, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, the data or voice is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps. Additional examples of a communication systems carrying both voice and data comprise communication systems conforming to the \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP), embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25.213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), or \u201cTR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems\u201d (the IS-2000 standard).","In a multiple-access communication system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on a forward link of the same base station, or the other base station, to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmission from a base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from a subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on one mobile subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user. In many communication systems, e.g., IS-95, W-CDMA, IS-2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.","An example of a data only communication system is a high data rate (HDR) communication system that conforms to the TIA\/EIA\/IS-856 industry standard, hereinafter referred to as the IS-856 standard. This HDR system is based on a communication system disclosed in co-pending application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cAPPARATUS AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The HDR communication system defines a set of data rates, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps, at which an access point (AP) may send data to a subscriber station (access terminal, AT). Because the AP is analogous to a base station, the terminology with respect to cells and sectors is the same as with respect to voice systems.","In a multiple-access communication system, communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to another base station. The data is transmitted on a forward link of the same base station, or the other base station, to the second subscriber station. The forward link refers to transmission from a base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from a subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on one mobile subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user. In many communication systems, e.g., IS-95, W-CDMA, IS-2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies.","Some service providers may be disadvantaged by the need to deploy a predominantly voice communication system, e.g., an IS-2000 revision 0 communication system on one carrier frequency, and a HDR communication system, e.g., IS-856 communication system on a separate carrier frequency. Such a disadvantage may arose from limited spectrum availability, insufficient customer base, business objectives or other reasons known to one of ordinary skills in the art. Consequently, the \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2) has started to develop a standard for enabling voice and high rate data communication on one carrier frequency. Such a system is described in a draft known as Release C of cdma2000 (hereinafter referred to as Draft).","The Draft specifies a apparatus of allowing voice users to utilize the forward channels defined by the IS-2000 standard. In the excess capacity, data users are served on contain up to two Forward Packet Data Channels (F-PDCH). Therefore, the F-PDCH is used to transmit data user information from a base station to the mobile stations. The user data are transmitted in packets called encoder packets. Each encoder packet is encoded, scrambled, and interleaved. Some or all of the interleaved symbols then form sub-packets, which are modulated and de-multiplexed into a variable number of in-phase and quadrature pairs of parallel streams. The modulation can comprise a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), eight phase-shift keying (8-PSK), or sixteen Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM). The number of streams varies in accordance with the demands of the voice users and data users. Each parallel streams is encoded with a distinct 32-ary Walsh function. The Walsh-coded symbols of all the in-phase streams are summed to form a single in-phase stream, and the Walsh-coded symbols of all the quadrature streams are summed to form a single quadrature stream. The resulting in-phase and quadrature streams are quadrature spreaded and transmitted. The F-PDCH is shared by mobile stations based on time multiplexing, thus transmitting information to one specific mobile station at a time.","As follows from the above description, the modulation format of the F-PDCH is variable. Consequently, to enable a mobile station to receive and process the F-PDCH, the base station also transmits control messages on a Forward Packet Data Control Channel (F-PDCCH) transmitted in parallel with the F-PDCCH as illustrated in . The control message comprises information required by the subscriber station for correct reception of the F-PDCH, e.g., an identifier of a subscriber station for which the F-PDCH is intended to, a modulation format of the F-PDCH, and other information as specified in the Draft. Because the amount of data that the F-PDCH transmits varies, e.g., with channel conditions, amount of data to be transmitted, the time for transmission (t-t) varies. The transmission time can be expressed in units of slots, a slot being a 1.25 ms unit. In accordance with the Draft specifications, the slot-format comprises one-slot, two-slots or four-slots. The slot-format of the F-PDCCH is the same as the slot-format of the F-PDCH.","In one embodiment, the F-PDCCH utilizes control messages of length of 21 bits. To assure consistency of control message content, a content quality indicator is computed, and appended to the control message. In one embodiment, the content quality indicator comprises a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). A conceptual structure of an exemplary F-PDCCH control message  is illustrated in . The control message  comprises 21 bits comprising the information bits of a control message content , and 8 bits comprising a quality indicator .","A conceptual structure of an exemplary F-PDCCH  is illustrated in . The 21 bits of input data , comprising the content control message, are concatenated with 8 error detection encoder bits in block . The bit stream is further concatenated with 8 encoder tail bits in block , and encoded in block . In one embodiment, the encoder is a convolutional encoder, well known in the art, with constraint length 9 and rate \u00bd, \u2153, or \u00bc. Depending on the slot-format a particular encoding rate is selected, i.e., \u00bd rate for the one-slot format, \u2153 rate for the two-slot format, and \u00bc rate for the four-slot format. The encoded symbols are provided to block , which adjusts length of the encoded symbols for further processing by puncturing\/repeating some symbols to generate 48 symbols for the one-slot format, 96 symbols for the two-slot format, and 192 symbols for four-slot format control message. The symbols are provided to a block interleaver . The interleaved symbols are then provided to a quadrature-phase shift keying (QPSK) modulator . The In-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) outputs of the QPSK modulator  are spreaded by a Walsh code (W) in spreaders (I) and (Q) and provided to a transmitter (not shown).","One of ordinary skills in the art understands that a particular embodiment of the F-PDCCH has been described for tutorial purposes. Consequently, other embodiments are contemplated. In particular, other encoders, interleavers, modulators, and spreading codes known to one of ordinary skills in the art can be used.","The control message, transmitted by the base station is received at a mobile station. The mobile station uses an inverse of the F-PDCCH processing as described in reference to , to recover the 21 bits comprising the control message. Because the mobile station has no information of how many slots comprises the control message, the mobile station performs the inverse of the F-PDCCH processing under the assumption that the last slot received comprises a control message that is transmitted in the one-slot format. Thus, the mobile station computes a CRC from the first 21 bits of the decoded output (ref.  of ), which the mobile station interprets as the information bits, and compares the computed CRC with the last 8 bits of the decoded output, (ref.  of ), which the mobile station interprets as the CRC. If the computed CRC is equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station declares a valid control message. If the computed CRC is not equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station performs the inverse of the F-PDCCH processing under the assumption that the last two slots received comprise a control message that was transmitted in the two-slot format, and determines whether the CRC checks as described in the above. If the computed CRC is equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station declares a valid control message. If the computed CRC is not equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station performs the inverse of the F-PDCCH processing under the assumption that the last four slots comprise a control message that is transmitted in the four-slot format, and determines whether the CRC checks as described in the above. If the computed CRC is equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station declares a valid control message. If the computed CRC is not equal to the interpreted CRC, the mobile station declares that no valid control message is found. The mobile station then waits until next slot is received and repeats the above process.","The above-described procedure may yield an incorrect determination of control message slot format. For example, assume that a control message is a two-slot message. Given the above described procedure, the mobile station performs the inverse of the F-PDCCH processing under an assumption that the control message is transmitted in a one-slot format, and interprets the first 21 bits of the decoded output as message content  (of ), and the remaining 8 bits as a quality indicator  (of ). Unfortunately, the content of certain control messages sometimes results in control messages that appear to be valid in a sense that, the computed CRC is equal to the interpreted CRC. Consequently, the mobile station declares a valid control message, and a false-alarm event occurs.","Because the same control message contents transmitted on the F-PDCCH are repeated from time to time, there is likelihood that the information bits comprising the message will cause repetitive false-alarm events. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a apparatus an apparatus preventing such repetitive incorrect determination of control message content to happen.","Although the background of the invention was described for pedagogical reasons in terms of a control channel of a communication system in accordance with the Draft, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the teaching is applicable to any system providing control messages on any control channel.","In one aspect of the present invention, a apparatus for generating scrambling sequence in a communications system at a first station is disclosed. The apparatus comprises determining a metric of system time and determining the scrambling sequence in accordance with the metric of system time.","In another aspect of the present invention, a apparatus for generating unscrambling sequence in a communications system at a second station is disclosed. The apparatus comprises determining a metric of system time, and determining the unscrambling sequence in accordance with the metric of system time.","In another aspect of the present invention, a apparatus for communicating information bits from a first terminal to a second terminal in a communications system is disclosed. The apparatus comprises determining a metric of system time, determining the scrambling sequence in accordance with the metric of system time, and scrambling information bits with the scrambling sequence at the first terminal. The receiving terminal determines a metric of system time, an unscrambling sequence in accordance with the metric of system time, and unscrambles information bits with the unscrambling sequence.","The word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used exclusively herein to mean \u201cserving as an example, instance, or illustration.\u201d Any embodiment described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.","The term packet is used exclusively herein to mean a group of bits, including data (payload) and control elements, arranged into a specific format.

The block  scrambles the input data  by a 21-bit sequence, provided by a sequence generator . The sequence generator  can comprise e.g., a hash function, a linear function, or any other means known to one skilled in the art, which provides a 21 bit long pseudo-random sequence in response to the input. In one embodiment, the block  performs scrambling by a bit-wise exclusive-OR of the input data  with the sequence . The scrambled sequence; therefore, comprises 21 bit and is provided to block . The block  concatenates the scrambled sequence with 8 error detection encoder bits. The bit stream is further concatenated with 8 encoder tail bits in block , and encoded in block . In one embodiment, the encoder is a convolutional encoder, well known in the art, with constraint length 9 and rate \u00bd, \u2153, or \u00bc. Depending on the slot-format a particular encoding rate is selected, i.e., \u00bd rate for the one-slot format, \u2153 rate for the two-slot format, and \u00bc rate for the four-slot format.

The In-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) outputs of the QPSK modulator  are spreaded by a Walsh code (W) in spreaders (I) and (Q) and provided to a transmitter (not shown).","As described above, the purpose of scrambling the input data  should prevent occurrence of repetitive incorrect determination of control message content. Because the content of the control message can be repetitive, so can be the content of the input data . Consequently, to prevent occurrence of repetitive incorrect determination of control message content, the scrambling sequence must be time varying. Consequently, in the illustrated embodiment, block  provides a metric of a system time. System time is a reference time that base stations and mobile stations both refer to so that they can keep synchronized in time. In one embodiment, the system time metric is expressed in units of slot, (i.e., the slot number of the control message slot\u2014referred to as a slot index) which is to be transmitted by the base station next as illustrated in .","At time t, the base station determines that a data to a mobile station will be scheduled for transmission next, and another control message  is to be sent. Taking into an account processing time necessary to compose the control message  and the F-PDCH, the base station determines that the control message can be sent at time t. The base station then determines the number of slots between the times tand tand calculates the slot index of the first slot () of the message .","Referring back to , block  provides the slot index of the next slot to a sequence generator , which generates the 21-bit long scrambling sequence. The sequence generator  can comprise e.g., a hash function, a linear function, or any other means known to one skilled in the art, which provides a 21 bit long pseudo-random sequence in response to a number. An exemplary embodiment of the sequence generator is illustrated in .","As illustrated in , the slot index of the next slot is provided to a mapping function , which generates a 21 bits long sequence in response. The mapping function  can comprise e.g., a hash function, a linear function, or any other means known to one skilled in the art, which provides a 21 bit long pseudo-random sequence in response to the input. At the beginning of a slot, the switch  is closed and the 21 bits long sequence is then copied to a 21 bit long buffer\/shift register . One of ordinary skills in the art understands that switch  represents a concept only, and any means accomplishing copying of the scrambling sequence to the buffer\/shift register  is contemplated. When the base station provides an indication that a first slot of a control message is to start, e.g., slot () of , therefore, the scrambling is to be performed, the buffer\/shift register  is clocked and its output is provided to block  of .","Mobile Station Processing","The mobile station processing is described in reference to a timing diagram as illustrated in . Upon receiving the F-PDCCH, the mobile station uses an inverse of the F-PDCCH processing as described in reference to  under the hypothesis that a one-slot  control message has been sent to recover the 29 bits comprising the scrambled information bits and the quality indicator bits of the control message. The mobile station then performs the CRC test. If the CRC test is positive, the mobile station unscrambles the slot in time interval . (Part a of .) If the CRC test fails, the mobile station uses an inverse of the F-PDCCH processing as described in reference to  under the hypothesis that a two-slot ,  control message has been sent and recovers the 29 bits comprising the scrambled information bits and the quality indicator bits. The mobile station then performs the CRC test. If the CRC test is positive, the mobile station unscrambles the information bits in time interval . (Part b of .) If the CRC test fails, the mobile station uses an inverse of the F-PDCCH processing as described in reference to  under the hypothesis that a four-slot - control message has been sent. The mobile station then recovers the 29 bits sequences comprising the scrambled information bits and the quality indicator bits. The mobile station then performs the CRC test under the hypothesis that a four-slot control message has been sent. If the CRC test is positive, the mobile station unscrambles the information bits in time interval  (Part c of .) If the CRC test fails, the mobile station declares that no valid control message is identified and waits till the next slot and repeat the above process.","The apparatus of generating the unscrambling sequence depends on the result of CRC test. In one embodiment, the unscrambling sequence generation is described in reference to .","Referring to , at the beginning of a slot, the mobile station determines the time slot index  of the previous slot and inputs the determined time slot index into a sequence generator . The sequence generator  comprises the same mapping function  as the sequence generator at the base station. The mapping function  generates a 21 bits long pseudo-random sequence in response. Once the sequence is generated, the switch  is closed and the 21 bits long sequence is then copied to an 84 bit long buffer\/shift register . One of ordinary skills in the art understands that switch  represents a concept only, and any means accomplishing copying of the scrambling sequence to the buffer\/shift register  is contemplated. Once the mobile station determines number of slot comprising the control message, the bit selector  provides an indication, which bits are to be copied from the buffer\/shift register  to a 21 bit long buffer\/shift register . Thus, if the mobile station determines that the control message comprises the 1-slot format, the 1-21bits from the buffer\/shift register  left (i.e., the newest 21 bits) are copied to the buffer\/shift register . If the control message comprises the 2-slot format, the 22-42bits from the buffer\/shift register  left (i.e., the next newest 21 bits) are copied to the buffer\/shift register . If the control message comprises the 4-slot format, 64-84bits from the buffer\/shift register  left (i.e., the oldest 21 bits) are copied to the buffer\/shift register . When the mobile station provides an indication that the information bits comprising the control message  are provided to block , the buffer\/shift register  is clocked and its output is also provided to block . Block  performs an inverse operation of bock  of , thus unscrambling the information bits of the control message.","One of ordinary skills in the art understands that the embodiment of the sequence generator, referred to in  was given for illustration purposes only. Consequently, other embodiments, assuring that a proper slot index is used to generate the unscrambling sequence are contemplated. Thus, one skilled in the art could contemplate embodiment illustrated in .","As illustrated in , once the mobile station ascertains number of slot comprising the control message, the mobile station determines which slot index is to be provided from the block  to a mapping function . The mapping function  comprises the same mapping function as the sequence generator at the base station. One skilled in the art recognizes that block  may comprise any storage device, a shift register, or an accumulator, capable of performing the described function. Thus, if the mobile station determines that the control message comprises the 1-slot format, the slot index of the slot preceding the current slot is provided to the mapping function . If the control message comprises the 2-slot format, the slot index of the slot preceding the current slot by two slots is provided to the mapping function . If the control message comprises the 4-slot format, the slot index of the slot preceding the current slot by fours slots is provided to the mapping function . The mapping function , generates a 21 bits long sequence in response. Once the 21 bits sequence is generated, the switch  is closed and the 21 bits long sequence is then copied to a 21 bit long buffer\/shift register . One of ordinary skills in the art understands that switch  represents a concept only, and any means accomplishing copying of the scrambling sequence to the buffer\/shift register  is contemplated. When the mobile station provides an indication that the scrambled information bits  of the control message are provided to block , the buffer\/shift register  is clocked and its output is provided to block .

For consistency reason, the description of mobile station processing referred to the same slot index for deriving the unscrambling sequence. However, one of ordinary skills in the art understands, that any slot of the message can be utilized, as long as both the base station and the mobile station share the knowledge, which slot was used. Consequently, use of any slot of the message is contemplated.","One of ordinary skills in the art understands that a particular embodiment of the F-PDCCH has been described for tutorial purposes.
