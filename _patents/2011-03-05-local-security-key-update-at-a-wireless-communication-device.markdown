No. 61\/311,174, filed on Mar. 5, 2010, entitled \u201cADVANCED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES\u201d, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Providing secure connections and protecting traffic confidentiality and integrity between mobile stations (MSs) and base stations (BSs) via wireless communications can be challenge for wireless mobile communication technology. Each wireless technology can provide standards, procedures, and protocols to ensure security and authentication of messages between the mobile stations and base stations. Wireless mobile communication standards can include the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) standard and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standard (e.g., 802.16e, 802.16m), which is commonly known to industry groups as WiMax (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access).","Some common security risks include identity exposed, dictionary attack, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, and session hijacking. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) can be used to mitigate security risks by using keys and message authentication. EAP is a mechanism that can define a standard message exchange between devices using an agreed upon authentication protocol.","A typical WiMax wireless network , as illustrated in , can include a mobile station (MS) , a base station (BS) , an Access Service Network (ASN) Gateway (GW) , and an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server . The base station and the ASN gateway can be included as part of the ASN , and the AAA server can be included as part of the Connectivity Service Network (CSN). Communication between networking devices may have different interfaces with various signaling overheads. Communication between the mobile station and the base station (or other ASN device) may use an R interface . Communication between the base station and the ASN gateway (in the ASN) may use a R interface . Communication between the ASN gateway (or other ASN device) and the AAA server (or other CSN device) may use a R interface .","During a successful WiMax EAP authentication between the mobile station (MS)  and the AAA server , a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) can be generated, which resides on both the mobile station and the AAA server. The PMK may be transmitted to the ASN gateway . The ASN gateway may be referred to as an Authenticator. The ASN gateway and mobile station may separately calculate an authentication key (AK). The authentication key may be transferred to the base station. The base station and mobile station may use the authentication key to encrypt and decrypt messages.","After a specified time or event indicating that data integrity has been comprised, the mobile station (MS)  and the AAA server  may provide EAP re-authentication used to generate a new authentication key. EAP authentication or calculating a new AK can occur each time handover occurs between base stations in the ASN.","Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated, and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended.","Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.","An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","In the IEEE 802.16e security framework, security keys may be refreshed during either a (re)authentication or a handover. (Re)Authentication can involve Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication with the Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server. The AAA server can refresh all of the keys both in the network and those used to communicate via the air interface. However the process of re-authentication using the AAA server can take a relatively long time and can incur significant additional signaling overheads in the network.","Handover can occur when a mobile station (MS) moves from one cell to another or from one base station to another. Handover can be anchored at the same ASN using PMK sharing. Having a light-weight method to refresh the security keys used for encryption and integrity protection on the air interface can be desirable, even when the MS stays at the same base station (BS). The light-weight method to refresh the security keys may be referred to as an Intra-BS Handover procedure. The intra-BS handover can allow more frequent key refreshes to enable integrity check value (ICV) size reduction without compromising security protection or involving the AAA using a full EAP. With less traffic or network activity the ICV can be reduced to 8 bits, while an increase in the number of packets can increase the ICV size to increase security.","Disclosed is a system and method for updating a security key at a base station (BS) and\/or a mobile station (MS). The method for updating a security key at a base station comprises the operation of transmitting a handover command from the base station to a mobile station. The operation of incrementing a base station instance of an authentication key counter at the base station follows. The next operation of the method can be calculating a new local authentication key (AK*) at the base station using the base station instance of the authentication key counter and an authentication key (AK). The AK may be previously obtained from an authenticator. The method further includes communicating by the base station with the mobile station using the new local authentication key after a predetermined action time.","The method for updating a security key at a mobile station (MS) comprises the operation of receiving a handover command at the mobile station from the base station. The operation of incrementing a mobile station instance of an authentication key counter at the mobile station follows. The next operation of the method can be calculating a new local authentication key (AK*) at the mobile station using the mobile station instance of the authentication key counter and an authentication key (AK). The AK may have been previously calculated by the mobile station. The method further includes communicating by the mobile station with the base station using the new local authentication key after a predetermined action time.","After EAP authentication during a network entry, both the Authenticator and the mobile station may establish or generate a valid Pairwise Master Key (PMK). Based on the PMK, an Authentication Key (AK) can be derived at both the Authenticator and mobile station. The Authenticator can pass the AK to the base station, and thus the base station and the mobile station can use the same AK to derive other keys for encryption and integrity protection.","In IEEE 802.16e, the AK can be derived as\n\nAK=KDF(PMK,MSID|BSID|\u201cAK\u201d,160),\u2003\u2003[Equation 1]\n","where MS identification (MSID) can be a 48 bit MS Media Access Control (MAC) address, BS identification (BSID) can be a 48 bit BS MAC address, and 160 can be the length of AK key (measured in bits) to be generated by a Key Derivation Function (KDF). Obviously, the authentication key can be calculated using IDs of different length to generate a key having a different length, as can be appreciated. Since the PMK, MSID, and BSID remain constant for the same mobile station and base station after an EAP authentication, the AK cannot be refreshed unless the MS performs re-authentication to refresh the PMK.","Typically each time communication transfers from one base station to another base station\u2014a process called a handover\u2014the AK is recalculated by the Authenticator and mobile station because the BSID changes. So a handover command can be used to refresh the AK, but not necessarily used to generate new a new PMK with every handover, in order to minimize handover latency and network overhead.","Other encryption keys used in IEEE 802.16e include a Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) key and a Transport Encryption Key (TEK). In IEEE 802.16e, the TEK may be refreshed anytime because the different TEK can be generated by the base station from the same AK. The CMAC can be refreshed in any handovers to a different base station because a counter can be involved in the CMAC derivation scheme. The counter used in a CMAC calculation may be a CMAC_KEY_COUNT in IEEE 802.16e.","To enable IEEE 802.16m base station legacy Access Service Network (ASN) compatibility with the IEEE 802.16e and older standards, maintaining the aforementioned AK derivation in the Authenticator can be desirable. In the IEEE 802.16m standard, both CMAC keys and TEKs are derived from the AK, so generating a key refresh during a Handover (HO) can be beneficial. Another level of counter-based Authentication Key (AK), called AK* or local AK, may be derived \u201clocally\u201d at the base station based on the received AK from the Authenticator, and derived \u201clocally\u201d at the mobile station based on the AK calculated by the mobile station. The mobile station and base station can then use the locally derived AK* to derive other CMAC and TEK keys for encryption and integrity protection. The term local AK is equivalent to AK* and the terms may be used interchangeably in this disclosure.","An example of counter based AK* derivation is defined as follows:\n\nAK*=KDF(AK,MSID|BSID|AK_COUNT|\u201cAK*\u201d,Length),\u2003\u2003[Equation 2]\n","Where the Key Derivation Function (KDF) uses the AK, an MS MAC address for an MSID, a BS MAC address for a BSID, and either a base station instance or a mobile station instance of the authentication key counter (AK_COUNT) to calculate the new local authentication key having a key size of Length. The key size of Length may be 160 bits or another desired length, depending on the desired security level and the length of the MSID and BSID. The AK_COUNT can be a counter maintained at the mobile station, base station and the Authenticator to ensure the same AK* is not derived and reused when the mobile station handover occurs to the same base station with same BSID, i.e. the same AK still remains valid. Reusing a previously used AK* value may appear to the base station as a replay attack. Thus, not recalculating the same AK* can prevent replay attacks. IEEE 802.16 base stations can be vulnerable to a replay attack in which an attacker maliciously resends valid frames that the attacker has intercepted in the middle of a forwarding (relaying) process. In one embodiment, the AK_COUNT may be maintained as a CMAC_KEY_COUNT.","Other encryption keys derived from the AK can be a CMAC key and a TEK. The CMAC key may be used to calculate a CMAC (or CMAC digest), where the CMAC is used in a range request or handover command to validate a new local AK (AK*). The TEK can be used to encrypt the data traffic. A TEK counter may be used for data traffic and may cycle or update more frequently than AK_COUNT or a CMAC counter. The overflow or rollover of the TEK counter can create a triggering event for an intra-BS handover and generating a new AK*. Accordingly, a large traffic volume may trigger a local security update. Other network events may also trigger the intra-BS handover.","With the local AK (AK*) in the key hierarchy (PMK, AK, AK*, CMAC key, and TEK), the base station and mobile station may refresh their security keys from the AK* level by simply increasing the AK_COUNT value without involving the Authenticator in the generation of a new AK or the local AK (AK*). Since key derivation is involved, not using full EAP authentication, the key refresh method can be simple and fast. Such key derivation operation is not necessarily triggered by the Authenticator since AK* is \u201clocal\u201d. Updating the AK_COUNT value with the Authenticator after key refresh may be desirable, to maintain counter synchronization. Using the local AK (AK*) may not provide the same level of security as a full EAP, but efficiency gains may outweigh the security considerations in many situations.","Each type of device a wireless communication system may communicate with another type of device based on a specified interface, where each interface has different security protocols, different transmission speeds, and different signaling overheads. The Wimax network reference model includes eight reference points that are conceptual links that can connect two functional entities in the network. Reference points represent a bundle of protocols between peer entities, similar to an IP network interface. Interoperability is enforced through reference points without dictating how vendors implement the edges of those reference points. The references are well documented in the Wimax specification. A summary of some of the reference points is discussed in the present application and is provided below for convenience.","R\u2014the interface between the MS and the ASN as per the air interface (Physical Layer (PHY) and MAC) specifications (IEEE P802.16d\/e). R may include additional protocols related to the management plane. The R interface  can be provided between mobile station  and base station , as shown in . The R interface may have faster transmission times and less overhead than other interfaces, such as R, R, and R, which can be used in full EAP authentication.","R\u2014the interface between the ASN and the CSN to support AAA, policy enforcement and mobility management capabilities. R can encompass the bearer plane methods (e.g., tunneling) to transfer IP data between the ASN and the CSN. The R interface  can be provided between the ASN gateway (or Authenticator)  and the AAA server , as shown in .","R\u2014consists of a set of control plane and bearer plane protocols for internetworking between CSNs operated by either the home or visited Network Service Provider (NSP).","R\u2014consists of a set of control and bearer plane protocols for communication  between the base station  and the ASN gateway (or Authenticator) , as shown in .","R\u2014consists of a set of control plane message flows and, in some situations, bearer plane data flow forwarding between base stations and relay stations.","Eliminating the additional communication between the base station and the Authenticator and between the Authenticator and the AAA server used in EAP authentication while still providing some refresh of authentication keys can be desirable. The intra-BS handover can allow refresh of authentication keys without incurring additional signaling overheads associated with R, R, and R interfaces.","To enable the initiation of a key refresh based on the local AK (AK*), an \u201cIntra-BS Handover\u201d process can be used. Typically, a handover is used to transfer communication from one base station to another base station, at which time a new AK is generated, thus refreshing the AK. The base station can refer to a single logical MAC entity independently managing a cell or sector, and may not necessarily be limited to a physical device. The intra-BS handover process or protocol can use a similar handover command structure as is used in a regular handover for transferring communication between base stations. But the handover command  used in the intra-BS handover protocol may be for the purpose of key refresh, instead of finding a target frequency or cell for better signal quality, as illustrated in . The intra-BS handover command may select the target base station to be the same as current serving base station to force a refresh of the local AK (AK*). The handover command may include an action time which indicates a time period after which the new local AK may be used.","Instead of performing a full EAP authentication and generating a new PMK, the intra-BS handover procedure can increment the AK counter (AK-COUNT) and locally at both the base station and the mobile station. The AK counter at the base station can be referred to as the base station instance of an authentication key counter, and the AK counter at the mobile station can be referred to as the mobile station instance of an authentication key counter. Since both MSID and BSID remain the same, AK may also be the same, thus it is not necessary to contact the Authenticator to request a new AK to be transferred to the base station.","Both the mobile station and base station may locally calculate a new local AK (AK*) and using the base station or the mobile station instance of the AK counter and the AK. The AK may have been previously obtained by the base station from the Authenticator. The AK counter may be increased or incremented with every handover. After the handover action time  or a predetermined action time, the base station and mobile station may communicate with the new local AK (AK*)  and other keys derived from the new local AK (AK*). Other keys below the AK* level may be automatically refreshed. Using the intra-BS handover procedure can eliminate the time and overhead associated with contacting the Authenticator and the AAA server prior to refreshing the local AK or obtaining new security keys.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","301","301"],"i":["c ","b ","a"]},"The AAA server may transfer a copy of the PMK to the Authenticator. Both the mobile station and the Authenticator may individually derive an AK and using the PMK. A copy of the AK  on the Authenticator may be transferred to the base station. The base station and mobile station may use the AK to generate other keys and encrypt and decrypt messages. Initially, a 1st AK* may be derived and on the base station and mobile station without a handover command or incrementing AK_COUNT. New CMAC keys and new TEKs may be derived from the 1st AK*. The AK* may be verified using a CMAC before coding or encrypting communication using the AK*. Then, the base station and mobile station may communicate using the 1st AK*  or keys derived from the 1st AK*.","A mobile station may make a handover request to the base station in the form of an advanced air interface (AAI) Handover (HO) Request (REQ). The AAI_HO-REQ  may be used when the handover is initiated by the mobile station. The request can indicate an intra-BS handover by setting the target base station equal to the serving or source base station. In response to the request, the base station can send a handover command in the form of an AAI_HO-CMD . In the case of a base station initiated handover, the base station can send an unsolicited AAI_HO-CMD  to the mobile station. The AAI_HO-CMD can indicate that the target base station is set to the serving base station and an Action Time, from which new security keys shall be used. As a result of the handover command, both the base station and mobile station may increase the AK_COUNT and and derive the 2nd AK* and (and subsequent AK*s).","To verify key update, which can occur after a 1st handover action time , the mobile station and base station can exchange a CMAC or CMAC digest calculated from new AK* in a ranging (RNG) request (REQ) or response (RSP). The AAI_RNG-REQ\/RSP  can include both the mobile station instance of the AK_COUNT and the CMAC calculated from the CMAC keys, which are derived from the 2nd AK*. The RNG-RSP may be encrypted and thus the ICV may be used to serve the same purpose of integrity protection instead of using CMAC or CMAC digest.","The base station can ensure reception of the AAI_RNG-REQ by replying with an AAI_RNG-RSP  including the CMAC calculated from the CMAC keys derived on the base station. With successful CMAC verification, the intra-BS handover completes and base station can update the Authenticator with the 2nd AK_COUNT value  (and subsequent AK_COUNT values), to maintain counter synchronization. Then, the base station and the mobile station may communicate using the 2nd AK*  or keys derived from the 2nd AK*.","If the CMAC is not verified by the base station or the mobile station, the base station or the mobile station may continue using the 1st AK* or a full EAP authentication may be trigger depending on implementation.","With another AAI_HO-CMD  indicating that the target base station is the same as the serving base station, the intra-BS handover process repeats, as illustrated in . The base station instance and mobile station instance of the AK_COUNT is increased and and the 3rd AK* and is derived locally on both the base station and mobile station. After a 2nd handover action time , the 3rd AK* may be verified  by the mobile station and the base station and the AK_COUNT may be updated  at the Authenticator. Then, the base station and the mobile station may communicate using the 3rd AK*  or keys derived from the 3rd AK*.","The steps or operations -and - may repeat for each (n\u22121)th handover command with an (n\u22121)th handover action time , until an event triggers a request for new authentication keys , such as an inter-BS handover, a rollover or overflow of the AK_COUNT, or an action indicating a security breach or attempt at a security breach. When such an event occurs, a new AK may be generated for inter-BS handover or a new PMK and may be generated between the AAA server and mobile station as a result of a successful (re)authentication . The AAA server may transfer a copy of the PMK to the Authenticator and the process repeats.","The counter handling during intra-BS handover can be the same as a typical handover. In most common cases, the mobile station instance of the AK_COUNT (AK_COUNT) can be the same as the base station instance of the AK_COUNT (AK_COUNT). In some rare cases, the AK_COUNTsent from the mobile station is larger than the AK_COUNTmaintained by the base station. In such cases, the base station may update its AK_COUNTto the larger AK_COUNTvalue and re-derive keys. In cases where the AK_COUNTis smaller than the AK_COUNT, the base station can ignore the request as a replay or can treat many similar replays as a replay attack or a counter-out-of sync attack and request a new AK.","The intra-BS handover may be used in some handover scenarios when a Relay or an L2 Remote Radio Module (RRM) is used by a base station. Using a relay station (RS), a key refresh may be desirable where the key generation inputs (such as PMK, BSID, and MSID) remain the same due to deployment choices. For example, a deployment configuration may hide the relay from the network so that the base station gets the AK from the Authenticator based on the BSID and transfers the AK to the relay station for \u201clocal use\u201d at the relay station. In such configurations the BSID is not used to generate the AK. When the mobile station moves between the base station and the relay station, the handover can appear to the Authenticator to be an \u201cintra-BS\u201d handover.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["110","122","142","8","144","112","114"]},"In another example of a relay wireless network, as illustrated in , a mobile station  performs an intra-BS handover from a first relay station (RS)  to a second relay station (RS)  that are both within the cell of the same base station . The first relay station and the second relay station may communicate with the base station using the R interface  and , respectively. Before the intra-BS handover a wireless communication channel  may be formed between the mobile station and the first relay station. After the intra-BS handover a wireless communication channel  may be formed between the mobile station and the second relay station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["601","602","603","604","604","605","605","606","607","608"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b "]},"The handover may be initiated by the mobile station with a handover request . The base station may respond to the request or send an unsolicited handover command  to the mobile station setting the target base station to the relay station within an action time. The handover request or handover command may be triggered when the mobile station moves away from the base station where the signal strength is weaker and closer to the relay station where the signal strength is stronger. As a result of the handover command, both the base station and the mobile station may increase the AK counter and and calculate a relay station local AK (AK*) and indicating that the target base station is the relay station. The relay station local AK may still use the BSID to calculate the relay station local AK (AK*). The base station may transmit a copy of the relay station local AK  to the relay station after the relay station local AK is calculated on the base station. After a relay station handover action time , the relay station and mobile station may communicate with the relay station local AK  and the base station can update the Authenticator with the updated AK counter value . The intra-BS handover may transfer communication from a base station to a relay station, from a relay station to a base station, or from a first relay station to a second relay station.","In another relay deployment, the relay station can maintain a relay link with the base station. In terms of security association between the relay station and the base station, the relay station can be similar to a mobile station. Since the relay link can be the point of traffic aggregation and may likely be stationary (i.e., does not perform any handovers), the security association between the relay station and the base station may run out traffic encryption keys over time. In such a case, the relay station can perform an intra-BS handover procedure with its associated base station to refresh the AK* and\/or CMAC\/TEK keys, instead of performing a full network re-authentication, to ensure key freshness on the relay link.","A similar procedure for a handover between evolved Node Bs (eNode Bs or eNBs) and a relay node (RN) may be used in 3GPP LTE. In the 3GPP LTE systems, the eNB serves the similar function as a base station (the eNB may have multiple Medium Access Control\/Radio Resource Control (MAC\/RRC) entities to manage multiple cells) in an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), which can communicate with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE), which is equivalent to a mobile station in IEEE 802.16.","The intra-BS handover provides a mechanism to renew keys in a local manner without involving the Authenticator for key generation and\/or transfer. The handover scheme designates the same base station as target and source, as well as updating the security key with a new counter that does not use inputs from the Authenticator.","Another example provides a method  for updating a security key at a base station (BS), as shown in the flow chart in .
