title: Authentication and binding of multiple devices
abstract: Systems and methods are described that relate to authentication and/or binding of multiple devices with varying security profiles. In one aspect, a first device with a higher security profile may vouch for the authenticity of a second device with a lower security profile when the second device requests access for content from a content provider. The vouching process may be implemented by allowing the first device to overlay its digital signature on a registration request that has been signed and transmitted by the second device. The second device with the lower security profile may access content from the content provider or source for a predetermined time period, even when the second device does not access content through the first device.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE"],"p":["Some aspects of the disclosure presents methods and systems related to authentication and\/or binding of multiple devices. Some aspects of the disclosure are related to associating two or more communication devices that may have varying security profiles.","The disclosure addresses security profiles, such as a security profile for a computing device that may control various aspects of access to content; for instance, the security profile may detail the strength of passwords, keys, and\/or other hardware\/software aspects that determine who can access a particular piece of content, and when, how, and where the content is accessible. For instance, a security profile may be as simple as requiring a single password of a predetermined strength (e.g., based on the length of the password, mixture of alphanumeric characters, etc.) to allow a user to access the computing device. In other cases, multiple passwords of a predetermined strength may be required (e.g., a password dynamically generated by a security token in addition to a standard static password) for access to the computing device. The security token may also store cryptographic keys (e.g., digital signatures, biometric data, etc.) that serve as authorization credentials. The security token itself may be tamper resistant and may require an additional personal identification number (PIN) to show an electronic key.","In yet other cases, the disclosure addresses the strength of a security profile associated with a computing device. The strength of a security profile may relate to where authentication credentials are stored within the memory of a secure computing device. In these cases, the ease with which the authentication credentials may be accessed and modified may ultimately determine the strength of the security profile.","Personal computers (PCs) and many mobile devices have security profiles that are considered somewhat less secure than devices such as, for example, digital set-top boxes for cable, satellite, and Internet Protocol television (IPTV) systems. Different device classes (e.g., PC versus set top box) may have distinct security capabilities. For example, the PC hardware platform may have no inherent security features. In contrast, the set-top box may be manufactured with special purpose security hardware. Moreover, the user experience anticipated by each device may also limit security capabilities. For example, a set-top box user may not be expected to repeatedly input user credentials. The combination of these and other factors may result in disparate security challenge mechanisms and capabilities resulting in a corresponding set of security profiles. The security profile assigned to a device may lend itself to the quality and integrity of the security services delivered by the device. For example, the security features in a set-top box may be far superior to security features in a PC and, therefore, trust in a device's capability to deliver content as planned by deterring abuse may vary.","Pursuant to the disclosure, some devices have lower security profiles for a variety of reasons having to do with how easily hacked the device is, including the fact that many of the cryptographic security keys associated with the device may not be adequately protected because they are stored in random access memory (RAM), the certificates may be burned into read-only memory (ROM), the media access control (MAC) address may be easily modified, there are no hardware roots of trust or any method to store a key and identity securely, and\/or the devices may be susceptible to large-scale cloning. For example, PCs and other devices may lack hardware security features accessible to third-party application developers targeting those devices. In fact, most PCs may lack hardware security systems and, therefore, persistent and volatile storage components may be rooted in protection mechanisms that may have weak resistance to reverse engineering. Meanwhile, some mobile phones may possess strong hardware cryptographic modules. However, access to these modules by third-parties may be non-existent, inferior, or hidden from user-space interfaces. One of the highest priorities for content distribution systems is to ensure that devices logging in to a customer account are paying for services and not stealing these services. With the less secure profiles of devices such as those mentioned above, ensuring that each user is obtaining legitimate services is very difficult to do, especially without a national billing and account management system. In fact, as mentioned above, many consumer devices may be easily cloned and run on someone else's account in a different part of the country when the billing system and account management are different entities.","Therefore, improved and\/or alternative methods\/systems are needed to enable devices to access content.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the disclosure or to delineate the scope of the disclosure. The following summary merely presents some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description provided below.","To overcome limitations in the prior art, and to overcome other limitations that will be apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present disclosure is directed to a method and system for securely authenticating and binding two or more devices that have varying security profiles such that a higher security profile device can vouch for one or more lower security devices.","Aspects of the disclosure relate to a system\/method in which a device may act as a registration or authentication proxy for other clients that need to make requests for content to a network activation service.","Aspects of the disclosure may be provided in a computer-readable medium having computer-executable instructions to perform one or more of the process steps described herein.","In the following description of the various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration various embodiments in which aspects may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","As mentioned above, there are problems associated with ensuring that content is appropriately communicated to and accessed by multiple devices within a client network. In this regard, content may include any type of information, including video, audio, data, e-books, financial data, etc., or a combination of more than one type.","In certain aspects, the present disclosure recognizes that different devices may have different security profiles. For instance, one device (e.g., a gateway) may have a stronger security profile and a second device (e.g., a smart phone) may have a weaker security profile. In particular, a first device may have an inferior security architecture that results in the weaker security profile while another device within its vicinity may have an adequate security architecture that results in the stronger security profile. Therefore, the device with the inferior security architecture may use the security services of the device with adequate security architecture (e.g., a trustworthy device) to imply proximity with the trustworthy device. Services may then make a stronger inference regarding the authenticity and context (e.g., geographic placement in the vicinity of the device with an adequate security architecture, etc.) of the device with the inferior security architecture.","If it is also desirable to bind two or more devices, binding of the devices may occur in any direction. Ultimately, the security services of a trustworthy device may be leveraged by other devices in order to imply use by a common owner. In other words, the trustworthy device may either act in the role of proxy by securely tunneling data between another device and a content service or another device may acquire fresh challenge\/response data from the trustworthy device and then deliver this output to the content service. Due to the flexibility of the message architecture, several device combinations may be realized including low-security device and gateway (e.g., as proxy), low-security device and gateway (e.g., as secure provider), low-security device and set-top box, and low-security device and smartphone with hardware support.","In general, the security profile of a device may control various aspects of access to content; for instance, the security profile may detail the strength of passwords, keys, and\/or other hardware\/software aspects that determine who access a particular piece of content, and when, how, and where the content is accessible.","In accordance with some aspects of the disclosure, a client device (e.g., a smart phone) may want to request to be registered and\/or activated on a network to receive services such as those related to video-on-demand. If the smart phone does not possess an adequate threshold level of security (e.g., as required by the content provider), the smart phone may make a request through a stronger security device such as a gateway, which does possess at least the minimum level of security (as defined by its security profile). The smart phone may initially digitally sign and transmit a request for network activation to the gateway device. Once the gateway confirms that the smart phone is an authorized device, the gateway may apply a second digital signature to the smartphone request and then transmit the appropriate request to a network activation service, thereby vouching for the smart phone. The network (e.g., a video-on-demand content provider or a secure data provider) may then make its own independent check as to the authenticity of the gateway and, if authenticated, the video-content provider may activate the smart phone so that the smart phone may access video-on-demand content. In this example, because the gateway possesses the minimum security profile, the gateway may have direct access to the network (e.g., video content provider). Likewise, because the smart phone does not possess the minimum security profile, the smart phone may not have direct access to the content (e.g., high value or secure content).","To authenticate a weaker security device, a stronger security device may digitally sign an activation request (e.g., a second time) that has already been signed by a weaker security device. This activation request may then be forwarded to a network activation or authentication service, for example, and the identities of both the stronger security device and the weaker security device may then be validated. The network service may already possess identity information of the stronger security device (e.g., through a registration process at the time of manufacture, through an initialization process upon first use, etc.). While the network service may not directly possess identity information related to the weaker security device, the signature of the stronger security device on the activation request may be used by the network service as an identity credential to allow the weaker security device to access content. For instance, in the previous example of a smart phone seeking access to a high value video-on-demand service through a gateway, the smart phone may digitally sign and transmit an activation request to the gateway. The gateway may then verify the authenticity of the smart phone (e.g., again through a registration process at the time of manufacture, through an initialization process upon first use, etc.), and if the gateway determines that the smart phone should have network access, the gateway may in turn digitally sign and transmit the authentication request to the video content provider. The content provider, or data manager such as a security provider, may then determine the authenticity of the gateway, and if the video content provider determines that the gateway is authentic, the network activation service may transmit access authorization credentials for the smart phone to the gateway. The gateway may then transmit these credentials to the smart phone so that the smart phone may access, e.g., video-on-demand content from the provider. These credentials may have an expiration of a few hours, a day, a week or a month depending on the content policy. After expiration of these credentials, the weaker device may be required to re-register or re-authenticate through the stronger security device to obtain a new set of credentials. The stronger device thus may act as a security and\/or registration proxy for the weaker security device. Similarly, the stronger device may act as a security and\/or registration proxy for other client devices that need to make activation requests to the network activation service.","This method of securely authenticating and\/or binding devices with different security profiles may have significant value to those delivering or providing access to content, such as multi system operators (MSOs), by allowing users to potentially consume content on many new devices such as PCs, MACs, cell phones, portable media devices, electronic pads, televisions with network connectivity, etc. which may not possess adequate security profiles. This increase in the number of content consumption device options may lead to an increase in revenue. Also, the ability for certain devices to serve as a security\/registration proxy for other devices may lead to new business models for video content as new services may be provided to less secure devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100","101","102","103","103","101","102"]},"There may be one line  originating from the central office , and it may be split a number of times to distribute the signal to various homes  in the vicinity (which may be many miles) of the central office . Although the term home is used by way of example, locations  may be any type of user premises, such as businesses, institutions, etc. The lines  may include components not illustrated, such as splitters, filters, amplifiers, etc. to help convey the signal clearly, but in general each split introduces a bit of signal degradation. Portions of the lines  may also be implemented with fiber-optic cable, while other portions may be implemented with coaxial cable, other lines, or wireless communication paths. By running fiber optic cable along some portions, for example, signal degradation in those portions may be significantly minimized, allowing a single central office  to reach even farther with its network of lines  than before.","The central office  may include a termination system (TS) , such as a cable modem termination system (CMTS), which may be a computing device configured to manage communications between devices on the network of lines  and backend devices such as servers - (to be discussed further below). The TS may be as specified in a standard, such as, in an example of an HFC-type network, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard, published by Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (a.k.a. CableLabs), or it may be a similar or modified device instead. The TS may be configured to place data on one or more downstream channels or frequencies to be received by devices, such as modems at the various homes , and to receive upstream communications from those modems on one or more upstream frequencies. The central office  may also include one or more network interfaces , which can permit the central office  to communicate with various other external networks . These networks  may include, for example, networks of Internet devices, telephone networks, cellular telephone networks, fiber optic networks, local wireless networks (e.g., WiMAX), satellite networks, and any other desired network, and the interface  may include the corresponding circuitry needed to communicate on the network , and to other devices on the network such as a cellular telephone network and its corresponding cell phones.","As noted above, the central office  may include a variety of servers - that may be configured to perform various functions. For example, the central office  may include a push notification server . The push notification server  may generate push notifications to deliver data and\/or commands to the various homes  in the network (or more specifically, to the devices in the homes  that are configured to detect such notifications). The central office  may also include a content server . The content server  may be one or more computing devices that are configured to provide content to users in the homes. This content may be, for example, video on demand movies, television programs, songs, text listings, etc. The content server  may include software to validate content delivery devices through a registration process, validate user identities and entitlements, locate and retrieve requested content, encrypt the content, and initiate delivery (e.g., streaming) of the content to the requesting user and\/or device.","The central office  may also include one or more application servers . An application server  may be a computing device configured to offer any desired service, and may run various languages and operating systems (e.g., servlets and JSP pages running on Tomcat\/MySQL, OSX, BSD, Ubuntu, Redhat, HTML5, JavaScript, ASP, .NET, perl, python, ruby with JEE\/J2EE, IIS, apache). For example, an application server may be responsible for collecting data such as television program listings information and generating a data download for electronic program guide listings. Another application server may be responsible for monitoring user viewing habits and collecting that information for use in selecting advertisements. Another application server may be responsible for formatting and inserting advertisements in a video stream being transmitted to the homes . And another application server may be responsible for receiving user remote control commands, and processing them to provide an intelligent remote control experience.","An example home may include a device , such as a modem, which may include transmitters and receivers used to communicate on the lines  and with the central office . The device  may be, for example, a coaxial cable modem (for coaxial cable lines ), a fiber interface node (for fiber optic lines ), or any other desired modem device. The device  may be connected to, or be a part of, a gateway interface device . The gateway interface device  may be a computing device that communicates with the device  to allow one or more other devices in the home to communicate with the central office  and other devices beyond the central office. The gateway  may be a set-top box (STB), digital video recorder (DVR), computer server, or any other desired computing device. The gateway  may also include (not shown) local network interfaces to provide communication signals to devices in the home, such as televisions , additional STBs , personal computers , laptop computers , wireless devices  (wireless laptops and netbooks, mobile phones, mobile televisions, personal digital assistants (PDA), etc.), and any other desired devices. Examples of the local network interfaces include Multimedia Over Coax Alliance (MoCA) interfaces, Ethernet interfaces, universal serial bus (USB) interfaces, wireless interfaces (e.g., IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth interfaces, and others.","In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, devices - may possess varying security profiles. The security profile of devices - may be determined by various factors, including the strength (e.g., as determined by the length and\/or sequence of alphanumeric characters) of passwords used to access the devices -, the implementation and\/or location of cryptographic keys (e.g., digital signatures, biometric data, etc.) within the device - (e.g., in RAM, ROM, other internal registers, etc.), and the use of a multifactor authentication schemes to access devices - (e.g., use of a keyed password and biometric data for access authorization), among other things. In other aspects, a security profile may also be determined by the strength of encryption\/decryption algorithms used by the device - to transmit\/receive data (e.g., symmetric\/asymmetric keys, etc.), by the strength of encrypted seed values, by the structure (e.g., mechanical features such as tamper-resistant protective covers, etc.) of the devices -, and\/or by the physical address where the device - is located (e.g., devices located in high crime versus low crime areas, fixed devices versus mobile devices, etc.). For instance, STBs  may have a stronger security profile than wireless devices , meaning that the STBs  may implement a security profile (e.g., computer-executable program instructions that control access to content, encryption of content, personalized commands, etc.) that is stronger (e.g., tougher to hack) than wireless devices  (e.g., a smart phone). In another embodiment, devices - may possess security profiles that may be rated on a graded scale from least secure to most secure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","201","202","203","204","205","110","116","200","206","207","208","200","209","210","209","210","101","109","200","211","200","211","200","211","200","203"]},"Various features described herein offer binding of security profiles associated with devices - so that users may access content from the central office  or another content storage facility or location. In certain aspects, the binding of security profiles may allow a weaker device - to use the security privileges associated with a stronger device -. For example, one such user may be a viewer who is watching a television program being transmitted from the central office . In some embodiments, as discussed previously, the user may be able to view content from a device that has a weaker security profile (e.g., a smart phone) through a registration process for authenticating the smart phone with a device that has a stronger security profile (e.g., a gateway ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a ","a "],"b":["300","300","200","300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309","311","300","310","309","300","200","300","312","302","313","303","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"i":["b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b ","c","c ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b ","b "],"b":["300","300","300","200","300","301","302","303","304","305","306","307","308","309","311","311","311","311","300","310","309","300","200","300","300","314","300","315","301","300","316","303","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","300","314","300","314","302","300","314","314","300","300"]},"The components illustrated in the figures herein are merely examples, and can be altered, combined, subdivided, in any desired manner to still achieve results described herein. Moreover, the devices shown in , , and may be portable, stand-alone, or spread across multiple devices, etc.","In certain aspects of the disclosure, a client device , - may come onto a network and may need to register with a customer account that has already been created before the device , - may navigate any content. In particular, registering with a customer account may include use of the customer account's credentials by the client device , - to log in to the network. The device , - may be personalized through a service (e.g., from central office ) that transmits a personalization response that may include access authorization credentials (e.g., cryptographic \u201ckeys\u201d) and identity information that ties the client device , - to a particular customer account (e.g., established from information at a service provider, established through a preregistered gateway  with a higher security profile, etc.).","It should be noted that any of client devices - may represent a device with a higher security profile (e.g., the preregistered gateway ) and any of the remaining client devices - may represent a device with a lower security profile. For instance, if modem  and\/or STB  has an adequate security profile (e.g., sufficient to allow access to a particular piece of requested content from central office ), the modem  and\/or STB  may also function as a gateway . In particular, as mentioned earlier, cable modem , may implement a higher security profile through features such as a trusted boot loader, a hardware root of trust where cryptographic keys may be stored in a trusted internal processor, an internal register storing the cryptographic keys when the cable modem  boots, and\/or an encrypted internal key that is not exposed if the cryptographic keys are put in RAM. However, throughout the remainder of the disclosure, unless specifically stated otherwise, the gateway  may be used to represent a device with a higher security profile and the other client devices , - may all have lower security profiles than gateway . Therefore, in general, gateway  is assumed to already possess its registration details whereas the remaining devices , - are discussed to explain how the registration process works via preregistered gateway . Because of its higher security profile, gateway  may serve as a hardware root of trust and may not have to register through yet another device - when accessing content from a content provider such as central office . On the other hand, client devices , - may have varying security profile levels that make them more susceptible to being hacked.","The identity information received by client devices , - through the registration process may be a globally unique identifier that may have a component of the identity that ties the devices , - to a particular customer account (e.g., associates the identifier stored in a database maintained, for example, by central office , with the customer account) through which devices , - are registering (e.g., established via the preregistered gateway  that may vouch for the security profile of device , - for viewing content). The keys may associate a device , - to a particular customer account and may include credentials that device , - may use to digitally sign requests for access to content. The keys may also be session keys useful for exchanging secure information at a later time (e.g., a preshared key).","The client devices - may have a unique device ID that may be created from the configuration on the device - (e.g., media access control (MAC) address, etc.). Devices , - may also acquire software\/program instructions to complete a registration process with gateway , if the software is not already present on devices , -. The software may allow the devices , - to sign and transmit registration requests using one or more preshared keys and may give the devices , - information regarding how to complete the registration process. The keys may be preshared on a network (e.g., network ) and\/or in a manufacturing process, etc. depending on the type of device , -. Also, it should be noted that the keys may include asymmetric keys (e.g., with a hash) and\/or a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with a symmetric key.","The gateway  may have a deep level of hardware root of trust, security that is identified through strong identification methods, and may be associated directly with a user account. The security profile of gateway  may serve as an anchor in a given location  and may be able to monitor activity of all of other client devices , - and may be able to vouch (e.g., for a predetermined period of time such as a day, week, month, etc.) for devices , - that may possess less secure security profiles when the devices , - may be trying to access content from central office .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["401","111","103","403","111","111"]},"Next, the process may move to step  where a client device , - may initially transmit to the registration proxy  a request, such as a digitally signed request, for access to content from the content provider. For instance, a smart phone  may transmit a digitally signed registration request to a gateway . This signed request may be a request for access to content, for example, for a predetermined period of time. The process may then move to decision step  where the registration proxy  may decide if the client device , - should be authorized to receive content. If not, the registration proxy  may deny the request in step . The process may then move back to step . If the registration proxy  decides that the client device , - should receive content, the registration proxy , in step , may then append, supplement, and\/or overlay its own digital signature to the request, which already includes the digital signature of client device , -. The registration proxy  may then transmit the doubly-signed request to the content provider. The digital signature of the registration proxy  may signify that registration proxy  \u201cknows\u201d the client device , - and is vouching for the device , - to be able to obtain content from a predetermined content provider.","The process may then move to step  where the content provider may decide if the registration request should be approved. If the request should not be approved, the content provider may transmit a denial of the request to registration proxy , which may pass the denial down to client device , - in step . The process may then move back to step . If the registration request is approved by the content provider, the process may move to step  where the content provider may transmit a personalized approval response (e.g., including access authorization credentials and identity information) to the registration proxy . The authorization credentials may be digitally signed by the content provider and may provide client device , - with a new security profile level, an expiration time, and the types of content that may be requested before the expiration time. The registration proxy  may then transmit the personalized approval response to the client device , - in step . Then, in step , device , - may access content from the content provider for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., as specified in the initial registration request) even when the device , - is not behind gateway  at location , as long as the identity of device , - has not changed. For instance, if the client device , - is a smart phone , the smart phone  may access video-on-demand content from central office . However, when the device , - is behind registration proxy , the registration proxy  may continue to monitor the activity of device , - even after the registration request of device , - has been approved by a content provider. In this way, devices , - may function as tethered devices that may be registered through an anchor of trust (e.g., registration proxy ).","Then, as shown in step , at the end of the predetermined access period, the client device , - may have to re-register with the registration proxy  to continue to access content from the content provider by transmitting a re-registration request for extending the time period for accessing the content. The process may then move back to step  where the re-registration request may be processed by the registration proxy  and the content provider. This re-registration process may not be as extensive as the initial registration and may include a \u201cstamp\u201d provided by registration proxy  on the request for content by a client device , -. If this re-registration process is approved by registration proxy  and the content provider, client device , - may receive content again for a predetermined time period, as specified in the re-registration request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["501","503","505","501","507","503","505","507","505","507","509","501","515","509","505","501","511","505","501","509","503","515","509","507","503","515","513","509","515"]},"Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above.
