Some strippers or scrub and recoat materials \u201cdewet\u201d (appear to bead up upon or otherwise insufficiently wet) a floor shortly after being applied, and may continue to dewet until the user swabs the applied material back and forth a few times. Some floor finishes (e.g., crosslinked floor finishes) are especially difficult to remove and may require multiple applications of a floor stripper formulation or long dwell times.","The present invention provides, in one aspect, a floor finish stripper or scrub and recoat composition comprising:\n\n","The invention provides in another aspect a method for stripping or deep scrubbing a floor finish comprising:\n\n","The disclosed compositions and methods facilitate stripping or cleaning floor finishes. Preferred embodiments of the disclosed compositions and methods have a reduced pH and may be less irritating to skin or less likely to stain substrates such as linoleum. Additional preferred embodiments of the disclosed compositions and methods are substantially free of inorganic salts, and may be \u201cgreener\u201d or more environmentally friendly than conventional compositions containing salts of acids as couplers.","The phrase \u201chardenable floor finish\u201d refers to an applied liquid coating that through a chemical or physical process (including solvent evaporation or other drying processes, photochemical reactions, electrochemical reactions, radical processes, thermal processes, ionic processes, moisture cure processes or multiple-component (e.g., two- or three-component) crosslinking processes) can become dried, crosslinked or otherwise cured in situ to form a tack-free film on a floor. The phrase \u201chardened floor finish\u201d refers to such a dried, cross-linked or otherwise cured floor finish.","The phrase \u201cstripping a floor finish\u201d refers to removing, at such time as it may be desired to do so, a hardened floor finish from an underlying installed flooring substrate without removing substantial portions of the flooring substrate. Such stripping preferably employs minimally abrasive measures such as mop or spray application of the disclosed stripper followed after a brief standing time by rinsing using, e.g., water or a detergent solution. Stripping may if desired be accompanied by more abrasive but flooring-safe measures such as abrading the finish during the standing time using, e.g., a nonwoven floor scrub pad, but may be carried out without requiring a flooring-damaging finish removal step such as sanding.","The phrases \u201cdeep scrubbing\u201d and \u201cscrubbing and recoating\u201d refer to applying, at such time as it may be desired to do so, a composition containing a floor finish solvent to a hardened floor finish atop an underlying installed flooring substrate without removing all of the hardened floor finish, and cleaning the hardened floor finish surface sufficiently so that an additional layer or layers of hardenable floor finish may be applied thereto and hardened.","The word \u201cconcentrate\u201d refers to a composition intended to be diluted with water before use. The phrase \u201csubstantially nonchlorinated\u201d refers to a concentrate that does not contain objectionable quantities of chlorinated solvents (e.g., methylene chloride) whose presence might pose a health or environmental hazard. The phrase \u201cfloor finish solvent\u201d refers to an organic liquid that can dissolve, soften or otherwise assist in removing a hardened floor finish from a floor, and includes organic cosolvents that assist in dissolving a solvent in a concentrate, help maintain the concentrate in a desirable physical state during storage, ease dilution of the concentrate with water, reduce cost, reduce odor or provide some other desirable packaging, storage or use benefit. The phrase \u201csparingly water-soluble\u201d refers to a material that when mixed by itself with water at room temperature and pressure at a mixing ratio less than 1:20 will not form a clear, homogenous solution but which can form a clear, homogenous solution in the presence of sufficient acidic coupler.","The phrase \u201cnot corrosive to skin\u201d refers to a composition which when tested with the CORROSITEX\u2122 in-vitro skin corrosion assay from InVitro International does not break through the assay membrane in less than sixty minutes of contact.","The phrase \u201chomogenous aqueous liquid phase and no or low foaming during shaking\u201d refers to a composition that contains or is diluted to contain at least 75 wt. % water and which when 7.5 ml of such composition or diluted composition is placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask, manually shaken for one minute and allowed to stand for one minute will not completely separate into two or more phases and will not exhibit more than 10 ml of visible foam.","A variety of sparingly water-soluble floor finish solvents may be employed in the disclosed compositions and methods. The solvent desirably has a flash point greater than about 60\u00b0 C., low odor and low toxicity, and preferably has at least 0.1 wt. % water solubility. Representative floor finish solvents include 2-, 3- or 4-acetamidophenol (<1.4% water solubility); acetanilide (<1% water solubility); acetophenone (<1% water solubility); 2-acetyl-1-methylpyrrole; benzyl acetate (<1% water solubility); benzyl alcohol (\u02dc-4% water solubility); benzyl benzoate (<1% water solubility); benzyloxyethanol (<1% water solubility); ethers or hydroxyethers such as ethylene glycol phenyl ether (2.3% water solubility, commercially available as DOWANOL EPh\u2122 from Dow Chemical Co.) and propylene glycol phenyl ether (1.1% water solubility, commercially available as DOWANOL PPh\u2122 from Dow Chemical Co.); essential oils (e.g., benzaldehyde, pinenes (alphas, betas, etc.), terpineols, terpinenes, carvone, cinnamealdehyde, borneol and its esters, citrals, ionenes, jasmine oil, limonene, dipentene, linalool and its esters); dibasic esters such as dimethyl adipate, dimethyl succinate, dimethyl glutarate (often available in a mixture, including products available under the trade designations DBE\u2122, DBE-3, DBE-4, DBE-5, DBE-6, DBE-9, DBE-IB, and DBE-ME from DuPont Nylon), dimethyl malonate, diethyl adipate, diethyl succinate, diethyl glutarate, dibutyl succinate, and dibutyl glutarate; dialkyl carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, diisopropyl carbonate, and dibutyl carbonate; Corganic anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and alkyl or alkenyl succinic anhydrides; organo-nitriles such as acetonitrile and benzonitrile; organo-phosphates and phosphonates such as tributyl phosphate, tripropyl phosphate, 2-ethyl-1-hexyl phosphate; phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, and diethyl phthalate; and mixtures thereof. The water solubilities noted above are room temperature values. Some materials may serve as a solvent in some floor stripper\/cleaner solutions or in some stripping applications, and as a cosolvent in combination with one or more solvents in other floor stripper\/cleaner solutions or in other stripping applications. Additional representative solvents include amyl acetate, amyl alcohol, butanol, 3-butoxyethyl-2-propanol, butyl acetate, n-butyl propionate, cyclohexanone, diacetone alcohol, diethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol methyl ether, diisobutyl carbinol, diisobutyl ketone, dimethyl heptanol, dipropylene glycol tert-butyl ether, ethanol, ethyl acetate, 2-ethylhexanol, ethyl propionate, ethylene glycol methyl ether acetate, hexanol, isobutanol, isobutyl acetate, isobutyl heptyl ketone, isophorone, isopropanol, isopropyl acetate, methanol, methyl amyl alcohol, methyl n-amyl ketone, 2-methyl-1-butanol, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, 1-pentanol, n-pentyl propionate, 1-propanol, n-propyl acetate, n-propyl propionate, propylene glycol ethyl ether, tripropylene glycol methyl ether (commercially available as DOWANOL TPM from Dow Chemical Co.), tripropylene glycol n-butyl ether (commercially available as DOWANOL TPNB from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol n-butyl ether acetate (commercially available as Butyl CARBITOL\u2122 acetate from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (commercially available as Butyl CARBITOL from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol n-butyl ether acetate (commercially available as Butyl CELLOSOLVE\u2122 acetate from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (commercially available as Butyl CELLOSOLVE from Dow Chemical Co.), dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether (commercially available as Butyl DIPROPASOL\u2122 from Dow Chemical Co.), propylene glycol monobutyl ether (commercially available as Butyl PROPASOL\u2122 from Dow Chemical Co.), ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (commercially available as UCAR\u2122 Ester EEP from Dow Chemical Co.), 2,2,4-Trimethyl-1,3-Pentanediol Monoisobutyrate (commercially available as UCAR FILMER\u2122 IBT from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol monohexyl ether (commercially available as Hexyl CARBITOL from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol monohexyl ether (commercially available as Hexyl CELLOSOLVE from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (commercially available as Methyl CARBITOL from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (commercially available as CARBITOL from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol methyl ether acetate (commercially available as Methyl CELLOSOLVE acetate from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (commercially available as Methyl CELLOSOLVE from Dow Chemical Co.), dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether (commercially available as Methyl DIPROPASOL from Dow Chemical Co.), propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (commercially available as Methyl PROPASOL acetate from Dow Chemical Co.), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (commercially available as Methyl PROPASOL from Dow Chemical Co.), diethylene glycol monopropyl ether (commercially available as Propyl CARBITOL from Dow Chemical Co.), ethylene glycol monopropyl ether (commercially available as Propyl CELLOSOLVE from Dow Chemical Co.), dipropylene glycol monopropyl ether (commercially available as Propyl DIPROPASOL from Dow Chemical Co.) and propylene glycol monopropyl ether (commercially available as Propyl PROPASOL from Dow Chemical Co.). Preferred floor finish solvents include benzyl alcohol, dibasic esters, essential oils, dialkyl carbonates, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol phenyl ether and mixtures thereof. The floor finish solvent(s) (including cosolvent(s), if employed), may collectively represent for example at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% of the total concentrate weight.","Tap water, deionized water, distilled water or water in any other suitable form may be used in the disclosed compositions and methods. The use of softened water or of water having a low overall hardness level may facilitate application of the disclosed compositions to a hardened floor finish and limit dewetting. When the disclosed compositions are formulated as a concentrate, water may represent for example at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70% or at least 80% of the total concentrate weight.","A variety of sulfonic acid, sulfate acid, phosphonic acid, phosphate acid and aromatic acid couplers may be employed in the disclosed compositions and methods. The acid coupler may contain carbon atoms, (e.g., from about 2 to about 11 carbon atoms), may contain heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen or sulfur) and may be substituted with various moieties (e.g., hydroxyl, ester, aldehyde or alkyl groups), so long as such carbon atoms, heteroatoms and moieties do not interfere with solubilization of the floor finish solvent or cause excessive foaming during shaking. As shown below in Examples 16 and 17, when a linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid such as dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid is used as the acid, agitation can lead to excessive foam formation. If a stripper\/cleaner prone to such excessive foam formation is applied using a swing machine or other motorized application device, the foam can cause pump cavitation and otherwise slow the removal process when using an autoscrubber or other suction device to remove the residual stripper\/cleaner and softened or stripped finish.","Exemplary acid couplers include hydroxyethane sulfonic acid, cumene sulfonic acid, toluene sulfonic acid, xylene sulfonic acid, methyl naphthalene sulfonic acid, amino tri (methylene phosphonic acid), 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid, n-butyl acid phosphate, phenyl acid phosphate, dimethylpyrophosphoric acid, 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acids (e.g., 2-hydroxybenzoic acid), dihydroxybenzoic acids (e.g., 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), pyridinecarboxylic acids (e.g., 2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) pyridinedicarboxylic acids (e.g., 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) and sulfosuccinic acid. The acid coupler may have any suitable purity level. Preferably however an acid coupler of at least 50% purity is employed. When the disclosed compositions are formulated as a concentrate, the acid coupler may represent for example about 0.1 to about 20%, about 0.1 to about 10% or about 0.1 to about 5% of the total concentrate weight. The acid coupler may be accompanied by other acids (e.g., mineral acids) or by salts of aromatic, aliphatic or mineral acids (e.g., sodium benzene sulfonate). However, the inclusion of such other acids or acid salts may make the stripper\/cleaner less environmentally friendly. Preferably the acid coupler is at least 50% of the total weight of acids and salts of acids in the disclosed compositions. Acid couplers as described in copending application Ser. No. 11\/254,235 filed even date herewith, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, may also be employed in the disclosed compositions and methods.","A variety of organic amines may be employed in the disclosed compositions and methods. Representative organic amines include low molecular weight (e.g., C) organoamines and substituted organoamines (e.g., alkanolamines) such as monoethanolamine, diethyl ethanolamine, triethanolamine, 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,2-diaminopropane, N-benzylethanolamine, 2-aminomethylpropanol, furfurylamine, tetrahydrofurfurylamine and mixtures thereof. When the disclosed compositions are formulated as a concentrate, the organic amine may represent for example about 0.1 to about 20%, about 0.1 to about 10% or about 0.1 to about 5% of the total concentrate weight. The amine amount may also be expressed in terms of the molar equivalent ratio of acid to amine. For example, acid:amine molar equivalent ratios of about 0.7:1 to about 1.3:1 may be employed. Often it will be desirable to adjust the amine amount to obtain a desired pH in the final concentrate or use-solution. For example, the pH may be about 2 to about 11, about 4 to about 10, or about 5 to about 9. The use of excessive amine in the floor stripper\/cleaner concentrate or use-solution can make the composition corrosive to skin, and can subject a concentrate having such corrosive properties to much more stringent packaging requirements. The organoamine may be accompanied by other amines (e.g., inorganic amines) or by salts of organic of inorganic amines. However, the inclusion of amine salts may make the stripper\/cleaner less environmentally friendly, and the inclusion of inorganic amines may make the composition more prone to dewetting. Preferably the organoamines are at least 50% of the total weight of amines and salts of amines.","The disclosed compositions may also contain one or more surfactants. Representative surfactants will be familiar to those skilled in the art, and include anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary surfactants are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,544,942 B1. The amount of surfactant may vary depending on factors such as the types and amounts of other ingredients in the disclosed composition, the desired dilution level, and other factors that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. As a general guide, the amount of surfactant may be about 0.1 to about 20%, about 0.1 to about 15% or about 0.1 to about 10% of the total concentrate weight.","The disclosed compositions may contain other adjuvants including biocides, abrasive particles, chelants, builders, defoamers, fragrances, dyes, indicators, colorants, thickeners, anticorrosion additives, antirust additives, light stabilizers and antioxidants. The types and amounts of such adjuvants will be apparent to those skilled in the art.","The disclosed stripper\/cleaners may be manufactured as water-containing concentrates intended to be diluted with additional water prior to use, or as ready-to-use aqueous solutions that may be employed without dilution. Desirably the floor stripper\/cleaner forms a single phase when freshly stirred and maintains that single phase while stored in the container in which it will be sold, or at least for sufficient time (e.g., for one minute or more, two minutes or more, or five minutes or more) so that the composition may be stirred or otherwise mixed and then applied to a floor at the intended point of use before phase separation occurs. The concentrate may contain for example about 5 to about 85 wt. % solvent, about 1 to about 93 wt. % water, about 1 to about 25 wt. % acid coupler and about 1 to about 25 wt. % organic amine. A ready-to-use solution may contain for example about 0.05 to about 25 wt. % solvent, about 25 to about 99 wt. % water, about 0.1 to about 10 wt. % acid coupler and about 0.1 to about 10 wt. % organic amine. The disclosed stripper\/cleaners may be manufactured by mixing the ingredients in any convenient order. For example, the water, organic amine, surfactant (if employed), floor finish solvent, acid and any other desired ingredients (e.g., dyes, fragrances, chelating agents, etc.) may be mixed together. The disclosed stripper\/cleaners may be packaged in any convenient form including bottles, drums, dispensers intended to be carried by a user during stripper\/cleaner application and dispensers intended to be replaceably installed in a mixing or dispensing device (e.g., a wall-mounted, freestanding or benchtop dispensing station). The types and design of suitable packaging will be familiar to those skilled in the art.","A variety of flooring substrates may be stripped using the disclosed method. Exemplary flooring substrates include resilient flooring substrates such as vinyl composition tiles, vinyl sheet flooring, linoleum, rubber sheeting, rubber tile, cork, synthetic sports flooring and vinyl asbestos tile, and non-resilient flooring substrates such as terrazzo, concrete, wood flooring, bamboo, wood laminate, engineered wood products (e.g. wood epoxy blends, permanently coated substrates such as those available under the names PERGO\u2122 and PARQUET\u2122), stone, marble, slate, ceramic tile, grout, and dry shake flooring. Such flooring substrates may be installed at a variety of jobsites, including indoor and outdoor sites involving new or existing residential, commercial and government- or agency-owned sites.","A variety of hardened floor finishes may be stripped or deep scrubbed using the disclosed method. Representative commercially available floor finishes include PADLOCK\u2122, GEMSTAR LASER\u2122, GEMSTAR POLARIS\u2122, RIVET\u2122, and TAJ MAHAL\u2122 acrylic floor finishes, GLOSSTEK 100\u2122 and ORION\u2122 polyurethane floor finishes, and COURTMASTER II\u2122, ISI STAR\u2122, TUKLAR MEDICAL\u2122 floor finishes, all from Ecolab Inc.; CORNERSTONE\u2122 and TOPLINE\u2122 acrylic floor finishes from 3M; BETCO BEST\u2122 floor finish from Betco Corp.; HIGH NOON\u2122 acrylic finish from Butchers; CITATION\u2122 and CASTLEGUARD\u2122 acrylic finishes from Buckeye International, Inc., COMPLETE\u2122, SIGNATURE\u2122, TECHNIQUE\u2122 and VECTRA\u2122 acrylic floor finishes from SC Johnson Professional Products; OVER AND UNDER\u2122 floor sealer from S.

Nos. 4,517,330, 4,999,216, 5,091,211, 5,319,018, 5,453,451, 5,773,487, 5,830,937, 6,096,383, 6,197,844, 6,228,433, 6,316,535 B1, 6,544,942 B1, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2002\/0028621 A1, and in the patents cited therein. The floor finishes may include water-soluble or water-dispersible film formers such as metal-free acrylic finishes, acid-containing polymers crosslinked using transition metals, and water-soluble or water-dispersible multicomponent (e.g., two component) polyurethanes. The floor finish may contain mixtures of film formers.","If in concentrated form, the stripper\/cleaner should be diluted with water prior to use, e.g., at an intended use location. Ordinary tap water, softened water or process water may be employed. The concentrate:water dilution ratio usually will be at least 1:1 by volume, for example at least 1:2, at least 1:3, at least 1:4, at least 1:5, at least 1:6, at least 1:8, at least 1:10 or more. A variety of mixing methods may be employed. Mixing in a mop bucket is one such method and may be preferred. The hardened floor finish can optionally be abraded with a suitably mild abrasive (e.g., a green or black SCOTCH-BRITE\u2122 Floor Maintenance pad from 3M) prior to applying the stripper\/cleaner. The stripper\/cleaner may be applied using techniques that will be familiar to those skilled in the art (e.g., using a flat or string mop, squeegee, roller or towel). The applied stripper\/cleaner should be allowed to stand for a suitable time (e.g., for a minute or more, and typically up to about 5, up to about 10 or up to about 20 minutes) while it softens or deep scrubs the floor finish. The composition (and, where stripping is intended, the softened finish) may be removed using a variety of techniques that will be familiar to those skilled in the art including vacuuming, mopping, scrubbing or wiping. The stripped floor or deep scrubbed floor finish may be allowed to dry and a layer or layers of floor finish applied thereto and caused or allowed to harden.","The invention is further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.","A concentrate was made using the ingredients and weight percentage amounts shown below in Table 1. Monoethanolamine, benzyl alcohol, surfactant and ethylene glycol n-butyl ether were all added with stirring to the majority of the water. The mixture formed two phases.

No. 5,744,440 was replicated and evaluated to determine foam generation using the method of Example 16. A 7.5 mL portion of the cleaner was placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask, manually shaken for one minute and allowed to stand for one minute. The cleaner produced a heavy foam that filled the remaining volume (approximately 42.5 mL) in the flask. A similar foam generation test was performed using the Run 6-1 and Example 13a concentrates, each diluted 1:3 by volume with water. The Run 6-11 use-solution produced approximately 5 ml of foam (viz., a foam volume corresponding to about two thirds of the initial liquid volume), and the Run 13 use-solution produced approximately 7.5 mL of foam (viz., a foam volume corresponding to the initial liquid volume). In each case the Run 6-11 and Run 13 use-solutions produced less than 10 mL of foam (viz., less than 4\/3 the initial liquid volume).","Various modifications and alterations of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. It should be understood that this invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth above."],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
