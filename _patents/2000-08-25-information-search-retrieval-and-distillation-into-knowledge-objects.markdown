title: Information search, retrieval and distillation into knowledge objects
abstract: The invention provides for various methods and apparatuses for searching bodies of knowledge, such as previously indexed source documents reachable over a network, search results from previous searches, and results from performing meta-searches. Search criteria is received from a client, and the bodies of knowledge are searched based on the search criteria, and search results provided responsive to said searching. Search results may be configured to have associated distillation triggers, where selecting a trigger causes its associated search result to be distilled in real-time. Distilled search results can be indexed into portions of the source document for focused entry, and can also be grouped and analytically presented on mid-menus to allow the user to review distilled data in summary form. Results may also have associated status symbols indicating by symbol a particular topic area to which a result is related, and by opacity or other indicator the apparent relevance of a result to the particular topic area. Search and viewing preferences may be determined according to psychometrics, user selection of a default user category, through a question/answer session, or based on monitoring user activity which incrementally defines a profile.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of presently co-pending application Ser. No. 09\/336,020, filed Jun. 18, 1999, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Composing A Search, for Searching a Corpus of Information or the Internet, for Displaying the Search Results in an Easily Viewable Manner, and for Crawling, Summarizing and Structuring the Corpus of Information\u201d; and co-pending application Ser. No. 09\/565,674 filed May 4, 2000, entitled \u201cInformation Search, Retrieval, and Distillation Into Knowledge Objects\u201d. These related applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention generally relates to searching a network for text and non-text data, and providing for storing and forwarding search results. More particularly, the invention relates to applying linguistics and syntax analysis to augment searching.","Recently there has been a vast proliferation of networking connection options, for businesses and general users alike, for connecting to networks such as intranets and the Internet. Many such businesses and users position themselves as an end point, or point of interest (hereafter generally \u201cweb sites\u201d), to whom others can connect and obtain information and other material. After several years of such end points becoming accessible of the networks, an enormous amount of information and other material is now available in an online electronic format.","A typical method for locating and reviewing such information is by way of a \u201cweb browser\u201d, such as Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Opera, and other network application programs (hereafter generally \u201cbrowsers\u201d). Unfortunately, the very richness of available information has made finding anything specific an enormously complex and tedious task. The vast number of available web sites can be likened to a beach, where a particular search seeks to locate a particular few grains of sand.","Typical search methods employ either data categorization or keyword searching. In the former, a well known example is www-Yahoo-com, which provides broad categories and successively narrower topic areas. In the latter, there are typically two types. The first are traditional search engines such as NorthernLight-com, AltaVista-com, Excite-com, and the like, which \u201ccrawl\u201d web sites and index the words found therein. The second are \u201cmeta\u201d search engines, such as SurfWax-com, DogPile-com, and the like, which execute a search across multiple search engines, and provide options for collating results. It is estimated that only 10% of all web sites are indexed. (Please note that periods within uniform resource locators (URLs) have been replaced with hyphens to prevent hypertext links in an online copy of this application.)","Unfortunately, both categorization and keyword searching have significant drawbacks. Categorization requires intervention to place a site within a relevant category or categories. Such categorization is very subjective, and therefore may result in significant omissions or misleading results when a searcher drills down to detailed categories. And, categorization is resource intensive, and therefore few web sites are categorized. Thus, typically, only \u201cmain stream\u201d sites are categorized.","Although keyword searching does not suffer the subjective effects of categorization, such searching requires a searcher to know the correct terms to use in order to perform an effective search. And, such searches typically result in a vast number of irrelevant search results (\u201chits\u201d) due to multiple uses for terms in diverse disciplines. For example, a search for \u201cinternational policy\u201d will return results concerning politics, college admission standards, international newspaper policies, foreign advocacy, etc., as each would use those terms someplace on their web page.","A further limitation to both techniques is that once the task of determining search results is accomplished, and results provided to a searcher's browser, there is no way to share those results with another party without re-executing the search. This results in a huge waste of computing resources. A related limitation is that the inherent lack of structure to web page data tends to result in web pages having large volumes of data within a given search result, where little of the web page data may actually be relevant to a particular query. In addition to making it difficult to find a relevant portion of a search result, large results can overwhelm the output capabilities of some devices (e.g., mobile devices) used for searching.","Methods and apparatuses are disclosed for searching bodies of knowledge, such bodies including previously indexed source documents reachable over a network, search results from previous searches, and results from performing meta-searches. Search criteria is received from a client. The bodies of knowledge are searched based on the search criteria, and search results provided responsive to said searching. The search results may be configured with a distillation trigger, wherein selecting a trigger causes a related search result to be distilled in real-time. Distilled search results can be indexed into portions of the source document for focused entry, and can also be grouped and analytically presented on mid-menus to allow the user to review distilled data in summary form. Results may also have associated status symbols (or tokens) indicating by symbol a particular topic to which a result is related. For example, user perceptible characteristics of the symbol, such as shape or opacity, can be used to indicate a result's topic area, concept, document type, and apparent relevance to the search criteria.","Various exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated and discussed herein. In one embodiment, the invention is directed towards searching the Internet, which is a well-known collection of public and private data communication and multimedia networks (e.g., intranets, Wide Area Networks (WAN), Local Area Networks (LAN), wireless networks, cable television based networks, etc.), that operate using common protocols to form a world wide network of networks.","Throughout embodiments of this invention, various input\/output devices and techniques are contemplated, including, but not limited to, wireless, mobile, voice-activated, voice recognition, and audio text-to-speech devices and techniques. Examples include, but are not limited to, personal computers (PCs), laptops, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones. A mix of input\/output modalities is, therefore, contemplated. For example, a user may use a keypad on a PC, PDA, or cellular telephone, for instance, to enter input, and may receive search results via a browser; a user may use voice to communicate, and may receive results via a browser; and a user may use voice to communicate, and may receive a response via text-to-speech audio feedback. Communication mediums may be wired, including Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), Plain Old Telephone System (POTS), the Internet, Integrated System Digital Network (ISDN), and DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), cable modem, for example, or wireless, including microwave and satellite transmissions, or combinations thereof.","Searching can be focused on retrieving text-based documents, graphics, web pages, or other desired data types, such as structured storage (databases and the like), music, spreadsheets, and the like. For simplicity, it is assumed a search query is in English language, but, other languages and data formats (e.g., graphics) may also be searched. (For example, a graphics fragment could be dropped into a query box by way of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) or through a Java Bean or ActiveX object.)","For the purposes of this description, the terms Uniform Resource Locator (URL), document, origination and source address are intended to be generally synonymous, as each term essentially references particular information at a particular network location. For simplicity, it is assumed addresses conform to the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) dot quad format (0.0.0.0). However, it should be appreciated that other address formats (such as wireless node identifiers) may be used without loss of generality.","It is assumed search commands and results are English based. However, such is not required, so long as individual language components can be identified, and appropriate analysis models provided for desired search types. The phrase \u201ccandidate source document\u201d will be used to refer to an information source that may be returned to a user in response to a search request, depending on whether search criteria is satisfied.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["100","102","104","106","108","100","106","108"]},"Source documents (e.g., search results) can be returned to a user \u201cas is,\u201d or in a \u201cdistilled\u201d format, which is a reduced content version of a source document. For example, for a text document, distillation provides a condensed abstract of the document based on the language within the source document (see ). Distillation is advantageous for client devices having limited display areas, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDA), portable computers, Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) enabled devices, such as mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, and \u201csmartphones,\u201d, and other portable communication or computing devices having limited screens and\/or computing resources (the phrase \u201cmobile device\u201d will be used to generally reference such PDAs, WAP enabled devices, portable communication or computing devices, etc.). Distillation is also generally helpful as it may be configured to provide a consistent interface displaying brief (per user preferences) overviews of source documents, thus allowing, for example, one to quickly determine the relevance of particular search results.","In one embodiment, a user of the client  and clients ,  contact the search server  to submit search criteria and receive results thereto. It is expected that searches are keyword or natural language queries. It will be appreciated, however, that searching is not limited to text searches. For example, pattern analysis or image recognition may be applied to image data to locate images by their data content. Search results are obtained through comparisons of search criteria with known search domains (see ) such as previously indexed web pages , meta-searches , by piggy-backing  onto private search engines, or searching against saved searched  of other users. Search results have an associated icon for creating a distillation of a result according to set user preferences (see ).","In one embodiment, search results are packaged as structured objects, such as HTML or XML objects (hereafter \u201cresult objects\u201d), with appropriate characteristic tags to identify the original searcher (user of the client ), as well as the nature and contents of the search results. For example, if a user wanted to see focus words in a document, a focus words XML section would be defined with the appropriate words therein. It will be appreciated that other structured storage can represent result objects; XML is assumed due to its text-based data tagging and broad industry support. (The phrase \u201cknowledge object\u201d may refer to a single result object, as well as a collection of result objects.)","Because XML provides tagged structure to result objects, such objects may be linked within a structured lexicon, allowing building a heuristic search capability for subsequent searches, as well as user communities of interest based on saved searches. Result objects may also include public encryption keys or other validation requirements to restrict access to some or all of the tagged sections within a saved result object. Result objects are intended to be E-mailed or otherwise transferred to other users, and in one embodiment, the search servers track result object sharing between users so that users can be informed when there is a change in shared data. In one embodiment, an editorial module (e.g., executed by a search server administrator) allows one to edit and\/or contribute supplemental content to result objects.","In one embodiment, an application programming interface (API) is provided for interfacing with a search server . The API provides an interface to the search server, through which third party developers (or users) can provide search services that are integrated with the search server. In addition, the API will enable search server administrators to extend the capabilities or customize a search server without modification to the underlying searching engine employed by the search server.","In one embodiment, the API is implemented by way of executable objects, such as ActiveX controls or JavaBeans (which are Java-based platform-independent controls developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.). It will be appreciated that other object formats can be used to implement the API. Executable objects are intended to be stored within a search server  (executing as server side objects); however, in an alternate embodiment, executable objects can be stored within result objects for downloading to a client  as needed. The executable objects are used by a client  as needed based on the preferences (see ) set by a user of the client, e.g., the user indicates the executable objects should be used when distilling the search results (see ).","The executable object, whether stored in a search server or within a result object, may be configured to be executed when search results are received by a client. Associated with the executable objects are extended processing statements that incorporate regular expressions, user preferences, or other data extraction techniques. Extended processing statements can be applied to a source document or a result object, and can be applied by the search server  to other result objects associated thereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","202","200","202"]},"The upper right circle  corresponds to acquirable knowledge from performing meta-searches, e.g., searches by way of other search engines. As with the known knowledge, intersection of the acquirable knowledge circle  circle with the query circle  corresponds to relevant search results from this particular search domain. Similarly, the lower right circle  corresponds to acquirable knowledge from piggy-backing onto private search engines provided by individual web sites, such as those search engines provided by universities, government web sites, or the like. In the piggy-back configuration , the invention may, for example, visit a private or local search page for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, execute a search thereon, and provide filtered search results to the user of the client .","The lower left circle  corresponds to search result objects stored by the search server  and made publicly available by the users generating the results. These publicly accessible results can be included when performing the user's search, and contribute to the current user's search. One advantage of saving previous search result objects for later sharing is that, as illustrated, there can be a portion  of saved search data that is no longer available to other search techniques. Knowledge gaps are common as a result of rapid changes in online data content. In one embodiment, \u201ckeys\u201d are assigned to user search result objects, where the keys operate as an identifier of the type of data stored within the result object. (Keys can be thought of as a form of a Dewey Decimal system for result objects.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["100","102","300"]},"After logging in  the user's connection device is sensed  for communications characteristics, such as display characteristics or audio characteristics, and output formats are adjusted accordingly.","After logging in  the user's connection device is sensed  for display characteristics, and viewing formats are adjusted accordingly. Unless overridden or supplemented by a user preference, the search server automatically tailors output according to a user's connecting device characteristics, and\/or other user preferences or characteristics such as psychometrics associated with the user, which may require overriding or supplementing view preferences discussed below. Thus, a user using a computer having a large browser window can be presented with results differently than will a mobile device.","Mobile devices may access the Internet with a restricted browsing environment, such as a \u201cmicrobrowser\u201d tailored for small data files, limited memory, and low-bandwidth requirements typical of most wireless networks. Consequently, rich source document content is reduced (e.g., graphics are converted to low-resolution) or discarded. And, data for the mobile device is converted into a format suitable for receipt by the mobile device. For example, currently, WAP enabled devices expect data to be encoded in WML (or equivalent), which is an XML variant specifically devised for small screens and one-hand navigation without a keyboard. WML output may include WMLScript, a JavaScript-like language tailored to a WAP enabled device's restrictive computing environment. Thus, as needed, data, whether previously encoded in HTML, XML, or other data format, is converted into WML (or other needed format) for receipt by a mobile device.","After logging in, a test  is then performed to determine whether the connecting user is a new user. If not new, a second test  is performed to determine whether to load previously used search results. If so, then search preferences, data types (e.g., dates, names, historical events, geography, job skills, etc.), and viewing preferences discussed below are loaded  for the user. In one embodiment, the user is prompted with a list indicating previously saved search sessions that may be retrieved. If the user does not desire loading previous searches, then processing continues with setting search preferences.","If the user is a new user, the search server creates a new record for the user with name, password preference option fields unset, and the user selects  a name and password. A user's profile is stored in a database associated with the search server. In one embodiment, different search servers maintain their own user databases, but cross-check with each other to verify if an apparently new user is known to another search server; if so, then the user's preferences can either be used remotely or copied locally and synchronized with the other search server. In one embodiment, multiple search servers share common (perhaps virtual) permanent storage.","The user may now choose to set  a variety of options to control searching, distillation (abstracting) and viewing of search results. Options are separated herein into three general categories, search preferences affecting the search process, data type preference controlling distillation of search results into result objects, and view preferences controlling display of data captured within a result object. In one embodiment, search options are internally represented by a search server as a series of constraint rules that are solved to determine whether a candidate source document meets all user options.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 2"],"b":["330","332","202","208","334"]},"Another option is a Results Sorted  option. This option controls whether to sort results by \u201capparent title\u201d or document source. The phrase \u201capparent title\u201d is used as some sources, such as web pages, embed control tags (e.g., HTML statements) indicating a page's title. Other data sources, such as plain text files, word processing files, spreadsheets, databases, etc., do not have associated tags indicating a title. In one embodiment, for text files, the first few words in the file are used as a title. In other file formats, a viewer filter is applied in effort to determine a title. For example, in the word processing file example, the file may contain an embedded document properties object indicating a title, or the first few words of the file can be used as the title. If no possible title can be determined, the source document's network location (e.g., its URL in an Internet context) can be used as a title.","Another option is a Results Highlighted  option. This option determines whether to highlight the context within search results. In one embodiment, highlighting means to bold face or otherwise accentuate (for example, with auditory feedback) search terms within a source document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 4","FIG. 6","FIG. 3C"],"b":["350","402"]},"It will be appreciated that these requirements can also be used to determining the user's initial list of search results. That is, after entering a search, a candidate list of search results is determined in accord with traditional searching methods. Without displaying the search results to the user, the search server instead prepares distilled result objects for each candidate result, and applies the search criteria to the distilled data, and removes source documents not containing the search criteria in the distilled data. Thus, if the user seeks a certain type of document having identifiable language constructions and lexical structure, such as legal documents, the search server can pare the initial search results to remove documents failing to have appropriate structure.","In one embodiment, the distilled object is compartmentalized. For example, if constructed as an XML object, the result object is defined with tags (or equivalent structural definitions for other data formats) are defined containing matching source document text for each data type option. For example, a Dates\/Times  constraint can be selected, causing the user to be presented with options for setting valid date and time values, ranges, and formats (e.g., month\/day\/year, day\/month\/year, month\/year, etc.) for data in the distilled result object. After distilling a document source, the result object then contains an XML tag pairing, such as <DATES> <\/DATES> containing matching source document data meeting the data type criteria.","Other options include Abstracts options  which allow setting requirements for sentence position, density, word frequency, sub-phrase parsing, etc. characteristics for data to be included in the distilled data. Source document data meeting these requirements are included in the result object within an appropriately labeled tag pairing. Abstracts can also be defined with respect to one or more of the data types discussed herein, such as key points , focus words , author's summary, or other data of interest to the user.","The Key Points  option causes a candidate source document to be analyzed to identify key sentences. Key sentences can be determined, for example, by word matching, sub-phrase parsing, special part of speech parsing, use of action words, word frequency counting, and based on other lexical analysis techniques known in the art. Key sentences may comprise entire sentences, portions thereof, or combinations with one or more other sentences. For example, a key sentence may be a phrase, or a slug of text having no structured connotation. It will be appreciated that other known techniques for identifying key sentences may be used.","The Focus Words  option causes a candidate source document to be analyzed to identify focus words. As discussed in patent application Ser. No. 09\/336,020 (which is incorporated herein by reference), focus words are related terms and phrases for a particular word or phrase, where the related terms are concepts or terms that are narrower, roughly equivalent, or broader in scope than words in a source document. Focus words can be determined by testing for part of speech, capitalization, word frequency checking, and presence in various word dictionaries such as Names, personal, corporate, geographic, events, holidays, and the like. Focus words determination can also be applied to the user's search query to aid in formulating a query of proper scope.","Another option is an Emphasis Items  option. When a source document is analyzed, all structural elements, such as tag pairings or other devices used to denote document structure, are identified and their contents stored and associated thereto. Thus, if a source document contains <TITLE>My Title<\/TITLE>, the text \u201cMy Title\u201d is stored and associated as being part of the TITLE tags. Selection of this option causes a supplemental user interface (not shown) to be presented, where the user may selectively elect to view (according to user view preferences) particular structural elements (such as the TITLE tag data) and their associated data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["380","302"]},"View options generally correspond to the distillation data types discussed above, and operate under similar principles. View options allow a user to sort order of appearance, determine what to emphasize (e.g., Emphasis Items  option), set minimum and maximum viewable values, for example, set a limit to the total number of dates shown, show only the N most often occurring dates, etc., for data within the result object. Note that one need not set a data type option in order to use a corresponding view option. For example, once can omit date range restrictions on distillation, yet require them to control display.","In one embodiment, a user may select a \u201cLearn from Sample\u201d button  to visually see the effect of selected data types and viewing options. Learn from sample allows a search server to provide a visual tutorial as to the effect of options available to the user, and allow the user to compose complex searches based on perceived results.","In a further embodiment, as discussed above with respect to , executable objects, such JavaBeans or ActiveX controls, may be used to refine or control distillation of search results. If this embodiment, a user may set a viewing preference (not illustrated) indicating such executable objects are to be used in the distillation process.","Continuing again with , once the user has set or accepted default values for search preferences , data types, and setting viewing preferences, the user then submits  search criteria to be searched for within available search domains (e.g., ). In one embodiment, search criteria can be forcibly included or excluded through use of +\/\u2212(or equivalent), causing search results to correspondingly include or not include criteria so designated. In one embodiment, the search server applies date\/time sensitive analysis to adjust the weighting of results priority (unless results are ordered\/alphabetized). For example, a search term of \u201chearts\u201d in February would rank higher valentine's day results.","In another embodiment, a user may enter a natural language query, or non-speech query, such as a search-by-example query for graphics image data. That is, exemplar graphics data can be dragged and dropped into a search box, and the search server locates image files, and performs image analysis (e.g., Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) imaging techniques) to identify results similar to the exemplar.","In one embodiment, a simplified preference setting interface (not shown) is presented to a user, where the simplified interface allows the user to select from several default search and distillation categories, where selection causes various of the above-described options to be set automatically for the user. For example, one category might be \u201cEducator\u201d, another \u201cPharmacist\u201d, or another category might be \u201cHuman Resources.\u201d Alternatively, psychometric measures, for example, an adjective check list, may be used to set these default options. In each case, the four main types of user preferences would be set to default values deemed appropriate for each search category. In this embodiment, the user may select and advanced options page to display and adjust the default values.","After entering the search criteria, the search server performs  a typical search through known domains (), resulting in a list of source documents satisfying designated search criteria. The user can then select  a listed source document, causing it by default to be opened in a separate browser window. Use of the separate window allows maintaining the contents of the search results window. Or, the user selects  a distillation icon  (), which by default is displayed adjacent a source document link  (), where selection causes distillation of the associated search result link  according to the user's set preferences ().","Assuming election to distill a source document, the search server then extracts  (see ) the clicked on source document according to the data types, rules, ranges, and view formats designated in the user's options , , .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","402","404"]},"Also illustrated are \u201cknowledge representation\u201d symbols (or tokens) . In one embodiment, these symbols have associated user perceptible characteristics, such as shape or opacity, which can be used to indicate a result's topic area, concept, document type, and apparent relevance to the search criteria (hereafter generally \u201ctopic area\u201d).","For example, one symbol may represent document age, where a hollow outline indicates an old source document, while a solid symbol means a new or current source document. Or, a symbol may represent the number of words in a source document, or number of pages, where a solid portion of a symbol indicates relative length of the source document. Or, a symbol may be associated verb activity within a source document, so that if a document is lexically analyzed (such as through analysis of verb structures) and determined to be \u201cactive\u201d, then a solid portion of the symbol is used to indicate such activity (perhaps as a ratio relative to the source document's size).","In one embodiment, representation symbols are associated with the searcher's search terms, thus allowing a searcher to evaluate apparent relevance of a search result to a particular topic area based on user perceptible characteristics (e.g., symbol shape, opacity, sound, etc.) of the representation symbols . In one embodiment, a user may also create, edit, or assign representation symbols to results, thus categorizing results as belonging to certain result type categories, e.g., identifying source documents concerning religion, politics, money, legal, medical, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},"A first operation is to identify  all source tags (e.g., HTML, XML, etc.) within a candidate source document, and save the content (values) of the tags into variables determined according to the user's options (). For example, if the user sets an option to receive title information, then if a title is identified within the source document, then the identified title is placed within appropriate (e.g., <TITLE><\/TITLE> XML tags (recall that the result object is, by default, encoded as an XML object).","Regular expression pattern matching rules (e.g., akin to the Unix \u201cgrep\u201d command) are applied  to isolate data elements such as dates, part numbers, etc. of interest to the user. After isolating these data elements, for text based source documents, the source document is reduced into five \u201cdata levels\u201d corresponding to (1) identifying document paragraphs , (2) identifying paragraph sentences , (3) identifying sentence phrases , (4) identifying phrase sub-phrases , and (5) identifying sub-phrase focus words .","Paragraphs are identified  through identification of hard return characters (e.g., ASCII characters , , word processing end of line characters, etc.), manual line breaks, blank lines between blocks of text, and the like. If the source document structured document such as HTML, DHTML, JavaScript, XML, WML, etc., the source document is also processed for indications of paragraph breaks based on punctuation related tags. For example, in an HTML type of source document, the paragraph tags (<P>) or use of a double break tag sequence (<BR><BR>) are treated as defining paragraphs.","Sentences can be identified  by isolating the use of punctuation (e.g., periods, question mark, exclamation point, etc.) to locate ends of sentences. In addition, punctuation usage is compared to exemplars so as to recognize certain types of sentence constructions, such as the salutation \u201cDr\u201d. Identified sentences (or \u201cslugs\u201d of connected text, since not all source documents, such as HTML type sources, follow conventional grammatical structures) can be identified by isolating use of punctuation (e.g., periods, question mark, exclamation point, etc.) to isolate ends of sentences. As with paragraph detection, use punctuation is compared with exemplars. If the source document structured document such as HTML, etc., the source document is processed for a combination of punctuation in combination with sentence ending structure such as single or double line spacing, or punctuation tags such as a break tag (<BR>).","Phrases can be identified  based on punctuation patterns. In one embodiment, phrases are identified as comma delimited portions of identified sentences. Alternatively, lexical analysis tools can be applied to parse the grammatical structure of the source document so as to identify phrases therein.","Sub-phrase focus words can be identified  by parsing phrases into sub-phrases  by comparing identified phrases to a lookup table containing conjugation slugs. (See also parent application Ser. No. 09\/336,020 for focus word extraction techniques.) For example, a partial lookup table might contain a list the following English conjugation phrases:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Entry","Conjugation Slug"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","to the"]},{"entry":[{},"2","to a"]},{"entry":[{},"3","to an"]},{"entry":[{},"4","of the"]},{"entry":[{},"5","of a"]},{"entry":[{},"6","of an"]},{"entry":[{},"7","by the"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"If the search server encounters a conjugation slug, the portion of the phrase preceding the conjugation slug is labeled, and the sub-phrase and identified conjugation slug text is removed from the source document text being inspected, and processing continues with the remaining text to identify other conjugation slugs and associated sub-phrases. In one embodiment, labeling means to store the nidentified sub-phrase in an array, where new entries are entered for each such phrase. It will be appreciated that other data structures may be used to store identified sub-phrases.","After identifying the sub-phrases, the search server submits them to a core extraction process that uses part-of-speech dictionaries, known grammatical structures, dictionaries of controlled-vocabularies specific to a domain (e.g., law, medicine, proper names, historical events, etc.), capitalization-weighting rules, phrase-construction rules, and de-duplication algorithms to identify focus words from the identified sub-phrases. In such fashion, words not appearing to have significance, e.g., not being found in dictionaries or appearing lexically significant through capitalization or other analysis rules, are ignored. Remaining words are deemed focus words for a source document that convey a distilled essence of the source document.","The source document is also processed to generate  an abstract based on identifying paragraphs and key slugs of text based on punctuation patterns, and using position weighting, length limiting, and frequency weighting to identify key sentences in the source document from which to compose an overview abstract of the source document. In addition, the length of the abstract is adjusted according to the sensed  display characteristics of the user's connection device. For example, if it is known that the user is using a mobile device, then a small abstract will be generated.","The source document is also processed to generate  key points. In one embodiment, the search server inspects each sentence and phrase for patterns of use between verbs within the sentences and phrases. To do so, the server first uses known part-of-speech parsers (e.g., the \u201cBrill POS Tagger\u201d by the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, and the Spoken Language Systems Group, Laboratory for Computer Science, MIT) to isolate verbs within a sentence or phrase. Generally, some source document words are recognized immediately as nouns, verbs, etc., while other words require inspection of prefixes, suffixes, infixes, adjacent word occurrence and other syntactic analysis to identify appropriate parts of speech.","Identified verbs are compared to a hierarchy of \u201cverb sequences\u201d which are groupings of verbs arranged in \u201cprocess order\u201d; for example: see\u2192pickup\u2192sniff\u2192taste\u2192chew\u2192swallow\u2192smile. The verb sequences are ranked by \u201clevel of action\u201d where \u201cstate of being\u201d verbs such as \u201care\u201d and \u201cis\u201d may be ranked near or at the top of the hierarchy, followed by verbs sequences of \u201caction towards\u201d, then verbs sequences of \u201cassociation\u201d then verb sequences of \u201ccommunication from,\u201d etc. The hierarchy of verbs, the sort order, and the arrangement of the verb sequences can vary based on context (associated nouns). The verb sequences may be implemented as sorted arrays, lookup tables, or Java vectors, or other structured format allowing for indicating sequences. (For further information regarding verb sequences, see , published by VORT Corporation (1979), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.)","Thus, for example, the server may parse the user's search criteria, or a history of the user's or associated users' search criteria (assume a words based search) and compare the search criteria words to a controlled-vocabulary. In one embodiment, the controlled-vocabulary are the identified focus words (discussed above), and they are used to associate nouns to the search criteria. In an alternate embodiment, an array or hierarchy of context-related (subject-based) nouns are compared and associated.","If associated nouns convey no action, e.g., they are not associated with one or more verb sequences, then only \u201cstate of being\u201d verbs are used in the key point filtering (extraction) process. But, if the nouns convey action, e.g., they are associated with one or more verb sequences, then the verbs in the controlled vocabulary associated with those nouns are used in the key point filtering process. The key point filtering process involves finding which subsets of text (e.g., sentences or phrases) of the distilled result object contain which of these verbs (or verb sequences and patterns) to select and rank those subsets of text as key points. Further, a user may set preferences (not shown) for assigning a priority to verb sequences (action levels); the priority may then be used as part of a calculation to determine which verb and verb sequences are to be applied in the key point filtering process.","Key points can also be generated by matching words from the user's search criteria to the same words in the source document. As a result, matched-in-context key points are created. For example, if the user's search criteria is \u201cventure capital\u201d, matched-in-context key points from a source document comprise:","\u201cMaurice Young Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Research Centre at the Faculty of Commerce, University of British Columbia.\u201d","\u201c . . .

When there is a limit, the search server ranks each sentence or phrase against the verb hierarchy, and cuts off  the number of key points that qualify based on the selected user preference. The search server can also uses this \u201cnumber of key points\u201d metric to determine the average number of key sentences should be included in an abstract.","After the extraction process, the search server has all components, e.g., tag values, regular expression matches, abstract, key points, focus words, and other data types of interest needed to construct a distilled version (e.g., result object) for a source document. In one embodiment, the user is provided with viewing preferences to set a numerical and\/or relative position for the contents of the distilled source document. For example, the user can assign a first, second, third position for desired data, and\/or the user may set relative preferences such that the abstract is above extracted dates (from regular expression matching) but below key points. Fixed and relative position preferences define a constraint system that can be dynamically solved and cause data to be displayed  to a user's connecting device.","In one embodiment, identified focus words are also indexed  within a database of focus words maintained by the search server for storing identified focus words arising from previous searches by the current and other (different) searchers. In such fashion, processing required to identify focus for one user's search may be re-used in other searches by making the results available to other searchers. In addition, such search retention makes available content that may otherwise become unavailable due to the original source document being taken offline from the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"600"},"As discussed above, the illustrated information is stored within a result object that has been created in real-time for a particular document source. It is assumed that such real-time distillation is responsive to clicking on an icon or other trigger associated with search results. Since distillation is in real-time, and can be based on results obtained from a conventional search, rather than the searching techniques disclosed herein, the distillation process can therefore be added to any existing search engine or other application program having access to discrete bodies of source data.","Based on the user's device characteristics, e.g., regular browser window on a computing device, restricted browser environment within a mobile device, the server presents a result object's contents (the distilled data) in an appropriate data format and language (e.g., HTML, WML, XML) to match both the parameters of the user's device and the user's selected viewing options.","Illustrated for example, are a title  that was determined for a selected result, the URL  for the source documents being summarized, and various result regions ,  containing identified data within the source document pursuant to selected search and view preferences.","In particular, the illustrated results provide focus words  which may be selected to adjust the search.","A user may perform context zooming, wherein a user is presented with a data type  (), and obtains a focused entry into the source document by selecting the distilled data type. The distillation process automatically enables context zooming  when distilled data is displayed . A distilled data type can be, for example a key point, an abstract, a matched-in-context key point, or focus word. In one exemplary embodiment, the distillation process automatically creates key points (or other data types) that index , in real-time, into a portion of the source document that surrounds the key point, and displays  that portion of the source document. An index may include a hyperlink to the surrounding text of the source document (where the amount of surrounding text can be set in by the user's preferences), which may be represented by an icon or text, for example, to zoom into the surrounding text. The amount of surrounding text can be determined by the user (such as through user preferences), or determined by the server in accordance with the user's device characteristics.","Context zooming gives users quick access to the full surrounding text of a key point (or selected data type) from a corresponding source document without having to hear or view the full text of the source document. Consequently, users can bypass text that may otherwise be irrelevant, or may scroll to other portions of the text from the surrounding text. For example, users of small, limited screen devices can zoom in on a portion of the source document, where the portion is appropriate for the particular device. In this manner, the user is able to view relevant portions of the source document without having to scroll through the entire document to find relevant text, and without having to be constrained by the size of the source document. Furthermore, context zooming gives a user the advantage of access to a specific portion of a document through a given distilled data type (e.g., a key point, a matched-in-context key point, a site link), without loss of context or content since the user is able to select the distilled data type for access to more detailed information.","In one example, a user is presented with three matched-in-context key points distilled from a source document: As search results are distilled  (, indicating a portion of the distillation process prior to displaying distilled data), each search result can be displayed  (showing distilled data), and can be further processed to be automatically and dynamically grouped  so as to be represented by a mid-menu comprising a list of menu options. A dynamically generated mid-Menu creates a stepping stone that allows a user to analyze the distilled data in summary form. Amongst other applications, mid-menus are useful for limited screen displays, such as cellular telephones. One of the advantages of mid-menus is that they provide users with brief and quick substantive access to a source'document without having to review the full text of the source document, and without having to review all the distilled data. Substantive access provides the user with more than mere data descriptions and titles. Substantive access provides the user with information related to a given source document, where the information is processed and categorized.","Each menu option  on a mid-menu may comprise a result category, and a corresponding content metric. A result category represents a category of data that has been analyzed and comprises results for the particular category of data. A content metric represents a qualitative or quantitative value of the particular category to give the user substantive access to a search result, where a quantitative measure may comprise, for example, the number of appearances for a given result category, or the length of text; and a qualitative measure may comprise, for example, a relative precision rating of a data type. The type of content metric that is displayed depends upon the nature of the given result category. Content metric, whether a qualitative or a quantitative measure, can be represented as a number, an icon, or symbol.","When a result category and corresponding content metric is displayed ,  to the user on the mid-menu, the user may select the menu option . Selecting the menu option  displays the results associated with the result category .","A result category may comprise a data type that represents a source document that is distilled in accordance with a data type constraint associated with the data type. For instance, a key point represents distilled data in accordance with a key sentence (which may be an entire sentence, a portion thereof, or combination with another or other sentences); a focus word represents distilled data in accordance with a conceptually related word; and site link represents distilled data in accordance with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). For example:","1> Key Points (8)","2> Matched-in-Context (6)","3> Focus Words (14)","4> Site Links (4)","5> Full Text (163)","6> Personal Names (9)","7> Patent Issues (12)","8> Back to Results","9> New Search","Options 1-7 are data types. For instance, \u201cKey Points\u201d represents key sentences, which may comprise an entire sentence, portions thereof, or combinations with other sentences, that are distilled from the given search result. The numbers in parenthesis represent the content metric, or the value of the corresponding Key Point. In the example above, the content metrics comprise a quantitative measure, namely, content density which tells a user that there are 6 \u201cKey Points\u201d; 6 \u201cMatched-in-Context\u201d key points; 14 \u201cFocus Words\u201d; 4 \u201cSite Links\u201d; and 163 words in the \u201cFull Text\u201d of the document. In one embodiment, \u201cPersonal Names\u201d and \u201cPatent Issues\u201d represent names and terms, respectively, found in a lookup table, where a corresponding content metric represents the number of occurrences of personal names in the given source document. (In another embodiment, discussed below, \u201cPersonal Names\u201d and \u201cPatent Issues\u201d can be user-defined.)","Alternatively, or conjunctively, a content metric can represent a qualitative measure, such as relevancy or precision, which can be determined by a standard computation linguistic algorithm for precision, frequency, and recall. For example, a result category can be rated for its relative precision to the user's search criteria, where each of the Key Points is rated, and the 6 Key Points are averaged to determine a precision rating for a result category.","Result categories may additionally comprise user-defined types. As illustrated by the following example, when a user defines search-related preferences, the user may also enter data for user-defined types, such as \u201cSiteSnaps\u2122\u201d, \u201cPersonal Names\u201d and \u201cPatent Issues\u201d sections.","1> SiteSnaps\u2122 (6)","2> Matched-in-Context (6)","3> Personal Names (9)","4> Patent Issues (12)","5> Full Text (163)","6> Back to Results","7> New Search","User-defined types refer to any type of data grouping that is useful to the user, but which does not fall into the category of a data type. For example, a user can create a category called \u201cSiteSnaps\u2122\u201d and define it so that it finds a full range of data types, or it finds data types listed by the user. The user can then define its corresponding content metric so that it represents the number of different data types that are returned by a given search (as opposed to how many data types are selected by the user in the user's preferences).","\u201cPersonal Names\u201d, rather than being a data type, can be defined by the user to search for a name (or names) entered by the user such that the mid-menu determines how many occurrences of the name (or names) occur within all data types selected by the user. Similarly, a \u201cPatent Issues\u201d category can be created to search for a term (or terms) entered by the user, where the term is (or terms are) related to patent issues, for example, and the mid-menu displays the number of occurrences of the term (or terms) in the data types selected by the user. These user-defined types are exemplary, are not exclusive, and may encompass many other types not discussed herein.","A menu option may also comprise a predefined menu option, as shown by options 8 and 9, and 6 and 7, respectively, on the sample menus above, which represent predefined menu options for navigating the menu.","Furthermore, mid-menus can be based on user preferences, where a user can determine the menu options that are displayed on the mid-menu, in one example, or a server can automatically determine the mid-menu options based on user preferences. When the mid-menu is dynamically and automatically generated, those menu options are automatically displayed.","\u201cMaurice Young Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Research Centre at the Faculty of Commerce, University of British Columbia.\u201d","\u201c . . .
