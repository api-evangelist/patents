{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF INVENTION","SUMMARY OF INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["New brokerage account creation within the financial services industry is a critical function. Current account opening procedures are found to be lacking in that there are multiple redundant activities, quality control issues, and customer satisfaction issues related to account opening cycle time that need to be addressed. New account opening procedures generally rely heavily on manual intake of data that is then transferred (typically by fax) to another department for data entry into the financial institution's computer system. This process breeds documentation errors, incomplete documents, and extensive paper handling that result in delays and communication errors that adversely affect new account setup.","What is needed is an automated on-line system and methodology that reduces account opening cycle time and data errors.","Embodiments of the present invention provide an on-line web based computerized system for creating a new brokerage account. A new account wizard software component guides a user through a series of data collection procedures using a rules based engine to facilitate data collection processing according to a plurality of data collection rules that are stored in a database. The user is presented with required and optional items of data to be collected based on previous data entries into the new account wizard until all requisite data has been collected. A workflow management software component manages data transfers, notifications, and delegates task assignments during creation of the new brokerage account using a rules based engine working in conjunction with a database of workflow rules and assignment rules to determine task assignments and data transfer destinations. There is also an application programming interface layer software component for interfacing data transfers between the workflow management software component and external software components.","It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the example embodiments disclosed. It should also be understood that not every feature of the methods and systems described is necessary to implement the invention as claimed in any one of the appended claims. Also, throughout this disclosure, where a process or method is shown or described, the steps of the method may be performed in any order or simultaneously, unless it is clear from the context that one step depends on another being performed first. Additionally, there can be significant time lag between steps. With respect to flow charts, block diagrams, and flow diagrams, not every possible signal flow, data path or process block is shown. Rather, for clarity, only those important to the inventive concepts being discussed relative to the drawing may be illustrated, although others may be discussed.","It should be understood that terms like \u201cbank,\u201d \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d and just \u201cinstitution\u201d are used herein in their broadest sense. Terms like bank and financial institution are intended to encompass all such possibilities, including but not limited to, finance companies, stock brokerages, credit unions, mortgage companies, manufacturers who grant loans to secure the purchase of goods, finance companies, computer companies, etc. Additionally, disclosed embodiments may suggest or illustrate the use of agencies or contractors external to the financial institution to perform some of the calculations and data repository services. These illustrations are examples only, and an institution or business can implement the entire invention on their own computer systems or even a single work station if appropriate databases are present and can be accessed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The bank's intranet\/network  serves as the center for all activity. The intranet\/network  physically connects a collection of computer servers - that host various software applications - and databases -. In addition, the intranet supports a plurality of workstations - that can access the various servers, software programs, and databases.","For ease of illustration and description, many of the servers illustrated in  have been individually labeled to describe the functions they perform. This is not a requirement as multiple different software programs can be resident within a single server. In addition, the entire network has not been shown in . There are many additional items of hardware and software that run on the network that do not have a direct impact on the present invention. One example would be print servers.","There is shown a network security server  that is responsible for ensuring that only authorized users can access the network and its contents via a network security application . A central associate information system (CAIS) server  is responsible for storing the access privileges and permissions for each network user  with respect to each network resource including software programs. There is also a new account opening server  that hosts the software and supporting databases of the present invention . An e-mail server  is utilized to manage the automated e-mail requirements  of the present invention . A document imaging server  is utilized to manage the document imaging requirements  of various software programs including the present invention. A customer relationship server  hosts customer relationship software and data  that can be accessed and used during new account setup to obtain personal information for an applicant that may currently exist in the system such as legal name, address, taxpayer ID, and the like. An investment account creation server  that is outside of network  creates and maintains custody of new accounts. An account data server  contains reporting data for investment customers that the present invention updates when necessary.","The present embodiment of the invention is comprised of software defining a methodology that is hosted by the new account opening server . The contents of server  are described in the call out box  and include a new account opening program wizard  that accesses wizard rules database , a workflow management system  that accesses workflow rules  and assignment rules  databases, and an application program interface layer  for communicating with other software programs on the network. Although the software is represented by a callout box , it should be noted that any or all software used in implementing the present invention can be stored on a media such as a computer program product.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"Each process is briefly introduced and will be described in greater detail with reference to subsequent figures. The first process illustrated is a general login procedure  used by bank employees to access, via a workstation, the bank's corporate intranet that hosts the hardware, software, storage media, etc . . . that comprise the bank's computer network. The software includes the new account opening program that is the subject of the present invention. The next procedure is a specific authorization procedure  that enables the user to access and execute all or a portion of the new account opening program based on that user's individual entitlements as defined by the network administrator. Once the user has launched the new account opening program, the first process of the new account opening program is a data collection process . Data collection  is followed by Principal review  in which an authorized manager reviews the data collected by the submitting user and either accepts or rejects the account application on its merits. If an application passes Principal review, the next step is to create the new account . There is also a document tracking procedure  that is responsible for maintaining a record of new account documents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["210","310","320"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["220","320","420"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","520","530","540","540","550","560","570"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["610","620","250","630"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"710"},"If the account data is not API eligible, the account information is forwarded via the workflow management system  to an operations account entry inbox . Operations account entry refers to a functional group of individuals that are responsible for manually creating an account that cannot be created automatically by the account creation program. In such cases the new account will be manually created using the data that was included . If the account data is API eligible then the account creation program will automatically create the account in the bank' system . At this point a check is performed to determine whether additional updates are required for account completion. If so, the workflow management system will notify a user within a group responsible for updating accounts and forward the new account information to such user . The user then manually updates and links the new brokerage account appropriately .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["260","810","820","830","850","250","850","840"]},"The foregoing describes each of the components that comprise the present invention. What follows now is a description of an example new account opening using  as a reference.","A junior level front office employee will log-in to the bank's intranet computer network  via a user workstation . For ease of description, this person will be referred to as a junior user. The junior user will complete the network login via server  and network security server programs . Once logged in to the network , the junior user will navigate the operating system to locate the \u201cnew account opening\u201d main software program  which resides on server . Upon launching the \u201cnew account opening\u201d main software program  the junior user's identity will be processed by the central associate information system (CAIS) software programs  that reside on server . The CAIS programs  process the junior user's ID and apply a set of privileges or entitlements to that the junior user has while working within the new account opening program .","The junior user is now ready to execute the new account wizard component  of the new account opening program . The new account wizard  guides the junior user through a plurality of data collection procedures. The new account wizard  utilizes a rules based engine to facilitate data collection processing according to a plurality of data collection rules that are stored in a database . The wizard presents data fields to the junior user via a series of electronic data collection forms. Each time the junior user enters a piece of data, the rules engine processes it and dynamically adjusts to present the next required piece of data. Certain previous data entries may eliminate the need to enter other data. In such cases the rules engine will shade out or remove those entries such that the user is only presented with items of data that need to be collected based. This continues until all requisite data has been collected.","The new account opening program is controlled or managed by a workflow management component . The workflow management component utilizes a database of workflow rules  and assignment rules  to provide logistical support for the new account opening program. Logistical support includes routing or delegating tasks to appropriate personnel such that the new account application is efficiently moved along and not allowed to languish unattended. The workflow management component  is also the gateway between the new account opening program  and external programs that depend on the data generated by the new account opening program . To facilitate interaction with external components an application interface layer  comprising a plurality of application programming interfaces (APIs) is part of the new account opening program . The term \u201capplication\u201d when used in conjunction with \u201cinterface\u201d refers to software. In all other instances the term \u201capplication\u201d refers to an \u201caccount application\u201d.","At the conclusion of data collection, the junior user will forward the collected data and any ancillary documentation for Principal review. Principal review means that a more senior level employee will review the data and decide whether to accept or reject the new account application. The data is forwarded with an assist from the workflow management component . The junior user completes the activity and the workflow management component  assigns the task to an available Principal reviewer. The workflow management component  in conjunction with its associated workflow rules database  and assignment rules database  will automatically assign a Principal to review the account application data and place the requisite data in their \u201celectronic inbox\u201d  and will send automated e-mail notifications using e-mail programs .","The Principal will manually conduct a review of the data and either accept or reject the application. A rejection will cause the workflow management component to return the data to the submitting junior user for correction or further action. An acceptance invokes the \u201caccount creation\u201d stage of the new account opening program .","To actually create the new account, the workflow management component  via application interface layer  presents the data to an external component whose task is to create the account based on the supplied data. If the account application has been approved but the data is not API eligible or validation or connectivity errors occur, the workflow management component  will route the data and assign the task of creating the account manually to the appropriate personnel. If the account data is application programming interface (API) eligible and no validation or connectivity errors occur the account will automatically be created by the appropriate external component. Once the account has been created a subsequent check is made to determine if additional updates or information need to be applied to the new account. If so, the workflow management component  will forward the account and assign the task of manually updating the account to the appropriate personnel.","As previously discussed, it should be noted that computer program code in the form of various computer program instructions can be used to implement at least portions of the processes involved in carrying out embodiments of the invention. Such computer program code can be supplied via a computer program product containing all or a portion of the computer program instructions stored on a media. The media may be fixed, or removable. Such a media could be a fixed storage media, but it could just as easily be a removable optical or magnetic disc or tape. The computer program instructions can reside on any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport computer program code for execution by any type of computing platform, instruction execution system, or collection of such systems interconnected via a buss or network. Such a computer readable medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system or device.","Computer program instructions which implement all or a portion of the invention may also be embodied in a stream of information being retrieved over a network such as the Internet. Note that the computer usable or computer readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which computer program code is printed, as the code can be electronically captured via, for instance, an optical scan, then compiled and interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner.","Specific embodiments of an invention are disclosed herein. One of ordinary skill in the computing and financial arts will quickly recognize that the invention has other applications in other environments. Many embodiments are possible. The following claims are in no way intended to limit the scope of the invention to the specific embodiments described above."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
