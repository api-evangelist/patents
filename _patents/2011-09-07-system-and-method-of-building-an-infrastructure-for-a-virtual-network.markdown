title: System and method of building an infrastructure for a virtual network
abstract: A network resource module communicatively interfaces a resource manager with one or more network nodes in a communications network. Each network node provides one or more network resources that may be used to create a virtual infrastructure for a virtual network. The network resource module detects the network nodes, abstracts the resources associated with the network nodes at a desired granularity (e.g., node level or flow level) into Virtual Resource Objects (VROs), and then publishes the VROs in a registry. Thereafter, Virtual Network Operators (VROs) select desired VROs from the registry to build the virtual infrastructure for the virtual network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to communication networks, and specifically to adapting Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) management middleware to communicate with the network nodes of a communications network.","\u201cThe Cloud\u201d generally refers to the on-demand computational resources that are available to a user via a computing network such as the Internet. Cloud computing increases the capacity and computational abilities for a user while relieving them of the responsibilities and costs associated with the installation and maintenance of the resources. These benefits stem from the fact that the resources comprising \u201cthe Cloud\u201d (e.g., hardware, software, and infrastructure) are web-based and not resident on the user's computing device.","A \u201cTelco-Cloud\u201d is similar to the Cloud, only it refers to the resources in a communications network, such as a 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) Evolved Packet Core (EPC) network architecture, and has its own set of unique requirements. For example, a TelcoCloud must have a 99.999% availability rate. With a Telco-Cloud, providers own and maintain the resources in the network. However, other providers that do not own the resources may still offer services that use those resources. Virtual Network Operators (VNOs), for example, can purchase or rent the use of some or all of the resources from the providers that own the resources, and offer their customers services that utilize those resources. This arrangement allows the VNOs to provide their services without having the costs and issues associated with owning the physical network.","There are three main service areas of interest for VNOs. These are Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Briefly, SaaS, which is often referred to as \u201con-demand software,\u201d is a software delivery model. With SaaS, software and its associated data are centrally hosted on one or more network nodes in the Telco-Cloud. Users can access the software using, for example, a browser application. The PaaS is the delivery of the resources associated with a computing platform. Typically, PaaS resources include, but are not limited to, facilities for application design, application development, application testing, security, database integration, storage, and the like. Generally, PaaS-related resources are provisioned as an integrated solution and offered to customers. The final service area is the IaaS. With IaaS, the owning provider \u201coutsources\u201d the network nodes and resources of its communication network. The owning provider maintains the responsibility for running, managing, and maintaining the network nodes and resources, while the customers that use them (e.g., the VNOs) pay the owners on a predetermined basis.","With a special emphasis on the IaaS, it is often difficult for VNOs to create their respective networks using the network resources. For example, consider the network architecture for a 3GPP LTE-EPC communications network. In such networks, Policy and Charging Control (PCC) nodes are required to manage the Quality of Service (QoS) for the entire system. It is often desirable to provide network resources at varying levels of granularity. For example, it might be helpful to provide bandwidth resources at both a link level and a flow level, and allow the VNOs to select the resources that are right for their respective networks. However, the ability to provide this to the VNOs is hampered. Particularly, the PCC entities in the 3GPP LTE-EPC network are not able to communicate with some of the components outside of the network, which makes it difficult to identify available resources to a VNO.","The present invention provides a system and method for allowing one or more virtual network operators (VNOs) to build and maintain a virtual network independently of each other. However, each virtual network that is created shares the same network resources of a physical communications network. The present invention is particularly useful for extending present day Infrastructure-as-a-Service functions to LTE-EPC communication networks.","In one embodiment, a network resource module is disposed between the network nodes of an LTE-EPC network and an IaaS middleware manager, such as a resource manager, for example. The network resource module comprises a communication interface that facilitates the communication of messages and signals between the resource manager and one or more network nodes in the LTE-EPC network. The network resource module also comprises a controller. In one embodiment of the present invention, the controller is configured to detect one or more network nodes present in the LTE-EPC network, and abstract the resources associated with those network nodes into corresponding Virtual Resource Objects (VROs). The VROs define the resources offered by the network nodes, and are published in a registry for discovery by a Virtual Network Operator (VNO) creating a virtual infrastructure for a virtual network.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a client node for creating a virtual infrastructure for a virtual network using the VROs. In this embodiment, the client node comprises a communication interface that connects the client node to a registry identifying one or more Virtual Resource Objects (VROs). As stated previously, each VRO represents the resources associated with the network nodes and\/or other network elements used to build and maintain the virtual infrastructure. The client node also comprises a programmable controller. In operation, the controller selects one or more desired VROs from the registry to include in a virtual container, and instantiates the VROs in the container to instantiate the virtual infrastructure for the virtual network.","The present invention provides a variety of advantages not realized by conventional systems. For example, the present invention extends the virtual LTC-EPC to existing data centers, and makes the PCC nodes in the network compatible with the Cloud Offering using IaaS middleware. Additionally, the present invention provides more granular control of the network resources for the creation and enforcement of policies, as well as Quality of Service (QoS) management. Further, the present invention enables new resources to be published and used by the VNOs much faster than in conventional systems.","Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to the above contexts or examples, and will recognize additional features and advantages upon reading the following detailed description and upon viewing the accompanying drawings.","The present invention provides a system and method for extending the services offered by present-day Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solutions to the Long Term Evolution-Evolved Packet Core (LTE-EPC) infrastructure. More particularly, the present invention abstracts the resources provided by one or more network nodes or other elements of an LTE-EPC network into Virtual Resource Objects (VROs). Different network operators are then able to utilize these VROs to build and maintain a virtual network. Thus, the present invention allows multiple network operators to create independent networks using the same network resources.","One embodiment of the present invention provides a Network Resource module that communicatively connects the IaaS management controller and the Policy, Charging, and Control (PCC) nodes within the LTE-EPC infrastructure. Such PCC nodes include, for example, a Home Subscriber Server (HSS), Service-Aware Support Node (SASN), a Packet Data Network-Gateway (PDN-GW), a Policy and Charges Rule Function (PCRF), and a Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF). The Network Resource module abstracts the resources provided by the PCC nodes into a context that is known to the IaaS management controller. The management controller then publishes these abstractions (i.e., the VROs) in a registry accessible to the network operators for use in building and maintaining their virtual communications networks.","Turning to the drawings,  illustrates an exemplary architecture for a Long Term Evolution\u2014System Architecture Evolution (LTE-SAE) network  suitable for use in one embodiment of the present invention. These networks and their operations are well-known in the art, and thus, only a brief discussion of network  and its components is included herein for clarity. For more specific information regarding the architecture and functionality of network , the interested reader is referred to the 3GPP description document entitled, \u201cOverview of 3GPP Release 10 V0.1.0 (2011 April),\u201d dated April, 2011. This document, and its contents, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The LTE-SAE network  has a flat, IP-based architecture comprising an LTE-based Radio Access Network (RAN)  interconnected with an EPC network . As is known in the art, the components in the LTE-SAE network  communicate both user data and signaling along separate paths or links (i.e., the data plane and the control plane, respectively). In , solid lines are used to indicate the bi-directional user data paths in the data plane, while dashed lines are used to indicate bi-directional signaling paths in the control plane. Generally, one or more user terminals  (e.g., cellular telephones) utilize the RAN  to gain access to services and functions offered by the EPC , as well as by other networks (e.g., the Internet\u2014not shown) connected to the EPC . The EPC  provides the core functionality for both circuit switched (CS) services and packet switched (PS) services.","The user terminals  communicate over an air interface (A) with one or more eNodeBs , which are access points into the EPC . As is known in the art, the eNodeBs  are disposed in a flat architecture and perform a variety of communication functions. These functions include, but are not limited to, modulation\/de-modulation of the radio signals communicated with the user terminals , channel coding\/de-coding, mobility management (e.g., measurement and handover processing), and some Radio Resource Control (RRC) functions (e.g, allocation, modification, and release of the resources facilitating transmission over the air interface (A)). The eNodeBs  also include the capability to transfer data to\/from other devices or nodes in the LTE-SAE network .","The EPC  comprises a Service Gateway (S-GW) , a Mobility Management Entity (MME) , a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) , a Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW) , a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) , and a Service Aware Support Node (SASN) .","The S-GW  is connected to the eNodeBs  via corresponding data paths, and provides communicatively connects the RAN  and the EPC . The S-GW  also maintains a data path with the PDN-GW . Functionally, the S-GW  provides an ingress\/egress point between the RAN  and the EPC , and serves as a local mobility anchor for user terminals  move across the eNodeB  coverage areas.","The MME  is a control plane entity that performs the signaling and control functions used to manage access by the user terminals  to the EPC network . More specifically, the MME  controls the assignment of network resources, supports tracking, paging, roaming and handovers, and controls all control plane functions related to subscriber and session management. The MME  is also configured to perform various bearer management control functions to establish one or more bearer paths used by the user terminals  and eNodeBs  to communicate data and signaling traffic. In addition, the MME  is configured to support other functions such as security procedures (e.g., end-user authentication, session initiation, the negotiation of algorithms for ciphering and integrity protection) and terminal-to-network session handling (e.g., all signaling used to set up a packet data context and negotiate a desired Quality of Service (QoS)). As seen in , the MME  is communicatively connected to the eNodeBs , the S-GW , and the HSS  via corresponding signaling links.","The HSS  comprises a central database for storing information associated with the user terminals  and connects to the MME  and the PCRF  via signaling links. In this embodiment, the HSS  is configured to support functionalities such as mobility management, call and session establishment support, and user authentication and access authorization.","The PDN-GW  is similar to the S-GW  in that it serves as a termination\/anchor point of the packet data interface towards one or more Packet Data Networks (PDNs). In its role as an anchor point, the PDN-GW  supports features and functions such as policy enforcement (e.g., operator-defined rules for resource allocation and usage), packet filtering (e.g., packet inspection), and charging support. In , the PDN-GW  communicates user data with the S-GW  and the SASN  in the data plane over corresponding data paths.","The PCRF  is a network node residing in the control plane that helps to optimize the interactions that occur between the various policy and rules functions. In one embodiment, the PCRF  is configured to support various policy decision functions. For example, the PCRF  can access subscriber databases and charging systems, support the creation of rules and policies on a per-user and\/or per-group basis, control access to premium content, control access to features based on accumulated usage, and optimize network resource utilization by applying Quality of Service (QoS) control.","Finally, the SASN  is a tool residing in the data plane that allows network operators to inspect traffic flows in multi-vendor and multi-access networks. Together with the PDN-GW , the SASN  may support policy enforcement features. As seen in , the SASN  receives data packets from the PDN-GW  over a user data connection, and signaling data from the PCRF  over a signaling connection. Based on an inspection of the packets, the SASN  provides network operators, in real-time, with a greater control of the resource allocation. More specifically, when implemented together with the PCRF , the SASN  allows the network operators to manage and optimize the utilization of one or more network resources based on deep-packet inspection, and enables the identification of virtually any type of application.","As stated previously, the present invention abstracts the resources provided by one or more network nodes of an LTE-EPC network into Virtual Resource Objects (VROs). Different network operators, which are not necessarily the same operators that own or maintain the network nodes, are then able to build and maintain a virtual network using these VROs. This approach allows the costs of building and maintaining an LTE-EPC network to be shared across multiple operators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","52","54","56","58"]},"The resource manager  is the IaaS management middleware, and is controlled by the owner(s) and operator(s) of the LTE-SAE network  via one or more computing devices at the resource management center . In operation, the resource manager  is responsible for receiving the abstractions describing the resources provided by the network nodes, and publishing those abstractions (i.e., the VROs) to a public registry, represented by registry . The resource manager  may publish the VROs in any known context; however, in one embodiment, which is seen in , the available VROs are described as generic class definitions in one or more files using eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and sent to the registry  using, for example, XML Metadata Interchange (XMI).","The resource manager  is not typically configured to communicate with the network nodes  (e.g., the S-GW , MME , HSS , PDN-GW , PCRF , and the SASN ). Therefore, according to the present invention, the network resource module  is disposed between the resource manager  and the network nodes . As seen in , the network resource module  comprises an independent computing device, such as a server, for example. However, this is for clarity and illustrative purposes only. In another embodiment, the network resource manager  comprises a software module executing on another computing device, such as the resource manager . In other embodiments, the network resource module comprises a plug-in executing on one or more of the network nodes .","Regardless of positioning, the network resource module  functions as an intermediary between the IaaS middleware executing on the resource manager  and the network nodes . That is, the network resource module  is configured to detect or sense the different network nodes  in the LTE-SAE network , by exchanging messages with the controllers of these network nodes, for example, and then abstracting the resources provided by those network nodes  into a context that is understood by the resource manager  (i.e., the VROs). For example, as seen in , the network resource module  in one embodiment abstracts the network resources into one or more classes using XML. The network resource module  then sends the abstracted resource descriptions to the resource manager  for publishing as VROs in the registry .","It should be understood that detecting the network nodes  may be accomplished using any method known in the art. In one embodiment, for example, the network resource module  exchanges messages with the controllers of each of the network nodes . The messaging, which may be initiated by the particular network nodes  in the LTE-SAE network  or by the network resource module , carries information describing the resources they offer for consumption by the VNOs from the network nodes . Upon receipt, the network resource module  generates the VROs by abstracting the received information into one or more classes in an XML file, and sends the resultant XML file to the resource manager .","In another embodiment, the owner(s)\/operator(s) of the LTE-SAE network  initially provisions the resource manager  with the resources provided by each network nodes  via the resource management center . Then, as each network node  is detected in the network , it exchanges messages with the network resource module . The network resource module , in turn, notifies the resource manager , which then generates the appropriate VROs from the provisioned information.","The registry , as stated above, is a public registry that receives the VROs from the resource manager  and stores them for consumption by one or more Virtual Network Operators (VNOs). More specifically, a given VNO client node  communicatively connects to the registry  via the resource manager . Using the client node , the VNO can select one or more desired VROs to use in building and maintaining a virtual network. For example, the VNO may wish to build a virtual network having a certain amount of bandwidth, or that provides subscribers with certain functionality. Using the client node , the VNO can browse the available VROs stored in the registry , and select those that match the specific VNO requirements.","In some embodiments, a resource discovery service  may be utilized by the VNO to automatically search for specific resources that would match the VNO requirements. Particularly, the VNO could identify specific requirements and\/or needs for building a virtual network to the resource discovery service . The resource discovery service  would then periodically search the registry  and, upon finding one or more VROs sufficient to satisfy the stated requirements, notify the VNO who would then select the appropriate VROs from the registry .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["70","56","10","50","10","72","10","22","32","34","36","38","40","42","50"]},"Once the resource manager  receives the information from the resource management center , the resource manager  executes a software program that converts the received information into one or more VROs in an XML-based file (box ), and stores it in a memory. Then, when the network resource module  detects or senses the presence of a network node  (line ), it sends a notification to the resource manager  (line ). The resource manager  may then read the saved VROs from its memory, and publish those VROs to registry  for consumption by the VNOs (line ). For example, the resource manager  may send the XML-based file containing the VROs to the registry  using the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI).

In this embodiment, the VNO has access to the resource discovery service , and identifies one or more desired resources to the service  (line ). The discovery service  then queries the registry  to determine if the VNOs desired resources are available (line ). The registry responds with an answer as to whether the VROs associated with the desired resources are available (line ), which the discovery service  passes back to the client  (line ). The answer may be, for example, an ACK\/NACK, or it may be an indicator that identifies specific resources listed on a display of the client node  as being available\/not available.","The VNO, via the client node , can then query the registry  to obtain the desired VROs. Particularly, the client node  queries the resource manager  with a message identifying the selected VROs (line ). The resource manager then generates a request to retrieve those selected VROs and sends the request to the registry (line ). If available, the registry  sends the selected VROs back to the resource manager  (line ), which then returns the VROs to the client device  for inclusion in the VNOs virtual container (line ).","Once the VNO has received the VROs for the desired resources, the VNO can utilize a Graphical User Interface (GUI) displayed at the client node  to configure and instantiate the selected VROs that will create the virtual network (box ). By way of example, consider a VNO that has selected HSS , PCRF , SASN , and PDN-GW  resources. In one embodiment, the HSS  resources represent a User Profile Database. To configure and instantiate the HSS , the VNO may, for example, add one or more user terminals  to the HSS . While in operation, the VNO can also remove the one or more user terminals from the HSS .","The VNO may also provide static and dynamic rules and policies to the PCRF , in addition to any rules and policies that might be delivered with the default virtual container. Other functions the VNO may perform to instantiate and configure the selected VROs is to identify certain services that it will provide (e.g., traffic types web services, web services bindings to other applications, packet inspection services, and other 3GPP services, etc.) to the PDN-GW , and determine and create the different Quality of Service (QoS) profiles that the PDN-GW will have to support (e.g., bandwidth throttling, packet dropping, user profile classes, etc.).","Once configured, the VNO instantiates a test virtual network to test the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d of the virtual network (box ). Particularly, the VNO tests a plurality of user terminals  under congested conditions with the rules and policies that have been defined, and within any bandwidth constraints applied. This \u201cvirtual test network\u201d can be used by the VNO to ensure that the virtual network will operate properly under defined conditions without interfering with the operation of another VNO's virtual network. Once the virtual network has been tested satisfactorily, the network is deployed for actual use by the VNO (line ). Thereafter, the registry  will, from time-to-time, include new VROs that the VNO is free to use to alter and\/or maintain the virtual network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["170","170","58","172","58","174","176","178","180","58","182","184","186","188"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["52","52","52","190","192","196","52","50","60"]},"The programmable controller  may comprise one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, hardware circuits, and\/or a combination thereof, configured to execute the instructions and logic  used to detect or sense the network nodes , as well as to communicate with the resource manager  and the controllers associated with the network nodes .

Further, the programmable controller  can determine the type of network node providing the resource information, and adapt the abstraction of the network resource information based on the determined network node type.
