Technical Field","The present invention relates to a polyamic acid composition, a polyimide endless belt, and an image forming apparatus.","2. Related Art","In an image forming apparatus of an electrophotographic system, an electrical charge is generated on an image holder which is a photoconductive photoreceptor containing an inorganic or organic material, an electrostatic latent image is formed by, for example, a laser beam according to a modulated image signal, and the electrostatic latent image is developed with an electrically charged toner so as to form a visual toner image. Then, a desired reproduction image is obtained by electrostatically transferring the toner image to a recording medium, such as a recording paper, directly or via an intermediate transfer member. In particular, an image forming apparatus is known which adopts a system in which a toner image formed on an image holder is transferred to an intermediate transfer member (primary transfer), and the toner image is further transferred from the intermediate transfer member to a recording paper (secondary transfer).","Materials for use in image forming apparatuses of the intermediate transfer member system include a conductive endless belt containing a thermoplastic resin (such as polycarbonate resin or PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride)) and an elastic belt containing a reinforcing material having a woven fabric, such as polyester, and an elastic member disposed in layers.","According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a polyamic acid composition containing:","a conductive carbon black; and","a polyamic acid in which a diamine compound, a tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, and an acid monoanhydride have been reacted at a quantitative ratio satisfying the following Relational Expression (1) and Relational Expression (2):\n\n0.962\u2266\u22660.997\u2003\u2003Relational Expression (1)\n\n0.20\u22662()<0.80\u2003\u2003Relational Expression (2)\n","wherein, in Relational Expressions (1) and (2), X represents a content by mol of the diamine compound, Y represents a content by mol of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, and Z represents a content by mol of the acid monoanhydride.","Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments will be described in more detail.","<First Exemplary Embodiment:Polyamic Acid Composition>","A polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment contains: a polyamic acid in which a diamine compound, a tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, and an acid monoanhydride have been reacted at a quantitative ratio satisfying Relational Expression (1) and Relational Expression (2);\n\n0.962\u2266\u22660.997\u2003\u2003Relational Expression (1)\n\n0.20\u22662()<0.80, and\u2003\u2003Relational Expression (2)\n","a conductive carbon black.","In Relational Expressions (1) and (2), X represents the content by mol of the diamine compound, Y represents the content by mol of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride, and Z represents the content by mol of the acid monoanhydride.","Conventionally, when the conductive carbon black is contained in a polyamic acid composition, there have been problems in that viscosity increases over time and chemical stability and thermal stability are poor. As a result, ease in operation sometimes remarkably lowers when subjected to a subsequent processing, for example an application process for belt production. When a polyimide endless belt is produced using the polyamic acid composition, there have been a problem in that the strength, especially folding endurance, of the belt decreases.","In contrast, the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment addresses the above-described problems, and contains the conductive carbon black and the polyamic acid in which ingredients have been reacted at a quantitative ratio satisfying Relational expression (1) and Relational expression (2).","Although the mechanism with which the above-described problems are solved is not very clear, it is supposed to be as described below.","First, the acid monoanhydride is a substance which functions as an terminal blocking agent that blocks an amino terminal group which can serve as a polymerization chain terminal of a polyamic acid obtained by polymerizing the diamine compound and the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride. Accordingly, it is considered that, in the polyamic acid in which the ingredients have been reacted at a quantitative ratio satisfying Relational Expression (1) and Relational Expression (2), amino terminal groups present at polymerization chain terminals are blocked in a proportion of 20% or more but less than 80%. Here, it is considered that, when the quantitative ratio is in the above-mentioned range (i.e., 0.20\u2266Z\/2(X\u2212Y)<0.80), the amino terminal groups present at the polymerization chain terminals of the polyamic acid react with a surface of the conductive carbon black to form a favorable interface layer.","Next, each component for use in the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment will be described in detail.","Polyamic Acid","The polyamic acid for use in the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited insofar as it is obtained by a reaction of raw materials in the above-mentioned quantitative ratio. A known polyamic acid may be used. The main molecular skeleton of a polyamic acid can be represented by Formula (I), for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.61mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09052654-20150609-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In Formula (1), R represents a divalent aromatic residue or a divalent aliphatic residue, R\u2032 represents a tetravalent aromatic residue or a tetravalent aliphatic residue, n represents a positive number, R\u2033 represents a terminal of a molecule, and is selected from hydrogen or an organic group formed by the acid monoanhydride, and the organic group except the hydrogen satisfies the relationship, 0.20\u2266Z\/2(X\u2212Y)<0.80.","More specifically, examples of R include the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"116.67mm","wi":"75.69mm","file":"US09052654-20150609-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Examples o R\u2032 include the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"174.24mm","wi":"63.25mm","file":"US09052654-20150609-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Examples of R\u2033 include, in addition to hydrogen, the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"44.11mm","wi":"62.65mm","file":"US09052654-20150609-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The scope of R\u2033 also include a known structure in which some of the hydrogen atoms of any of the above aromatic residues or aliphatic residues are substituted with a substituent such as an alkyl group or a hydroxyl group.

The reprecipitated matter is put in a pressure-proof bottle. Then, a 1N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added, and the resultant is treated at 100\u00b0 C. for 2 hours to obtain a hydrolysate of the polyamic acid. Next, the hydrolysate is subjected to extraction using chloroform. Then, a concentrate of the chloroform phase is analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a gas chromatography method to identify the structure and the amount of the diamine component (derived from the diamine compound). Separately, the aqueous phase, which is a chloroform-insoluble phase of the above hydrolysate, is neutralized, and freeze-dried to obtain a dry solid substance. The dry solid substance is subjected to extraction using methanol. Then, the dissolved substance is analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and a gas chromatography method to thereby identify the structure and the amount of the carboxylic acid component (derived from the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and the acid monoanhydride).","The analysis method described above is used to determine whether or not polyamic acids described in the present specification satisfy Relational Expression (1) and Relational Expression (2).","A polyamic acid used in the first exemplary embodiment has an imidization ratio obtained by the following IR method of preferably from 0.0% to 25.0%, more preferably from 0.0% to 15.0%, and most preferably from 0.0% to 10.0%, from the viewpoints of improved processability in a subsequent application process and improved appearance of a formed polyimide film.","The imidization ratio according to the IR method is measured by the following method. All of the imidization ratio values described in this specification are the values measured by the following method.\n\n","When the polyamic acid is in the form of a solid, the imidization ratio can be determined by similar measurement using KBr powder.","In general, it is said that, in polyamic acid, dehydration between an amide bond site and a carboxyl group therein, which is an imidization reaction, sequentially occurs. When the imidization reaction occurs, an imide closed-ring structure is formed and impedes the movement of molecules. As a result, it is expected that the fluidity as a solution decreases. In the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment, the imidization ratio is adjusted to the above-mentioned preferable range, whereby the fluidity and processability of the polyamic acid may be improved and a polyimide film having a favorable appearance may be obtained.","In general, an imidization reaction of polyamic acid very rapidly proceeds with heat or the like, which makes it difficult to measure a true imidization ratio of the polyamic acid itself. In contrast, the above-described method of measuring an imidization ratio of polyamic acid is a superior method addressing such difficulty.","The molecular weight of the polyamic acid of the first exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited. In Formula (I), n is preferably from 1 to 1,000, more preferably from 10 to 500, and most preferably from 30 to 300.","The unit number n of the polyamic acid can be determined by:","obtaining the weight average molecular weight of the polyamic acid by the GPC method described below;","calculating the molecular weight per unit by summing up the molecular weight per mol of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride as a raw material for the polyamic acid and the molecular weight per mol of the diamine as another raw material for the polyamic acid; and","dividing the weight average molecular weight of the polyamic acid by the total molecular weight per unit.","As an example of the GPC (Gel Permeation Chromatography) method, measurement is performed using HLS-8120GPC (Column: TSKgel series) manufactured by TOSOH CORP. as an instrument and N-methylpyrrolidone (to which 1 mM lithium bromide and 1 mM phosphoric acid have been added) as an eluent. The polyamic acid is chemically unstable, and care should be taken to avoid decrease in the molecular weight due to a depolymerization reaction, which occurs depending on conditions. Therefore, also in GPC, the processes from sample preparation to measurement may be carried out within about 5 hours.","Diamine Compound","The diamine compound used in the first exemplary embodiment is not particularly limited and a known diamine compound may be used insofar as the diamine compound has two amino groups in its molecular structure and can be used for polymerization of a polyamic acid.

After such a treatment is conducted, liquid phase acid treatment may be performed with, for example, nitric acid. The acid carbon black is more preferably produced by a closed furnace method. In general, only a carbon black having a high pH and a low volatile content is produced by the furnace method. However, the pH of the carbon black can be adjusted by subjecting the carbon black to the liquid phase acid treatment.

The method of mixing the polyamic acid and the conductive carbon is not particularly limited, and may be a known method. An example of the method is a method including crushing aggregation of the conductive carbon black by shearing force, impact, or collision, for example according to a stirring method, an ultrasonic irradiation method, a ball mill method, or a jet mill method, and distributing the conductive carbon black to the polyamic acid such that the conductive carbon black is dispersed in the polyamic acid. These methods may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.","More specific examples thereof include a method including adding the conductive carbon black before polymerization for forming the polyamic acid and allowing the polymerization for forming the polyamic acid to proceed in the presence of the conductive carbon black whereby the conductive carbon black is dispersed, and a method including mixing the conductive carbon black and a solution of the polyamic acid obtained by polymerization. These methods may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.","An example of the method is a master batch method that includes first mixing the conductive carbon black and a part of the polyamic acid so as to disperse the conductive carbon black and then adding the remainder of the polyamic acid. In this method, the polyamic acid to be used first may have a low molecular weight. The low-molecular-weight polyamic acid may be a polyamic acid satisfying Relational Expression (1) and Relational Expression (2).","In the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment, the amount of the conductive carbon black with respect to 100 parts by mass of the polyamic acid is preferably from 1 part by mass to 100 parts by mass, more preferably from 5 parts by mass to 80 parts by mass, still more preferably from 15 parts by mass to 60 parts by mass, and further preferably from 20 parts by mass to 40 parts by mass.","To the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment, various known additives and fillers may be added insofar as the objects are not impaired. Examples thereof include a silicone defoaming agent; a conductive substance other than conductive carbon black, such as titanium oxide or zinc oxide; an inorganic compound such as metal powder; a fatty acid ester antistatic agent; a high-molecular-weight conductive compound, such as polyaniline; and glass fiber, mica, talc, calcium carbonate, silica, PTFE, or silicone rubber as a reinforcing material, a sliding material, a heat conductive material, or an elasticity imparting material.","<Second Exemplary Embodiment: Polyimide Endless Belt>","A polyimide endless belt according to the second exemplary embodiment is obtained by applying the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment to a surface of a cylindrical base material (metal mold), and converting the polyamic acid to imide by, for example, subjecting the polyamic acid composition applied to the surface of the cylindrical base material to heat treatment.","An example of the production method is described below. First, the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment is applied to a surface of a cylindrical base material. The cylindrical base material may be a cylindrical metal mold. In place of the metal mold, a mold formed of a conventional raw material, such as a resin, glass, or ceramic, may favorably serve as a base material. Moreover, a glass coating or a ceramic coating may be provided on the surface of the base material, and a silicone release agent or a fluorine release agent may be applied to the surface of the base material.","A surplus solution may be eliminated and the variation in thickness of the solution on the cylindrical base material may be reduced by moving a thickness-controlling substrate in the axis direction of the cylindrical base material while maintaining a previously-adjusted clearance between the cylindrical base material and the thickness-controlling substrate. When the variation in thickness of the solution is suppressed when the solution is applied to the cylindrical base material, it is not necessary to use the thickness-controlling substrate.","The surface of the cylindrical base material on which the polyamic acid composition is coated may be either the inner surface of the cylindrical base material or the outer surface of the cylindrical base material. When the polyamic acid composition is applied to the inner surface of the cylindrical base material, the thickness-controlling substrate may be passed through the hole of the cylindrical base material. When the polyamic acid composition is applied to the outer surface of the cylindrical base material, the cylindrical base material may be passed through a hole provided at the thickness-controlling substrate.","Examples of the coating solvent used when the polyamic acid composition according to the first exemplary embodiment is applied to the surface of the cylindrical base material include sulfoxide solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide and diethylsulfoxide; formamide solvents, such as N,N dimethylformamide and N,N-diethylformamide; acetamide solvents, such as N,N-dimethylacetamide and N,N-diethylacetamide; pyrrolidone solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone; phenol solvents, such as phenol, o-, m- or p-cresol, xylenol, halogenated phenol, and catechol; ether solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and dioxolane; alcohol solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, and butanol; cellosolve solvents, such as butyl cellosolve; hexamethylphosphoramide; and \u03b3-butyrolactone. The solvent may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof as a mixture. Furthermore, an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as xylene or toluene, is also usable. The solvent is not particularly limited insofar as the solvent dissolves a polyamic acid and a polyamic acid-polyimide copolymer.","The coating solvent may be the same solvent as that used in the synthesis of the polyamic acid according to the first exemplary embodiment. Alternatively, the solvent used in the synthesis of the polyamic acid may be substituted with a desired coating solvent after polymerization for forming the polyamic acid. The solvent substitution may be performed by any of the following methods: a method including adding a given amount of solvent to a polyamic acid solution for dilution; a method including re-precipitating a polymer and re-dissolving the polymer in a desired solvent; and a method including adding a desired solvent while gradually distilling off the previous solvent so as to adjust the composition.","Next, the cylindrical base material to which the polyamic acid composition has been applied is placed in a heated environment so as to be dried for evaporating the solvent contained therein such that preferably 20 mass % or more (more preferably 60 mass % or more) of the solvent evaporates. However, the solvent may remain in the film as long as the coating film surface is dried and the solvent does not flow even when the coating film is inclined. The drying temperature may be from 50\u00b0 C. to 200\u00b0 C.","After completion of drying, the polyamic acid composition is subjected to conversion to an imide. The conversion to an imide may be performed fully by heating the cylindrical base material, to which the polyamic acid composition has been applied, at a given temperature. The heating temperature during the process may be equal to or higher than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide to be obtained. The heating temperature varies depending on the types of the tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and the diamine as raw materials, and may be set to a temperature at which the imidization completes, i.e., a temperature that is equal to or higher than the glass transition temperature of the polyimide to be obtained. For example, the heating temperature may be from 60\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C., and preferably from 100\u00b0 C. to 350\u00b0 C.","The conversion to an imide may alternatively be performed by the following chemical imidization. A method of the chemical imidization includes adding a dehydrating agent and\/or a catalyst to a polyamic acid composition to thereby chemically advance an imidization reaction. The dehydrating agent is not particularly limited insofar as it is a monovalent carboxylic acid anhydride. For example, one selected from the following or two or more selected from the following may be used: acid anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, butanoic anhydride, and oxalic anhydride. The amount of the dehydrating agent to be used may be from 0.01 mol to 2 mol per mol of the repeating unit of the polyamic acid.","Examples of the catalyst include, but are not limited to, one selected from the following or a combination of two or more selected from the following: tertiary amines such as pyridine, picoline, collidine, lutidine, quinoline, isoquinoline, and triethylamine. The amount of the catalyst to be used may be from 0.01 mol to 2 mol per mol of the dehydrating agent to be used.","The chemical imidization may be performed by adding a dehydrating agent and\/or a catalyst to a polyamic acid solution, and optionally heating as required. The reaction temperature of dehydration cyclization is generally from 0\u00b0 C. to 180\u00b0 C., and preferably from 60\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C.","The dehydrating agent and\/or the catalyst that has been allowed to act on the polyamic acid does not have to be removed; when they are removed, the removal may be performed by any of the following methods. As a method of removing the added dehydrating agent and\/or the catalyst, heating under reduced pressure, re-precipitation, or the like may be used. Heating under reduced pressure may be performed under vacuum at a temperature of from 80\u00b0 C. to 120\u00b0 C., whereby, for example, a tertiary amine used as a catalyst an unreacted dehydrating agent, and a carboxylic acid as a hydrolysis product are distilled off. The re-precipitation may be performed using a poor solvent that dissolves a catalyst, an unreacted dehydrating agent, and a carboxylic acid as a hydrolysis product but does dissolve the polyamic acid-polyimide copolymer; specifically, the reaction liquid is added to large excess of a poor solvent so as to cause re-precipitation. The poor solvent is not particularly limited, and may be selected from water, an alcohols solvent such as methanol or ethanol, a ketone solvent such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or a hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane. The precipitated polyamic acid-polyimide copolymer may be separated by filtration, and then dissolved again in a solvent such as \u03b3-butyrolactone or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.","Thereafter, the resin is removed from the cylindrical base material, thereby providing a desired polyimide endless belt.","Although a production method of a polyimide endless belt according to the second exemplary embodiment is described above, the scope of the invention is not limited only to the exemplary embodiments, and various improvements, alterations and modifications may be added based on the knowledge of those skilled in the art within the range not departing from the gist of the invention.
