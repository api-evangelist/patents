{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to monitoring objects across an enterprise network and more specifically to a monitoring tool auditing module and method of operation.","A business enterprise may include many computers, servers, databases, mission-critical applications, and other components deployed at various nodes in a network. Some nodes may include components that are deployed in a cloud environment. Other nodes may include components that are deployed in a stand-alone configuration on the network. The operation of these components are important to the success of the business enterprise. Monitoring tools may be used by a business enterprise to monitor the health, welfare, performance, utilization, and\/or other parameters of these components. As enterprises become more complex in their deployment and operation, the need grows for advanced monitoring systems and tools.","According to one embodiment, a monitoring tool auditing module comprises an interface, a memory, and a processor. The interface receives a plurality of monitoring audit requests, each monitoring audit request identifying one or more monitoring targets to be audited. The memory is coupled to the interface and stores the plurality of monitoring audit requests in a queue based at least in part upon the order that the monitoring audit requests are received by the interface. The processor is coupled to the memory and accesses a particular one of the plurality of monitoring audit requests stored in memory and determines a monitoring target to be audited based at least in part upon the particular monitoring audit request. The processor determines a plurality of monitoring tools that are deployed at the determined monitoring target, and determines status information for each determined monitoring tool deployed at the determined monitoring target. The processor further determines configuration information for each determined monitoring tool deployed at the determined monitoring target.","The system described in this disclosure provides several advantages to enterprises. Users of the system have the ability to identify monitoring targets within the enterprise and configure monitoring requirements for each monitoring target in a standardized, data driven environment. With the aid of an interactive user interface, the user can create, update, or delete monitoring requirements documents. A monitoring tool deployment module facilitates the deployment, configuration, and\/or removal of monitoring tools for monitoring targets based on monitoring deployment requests. These monitoring deployment requests may be based on monitoring requirements set forth by users in monitoring requirements documents. A monitoring tool auditing module determines a plurality of monitoring tools deployed at monitoring targets in the enterprise and gathers status and configuration information for them in audit files. A monitored objects module compares monitoring requirements, such as those set forth in monitoring requirements documents, against the actual state of monitoring in the enterprise, as determined from the status and configuration information from audit files, and determines whether there is any gap in monitoring in the enterprise. Additional monitoring tools may be deployed, existing monitoring tools may be modified, and\/or existing monitoring tools may be removed, based on any determined gap in monitoring. Thus, the system of the present disclosure aggregates and audits the actual versus the desired monitoring configuration within an enterprise. In this way, the system is able to monitor and manage the rapidly changing landscape of network and server components deployed and operating in the enterprise. The system therefore supports advanced monitoring capabilities and reduces the reliance on manual processes.","Various embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.","It should be understood at the outset that, although example implementations of embodiments of the invention are illustrated below, the present invention may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not.
