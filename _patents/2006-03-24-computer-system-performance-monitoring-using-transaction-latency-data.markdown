title: Computer system performance monitoring using transaction latency data
abstract: A method of monitoring a computer application executed on a computer system. The method includes the steps of (1) without predefining events describing potential stages of a transaction executed by the computer application, using an application program interface to add software code to the computer application for assigning a single general reference to characteristic transactional information associated with the transaction, (2) using the single general reference to identify transaction events performed by the computer application in executing the transaction, and (3) measuring transaction events.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/896,854, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,051,339, filed Jun. 29, 2001.","The present invention relates in general to systems and methods for monitoring the performance of computer systems and, in particular, to computer system performance monitoring using transaction latency data.","Measurement and management of computer systems performance is becoming increasingly important in businesses and industries that rely heavily on information technology (IT). The financial services industry, for example, is comprised of investment houses, banks, stock exchanges, brokers, and others who conduct countless computerized transactions on a daily basis and whose capital investments in technology may be tremendous. It is imperative, therefore, that participants in this or other information-dependent industries possess not only high-powered computer systems capable of handling high volumes of computerized transactions, but also that those systems function as nearly as possible to peak efficiency.","The concept of latency is often used a gauge of computer system and network performance. In a computer system or network, latency is the total time between two measurable points and is often used to mean any delay that increases real or perceived response time. This time may include the time it takes a message to be sent between processes or business offices over the network. It may also include the time spent in writing details or data to a disk or database. Other contributors to latency include processing\/calculation delays, mismatches in data speed between the microprocessor and input\/output (I\/O) devices and inadequate data buffer, propagation (the time it takes for a packet to travel between one place and another); transmission medium (optical fiber, wireless, or some other medium); packet size; router and other processing (each gateway node takes time to examine and possibly change the header in a packet); and other computer and storage delays (e.g., within local area networks (LANS) or similar networks at each end of the journey, a packet may be subject to storage and hard disk access delays at intermediate devices such as switch and bridge).","A currently available IT performance optimization standard is application response measurement (ARM). ARM is a specification that details application response measurement and is provided as part of a software developer's kit that is available from various vendors including the Computer Measurement Group (CMG) headquartered in Turnersville, N.J. CMG and its members are concerned with measurement and management of computer systems, including performance evaluation of existing computer systems to maximize their performance (e.g., response time, throughput, etc.) and capacity management when enhancements to existing systems are planned and when new systems are being designed. The ARM specification is supported by commercial software available from Hewlett Packard Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., Tivoli Systems, Inc. of Austin, Tex. and BMC Software, Inc. of Houston, Tex. The ARM program includes an application program interface (API) that can capture system measurement data. However, at each transfer of the measurement data from one component in a computer system to the next, a unique API-generated handle (or \u201ccorrelator\u201d or \u201cidentifier\u201d) is created and transferred to the next system component. Hence, if processing time or other transactional data is to be passed from a first server to a second server in a computer system, then a first unique handle is generated by the ARM API that is correlated or associated with the transactional data, and the first handle and its associated transactional data are then passed from the first server to the second server. Likewise, if processing time or other transactional data is to be passed from the second server to a third server in the computer system, then a second unique handle is generated by the ARM API that is correlated or associated with the transactional data, and the second handle and its associated transactional data are then passed from the second server to the third server. In large systems that process a complex transaction comprised of many subtransactions, it becomes readily apparent that many unique API-generated handles must be created and passed through the system. Creating and passing multiple API-generated handles throughout a computer system requires that that the ARM API include a correlation application or program for tracking and correlating the processing time and other transactional data with the various handles as they through the computer system. Such an arrangement complicates the ARM API architecture and adds additional processing and storage burdens and other operational inefficiencies to the computer system whose latency characteristics the ARM API is intended to monitor. Moreover, the ARM API can only provide for the measurement of nested transactions that are client-server in nature, i.e., with a parent-child relationship.","Alternative systems and methods for monitoring computer system latency are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,041,352; 6,144,961 and 6,108,700.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,352 teaches a response time measuring system similar to conventional ARM. Conventional ARM determines system response time at the point of origin of a transaction request, i.e., when a transaction starts and when it completes from the perspective of the client. The system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,352 differs form conventional ARM in that it determines system response time at any point in the outgoing and incoming transaction path loop.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,961 describes a transaction response time measuring system that uses sampling of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) data packets. In particular, when a user sends a transaction across a network, such as a data request for data stored on a server, data packets containing session layer data (OSI level 5 or greater) will travel across the network between the client and the server. When the transaction is complete and there are no other transactions currently pending between the client and the server, none of the data packets traveling between the client and the server will contain session layer data. In other words, packets containing session layer data only travel between the client and the server while the transaction between the client and the server is pending. U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,961 uses this fact to calculate the transaction response time in a non-intrusive manner.","To determine transaction response times, U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,961 uses a routine which analyzes captured data packets. The system captures data packets and then determines when the transaction in question begins. This is accomplished by detecting the initial presence of a data packet containing session layer data. The session layer data is detected by conventionally using the OSI model's description of the sequence of data information within each packet. Next, the routine detects an absence of session layer data contained within successive captured data packets for a predetermined amount of time. The routine then defines the end of the transaction as the point in time at which the predetermined amount of time began. The amount of time for processing the transaction is then measured as the difference between the beginning and the end of the transaction. Similar to the invention set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,352 and conventional ARM systems, the system and method provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,144,961 offers a means to evaluate the response time associated with a particular user transaction request. Accordingly, like those technologies, it does not permit performance evaluation of a computer system comprised of a plurality of cooperating business units and\/or processes.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,108,700 discloses a system for measuring the response times of the various stages of computer applications. The invention described therein proposes the creation of a transaction definition language called the ETE (End-to-End) Transaction Definition Language that specifies how to construct identifiable transactions from events and links. In an illustrated example, the ETE Transaction Definition Language provided in U.S. Pat. No. 6,108,700 requires the creation of twenty-one (21) lines of software code merely to define something as relatively simple as a Web commerce transaction. Merely contemplating all of the possible events and transactions that might be involved in a complex business transaction, particularly one whose execution involves the coordination of several business entities and computer systems, is itself a daunting task. Codifying these items complicates the task. That is, individually defining all of these events and transactions in software code in order to produce a complete set of transaction generation rules amounts to a potentially vast amount of preliminary preparation activity that must be performed before the monitoring system may be placed into operation.","An advantage exists, therefore, for a system and method of measuring the precise latency of information flowing through computer systems comprising multiple business units and\/or or processes and regardless of system topology, e.g., nested client-server, distributed, or combinations thereof. The technique should be uncomplicated in design and implementation, minimally invasive, and highly scalable in order to accommodate potentially large volumes and frequencies of information flow through vast computer systems and networks.","The present invention provides a system for and method of measuring the precise latency of information flowing through computer systems and regardless of system topology, e.g., nested client-server, distributed, or a combinations thereof. As used in connection with the present invention, a \u201ccomputer system\u201d may include a single computer (including, without limitation, a mini-computer on up through a mainframe) as well the multiple processes running thereon, a plurality of computers interconnected in the form of a local area network (LAN), interconnected regional business offices, a wide area network (WAN), an international network of offices or the Internet. Similarly, a \u201ctransaction event\u201d may include a request, a response, a directive not requiring a response, a complete or partially complete subtransaction, an automatically or manually triggered computer function, a database store or retrieve function or any other time-monitorable function or calculation that may be performed by a computer system.","The metrics measured by the present invention include the processing time for a given transaction event within each computing process, the time spent by the transaction between each computing process, and the time taken by the transaction to pass through the entire computer system. An exemplary, although not limitative, application of the present invention would involve precisely measuring the latency of business information flowing through a trading system comprising multiple processes running on multiple computers whereby trade data is passed from one process to the next with each new trade. Accordingly, the relevant metrics for that particular application of the invention would be the processing time for a given trade within each process, the time spent by the trade between each process, and the time taken by the trade to pass through any part of the system or the entire system.","The present invention involves the association of measurement or timing data with inherent transactional information that is ordinarily passed from one component of a computer system to the next in the course of executing a transaction by a computer application. The raw measurement or timing data is then used to calculate latency data for some or all aspects of a particular transaction. Significantly, the invention performs these operations based solely on references drawn only from the business or other transactional data associated with the transaction.","According to the invention, computer systems may be instrumented using an uncomplicated and minimally invasive API that allows the execution time of every task in an application to be measured and transactional information to be tagged to the measurement or timing data. Preferably, the measurement data is also associated with related measurement data from other components or systems of the same business entity in order to give precise latency data and statistics for transactions that involve more then one segment of a business' operations. By way of example, a trade reference or other inherent conventional business information normally associated with an electronic business transaction may be used as the transaction identifier throughout the latency measurement process. Then, individual tasks required for processing the task can be tagged with timing data whereby the data can be processed and evaluated to produce desired latency and\/or summary data. For instance, the average, maximum or minimum time taken to process commodities or securities trades from front-office to back-office within a brokerage or investment house may be calculated with precision in order to obtain meaningful information concerning the efficiency of the business entity's computerized transaction system.","With the present invention, no special languages, software code and rules must be created to predefine and pre-classify events and transactions. Furthermore, no transaction handle or correlator needs to be created for a transaction and passed from one component of a computer system to the next since the business information normally associated with the transaction is itself sufficient to identify and track the transaction. Since no use is made of API-generated handles, the present system easier to deploy in modular systems than conventional ARM systems.","Moreover, multiple computer systems or components that may be required to execute an entire transaction need not be confined to being client-server in nature since the API according to the invention can be mapped to other topologies, e.g., a distributed system. The technique is simple in design and implementation, minimally invasive, and highly scalable in order to accommodate potentially large volumes and frequencies of information flow through vast computer systems and networks.","Among its advantages, the present system eliminates guess-work from computer system capacity estimates, enables ready assessment of the performance impact of new computer application releases and migrations, identifies application performance trends, works with either intra-system or inter-system IT system optimization tools, assists in researching user performance complaints and generates system management reports.","Other details, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the following description of the presently preferred embodiments and presently preferred methods of practicing the invention proceeds.","Referring to , there is shown a client-server computer system topology whose transactional latency may be measured by presently available IT performance optimization tools. In , Points  to  represent the flow of business or other transactional information through multiple transactions on multiple computers respectively named CLIENT A, SERVER B, SERVER C and SERVER D. The client-server topology represented in  is a nested parent-child type of topology wherein completed transaction \/ is comprised of a number of smaller nested transactions or subtransactions. Transaction \/ typically includes an initial transactional request made by user  (step ) to a suitable computer input\/output (I\/O) device which culminates in the provision of the requested information from the I\/O device to the user (step ). Transaction \/ represents a transaction that is the parent of transaction \/, i.e., \/ is nested within \/. Transaction \/, in turn, is the parent of transaction \/, and so on. The latency of transaction \/ may be measured using a conventional IT performance optimization tool such as the ARM SDK described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","14","2","13","1","14"]},"When a user makes a transactional request from an application being monitored by the ARM program, CLIENT A begins a first transaction T which initiates a START call to ARM API . An ARM START call typically identifies the application being monitored, the transaction and (optionally) the user, as well as the status of the transaction when completed. In the illustrated example, ARM API  also assigns the correlator or handle Corr C to the first transaction T and returns the handle to CLIENT A. Concurrently, through an ARM agent , the handle Corr C associated with the first transaction T is passed to a correlation application . In addition to communicating with the correlation application , ARM agent  measures and monitors the application transactions and may make the information available to IT management\/optimization tools such as those offered by Cyrano SA of Newburyport, Mass.","Having received handle Corr C from ARM API  for the first transaction T, CLIENT A sends a request (T) to SERVER B, and includes handle Corr C in the request. SERVER B then starts a second transaction T, passing Corr C as the parent handle or identifier for the second transaction to ARM API . At the same time, SERVER B requests and receives from ARM API  a correlator, Corr C, which is assigned to the second transaction. Simultaneously, the handle Corr C associated with the second transaction T is passed to correlation application  through ARM agent . SERVER B then sends a request (T) to SERVER C, and includes Corr C in the request. SERVER C starts transaction T, passing Corr C as the parent handle or identifier for the third transaction to ARM API . In more complex applications and systems this cycle is repeated until the overall application transaction is completed. And, with each succeeding transaction request in the application or computer system, a new and different API-generated handle is created and passed with the request.","The correlation application  collects all the data about these transactions, and puts together the total picture, knowing that T is the parent of T (via C), and T is the parent of T (via C), and so forth. However, the creation, correlation and storage of potentially vast numbers of API-generated transaction handles needlessly complicates the transaction tracking process and consumes processing and storage resources that could be more productively allocated, e.g., to reducing the response time of the application being monitored.","Referring to , there is shown a distributed computer system , containing no nested transactions, whose latency may be measured by the computer system performance monitoring system of the present invention. Servers A through E represent a distributed computer system wherein business or other transactional information flows from point  to point  via either Server C or Server D. Unlike conventional ARM programs, the present computer system performance monitoring system is unrestricted in its ability to measure the time taken for transactional information to travel from point  to point  via Server C or Server D.","The present system measures the timing and calculates the precise latency of transactional information flowing through any computer system comprising multiple components, e.g., system  (or a nested or a combined nested and distributed topology system), by tagging or linking measurement data directly to the business or other transactional information being passed through the computer system. That is, unlike existing computer latency measuring systems, the present system employs no changing API-generated handles that are passed from server to server during operation of a computer application whose latency characteristics are being measured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["300","302","304"]},"The API according to the present invention is placed strategically in a computer application to mark the beginning and end of processing (and any other significant events) at desired computer system components or processes, all of which are selected at the discretion of the user of the API. More specifically, API software code is added to the computer application which, when executed, assigns a single general reference to characteristic transactional information associated with a transaction event to be executed by the computer application. Additionally, the API includes an agent that marks the time at which the API software code is executed and tags that time with the business or other transactional information being currently processed by the computer application. Unlike conventional ARM APIs, the present API does not create or pass any data from one system component to the next (e.g., a timestamp or a unique API-generated handle, correlator or other identifier) beyond that of the business information ordinarily passed in processing a transaction. That is, the present invention recognizes that characteristic transactional information inherently associated with a given transaction, in and of itself, constitutes a readily identifiable electronic fingerprint or reference that is sufficient to enable identification and tracking of events processed by a computer application in executing the transaction as it flows through a computer system. For instance, characteristic business or other transactional information associated with a securities trade may include, inter alia, a Trade Identifier (or trade ID or trade reference, the identity of the party requesting the trade, the type of securities being traded, the number of securities being traded, the price of the securities, the date of the trade, whether the trade is a \u201cbuy\u201d or a \u201csell\u201d, as well other trade-specific information. Thus, the aggregation of this characteristic transactional information represents a unique identifier that itself may be directly tracked throughout processing by a computer system, thereby eliminating the need for a new and different API-generated handle to be created, correlated and tracked at each transition from one computer system component to the next and for each computer application transaction conducted in executing the transaction.","Referring again to , using the API of the present invention, the following metrics are measured by the API agent: the time spent by each trade within Process 1; the time spent by each trade within Process 2; and the time spent by each trade between Processes 1 and 2. Each of two transaction processes (or computer components) has been instrumented with the API such that the beginning and end of processing will be logged and associated with the relevant trade reference, i.e., REF# and REF#.

The problem with this approach is that while it provides good statistics about the time transaction time taken within the individual modules or components it offers no indication of the latency between these components.","Most business flows in an organization or enterprise are interlinked. A downstream system may receive messages from many different locations. It is not possible to, for instance, just look at every 10th message and perform latency calculations for that message.

Computer system , for example, is illustrative of merely one of many complex computer systems whose performance may be monitored by the system and method according to the invention. In particular, computer system  is a globally distributed computer system a bank, brokerage, investment house or other similar entity which runs an integrated computer application for enabling placement, processing and settlement of equities and other securities trades.","Computer system  comprises a gateway  through which clients  may initiate transactions such as trade orders or the like. In placing a trade order or simply requesting a current price for equity stocks or other securities, system  may provide a client with the desired price via a Pricing Engine . If the price is satisfactory to the client, then the client might place a trade order for the securities through a trade router  which, in turn, routes the request to the appropriate regional office  (e.g., Asia, America, Europe) of the investment entity. From the appropriate regional office , a Send Order request is distributed to the appropriate one or more exchanges -capable of fulfilling the trade order. Each of the relevant ones of exchanges -responds with its ability to execute the trade order via an Execution Reply  which is returned to the appropriate regional office . At this juncture, the regional office may convey the ability of the trade order to be fulfilled back to the client  and await confirmation from the client that the order is to be fulfilled. Alternatively, the regional office may execute the trade order according to previously agreed upon instructions established by the client.","Once authorization to execute the trade order has been given, the trade is processed at Trade Processing stage  which communicates a Stock Record System  which records the existence and pertinent details of the transaction. Additionally, Trade Processing stage  communicates with a cash Payments System  to secure payment for the transaction and seeks clearance for settlement of the trade through Trade Clearance stage . Depending on the geographic location of the regional office  through which the trade is executed, the trade clearance stage may involve obtaining clearance by one or more settlement systems  (e.g., CREST for settlement of UK, Irish and international securities and Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication \u201cSWIFT\u201d for settlement of European and international securities). With the appropriate clearances obtained, Trade Processing stage  communicates the cleared trades to Trade Confirmation stage  which, in turn, notifies investment Custodians  and the client  (through Gateway ).","In analysing computer system  it may be important to know, among other information, how long it takes an trade order from a client  to be sent to the market. In , this would be the time from the Gateway  to Send Order  to markets -With the present invention, this and any other desired business flow in computer system  may be broken down in such a way that one can observe how long it takes within each process en-route and the time taken between each process.","Recall that in conventional ARM-type computer system monitoring, an API-generated handle is created that is then used to reference each logging action. This handle is passed downstream to another process that supplies the first handle to the ARM agent and is then given a replacement handle that establishes the link between the first process and the second. This link is continued through any linked processes.","In the present invention, there is no handle-generating API agent or correlation application for correlating the API-generated handles with the transaction being processed. This is because the only data passed between processes is business or other transactional data and the only data supplied to the instant collection agent is that data. This data, e.g. a Trade Identifier, is used to link the processes together throughout computer system .","The advantage of this method is that there is no requirement for the processes to pass a handle between them. The following hypothetical is illustrative. Assume, for instance, that there are four processes involved in a particular transactional flow. If, as in the present example, each of these processes uses the same reference to identify a trade being processed, the present invention will enable monitoring of the flow if only process 1 and process 4 were logged. Since the trade being monitored shares the same reference throughout the business flow one could determine the start time for process 1 and the end time for process 4. To perform corresponding monitoring of the same trade with the ARM standard, an external handle would need to be made available and this would entail the data links between process 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 3 and 4 being changed at each link.","It is not uncommon for one or more of the processes in the flow to be a package supplied by an external vendor. Under those circumstances, statistics about the time taken within the external package cannot be gathered. However, using the present computer system monitoring system, the presence of an externally controlled package would not negate the ability to consider the total time taken within the flow or within the individual components not under third party control. An example of this provided in  wherein orders are sent to a number of exchanges. A Trade Identifier cannot be sent out from Send Order  to the exchanges . However, this does not impact the ability of the present system to link Send Order  and Execution Reply  together by the business or other transactional data associated with the trade. In this way, the present system can calculate how long the trade took being sent to and sent back from the exchanges. This is extremely important in understanding where the latency within the flow is occurring. If, for example, excessive latency was manifested between Send Order  and Execution Reply , it might indicate that the enterprise needs to upgrade links, etc.","A further advantage of the present invention is that business or other transactional data collected from a process may be used within a number of transactional flows under scrutiny. Referring again to , consider the flow path that routes data from Gateway , Trade Router , the European regional office , Send Order , European regional office , Trade Router  to Gateway . This flow would equate to the total round trip time for a trade event from and to the client . Likewise, the data collected from Gateway , Trade Router , European regional office , Send Order  to European regional office  is also used in the flow that feeds through to Trade Processing  and beyond that to Stock Record system , Cash Payments System , Trade Confirmations  and so on. This is of particular importance since many complex and geographically-dispersed computer systems are not normally limited to isolated flows. Most computer systems and components receive events passed from a number of other systems and, similarly, equally pass data to a number of downstream systems. Associating all of these events with common transactional data greatly simplifies tracking of the transaction within the computer system and evaluation of computer system's performance.","Although the invention has been described in detail for the purpose of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed herein."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
