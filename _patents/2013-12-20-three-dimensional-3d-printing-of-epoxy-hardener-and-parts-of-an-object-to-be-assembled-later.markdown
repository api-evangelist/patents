title: Three dimensional (3D) printing of epoxy, hardener, and parts of an object to be assembled later
abstract: A three dimensional (3D) printer and method for dispensing a material to form a 3D substructure and for dispensing an adhesive onto the 3D substructure. The adhesive printed onto the 3D substructure may be used to attach the 3D substructure to another substructure such as a conventionally formed substructure or another 3D printed substructure. Printing the adhesive using the 3D printer during the same 3D manufacturing process used to print the 3D substructure may improve precision of the location at which the adhesive is dispensed, thereby improving the quality of superstructure created by joining the substructures. An embodiment of the present teachings may decrease the overall time and cost to attach substructures.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present teachings relate to three dimensional (3D) printing and, more particularly, to the printing of a 3D structure, and the assembly of the 3D printed structure with other 3D printed structures or structures manufactured using other techniques.","The use of traditional manufacturing techniques is rapidly moving toward digital manufacturing. Additive or subtractive manufacturing (herein collectively, 3D printing) provides many advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques. For example, intricate structural designs that could not be formed previously using conventional techniques may be formed using 3D printing. Further, 3D printing provides a cost-effective method for manufacturing batch sizes as small as a single unit. Designs may be created using computer-aided design (CAD) software by an end user, or a user may download web-based software instructions to create a needed repair part or desired decorative structure at home or small business. Different print heads can add a plurality of different materials to the object being created (e.g. rubber, plastics, paper, polyurethane-like materials, metals, etc.).","Some 3D printed substructures may require assembly with other substructures after printing. For example, a 3D printed substructure may be attached to one or more other 3D printed substructures, to one or more conventionally manufactured substructure, or to both, using an adhesive. For assembly, two or more 3D printed structures may be transported after printing to an assembly station where an adhesive is manually applied to one or both substructures. The structures are then assembled using the adhesive to secure the two or more structures together.","A 3D printed structure and method that allows more rapid or convenient assembly of parts would be desirable.","The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of one or more embodiments of the present teachings. This summary is not an extensive overview, nor is it intended to identify key or critical elements of the present teachings, nor to delineate the scope of the disclosure. Rather, its primary purpose is merely to present one or more concepts in simplified form as a prelude to the detailed description presented later.","An embodiment of the present teachings may include a system for forming a structure, the system including a three dimensional (3D) printer. The 3D printer may include a first reservoir comprising a polymer, a second reservoir comprising an adhesive, a nozzle configured to dispense the polymer onto a platform to form a 3D substructure, and a nozzle configured to dispense the adhesive onto the 3D substructure.","In another embodiment, a method for forming a structure may include providing a three dimensional (3D) printer, wherein the printer includes a first reservoir comprising a polymer and a second reservoir comprising an adhesive. The method may further include dispensing the polymer from the first reservoir through a nozzle to print a 3D substructure using the 3D printer, and dispensing the adhesive from the second reservoir through a nozzle onto the 3D substructure using the 3D printer.","It should be noted that some details of the FIGS. have been simplified and are drawn to facilitate understanding of the present teachings rather than to maintain strict structural accuracy, detail, and scale.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","Attaching a 3D printed substructure to other 3D printed substructures, to one or more conventionally manufactured substructure, or to both, using an adhesive requires the manual application of adhesive to the printed substructure. Manual application of adhesive may suffer from lack of precision, high cost, and potential for error.","In an embodiment of the present teachings, one or more adhesives may be applied by a 3D printer itself during formation of the 3D printed substructure, for example using one of the embodiments described below. Application of an adhesive by a 3D printer may improve adhesive placement precision and reduce cost and the potential for error. For purposes of this application, a \u201csubstructure\u201d or \u201csubassembly\u201d is a structure that will be attached to another substructure to form a completed assembly (i.e., superstructure).","Printing of a 3D substructure and an adhesive, and assembly of two 3D printed substructures to form a completed assembly in accordance with an embodiment of the present teachings, is depicted in the cross sections of .  depicts a 3D printer including a platform  and a plurality of material supplies , for example a plurality of reservoirs, that supply various liquid (viscous) materials - to be printed. The reservoirs may be supplied by different printheads or by different reservoirs in the same printhead, although other configurations are contemplated. In an embodiment, a material  such as a polymer is dispensed (e.g., ejected) by the printer from reservoir B through a nozzle B onto the platform . The nozzles  and reservoirs  may be part of a printhead . During printing, the printhead  moves in X-, Y-, and Z-directions to dispense a plurality of layers A-C onto platform  to form a 3D substructure . Layers  may be about 100 \u03bcm or less in thickness. 3D printing of structures and substructures is well known in the art.","Subsequently, an adhesive  is dispensed by the printer through nozzle A onto the substructure  to provide a dispensed adhesive  as depicted in . The dispensed adhesive  may be an air-curable adhesive, an epoxy (for example, polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate, etc.), a thermoplastic, a thermoset, etc. The adhesive  may be dispensed into a recess in the 3D substructure  as depicted in , or over a flat surface or other structural topography. Because the adhesive  is dispensed using the 3D printer, the location and volume of adhesive  may be precisely controlled. It will be appreciated that, in another embodiment, the adhesive  may be dispensed prior to completing substructure , for example after depositing one or more of layers A and B, but before depositing layer C.","In an embodiment, the adhesive  may be an air-curable adhesive. A particular type of air-curable adhesive may have various desirable qualities for a particular application, but an unacceptably short working time. In an embodiment, an optional sealer  may be dispensed from reservoir C through nozzle C onto the top layer C to form a film covering  that covers dispensed adhesive  as depicted in . The film covering  reduces exposure of the adhesive  to air, thus slowing a cure rate of the adhesive . The film covering  may be formed to include a tab portion  for easy removal of the film covering . The formation of material overhangs, such as that required to print tab  of film covering  using the 3D printer, may be performed by an artisan skilled in the art of 3D printing.","In an alternate embodiment, instead of printing the film covering  using a liquid viscous material, the printer may include a tape and reel assembly  including a supply reel A and a take-up reel B. A tape assembly  includes a plurality of preformed solid film coverings . In this embodiment, the printer is configured to dispense a solid film covering  onto the top layer C and to cover dispensed adhesive  as depicted in . In either case, where the film covering is printed with a viscous material and cured, or dispensed as a solid preformed section , the film covering  is removed to expose the adhesive  prior to connecting the substructures , , described below.","In another embodiment, the dispensed adhesive  may be, for example, an adhesive that is curable using heat or ultraviolet (UV) light, such that the dispensed adhesive  has a sufficient working time without use or protection of a film covering . Further, adhesive  may be a B-staged adhesive wherein, after depositing, the adhesive  is partially cured prior to assembly. Subsequently, the substructures may be assembled hours or days later, at which time the B-staged adhesive is fully cured, for example heat cured, after assembly of the substructures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["12","40","40","40","40","42","12","44","40","42","46","42","44","42","44"]},"Next, the first substructure  and the second substructure  are connected together using the one or more adhesives - to form a completed structure or assembly similar to that depicted in . In an embodiment where adhesives  and  are two different components of a two-part epoxy adhesive, the components may combine to form an epoxy  as depicted in . Mixing of the epoxy components ,  may be enhanced and improved using an X-Y scrub of the two substructures , , if the design and tolerances of substructures ,  allow an X-Y scrub. For purposes of the present teachings, an X-Y scrub includes the use of relative planar movement between two substructures ,  in the X- and Y-directions to enhance mixing of the two-part epoxy components ,  interposed therebetween. Connection of the two substructures ,  may include a curing process, such as a heat cure or a UV light cure, to set one or more of the adhesives -.","In an embodiment, the 3D printed substructure may be printed to have a rough surface texture to increase surface area at the adhesive location. This prevents the need for a final assembler (person or machine) to roughen the surface, for example by manually sanding, prior to assembly.","In another embodiment, substructures similar to substructures ,  may be formed using a 3D printing process that includes the use of laser heating of a powdered solid, or a subtractive process in which a volume of raw material is cut to remove excess material. The viscous adhesive layers , - and film covering  may be then be applied to the substructures ,  using the 3D printer as described above.","Thus embodiments of the present teachings may include the use of 3D printing technology in a single step manufacturing operation to create a set of parts for assembly. An embodiment may include printing one or more 3D printed substructures using a 3D printer, then printing an adhesive directly onto the 3D printed part using the 3D printer that also prints the 3D printed part. Direct application of the assembly adhesive as part of the printing operation may enable increased assembly automation, reduce assembly variability, and may result in reduced cycle times, overhead costs, energy input, and part fall-out rate. Substructures may then be conveniently assembled and secured together without requiring the final assembler (person or machine) to select and apply the adhesive. Printed parts, including one or more 3D printed adhesives, may be shipped by a manufacturer to a user at a different location, for example a subcontractor manufacturing site, a construction site, or another location for later assembly. In this embodiment, the original manufacturer specifies the location of the adhesive and also prints correct quantity of adhesive, thus reducing the potential for error in adhesive placement, adhesive composition, and\/or adhesive quantity by the final assembler.","Due to the curing rate of some adhesives, the printed adhesive may have an expiration date based on the cure rate of the adhesive. A printing date of the 3D substructure may be based on the expiration date of the printed adhesive, such that the substructure may be printed and shipped by the manufacturer, then assembled later by the user, prior to expiration of the adhesive.","In an embodiment, during design, two or more substructures, one or more adhesives (e.g., one or more epoxies, including one or more resins and hardeners), and any desired film coverings, are specified, for example as CAD data, and sent to a 3D printer that is capable of manufacturing the various elements. In an embodiment, the CAD software may specify a particular adhesive based on the type of material from which the part will be formed, for example through a main software program, through a plug-in, or an application programming interface (API). Submission of the CAD data and production specification may be done by direct connection, network, or wirelessly (e.g. from a mobile device). The 3D printer creates the parts and the appropriately-located epoxies, hardeners, and coverings using 3D printing methods. The 3D printer may include separate heads for each material, or one head including a plurality of materials. Each different material may be printed through a separate nozzle, although it is contemplated that each material from a separate material reservoir may be printed through a single nozzle. A plurality of layers, where each layer is less than one micron thick, are serially applied by the printer, building up the substructures and dispensing the one or more epoxies, hardeners, and coverings. Depending on the specification and the capabilities of the 3D printer, an individual part, including its associated epoxies, hardeners, and coverings, may be produced in a single manufacturing operation. Each part (i.e., substructure) may be printed separately, or some or all parts (and their associated epoxies, hardeners, and coverings) may be produced in a single manufacturing operation. In some embodiments, the materials for the substructures, epoxies, hardeners, and\/or coverings may be included in the same layer or layers, for example when two or more of these materials are on the same physical plane in 3D space.","In an embodiment, an epoxy resin and hardener may be formulated to cure relatively quickly when they come into contact with each other. In another embodiment, the adhesive may cure upon application of a catalyst, for example heat, UV light, a chemical catalyst, etc. In an embodiment, two subassemblies are physically attached together solely using the 3D printed adhesive and no other material. In other embodiments, a screen printed adhesive, sprayed adhesive, etc., and\/or clamps or latches may be used in conjunction with the 3D printed adhesive to hold the subassemblies together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["60","62","64","66","68","62","70","68","66","64","62","72","70"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 7"],"b":["80","80","12","40","42","44","46","80","82","84","86","82","87","88","82","90","92","92","94","96","98","94","86","100","102","102","14","18","12","40","14","26","42","46","102","104","106","80","12","40","26","42","46"]},"Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the present teachings are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible.
