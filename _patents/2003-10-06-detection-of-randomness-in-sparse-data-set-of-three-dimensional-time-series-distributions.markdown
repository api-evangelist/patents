abstract: A two-stage method is provided for automatically characterizing the spatial arrangement among data points of a three-dimensional time series distribution in a data processing system wherein the classification of this time series distribution is required. The invention utilizes two-stage method Cartesian grids to determine (1) the number of cubes in the grids containing at least one input data point of the time series distribution; (2) the expected number of cubes which would contain at least one data point in a statistically determined random distribution in these grids; and (3) an upper and lower probability of false alarm above and below this expected value utilizing a second discrete probability relationship in order to analyze the randomness characteristic of the input time series distribution.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","EXAMPLE"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","(1) Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to signal processing\/data processing systems for processing time series distributions containing a small number of data points (e.g., less than about ten (10) to twenty-five (25) data points). More particularly, the invention relates to a dual method for classifying the white noise degree (randomness) of a selected signal structure comprising a three dimensional time series distribution composed of a highly sparse data set. As used herein, the term \u201crandom\u201d (or \u201crandomness\u201d) is defined in terms of a \u201crandom process\u201d as measured by the probability distribution model used, namely a nearest-neighbor stochastic (Poisson) process. Thus, pure randomness, pragmatically speaking, is herein considered to be a time series distribution for which no function, mapping or relation can be constituted that provides meaningful insight into the underlying structure of the distribution, but which at the same time is not chaos.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Recent research has revealed a critical need for highly sparse data set time distribution analysis methods and apparatus separate and apart from those adapted for treating large sample distributions. This is particularly the case in applications such as naval sonar systems, which require that input time series signal distributions be classified according to their structure, i.e., periodic, transient, random or chaotic. It is well known that large sample methods often fail when applied to small sample distributions, but that the same is not necessarily true for small sample methods applied to large data sets. Very small data set distributions may be defined as those with less than about ten (10) to twenty-five (25) measurement (data) points. Such data sets can be analyzed mathematically with certain nonparametric discrete probability distributions, as opposed to large-sample methods, which normally employ continuous probability distributions (such as the Gaussian).","The probability theory discussed herein and utilized by the present invention is well known. It may be found, for example, in works such as P. J. Hoel et al., , Houghton-Mifflin, Boston, Mass., 1971, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","Also, as will appear more fully below, it has been found to be important to treat white noise signals themselves as the time series signal distribution to be analyzed, and to identify the characteristics of that distribution separately. This aids in the detection and appropriate processing of received signals in numerous data acquisition contexts, not the least of which include naval sonar applications. Accordingly, it will be understood that prior analysis methods and apparatus analyze received time series data distributions from the point of view of attempting to find patterns or some other type of correlated data therein. Once such a pattern or correlation is located, the remainder of the distribution is simply discarded as being noise. It is believed that the present invention will be useful in enhancing the sensitivity of present analysis methods, as well as being useful on its own.","Various aspects related to the present invention are discussed in the following exemplary patents:","U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,659, issued May 30, 2000, to Francis J. O'Brien, Jr., discloses a method for measuring and recording the relative degree of pical density, congestion, or crowding of objects dispersed in a three-dimensional space. A Population Density Index is obtained for the actual conditions of the objects within the space as determined from measurements taken of the objects. The Population Density Index is compared with values considered as minimum and maximum bounds, respectively, for the Population Density Index values. The objects within the space are then repositioned to optimize the Population Density Index, thus optimizing the layout of objects within the space.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,817, issued Apr. 9, 1996, to Francis J. O'Brien, Jr., discloses an adaptive statistical filter system for receiving a data stream comprising a series of data values from a sensor associated with successive points in time. Each data value includes a data component representative of the motion of a target and a noise component, with the noise components of data values associated with proximate points in time being correlated. The adaptive statistical filter system includes a prewhitener, a plurality of statistical filters of different orders, stochastic decorrelator and a selector. The prewhitener generates a corrected data stream comprising corrected data values, each including a data component and a time-correlated noise component. The plural statistical filters receive the corrected data stream and generate coefficient values to fit the corrected data stream to a polynomial of corresponding order and fit values representative of the degree of fit of corrected data stream to the polynomial. The stochastic decorrelator uses a spatial Poisson process statistical significance test to determine whether the fit values are correlated. If the test indicates the fit values are not randomly distributed, it generates decorrelated fit values using an autoregressive moving average methodology which assesses the noise components of the statistical filter. The selector receives the decorrelated fit values and coefficient values from the plural statistical filters and selects coefficient values from one of the filters in response to the decorrelated fit values. The coefficient values are coupled to a target motion analysis module which determines position and velocity of a target.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,466,516 B1, issued Oct., 15, 2002, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a method and apparatus for automatically characterizing the spatial arrangement among the data points of a three-dimensional time series distribution in a data processing system wherein the classification of said time series distribution is required. The method and apparatus utilize grids in Cartesian coordinates to determine (1) the number of cubes in the grids containing at least one input data point of the time series distribution; (2) the expected number of cubes which would contain at least one data point in a random distribution in said grids; and (3) an upper and lower probability of false alarm above and below said expected value utilizing a discrete binomial probability relationship in order to analyze the randomness characteristic of the input time series distribution. A labeling device also is provided to label the time series distribution as either random or nonrandom, and\/or random or nonrandom within what probability, prior to its output from the invention to the remainder of the data processing system for further analysis.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,234 B1, issued May 28, 2002, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a method and apparatus for automatically characterizing the spatial arrangement among the data points of a time series distribution in a data processing system wherein the classification of this time series distribution is required. The method and apparatus utilize a grid in Cartesian coordinates to determine (1) the number of cells in the grid containing at least-one input data point of the time series distribution; (2) the expected number of cells which would contain at least one data point in a random distribution in said grid; and (3) an upper and lower probability of false alarm above and below said expected value utilizing a discrete binomial probability relationship in order to analyze the randomness characteristic of the input time series distribution. A labeling device also is provided to label the time series distribution as either random or nonrandom, and\/or random or nonrandom.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,597,634 B1, issued Jul. 22, 2003, to O'Brien, Jr. et al., discloses a signal processing system to processes a digital signal converted from to an analog signal, which includes a noise component and possibly also an information component comprising small samples representing four mutually orthogonal items of measurement information representable as a sample point in a symbolic Cartesian four-dimensional spatial reference system. An information processing sub-system receives said digital signal and processes it to extract the information component. A noise likelihood determination sub-system receives the digital signal and generates a random noise assessment of whether or not the digital signal comprises solely random noise, and if not, generates an assessment of degree-of-randomness. The information processing system is illustrated as combat control equipment for undersea warfare, which utilizes a sonar signal produced by a towed linear transducer array, and whose mode operation employs four mutually orthogonal items of measurement information.","The above prior art does not disclose a method which utilizes more than one statistical test for characterizing the spatial arrangement among the data points of a three dimensional time series distribution of sparse data in order to maximize the likelihood of a correct decision in processing batches of the sparse data in real time operating submarine systems and\/or other contemplated uses.","Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a dual method comprising automated measurement of the three dimensional spatial arrangement among a very small number of points, objects, measurements or the like whereby an ascertainment of the noise degree (i.e., randomness) of the time series distribution may be made.","It also is an object of the invention to provide a dual method and apparatus useful in naval sonar, radar and lidar and in aircraft and missile tracking systems, which require acquired signal distributions to be classified according to their structure (i.e., periodic, transient, random, or chaotic) in the processing and use of those acquired signal distributions as indications of how and from where they were originally generated.","Further, it is an object of the invention to provide a dual method and apparatus capable of labeling a three dimensional time series distribution with (1) an indication as to whether or not it is random in structure, and (2) an indication as to whether or not it is random within a probability of false alarm of a specific randomness calculation.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the drawings, the descriptions given herein, and the appended claims. However, it will be understood that above listed objects and advantages of the invention are intended only as an aid in understanding certain aspects of the invention, are not intended to limit the invention in any way, and do not form a comprehensive or exclusive list of objects, features, and advantages.","Accordingly, the present invention provides a two-stage method for characterizing a spatial arrangement among data points for each of a plurality of three-dimensional time series distributions comprising a sparse number of the data points. The method may comprise one or more steps such as, for instance, creating a first virtual volume containing a first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points to be characterized and then subdividing the first virtual volume into a plurality k of three-dimensional volumes such that each of the plurality k of three-dimensional volumes have the same shape and size.","A first stage characterization of the spatial arrangement of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points may comprise the steps of determining a statistically expected proportion \u0398 of the plurality k of three-dimensional volumes containing at least one of the data points for a random distribution of the data points such that k*\u0398 is a statistically expected number M of the plurality k of three-dimensional volumes which contain at least one of the data points if the first three-dimensional time series distribution is characterized as random. Other steps may comprise counting a number m of the plurality k of three-dimensional volumes which actually contain at least one of the data points in the first three-dimensional time series distribution in any particular sample. The method comprises statistically determining an upper random boundary greater than M and a lower random boundary less than M such that if the number m is between the upper random boundary and the lower random boundary then the first time series distribution is characterized as random in structure during the first stage characterization.","A second stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points may comprise the steps of determining when \u0398 is less than a pre-selected value, and then utilizing a Poisson distribution to determine a mean of the data points. If \u0398 is greater than the pre-selected value, then the method may comprise utilizing a binomial distribution to determine a mean of the data points. Additional steps may comprise computing a probability p from the mean so determined based on whether \u0398 is greater than or less than the pre-selected value. Other steps may comprise determining a false alarm probability \u03b1 based on a total number of the plurality k of three-dimensional volumes for the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points to be characterized. The method may comprise comparing p with \u03b1 to determine whether to characterize the sparse data as noise or signal during the second stage characterization.","The first stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points is compared with the second stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points to improve the overall accuracy of the characterization.","If the first stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points indicates a random distribution and the second stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points indicates a signal, then the method may comprise continuing to process the data points.","If the first stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points indicates a random distribution and the second stage characterization of the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points indicates a random distribution, then the first three-dimensional time series distribution of the data points as random with a higher confidence level than in a single stage characterization.","The method may continue for characterizing each of the plurality of three-dimensional time series distribution of data points.","In a preferred embodiment, the random process (white noise) detection subsystem includes an input for receiving a three-dimensional time series distribution of data points expressed in Cartesian coordinates. This set of data points will be characterized by no more than a maximum number of points having values (amplitudes) between maximum and minimum values received within a preselected time interval. A hypothetical representation of a white noise time series signal distribution in Cartesian space is illustratively shown in . The invention is specifically adapted to analyze both selected portions of such time series distributions, and the entirety of the distribution depending upon the sensitivity of the randomness determination, which is required in any particular instance.","The input time series distribution of data points is received by a display\/operating system adapted to accommodate a pre-selected number of data points N in a pre-selected time interval \u0394t and dispersed in three-dimensional space along with a first measure referred to as Y with magnitude \u0394Y=max(Y)\u2212min(Y), and a second measure referred to as Z with magnitude \u0394Z=max(Z)\u2212min(Z). The display\/operating system then creates a virtual volume around the input data distribution and divides the virtual volume into a grid consisting of cubic cells each of equal enclosed volume. Ideally, the cells fill the entire virtual volume, but if they do not, the unfilled portion of the virtual volume is disregarded in the randomness determination.","An analysis device then examines each cell to determine whether or not one or more of the data points of the input time series distribution are located therein. Thereafter, a counter calculates the number of occupied cells. Also, the number of cells which would be expected to be occupied in the grid for a totally random distribution is predicted by a computer device according to known Poisson probability process theory and binomial Theorem equations. In addition, the statistical bounds of the predicted value are calculated based upon known discrete binomial criteria.","A comparator is then used to determine whether or not the actual number of occupied cells in the input time series distribution is the same as the predicted number of cells for a random distribution. If it is, the input time series distribution is characterized as random. If it is not, the input time series distribution is characterized as nonrandom.","Thereafter, the characterized time series distribution is labeled as random or nonrandom, and\/or as random or nonrandom within a pre-selected probability rate of the expected randomness value prior to being output back to the remainder of the data processing system. In the naval sonar signal processing context, this output either alone, or in combination with overlapping similarly characterized time series signal distributions, will be used to determine whether or not a particular group of signals is white noise. If that group of signals is white noise, it commonly will be deleted from further data processing. Hence, it is contemplated that the present invention, which is not distribution dependent in its analysis as most prior art methods of signal analysis are, will be useful as a filter or otherwise in conjunction with current data processing methods and equipment.","In the above regards, it should be understood that the statistical bounds of the predicted number of occupied cells in a random distribution (including cells occupied by mere chance) mentioned above may be determined by a second calculator device using a so-called probability of false alarm rate. In this case, the actual number of occupied cells is compared with the number of cells falling within the statistical boundaries of the predicted number of occupied cells for a random distribution in making the randomness determination. This alternative embodiment of the invention has been found to increase the probability of being correct in making a randomness determination for any particular time series distribution of data points by as much as 60%.","The above and other novel features and advantages of the invention, including various novel details of construction and combination of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out by the claims. It will be understood that the particular device and method embodying the invention is shown and described herein by way of illustration only, and not as limitations on the invention. The principles and features of the invention may be employed in numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention in its broadest aspects.","Referring now to the drawings, a preferred embodiment of the dual method of the invention will be presented first from a theoretical perspective, and thereafter, in terms of a specific example. In this regard, it is to be understood that all data points are herein assumed to be expressed and operated upon by the various apparatus components in a Cartesian coordinate system. Accordingly, all measurement, signal and other data input existing in terms of other coordinate systems is assumed to have been re-expressed in a Cartesian coordinate system prior to its input into the inventive apparatus or the application of the inventive method thereto.","The invention starts from the preset capability of a display\/operating system  () to accommodate a set number of data points N in a given time interval \u0394t. The data points are dispersed in three-dimensional space with a first measure referred to as Y with magnitude \u0394Y=max(Y)\u2212min(Y), and a second measure referred to as Z with magnitude \u0394Z=max(Z)\u2212min(Z). A representation of a three-dimensional time series distribution of random data points  is shown in . A subset of this overall time series data distribution would normally be selected for analysis of its signal component distribution by this invention.","For purposes of mathematical analysis of the signal components, it is assumed that the product\/quantity given by \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z=[max(t)\u2212min(t)]*[max Y\u2212min(Y)]*[max(Z)\u2212min(Z)] will define the virtual volume , illustrated as containing the subset , with respect to the quantities in the analysis subsystem. The sides of virtual volume are drawn parallel to the time axis and other axes as shown. Then, for substantially the total volume of the display region, a Cartesian partition is superimposed on the region with each partition being a small cube of sides \u03b4 (see, ). The measure of  will be defined herein as: \n\n","The quantity k represents the total number of small cubes of volume \u03b4created in the volume \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z. Other than full cubes  are ignored in the analysis. The quantity of such cubes with which it is desired populate the display region is determined using the following relationship, wherein N is the maximum number of data points in the time series distribution, \u0394t, \u0394Y and \u0394Z are the Cartesian axis lengths, and the side lengths of each of the cubes is \u03b4: \n\n\nwhere int is the integer operator, \n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nwhere \n\n\nwhere \n\n\n","It is to be noted that in cases with very small amplitudes, it may occur that int (\u0394Y\/\u03b4)\u22661, int (\u0394Y\/\u03b4)\u22661, int (\u0394Z\/\u03b4)\u22661, or int(\u0394Y\/\u03b4)\u22661. In such cases, the solution is to round off either quantity to the next highest value (i.e., \u22672). This weakens the theoretical approach, but it allows for practical measurements to be made.","As an example of determining k, assume \u0394t (or N)=30, \u0394Y=20 and \u0394Z=9, then k=30 (from equations (2) through (4)) and \u03b4=5.65 (from equation (1)). In essence, therefore, the above relation defining the value k selects the number of cubes having sides of length \u03b4 and volume \u03b4, which fill up the total space \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z to the greatest extent possible, i.e., k*\u03b4\u2248\u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z.","From the selected partitioning parameter k, the region (volume) \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z is carved up into k cubes, with the sides of each cube being \u03b4 as defined above. In other words, the horizontal (or time) axis is marked off into intervals, exactly int(\u0394t\/\u03b4) of them, so that the time axis has the following arithmetic sequence of cuts (assuming that the time clock starts at \u0394t=0):\n\n","Likewise, the vertical (or first measurement) axis is cut up into intervals, exactly int(\u0394Y\/\u03b4) of them, so that the vertical axis has the following arithmetic sequence of cuts:\n\nmin(), min()+\u03b4, . . . , min()+(\u0394\u03b4)*\u03b4=max(),\n\nwhere min is the minimum operator and max is the maximum operator.\n","Similarly, the horizontal plane (or second measurement) axis is cut up into intervals, exactly int(\u0394Z\/\u03b4) of them, so that this horizontal plane axis has the following arithmetic sequence of cuts:\n\nmin(), min()+\u03b4, . . . , min()+(\u0394\/\u03b4)*\u03b4=max()\n","Based on the Poisson point process theory for a measurement set of data in a time interval \u0394t of measurements of magnitudes \u0394Y and \u0394Z, that data set is considered to be purely random (or \u201cwhite noise\u201d) if the number of partitions k are nonempty (i.e., contain at least one data point of the time series distribution thereof under analysis) to a specified degree. The expected number of nonempty partitions in a random distribution is given by the relationship:\n\n*(1)\u2003\u2003(5)\n\nwhere the quantity \u0398 is the expected proportion of nonempty partitions in a random distribution and N\/k is \u201cthe parameter of the spatial Poisson process\u201d corresponding to the average number of points observed across all three-dimensional subspace partitions.\n","The boundary, above and below k*\u0398, attributable to random variation and controlled by a false alarm rate is the so-called \u201ccritical region\u201d of the test. The quantity \u0398 not only represents (a) the expected proportion of nonempty cubic partitions in a random distribution, but also (b) the probability that one or more of the k cubic partitions is occupied by pure chance, as is well known to those in the art. The boundaries of the parameter k*\u0398 comprising random process are determined in the following way.","Let M be a random variable representing the integer number of occupied cubic partitions as illustratively shown in . Let m be an integer (sample) representation of M. Let mbe the quantity forming the lower random boundary of the statistic k*\u0398 given by the binomial criterion: \n\n\nB(m;k,\u0398) is the binomial probability function given as: \n\n\nwhere \n\n\nis the binomial coefficient, \n\n","The quantity \u03b1is the probability of coming closest to an exact value of the pre-specified false alarm probability \u03b1, and mis the largest value of m such that P(M\u2266m)\u2266\u03b1\/2. It is an objective of this method to minimize the difference between \u03b1 and \u03b1. The recommended probability of false alarm (PFA) values for differing values of spatial subsets k, and based on commonly accepted levels of statistical precision, are as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0053"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"PFA(\u03b1)","k"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0.01","k \u2267 25"]},{"entry":[{},"0.05","k < 25"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The upper boundary of the random process is called m, and is determined in a manner similar to the determination of m.","Thus, let mbe the upper random boundary of the statistic k*\u0398) given by: \n\n","The value \u03b1is the probability coming closest to an exact value of the pre-specified false alarm probability \u03b1, and Mis the largest value of m such that P(M\u2267m)\u2266\u03b1\/2. It is an objective of the invention to minimize the difference between \u03b1 and \u03b1.","Hence, the subsystem determines if the signal structure contains m points within the \u201ccritical region\u201d warranting a determination of \u201cnon-random\u201d, or else \u201crandom\u201d is the determination, with associated PFA of being wrong in the decision when \u201crandom\u201d is the decision.","The subsystem also assesses the random process hypothesis by testing:\n\n=\u0398(NOISE)\n\n\u2260\u0398(SIGNAL+NOISE),\n\nwhere {circumflex over (P)}=m\/k is the sample proportion of signal points contained in the k sub-region partitions of the space \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z observed in a given time series. As noted above,  shows what a hypothetical white noise (random) distribution looks like in Cartesian time-space.\n","Thus, if \u0398\u2248{circumflex over (P)}=m\/k, the observed distribution conforms to a random distribution corresponding to \u201cwhite noise\u201d.","The estimate for the proportion of k cells occupied by N measurements ({circumflex over (P)}) is developed in the following manner.

Cis labeled in an appropriate manner to identify each and every cube in the three space. Using the example given previously with N=\u0394t=30, \u0394Y=20, \u0394Z=9 and k=30=5*3*2, the cubes may be labeled using the index h running from 1 to 5, the index i running from 1 to 3 and the index j running from 1 to 2 (see ).","Next, to continue the example for k=30 shown in , define the following cube counting scoring scheme for the 5*3*2 partitioning comprising whole cube subsets: \n\n\nThus, Xis a dichotomous variable taking on the individual values of 1 if a cube Chas one or more objects present, and a value of 0 if the cube is empty.\n","Then calculate the proportion of 30 cells occupied in the partition region: \n\n","The generalization of this example to any sized table is obvious and within the scope of the present invention. For the general case, it will be appreciated that, for the statistics Xand C, the index h runs from 1 to int(\u0394t\/\u03b4), the index i runs from 1 to int(\u0394Y\/\u03b4) and the index j runs from 1 to int(\u0394Z\/\u03b4).","In addition, a conjoint, confirmatory measure useful in the interpretation of outcomes is the R ratio, defined as the ratio of observed to expected occupancy rates: \n\n\nThe range of values for R indicate:\n\n","The R statistic is used in conjunction with the formulation just described involving the binomial probability distribution and false alarm rate in deciding to accept or reject the \u201cwhite noise\u201d hypothesis. Its use is particularly warranted in very small samples (N<25). In actuality, R may never have a precise value of 1. Therefore, a new novel method is employed for determining randomness based on the R statistic of equation (8).","A rigorous statistical procedure has been developed to determine whether the observed R-value is indicative of \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201csignal\u201d. The procedure renders quantitatively the interpretations of the R-value whereas the prior art has relied primarily on intuitive interpretation or ad hoc methods, which can be erroneous.","In this formulation, one of two statistical assessment tests is utilized depending on the value of the parameter \u0398.","If \u0398\u22660.10, then a Poisson distribution is employed. To apply the Poisson test, the distribution of the N sample points is observed in the partitioned space. It will be appreciated that a data sweep across all cells within the space will detect some of the squares being empty, some containing k=1 points, k=2 points, k=3 points, and so on. The number of points in each k category is tabulated in a table such as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Frequency Table of Cell Counts"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"k","N"]},{"entry":[{},"(number of","(number of"]},{"entry":[{},"cells","points"]},{"entry":[{},"with points)","in k cells)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"0","N"]},{"entry":[{},"1","N"]},{"entry":[{},"2","N"]},{"entry":[{},"3","N"]},{"entry":[{},".","."]},{"entry":[{},".","."]},{"entry":[{},".","."]},{"entry":[{},"K","N"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"From this frequency table, two statistics are of interests for the Central Limit Theorem approximation:","The \u201ctotal\u201d, \n\n\nand (9)\n\nthe sample mean, \n\n","Then, if \u0398\u22660.10, the following binary hypothesis is of interest:\n\n:\u03bc=\u03bc(NOISE)\n\n:\u03bc\u2260\u03bc(SIGNAL)\n","The Poisson test statistic, derived from the Central Limit Theorem, Eq.

A value for N is first selected, here N=30 (step , ). A time series distribution of data points is then read into a display\/operating subsystem  adapted to accommodate a data set of size N from data processing system  (step ). Thereafter, the absolute value of the difference between the largest and the smallest data points for each measure, \u0394Y and, is determined by a first comparator device  (step ). In this example, it will be assumed that N=\u0394t=30 measurements with a measured amplitudes of \u0394Y=20 units and \u0394Z=9 units. The N, \u0394Y and \u0394Z values are then used by window creating device  to create a virtual volume in the display\/operating system enclosing the input time series distribution, the size of the volume so created being \u0394t*\u0394Y*\u0394Z=5400 units (step ).","Thereafter, as described above, the virtual volume is divided by the cube creating device  into a plurality k of cubes C(see ), each cube having the same geometric shape and enclosing an equal volume so as to substantially fill the virtual volume containing the input time series distribution set of data points (step ). The value of k is established by the relation given in equations (2) through (4): \n\n\n","Thus, the 5400 unitspace of the virtual volume is partitioned into 30 cubes of side 5.65 so that the whole space is filled (k*\u03b45400). The time-axis arithmetic sequence of cuts are: 0, 5.65, . . . , int(\u0394t\/\u03b4) \u03b4=28.2. The Y amplitude axis cuts are: min(Y), min(Y)+\u03b4, . . . , min(Y)+int(\u0394Y\/\u03b4)*\u03b4=max(Y) and the Z amplitude axis cuts are: min(Z), min(Z)+\u03b4, . . . , min(Z)+int (\u0394Z\/\u03b4)*\u03b4=max(Z).","Next, the probability false alarm rate is set at step  according to the value of k as discussed above. More particularly, in this case \u03b1=0.01, and the probability of a false alarm within the critical region is \u03b1\/2=0.005.","The randomness count is then calculated by first computing device  at step  according to the relation of equation (5):\n\n*(1)=30*0.632\u224518.96.\n\nTherefore, the number of cubes expected to be non-empty in this example, if the input time series distribution is random, is about 19.\n","The binomial distribution discussed above is then calculated by a second computing device  according to the relationships discussed above (step , ). Representative values for this distribution are shown in  for each number of possible occupied cells m for k=30 and \u0398=0.632.","The upper and lower randomness boundaries then are determined, also by second calculating device . Specifically, the lower boundary is calculated from  (step ) from the criterion P(M\u2266m)\u2266\u03b1\/2. Then, computing the binomial probabilities results in P(M\u226611)=0.00265. Thus, the lower bound is m=11.","The upper boundary, on the other hand, is the randomness boundary Mfrom the criterion P(M\u2267m)\u2266\u03b1\/2. Computing the binomial probabilities gives P(M\u226727)=0.00435; hence m=27 is taken as the upper bound (step ). The probabilities necessary for this calculation also are shown in .","Therefore, the critical region is defined in this example as m\u226611, and m\u226727 (step ).","The actual number of cells containing one or more data points of the time series distribution determined by analysis\/counter device  (step , ) is then used by divider  and a second comparator  in the determination of the randomness of the distribution (step , ). Specifically, using m=18 as an example, it will be seen that the sample statistic {circumflex over (P)}=m\/k=0.600, and that R={circumflex over (P)}\/\u0398=0.600\/0.632=0.94.","Steps , , , , ,  and  comprise the hereinearlier referred to first stage characterization process, hereby designed by the reference character (only ).","Branching to step  () which the sparse data decision logic module performs, the R statistic value of 0.94 is evaluated statistically. A more precise indicator is obtained by applying the significance test in accord with the present invention, as described earlier. For this calculation, we note that \u03b8=0.632, which invokes the Binomial probability model to test the hypothesis:\n\n\u03b8(NOISE)\n\n\u03b8(SIGNAL)\n\nIn this case, k\u03b8=18.96. Thus, applying the Binomial test gives: \n\n\nThe p value is computed to be: \n\n\nSince p=0.58 and \u03b1=0.1, and since p\u2267\u03b1, we conclude (step ) that the R test shows the volumetric data to be random (NOISE only, with 99% certainty) with the value of R=0.93 computed for this spatial distribution in 3D-space.\n","It is also worth noting in this regard that the total probability is 0.00265+0.00435=0.00700, which is the probability of being wrong in deciding \u201crandom\u201d. This value is less than the probability of a false alarm, PFA=0.01. Thus, the actual protection against an incorrect decision is much higher (by about 30%) than the a priori sampling plan specified.","Since m=18 falls inside of the critical region, i.e., m\u226618\u2266M, the decision is that the data represent an essentially white noise distribution (step ). Steps , , and  comprise the hereinearlier referred to second stage characterization process, hereby designated by the reference numeral  (only ). Accordingly, since both methods yield consistent results the distribution is labeled at step  by the labeling device  as a noise distribution, and transferred back to the data processing system  for further processing. In the naval sonar situation having a spatial component, a signal distribution labeled as white noise would be discarded by the processing system, but in some situations a further analysis of the white noise nature of the distribution would be possible. Similarly, the invention is contemplated to be useful as an improvement on systems that look for patterns and correlations among data points. For example, overlapping time series distributions might be analyzed in order to determine where a meaningful signal begins and ends.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which is shown an illustrative embodiment of the apparatus and method of the invention, from which its novel features and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sup":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
