title: Systems and methods for interacting with a user interface of a media player
abstract: Systems and methods for interfacing with playback of media by a media player are provided. By combining the functionality of fast forward and skip forward into a single button control, the invention reduces the numbers of control buttons that need be included on a device, reducing device costs and consumer “button overload.” In one embodiment, by pressing (and releasing) a forward button, media being rendered by a media player skips to a predetermined location in the media. By pressing and holding (and then releasing) the forward button, the media being rendered is fast forwarded according to algorithms for fast forwarding. A backward button covers skipping backward and fast reversing in a similar fashion. A device including a play/pause button and the described forward and backward buttons advantageously reduces the number of buttons required by two buttons.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice shall apply to this document: Copyright \u00a9 2003, Microsoft Corp.","This invention relates to an improved user interface for interacting with a media player. More particularly, this invention relates to a user interface that combines the functionality of multiple buttons to provide fewer buttons, e.g., for smaller form factor devices.","With the advent of portable digital media players of small form factor, there is a challenge in limiting the hardware button set to a useful and usable set. Typically, media players solve this problem by eliminating all but \u201cthe important\u201d controls and providing a subset of the controls found on larger audio\/video (A\/V) equipment consoles and digital media center remotes. For digital video and television (TV) scenarios, individual buttons have been separately, but collectively, provided for each of the following functions: Jump \u201cn seconds\u201d forward (or skip forward), Jump \u201cn seconds\u201d backward (or skip backward), Scan forward and Scan backward.","For illustrative purposes, an exemplary prior art media playback user interface is shown in . A play\/pause button PP toggles between rendering a designated selection of media and pausing the rendering of the selection. When the selection of media is being rendered, pressing the fast forward button FF causes the media to be rendered faster, allowing a user to move through the selection at a faster pace while still observing some characteristics of the selection to know when to stop fast forwarding the selection. Typically, pressing the fast forward button FF again causes the movie to return to the play speed, or causes the fast forward process to toggle through different speeds. Selecting the play\/pause button PP also generally returns the rendering of the media to play speed. Similar to the fast forward button FF, there is a fast rewind, or fast reverse, button FR, except that the media is rendered backward instead of forward.","The prior art user interface also includes a skip forward button SF and a skip backward button SB. The skip forward button SF either causes the next media selection in a set to be played or causes the rendering of the media to skip forward a predetermined distance, which may either be to a predetermined location (like the next chapter in a DVD rendering process) or may be to a predetermined time ahead (like 120 seconds ahead of a present location). The skip backward button SB works similarly, but once again, operates to cause the rendering of the media to skip backward a predetermined amount, as predetermined by location or time.","However, as noted, for smaller form factors, such as MP3 players, portable movie players and the like, there is a need to reduce the associated hardware set of buttons to a more efficient set in view of hardware real estate restrictions. Additionally, a small device with a multitude of buttons is intimidating from a user standpoint, regardless of real estate restrictions. Even if not intimidating, it would be desirable to reduce the cost of a device by providing a more efficient set of user interface controls. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved user interface for rendering media that addresses the problems presented by the state of the art.","In consideration of the shortcomings of the art, the present invention provides systems and methods for interfacing with a user interface of a media player. By combining the functionality of Fast Forward and Skip Forward into a single button control, the invention reduces the numbers of hardware control buttons that need be included on a device, reducing device costs and consumer \u201cbutton overload.\u201d In one embodiment, by pressing (and releasing) a forward button, media being rendered by a media player skips to a predetermined location in the media. By pressing and holding (and then releasing) the forward button, the media being rendered is fast forwarded according to algorithms for fast forwarding. A backward button covers skipping backward and fast reversing in a similar fashion. In one embodiment, the skip forward function of the forward button skips forward in the rendering of the media by a predetermined amount of time. In this regard, a device including a play\/pause button and forward and backward buttons in accordance with the invention advantageously reduces the number of buttons required of the design of the device by two buttons.","Other advantages and features of the invention are described below.","Overview","As mentioned, where the prior art provides separate buttons for each of skip backward, fast rewind, play\/pause, fast forward, and skip forward, the invention provides systems and methods for interfacing with the playback of media with three controls: backward, play\/pause and forward. The backward and forward buttons, skip or accelerate a playback rate depending on whether the button is clicked or pressed and held, respectively. Other features of the invention are described below.","Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments","One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the invention can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network, or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard, the present invention pertains to any computer system or environment having any number of memory or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units or volumes, which may be used in connection with processes for interfacing with media being rendered in accordance with the present invention. The present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or distributed computing environment, having remote or local storage. The present invention may also be applied to standalone computing devices, having programming language functionality, interpretation and execution capabilities for generating, receiving and transmitting information in connection with remote or local services. Media storage, retrieval and rendering are particularly relevant to those computing devices operating in a network or distributed computing environment, as sources for disparate types of media exist in many different places in a computing environment that is interconnected via a plurality of networks and thus the methods for interfacing with media rendering processes in accordance with the present invention can be applied with great efficacy in those environments.","Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information, cache storage and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity, allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard, a variety of devices may have applications, objects or resources that may be implicated by the methods for navigating the playing of media in accordance with the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["10","10","110","110","110","14","10","10","110","110","110"],"i":["a","b","a","b","c","a","b","a","b","c"]},"It can also be appreciated that an object, such as , may be hosted on another computing device , , etc. or , , etc. Thus, although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, personal or portable media players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects and the like.","There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many of the networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any of the infrastructures may be used for exemplary communications made incident to navigating media according to the present invention.","In home networking environments, there are at least four disparate network transport media that may each support a unique protocol, such as Power line, data (both wireless and wired), voice (e.g., telephone) and entertainment media. Most home control devices such as light switches and appliances may use power lines for connectivity. Data Services may enter the home as broadband (e.g., either DSL or Cable modem) and are accessible within the home using either wireless (e.g., HomeRF or 802.11x) or wired (e.g., Home PNA, Cat 5, Ethernet, even power line) connectivity. Voice traffic may enter the home either as wired (e.g., Cat 3) or wireless (e.g., cell phones) and may be distributed within the home using the associated wiring. Entertainment media, or other graphical data, may enter the home either through satellite or cable and is typically distributed in the home using coaxial cable. IEEE 1394 and DVI are also digital interconnects for clusters of media devices. All of these network environments and others that have emerged or may emerge as protocol standards may be interconnected to form a network, such as an intranet, that may be connected to the outside world by way of the Internet. In short, a variety of disparate sources exist for the storage and transmission of data, and consequently, moving forward, computing devices will require ways of sharing data, such as data accessed or utilized incident to program objects, which implicate the user interface experience enabled by the present invention.","The Internet commonly refers to the collection of networks and gateways that utilize the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) suite of protocols, which are well-known in the art of computer networking. The Internet can be described as a system of geographically distributed remote computer networks interconnected by computers executing networking protocols that allow users to interact and share information over the network(s). Because of such wide-spread information sharing, remote networks such as the Internet have thus far generally evolved into an open system for which developers can design software applications for performing specialized operations or services, essentially without restriction.","A network infrastructure enables a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. In client\/server architectures, for instance, the \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group. Thus, in computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. Typically, the client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , for example, computers , , etc. could be thought of as clients and computers , , etc. could be thought of as servers where servers , , etc. maintain data that is transmitted to the client computers , , etc. upon request, although any computer can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances. Any of these computing devices may be processing data or requesting services or tasks that may implicate the user interface of the invention.","A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software or media objects utilized pursuant to the user interface of the invention may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects. For instance, in a thin client computer, the user interface of the invention could be provided via a remoting protocol, such as the remote desktop protocol (RDP).","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d Typically, a computer network address, such as an IP address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL), can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","Thus,  illustrates an exemplary networked or distributed environment, with a server in communication with client computers via a network\/bus, in which the present invention may be employed. In more detail, a number of servers , , etc., are interconnected via a communications network\/bus , which may be a LAN, WAN, intranet, the Internet, etc., with a number of client or remote computing devices , , , , , etc., such as a portable computer, handheld computer, thin client, networked appliance, or other device, such as a VCR, TV, oven, light, heater and the like in accordance with the present invention. It is thus contemplated that the present invention may apply to any computing device in connection with which it is desirable to implement an improved experience for media interaction.","In a network environment in which the communications network\/bus  is the Internet, for example, the servers , , etc. could be Web servers with which the clients , , , , , etc. communicate via any of a number of known protocols, such as HTTP. Servers , , etc. may also serve as clients , , , , , etc., as may be characteristic of any distributed computing environment.","Communications may be wired or wireless, where appropriate. Client devices , , , , , etc. may or may not communicate via communications network\/bus , and may have independent communications associated therewith. For example, in the case of a TV or VCR, there may or may not be a networked aspect to the control thereof. Each client computer , , , , , etc. and server computer , , etc. may be equipped with various application program modules or objects  and with connections or access to various types of storage elements or objects, across which files or data streams may be stored or to which portion(s) of files or data streams may be downloaded, transmitted or migrated. Any one or more of computers , , , , etc. may be responsible for the maintenance and updating of a database  or other storage element, such as a database or memory  for storing data processed according to the invention. Thus, the present invention can be utilized in a computer network environment having client computers , , etc. that can access and interact with a computer network\/bus  and server computers , , etc. that may interact with client computers , , etc. and other like devices, and databases .","Exemplary Computing Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},"Although not required, the invention can partly be implemented via an operating system, for use by a developer of services for a device or object, and\/or included within application software that operates in connection with the user interface component(s) of the invention. Software may be described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more computers, such as client workstations, servers or other devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations and protocols.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["100","100","100","100"],"i":["a ","a ","a"]},"With reference to , an exemplary device for implementing the invention includes a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer . Components of computer may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit , a system memory , and a system bus that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit . The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.","Computer typically includes a variety of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer . By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CDROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory may include computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) and\/or random access memory (RAM). A basic input\/output system (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up or initiation of an application or user interface, may be stored in memory . Memory typically also contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit . By way of example, and not limitation, memory may also include an operating system, application programs, other program modules, and program data.","The computer may also include other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example, computer could include a hard disk drive that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media, a magnetic disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk, and\/or an optical disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk, such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable\/non-removable, volatile\/nonvolatile computer storage media that can be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM and the like. A hard disk drive is typically connected to the system bus through a non-removable memory interface such as an interface, and a magnetic disk drive or optical disk drive is typically connected to the system bus  by an interface, such as a removable memory interface.","A user may enter commands and information into the computer through input devices such as a keyboard and pointing device, commonly referred to as a mouse, trackball, touch pad, pen or stylus, etc. Other input devices may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through user input and associated interface(s) that are coupled to the system bus , but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A graphics subsystem may also be connected to the system bus . A monitor or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus via an interface, such as output interface , which may in turn communicate with video memory. In addition to a monitor, computers may also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and a printer, which may be connected through output interface ","The computer may operate in a networked or distributed environment using logical connections to one or more other remote computers, such as remote computer , which may in turn have media capabilities similar to, but different from device . The remote computer may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, or any other remote media consumption or transmission device, and may include any or all of the elements described above relative to the computer . The logical connections depicted in  include a network , such local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), but may also include other networks\/buses. Such networking environments are commonplace in homes, offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet.","When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer is connected to the LAN through a network interface or adapter. When used in a WAN networking environment, the computer typically includes a modem or other means for establishing communications over the WAN, such as the Internet. A modem, which may be internal or external, may be connected to the system bus via the user input interface of input , or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer , or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device. It will be appreciated that the network connections shown and described are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.","Exemplary Distributed Computing Frameworks or Architectures","Various distributed computing frameworks have been and are being developed in light of the convergence of personal computing and the Internet. Individuals and business users alike are provided with a seamlessly interoperable and Web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices, making computing activities increasingly Web browser or network-oriented.","For example, MICROSOFT\u00ae's managed code platform, i.e., .NET, includes servers, building-block services, such as Web-based data storage and downloadable device software. Generally speaking, the .NET platform provides (1) the ability to make the entire range of computing devices work together and to have user information automatically updated and synchronized on all of them, (2) increased interactive capability for Web pages, enabled by greater use of XML rather than HTML, (3) online services that feature customized access and delivery of products and services to the user from a central starting point for the management of various applications, such as e-mail, for example, or software, such as Office .NET, (4) centralized data storage, which increases efficiency and ease of access to information, as well as synchronization of information among users and devices, (5) the ability to integrate various communications media, such as e-mail, faxes, and telephones, (6) for developers, the ability to create reusable modules, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the number of programming errors and (7) many other cross-platform and language integration features as well.","While some exemplary embodiments herein are described in connection with software residing on a computing device, one or more portions of the invention may also be implemented via an operating system, application programming interface (API) or a \u201cmiddle man\u201d object, a control object, hardware, firmware, intermediate language instructions or objects, etc., such that the methods for interacting with a media rendering experience in accordance with the invention may be included in, supported in or accessed via all of the languages and services enabled by managed code, such as .NET code, and in other distributed computing frameworks as well.","Systems and Methods for Providing an Improved User Interface for Media Rendering","As mentioned, in recognition of the need for a stream-lined user interface for portable media players, the invention provides user interface objects that enable an efficient set of user interface controls. For instance, in accordance with exemplary implementation of the user interface controls of the invention, a designer of a portable media device may decide that when video is playing, each press on a forward button skips forward 29 seconds in the video and as the forward button continues to be held, the video playback rate increases from 2 to 120 times faster than the normal rate of rendering the video. Pre-identified key frames can be displayed for distinctness during the fast forward or skip process. Moreover, as illustrated in , a timeline TL representing the relative current position being rendered (and other positions) in the video may optionally be displayed via hashmark(s) HM. In one embodiment, during fast forwarding or skipping with the forward button, if key frames are not available, the frame at the time of pressing the button is displayed, the sound is not output, and a timeline is displayed to represent the forward progress being made in the media being rendered. An exemplary implementation of a timeline control is illustrated in .","Similarly, when implementing the controls of the invention, a designer of a portable media device may decide that, when video is playing, each press on a backward button skips backward 7 seconds in the video and as the backward button continues to be held, the video playback rate plays back in reverse from 2 to 120 times faster than the normal rate of rendering the video backwards. Pre-identified key frames can be displayed for distinctness during the fast forward or skip process.","In one implementation of the forward and backward buttons of the invention, when video is paused, either the behavior of the above-described \u201cmedia being rendered\u201d scenario applies, or alternatively, to facilitate navigation of video segments, including the beginning and end of the video file, e.g., recorded digital TV, a single press of the forward (or backward) button results in the illustration of position information on a timeline via hashmarks or the like, e.g., showing 15 minute intervals and moving to the next or previous hashmark based on the forward and backward button being pressed, respectively.","The hardware buttons and controls on a portable media device that may use the invention may fit into categories. For instance, the categories Power (ON\/OFF), Lock (LOCK), Playback (REV, PLAY, FF, and VOLUME), Navigation UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, OK, BACK and START) and Optional Presets (Optional Presents 1, 2, 3 and 4).","Exemplary descriptions of the function(s) of each button shown in  for a non-limiting embodiment of the invention are as follows:","ON\/OFF: to turn the device on and off.","LOCK: when the lock is engaged, all other controls are disabled. The device can be locked when it is on (e.g., while playing music) or when it is off. In one embodiment, when the device is locked, there is no indication in the UI that the device is locked.","REV (or FF): clicking this button jumps back (or forward) at a coarse level (tracks in music, key frames in video, pictures in a slideshow); press-and-holding this button scans backward (or forward) through the current media item, e.g., with a variable rate or with an accelerating scan.","PLAY: clicking this button toggles between play and paused state when the media is being rendered and PLAY, REV and FF affect playback of what is currently playing (or paused) as described in exemplary embodiments of the invention.","VOLUME: this control, e.g., dial control, allows the user to adjust the audio playback volume for the device. The volume setting applies to all audio output for the device: music, video and UI.","UP (or DOWN): when navigating a list of options, clicking this button selects the previous (or next) item in the list. For audio visualizations, for instance, the UP and DOWN button may move through the set of visualizations.","LEFT (or RIGHT): when navigating a band of screens, clicking this button moves the user left (or right) to the previous (or next) screen in the band.","OK: drills deeper into the selected item and on a leaf item, takes an action appropriate to it. For example, pressing OK on an artist name will take the user to a screen showing all the albums by that artist, pressing OK on one of those albums will take the user to a screen showing all the tracks on that album and pressing OK on one of the tracks begins playing the selected track.","BACK: moves outward to the previous screen or band of screens, e.g., opposite of the OK functionality.","START: moves to a root menu of the Library, i.e., the Start screen; if already at the root menu of the Library, this button moves the user to a \u201cNow Playing\u201d menu.","Optional Presets 1, 2, 3 and 4: clicking a preset button, for instance, may move the user to the \u201cNow Playing\u201d menu and begin playback of the media content associated with that preset button; press-and-holding a preset button may cause the preset button to become associated with the contents of the current screen. For example, if the user press-and-holds 1 on the screen showing all the albums by Beck, the first preset may be associated with all songs by Beck as a result.","Within the Now Playing menu, the playback controls (the REV, PLAY and FF buttons) may be used to control the playback of the currently playing media item. Also, if the user is listening to music while browsing in the library, the playback controls function the same way. If the media is playing, the \u201cplayback position\u201d is the place that is currently playing, e.g., \u201ctwo minutes into the third song in the playlist.\u201d If the media is paused, the \u201cplayback position\u201d is the place that will play when playback resumes.","Remote controls may still have separate skip and scan buttons for both forward and backward.","With respect to controlling music playback, in alternate non-limiting embodiments of the user interface controls of the invention, while music is playing (or is paused), the playback controls of the invention function as follows:","REV button: move backward by track (on click) and scan backward (on press-and-hold). Clicking the REV button moves the playback position to the start of the current track; if the playback position is already within a second of the start of the current track, the playback position is moved to the start of the previous track (in the current album or playlist); if already on the first track, clicking the REV button moves the playback position to the start of the first track. Press-and-holding the REV button results in an accelerating reverse scan of the music, depending upon the capabilities of the device. In one embodiment, the reverse scan continues across track boundaries, but stops at the start of the first song of an album, playlist, or queue. In other embodiments, the user can scan music while the music is paused, but after releasing the REV button, the music remains paused.","FF button: move forward by track (on click) and scan forward (on press-and-hold). Clicking the FF button moves the playback position to the start of the next track (in the current album or playlist); if already on the last track, the playback position is set to be the end of the last track. In various embodiments, press-and-holding the FF button results in an accelerating forward scan of the music. The forward scan continues across track boundaries, but stops at the end of the last song of the album, playlist, or queue that is being played. Also, in one embodiment, the user can scan music while the music is paused and after releasing the FF button, the music is still paused.","PLAY button: clicking the PLAY button toggles the play\/pause state; if music is paused, playback resumes; if music is playing, playback is paused.","With respect to controlling TV\/Video playback, in alternate non-limiting embodiments of the user interface controls of the invention, while TV or video content is playing (or is paused), the playback controls of the invention function as follows:","REV button: move backward by a fixed increment (on click) and scan backward (on press-and-hold). Clicking the REV button moves the playback position backward by a fixed increment (e.g., 8 seconds\u2014to replay something a user just missed). If this would move the playback position beyond the start of the video, then the playback position is moved to the start of the video. Press-and-holding the REV button results in an accelerating reverse scan of the video. The reverse scan stops at the start of the video. The user can scan while the video is paused and after releasing the REV button, the video remains paused.","FF button: move forward by a fixed increment (on click) and scan forward (on press-and-hold). Clicking the FF button moves the playback position forward by a fixed increment (e.g., 29 seconds\u2014to skip over a commercial). If this would move the playback position beyond the end of the video, then the playback position is moved to the end of the video. In one embodiment, press-and-holding the FF button results in an accelerating forward scan of the video. The forward scan stops at the end of the video. The user can scan while the video is paused and after releasing the FF button, the video remains paused.","PLAY button: clicking the PLAY button toggles the play\/pause state; if a video is paused, playback resumes; if a video is playing, playback is paused.","With respect to controlling slideshow playback, in alternate non-limiting embodiments of the user interface controls of the invention, while a slideshow is playing (or is paused), the playback controls of the invention function as follows:","REV button: move back to the previous slide (on click) and continuously move backward one slide at a time (on press-and-hold). Clicking the REV button moves back to the previous slide in the slideshow. If the user is already on the first slide in the slideshow, the user is taken to the last slide in the slideshow (i.e., the slideshow loops backward). Press-and-holding the REV button causes the slideshow to be shown rapidly in reverse, looping through to the end when the start of the slideshow is reached. In one embodiment, each picture is shown for a preset time, e.g., one second.","FF button: move forward to the next slide (on click) and continuously move forward one slide at a time (on press-and-hold). Clicking the FF button moves forward to the next slide in the slideshow. If the user is already on the last slide in the slideshow, the user is taken to the first slide in the slide show. Press-and-holding the FF button causes the slideshow to rapidly advance through the slideshow, looping to the beginning when the end of the slideshow is reached. In one embodiment, each picture is shown for a preset time, e.g., one second.","PLAY button: clicking the PLAY button toggles the play\/pause state; if the slideshow is paused, playback resumes; if the slideshow is playing, playback is paused. When a slideshow is paused, pictures are shown, but the slideshow does not automatically advance\u2014the user must manually move through the slides using the FF and REV buttons.","When viewing a slideshow while listening to music, in one embodiment, the playback controls control the music, and the up and down arrows move through the slideshow as described with respect to the FF and REV buttons above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["500","510","520","500","510","520","500","510","520","500","510","520"],"i":["a","a ","b ","b","b ","b ","b","b ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["600","610","630","600","640","600","650","660"]},"There are multiple ways of implementing the present invention, e.g., an appropriate API, tool kit, driver code, operating system, control, standalone or downloadable software object, etc. which enables applications and services to use the rich playback experience enabled by the systems and methods of the invention. The invention contemplates the use of the invention from the standpoint of an API (or other software object), as well as from a software or hardware object, such as a media player, that receives data, such as a media object, in accordance with the invention. Thus, various implementations of the invention described herein may have aspects that are wholly in hardware, partly in hardware and partly in software, as well as in software. For instance, the user interface controls and corresponding interfaces to a device and its display can be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination thereof.","As mentioned above, while exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures, the underlying concepts may be applied to any computing device or system in which it is desirable to temporally influence the playback or rendering of a software object. For instance, the algorithm(s) and hardware implementations of the invention may be applied to the operating system of a computing device, provided as a separate object on the device, as part of another object, as a reusable control, as a downloadable object from a server, as a \u201cmiddle man\u201d between a device or object and the network, as a distributed object, as hardware, in memory, a combination of any of the foregoing, etc. While exemplary programming languages, names and examples are chosen herein as representative of various choices, these languages, names and examples are not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous ways of providing object code and nomenclature that achieves the same, similar or equivalent functionality achieved by the various embodiments of the invention.","As mentioned, the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. Thus, the methods and apparatus of the present invention, or certain aspects or portions thereof, may take the form of program code (i.e., instructions) embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers, the computing device generally includes a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the user interface techniques of the present invention, e.g., through the use of a data processing API, reusable controls, or the like, are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language, and combined with hardware implementations.","The methods and apparatus of the present invention may also be practiced via communications embodied in the form of program code that is transmitted over some transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via any other form of transmission, wherein, when the program code is received and loaded into and executed by a machine, such as an EPROM, a gate array, a programmable logic device (PLD), a client computer, etc., the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program code combines with the processor to provide a unique apparatus that operates to invoke the functionality of the present invention. Additionally, any storage techniques used in connection with the present invention may invariably be a combination of hardware and software.","While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. For example, while exemplary network environments of the invention are described in the context of a networked environment, such as a peer to peer networked environment, one skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is not limited thereto, and that the methods, as described in the present application may apply to any computing device or environment, such as a gaming console, handheld computer, portable computer, media player, etc., whether wired or wireless, and may be applied to any number of such computing devices connected via a communications network, and interacting across the network. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that a variety of computer platforms, including handheld device operating systems and other application specific operating systems are contemplated, especially as the number of wireless networked devices continues to proliferate.","While exemplary embodiments refer to utilizing the present invention in the context of rendering media, the invention is not so limited, but rather may be implemented in connection with any kind of object that is capable of being rendered on a computing device. For instance, the rendering of DVDs, TV broadcasts, word processing files, spreadsheets, movies, music, advertisements, retail products, etc. can all be processed according to the present invention. For instance, the invention may be applied to the recording and subsequent playback of the operation of a specified application, for testing or debugging purposes. Still further, the present invention may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment, but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The systems and methods for providing an improved media rendering user interface in accordance with the present invention are further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
