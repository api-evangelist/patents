title: System and method to enable uplink control for restricted association networks
abstract: Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate resource management in a wireless communication system. Various techniques described herein can enable a network cell in a wireless communication system (e.g. a macro cell) to mitigate the effects of interference on other surrounding network cells (e.g., femto cells embedded within the coverage of the macro cell). For example, a network cell can allocate control resources that overlap control resources of a nearby cell and assign resources within the region of overlap only to users that will not cause substantial interference to the nearby cell. As another example, a network cell can utilize a control channelization that partially coincides with a control and/or random access channelization of a nearby cell. The network cell can subsequently elect not to use the control resources in the coinciding region in order to enable the nearby cell to control the effects of interference though data scheduling.

No. 61\/044,835, filed Apr. 14, 2008, and entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS TO ENABLE UPLINK CONTROL FOR RESTRICTED ASSOCIATION NETWORKS,\u201d the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","I. Field","The present disclosure relates generally to wireless communications, and more specifically to techniques for resource management in a wireless communication system.","II. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services; for instance, voice, video, packet data, broadcast, and messaging services can be provided via such wireless communication systems. These systems can be multiple-access systems that are capable of supporting communication for multiple terminals by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access systems include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems.","As the demand for high-rate and multimedia data services rapidly grows, there has been an effort toward implementation of efficient and robust communication systems with enhanced performance. For example, in recent years, users have started to replace fixed line communications with mobile communications and have increasingly demanded great voice quality, reliable service, and low prices.","In addition to mobile telephone networks currently in place, a new class of small base stations has emerged, which can be installed in the home of a user and provide indoor wireless coverage to mobile units using existing broadband Internet connections. Such personal miniature base stations are generally known as access point base stations, or, alternatively, Home Node B (HNB) or Femto cells. Typically, such miniature base stations are connected to the Internet and the network of a mobile operator via a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) router, cable modem, or the like.","Wireless communication systems can be configured to include a series of wireless access points, which can provide coverage for respective locations within the system. Such a network structure is generally referred to as a cellular network structure, and access points and\/or the locations they respectively serve in the network are generally referred to as cells.","Because the strength of a signal typically decreases as the distance over which it is communicated increases, a network user can, under various circumstances, exchange substantially strong signals with cells located physically close to the user as compared to cells that are located farther away from the user. However, for various reasons, a user may not communicate with a wireless communication system through the cell closest to the user. For example, due to differences in capabilities of respective cells in the network, a cell closest to a user may be unable to provide a desired service to a user or may only be capable of providing the service with a lesser quality than a cell located further away. As another example, a closest cell to a user may have restricted access such that the user is not authorized to connect to the cell.","In these and other similar situations, signals transmitted from a user to a serving cell for the user can additionally be observed at other cells whose coverage areas include the physical location of the user. Thus, if these cells attempt to communicate using the resources on which the user transmits to its serving cell, substantial interference can result. Accordingly, it would be desirable to implement resource management techniques for a wireless communication system that mitigate at least the above shortcomings.","The following presents a simplified summary of various aspects of the claimed subject matter in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements nor delineate the scope of such aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","According to an aspect, a method is described herein that can comprise identifying a network cell and a set of control resources associated with the network cell; allocating a set of control resources, wherein at least a portion of the allocated set of control resources overlaps at least a portion of the set of control resources associated with the identified network cell; and selecting control resources for subsequent use from among the allocated set of control resources such that the selected control resources are substantially free from interference caused by the set of control resources associated with the identified network cell.","A second aspect described herein relates to a wireless communications apparatus, which can comprise a memory that stores data relating to a neighboring network cell, a set of control resources used by the neighboring network cell, a system frequency band, and at least one terminal. The wireless communications apparatus can further comprise a processor configured to allocate control resources in the system frequency band such that the allocated control resources at least partially overlap the control resources used by the neighboring network cell and to select control resources for assignment to the at least one terminal such that the selected control resources are substantially free from interference from the control resources used by the neighboring network cell.","A third aspect relates to an apparatus, which can comprise means for identifying frequency subbands in use for control transmission at a neighboring cell having a coverage area that overlaps a coverage area associated with the apparatus; and means for allocating frequency subbands for control transmission such that the frequency subbands identified as in use for control transmission by the neighboring cell are allocated only to users outside the coverage area of the neighboring cell.","A fourth aspect relates to a computer program product, which can comprise a computer-readable medium that comprises code for causing a computer to identify an Evolved Node B (eNB) and a set of control resources used by the eNB; code for causing a computer to reserve control resources such that at least a portion of the allocated control resources overlap with the control resources used by the eNB; and code for causing a computer to allocate reserved control resources to at least one user such that control transmissions conducted by the eNB are substantially free from interference caused by control transmissions conducted by the at least one user over the allocated control resources.","A fifth aspect described herein relates to an integrated circuit that executes computer-executable instructions. The instructions can comprise identifying a neighboring cell; reserving a set of control resources from a system bandwidth; and allocating reserved control resources to respective users such that control transmissions conducted by the neighboring cell are substantially free from interference caused by control transmissions by the respective users over the allocated control resources.","Another aspect described herein relates to a method operable in a wireless communication system. The method can comprise identifying an overlap of control resources with a Radio Resource Control (RRC)-configured control region at a neighboring cell disparate from a serving cell; and conducting one or more transmissions using resources in the overlap of control resources such that the one or more transmissions have a reduced interference level due to RRC configuration at the neighboring cell.","A seventh aspect described herein relates to a wireless communications apparatus that can comprise a memory that stores data relating to a set of control resources that overlaps with a RRC-configured set of control resources at a non-serving eNB. The wireless communications apparatus can further comprise a processor configured to conduct at least one communication using the set of control resources stored by the memory such that the at least one transmission has reduced interference due to RRC configuration at the non-serving eNB.","An eighth aspect relates to an apparatus operable in a wireless communication system. The apparatus can comprise means for identifying uplink control resources that overlap with a RRC-configured control region at a neighboring non-serving cell; and means for conducting one or more transmissions on the identified uplink control resources with reduced interference due to RRC configuration at the neighboring non-serving cell.","An additional aspect described herein relates to a computer program product, which can include a computer-readable medium that comprises code for causing a computer to identify control resources that overlap with a RRC-configured control region at a neighboring non-serving cell; and code for causing a computer to perform at least one Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) transmission on the identified control resources with reduced interference due to RRC configuration at the neighboring non-serving cell.","A further aspect described herein relates to an integrated circuit that executes computer-executable instructions. The instructions can comprise obtaining information relating to a set of control resources that overlaps with a RRC-configured set of control resources at a non-serving eNB; and conducting at least one communication using the set of control resources for which information is obtained such that the at least one transmission has reduced interference due to RRC configuration at the non-serving eNB.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, one or more aspects of the claimed subject matter comprise the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the claimed subject matter. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the claimed subject matter can be employed. Further, the disclosed aspects are intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents.","Various aspects of the claimed subject matter are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent,\u201d \u201cmodule,\u201d \u201csystem,\u201d and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, an integrated circuit, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components can communicate by way of local and\/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and\/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).","Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a wireless terminal and\/or a base station. A wireless terminal can refer to a device providing voice and\/or data connectivity to a user. A wireless terminal can be connected to a computing device such as a laptop computer or desktop computer, or it can be a self contained device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). A wireless terminal can also be called a system, a subscriber unit, a subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, remote station, access point, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal can be a subscriber station, wireless device, cellular telephone, PCS telephone, cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem. A base station (e.g., access point or Node B) can refer to a device in an access network that communicates over the air-interface, through one or more sectors, with wireless terminals. The base station can act as a router between the wireless terminal and the rest of the access network, which can include an Internet Protocol (IP) network, by converting received air-interface frames to IP packets. The base station also coordinates management of attributes for the air interface.","Moreover, various functions described herein can be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions can be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media can be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk and blu-ray disc (BD), where disks usually reproduce data magnetically and discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.","Various techniques described herein can be used for various wireless communication systems, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems, Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) systems, and other such systems. The terms \u201csystem\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d are often used herein interchangeably. A CDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Additionally, CDMA2000 covers the IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system can implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM\u00ae, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an upcoming release that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project\u201d (3GPP). Further, CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named \u201c3rd Generation Partnership Project 2\u201d (3GPP2).","Various aspects will be presented in terms of systems that can include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems can include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and\/or can not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches can also be used.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrates a system  for coordinating control resources within a wireless communication system in accordance with various aspects described herein. As  illustrates, system  can include one or more user equipment units (UEs) , which can communicate with one or more Evolved Node Bs (eNBs)  and\/or . While only one UE  and two eNBs  and  are illustrated in , it should be appreciated that system  can include any number of UEs  and\/or eNBs  and\/or . Further, it can be appreciated that respective eNBs in system  can serve any suitable coverage area, such as an area associated with a macro cell, a femto cell (e.g., an access point base station or Home Node B (HNB)), and\/or any other suitable type of coverage area.","In accordance with one aspect, UE  can communicate with an eNB  designated as a serving eNB for UE  (e.g., eNB ). For example, UE  can conduct one or more uplink (UL, also referred to as reverse link (RL)) communications to eNB , and eNB can conduct one or more downlink (DL, also referred to as forward link (FL)) communications to UE . In the example illustrated by system , communications between UE  and eNB  are illustrated using a solid line. In one example, uplink and\/or downlink communication between UE  and eNB  can additionally result in interference to nearby eNBs, such as eNB . For example, if the coverage areas of multiple eNBs in system  overlap, a UE located in an area that lies in an overlap between the coverage of multiple eNBs can cause interference to one or more eNBs within range of the UE with which the UE is not communicating under various circumstances. This can occur, for example, in a system that includes femto cells if a UE is located within the coverage area of a femto cell, which in turn is embedded into the coverage area of a macro cell.","In accordance with one aspect, as the strength of a signal generally decreases as the distance over which it is communicated increases, UE  can, under various circumstances, exchange substantially strong signals with eNBs  and\/or  located physically close to UE  as compared to eNBs  and\/or  that are located farther away from UE . However, various factors can cause UE  to select an eNB  and\/or  other than an eNB  and\/or  that is closest to UE  for communication within system . For example, as a result of differences in capabilities of respective eNBs, an eNB closest to a UE may be unable to provide a desired service or may only be capable of providing the service with a lesser quality than an eNB located further away. Such differences in eNB capability could result from, for example, different transmit power levels, backhaul implementations, numbers of antennas utilized, duplexing capabilities (e.g., half-duplex vs. full-duplex), or the like. As another example, a closest eNB to a UE may have restricted access (e.g., the eNB may correspond to a restricted association network) such that the UE is not authorized to connect to the eNB.","In these and other similar situations, signals transmitted from a UE to a serving eNB  can interfere with other eNBs  whose coverage areas include the physical location of UE , which can result in significant outages and\/or other adverse effects. Accordingly, one or more eNBs  and\/or  in system  can include respective resource coordination modules  and\/or , which can operate to coordinate control resource usage between eNBs  and\/or  in system  in order to mitigate the effects of interference between entities in system . For example, if eNBs  and  are configured to utilize overlapping sets of control resources in frequency, resource coordination modules  and  at eNBs  and  can facilitate coordination between the overlapping control resources such that transmissions conducted over the overlapping resources from a given eNB do not interfere with communication at another nearby eNB. Specific techniques that can be utilized for resource coordination are provided in further detail infra.","In one example, resource coordination modules  and\/or  at respective eNBs  and\/or  in system  can facilitate communication between eNBs  and  (e.g., via backhaul messaging) to determine various frequency subbands to be utilized by the respective eNBs  and\/or  for control communication and\/or respective interlaces in time at which eNBs  and\/or  are to conduct control communications.","In another example, resource coordination modules  and\/or  at one or more eNBs  and\/or  in system  can coordinate control resources based on reports provided by a UE  via a channel reporting module  at UE  and\/or by other means. For example, UE  can identify one or more eNBs  and\/or  that provide service in an area in which UE  is located, relative observed signal strengths associated with respective eNBs  and\/or , respective control frequencies in use by respective eNBs  and\/or , and\/or other similar information. Based on reported information from a UE, an eNB  and\/or  can then adjust a utilized set of control resources to mitigate interference with other identified eNBs  and\/or .","In a further example, one or more eNBs  and\/or  in system  can coordinate control resources with the aid of an external system controller . System controller  can be, for example, a management server or entity for system  and\/or one or more areas within system . For example, system controller  can be a HNB Management Server (HMS) and\/or another suitable entity, which can coordinate the use of one or more channels within a given area (e.g. a neighborhood). In one example, system controller  can itself include a resource coordination module  and\/or any other appropriate component(s) for coordinating channel usage among eNBs  and\/or  in system , either independently or in cooperation with respective resource coordination modules  and\/or  at eNBs  and\/or . In another example, system controller  can communicate with eNBs  and\/or  via backhaul messaging and\/or by any other suitable means.","As further illustrated in system , UE  can include a processor  and\/or a memory , which can be utilized to implement some or all of the functionality of channel reporting module  and\/or any other component(s) of UE . Similarly,  illustrates that eNB  can include a processor  and\/or memory  to implement some or all of the functionality of resource coordination module  and\/or any other component(s) of eNB . While only eNB  is illustrated as including a processor  and memory  in , however, it should be appreciated that eNB  and\/or system controller  could additionally or alternatively implement a processor and\/or memory in a similar manner.","In accordance with one aspect, resource coordination modules , , and\/or  can utilize one or more techniques described infra to partition respective nodes and\/or cells (e.g. corresponding to respective eNBs  and\/or ) in system  such that the nodes utilize different channelization. It can be appreciated that these techniques can be utilized for any scenario in which interference is desirably mitigated, such as, for example, a scenario in which a first node is embedded into the coverage of a second node, a scenario in which a node does not always actively transmits and\/or receive and can potentially generate random interference during periods of inactivity, and\/or any other scenario.","Turning to , a system  that facilitates control transmission in a restricted association network in accordance with various aspects is illustrated. With regard to , it should be appreciated that system  is provided merely as an example of a network structure that can utilize the resource management techniques described herein and that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the claims are not intended to be limited to such a network structure.","As  illustrates, system  can include a femto cell  having an associated coverage area  and a macro cell  that is associated with a larger coverage area . In one example, the coverage area  of femto cell  can be embedded within the coverage area  of macro cell  such that the coverage area  of femto cell  is entirely contained within the coverage area  of macro cell . For example, femto cell  can provide communication coverage for a user residence and\/or a similar area, and macro cell  can provide coverage for a group of residences that includes a residence associated with femto cell . However, it should be appreciated that the techniques described herein do not require the coverage area  of femto cell  to be located entirely within the coverage area  of macro cell  and that the techniques described herein can be used to coordinate resources between cells having any degree of overlap.","In accordance with one aspect, femto cell  can be a restricted access network such that only UEs within a closed subgroup (CSG) associated with femto cell  are allowed to access femto cell . Access control can be performed at femto cell  by, for example, an access restriction module  and\/or any other suitable component associated with femto cell . Thus, if a given UE  within the coverage area  of femto cell  is not authorized to access femto cell , the UE  can be required to instead access a macro cell  that also provides coverage for the area in which UE  is located. In such an example, UE  may be required to conduct communication with macro cell  at a high rate of power due to, for example, the large coverage area  associated with macro cell . However, if UE  is located close to femto cell  (e.g., within coverage area ), high-power transmissions from UE  to macro cell  can cause significant interference and\/or outages to femto cell  if suitable interference management is not performed.","Accordingly, femto cell  and\/or macro cell  can utilize respective resource coordination modules  and\/or  or any other suitable functionality to coordinate and\/or negotiate a resource allocation policy between femto cell  and macro cell , thereby mitigating the effects of interference on femto cell  caused by UE  and\/or other similarly situated UEs. Additionally or alternatively, femto cell  and\/or macro cell  can leverage an external system management entity (e.g., system controller ) to aid in resource coordination.","In another example, femto cell  and\/or macro cell  can utilize reports provided by a channel reporting module  associated with UE  to infer whether UE  is causing interference to . An inference based on information from channel reporting module  can subsequently be utilized to tailor a specific resource allocation to UE . In a further example, macro cell  can include a scheduling component , which can be utilized to schedule transmissions to and\/or from UE  such that the transmissions substantially avoid causing interference to femto cell .","Referring now to , a set of diagrams - are provided that illustrate example frequency band allocations that can be utilized within a wireless communication system in accordance with various aspects. In accordance with one aspect, diagrams  and  represent uplink channelizations that can be utilized by, for example, systems , , and\/or any other suitable system.","In accordance with one aspect, an uplink channelization utilized by a wireless communication system can include one or more sets of resources  allocated for Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), Scheduling Request (SR), and\/or persistent acknowledgement (ACK) transmission. In one example, resource set  can be combined with one or more ACK channels  to form a Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) . As diagram  represents, resources for PUCCH  can be allocated at one or more ends of a system frequency band. Alternatively, as diagram  represents, resources for PUCCH  can be allocated at a central region of a system frequency band.","In one example, CQI resource blocks (RBs) can be allocated to predefined locations at the edge of the band or the center of the band, and respective mobile users (e.g., UEs  or ) can be assigned to particular CQI channel(s) using Layer 3 (L3) messages. In another example, configurations for SR and persistent ACK resources can be explicitly signaled to one or more mobile users in a similar manner to CQI resources. Accordingly, it can be appreciated that CQI, SR, and persistent ACK resources configured to be utilized by a given mobile user can be signaled to the user in a single L3 message, such as a Radio Resource Control (RRC) message and\/or any other suitable type of message.","In accordance with one aspect, ACK channels  can be allocated to RBs adjacent to RBs allocated for CQI such that each ACK channel is mapped to a corresponding Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) channel element location for scheduled DL data. In one example, allocations of ACK channels  to respective users can be dynamically selected and\/or changed for a user depending on DL resources utilized to communicate with the user. In accordance with another aspect, Random Access Channel (RACH) resources  can be allocated next to resources for PUCCH  in the frequency band. While RACH  is illustrated at only one end of the system frequency band in diagram  and at only one side of the PUCCH allocation  in diagram , it should be appreciated that RACH  can be allocated in any suitable location(s) within a system frequency band. Further, it can be appreciated that RACH  can occupy any suitable amount of resources in the system frequency band (e.g., 6 RBs or the like). In accordance with another aspect, remaining resources  in the system frequency band can be allocated for data transmission.","Turning now to , a diagram  is provided that illustrates a first resource management scheme that can be utilized to facilitate control transmission in a wireless communication system. As diagram  illustrates, resource management can be performed to manage interference between two cells in a wireless communication system having respective UL channelizations  and . In one example, UL channelization  corresponds to an unrestricted eNB (e.g., macro cell ) while UL channelization  corresponds to a restricted eNB (e.g., femto cell ). However, it should be appreciated that any set of two or more cells for which interference is desirably mitigated could utilize the techniques illustrated by diagram .","In accordance with one aspect, an eNB corresponding to channelization  can allocate a CQI\/SR\/Persistent ACK channel block such that it spans the UL control channel RBs (e.g., PUCCH) of one or more eNBs corresponding to channelization . Accordingly, within the CQI RBs at the eNB corresponding to channelization , terminals close to eNBs corresponding to channelization  can be allocated only CQI\/SR\/Persistent ACK channels that are orthogonal to the CQI and\/or ACK RBs of the eNBs corresponding to channelization .","In one example, a PUCCH allocation can occupy a relatively small portion of UL channelization  such as, for example, 1 RB on each side of the frequency band. Accordingly, a larger frequency portion (e.g., 2-3 RBs), can be utilized for CQI\/SR\/Persistent ACK transmission for UL channelization . Based on these resource allocations, an eNB associated with channelization  can allocate control resources such that a terminal close to an eNB associated with channelization  does not utilize CQI\/SR\/Persistent ACK resources within the frequency subset allocated within channelization . In one example, information collected from respective terminals relating to distance from an eNB associated with channelization  can be utilized such that overlapping control resources in channelizations  and  are only utilized by an eNB associated with channelization  for terminals outside the range of an eNB associated with channelization . Alternatively, an eNB associated with channelization  can instead not utilize overlapping control resources in channelizations  and  for any terminals, regardless of their location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","400","500","502","504","502","504","500"]},"In accordance with one aspect, an eNB corresponding to channelization  can allocate a PUCCH channel block such that it spans the UL control channel RBs of a neighboring eNB corresponding to channelization . As diagram  further illustrates, an eNB corresponding to channelization  can then only allocate PUCCH channels to respective users that are free of high interference. Thus, for example, a portion of the allocated PUCCH channel block that coincides with UL control channel resources at the eNB corresponding to channelization  can be reserved as unused such that no users are allocated resources from those resources.","In accordance with one aspect, PUCCH resources utilized by an eNB corresponding to channelization  can coincide with data and\/or random access resources used by an eNB corresponding to channelization . Accordingly, a scheduler at the eNB corresponding to channelization  (e.g., scheduling module ) can be utilized to schedule data transmissions on the portion of resources that coincides with PUCCH resources allocated at the eNB corresponding to channelization  such that the scheduled data transmissions do not cause interference to the control transmissions of the eNB corresponding to channelization . Thus, it can be appreciated that the resource management technique illustrated by diagram  differs from the resource management technique illustrated by diagram , wherein an eNB corresponding to channelization  schedules a smaller control block and is required to coordinate its control transmissions with an eNB corresponding to channelization  such that there is no overlap. In contrast, it can be appreciated that an eNB corresponding to channelization  as illustrated by diagram  will instead coordinate its data transmissions such that it is not interfering with control transmissions of an eNB corresponding to channelization .","In the specific example where the eNB corresponding to channelization  is an unrestricted macro cell and the eNB corresponding to channelization  is a restricted femto cell embedded within the macro cell, the macro cell can act as an aggressor to the femto cell in that, due to restricted association, a user associated with the macro cell can approach the femto cell without having access to the femto cell and interfere with signals used by the femto cell. Thus, as illustrated by diagram , a macro cell can withhold control transmission such that the femto cell can regulate control resources over its control resource allocation. Alternatively, as illustrated by diagram , the femto cell can instead overlap its control resources with the data resources of the macro cell such that scheduling constraints are imposed on the macro cell without impacting control transmissions at the macro cell.","In accordance with another aspect, in the case of RACH interference, the UL control channels at an eNB associated with channelization  can be punctured at one or more edges of the spectrum. In one example, the eNB associated with channelization  can modify the coding and modulation applied to PUCCH to take the effect of this puncturing into account.","Referring next to , a diagram  is provided that illustrates a third resource management scheme that can be utilized to facilitate control transmission in a wireless communication system. As diagram  illustrates, resources can be allocated by an eNB corresponding to channelization  in a similar manner to that shown in diagram  in order to avoid control signaling associated with an eNB associated with channelization . In addition, as diagram  further illustrates, additional control resources can be reserved as unused as shown in channelization  to avoid RACH signaling allocated in channelization . While diagram  illustrates that uneven reservations can be made along respective edges of a frequency band in order to avoid RACH signaling, resource reservations at respective edges of the frequency band can be equal in size and\/or allocated in any other suitable manner. Further, with respect to diagrams -, it should be appreciated that control channel signaling can occupy any suitable portion of the associated system frequency band.","Turning to , a diagram  is provided that illustrates an example technique for CQI measurement and reporting that can be utilized (e.g., by a UE ) in accordance with various aspects. In accordance with one aspect, the techniques illustrated by diagram  can be utilized in the case of synchronous networks to coordinate DL transmissions between unrestricted and restricted base stations by configuring low power subframes at the restricted base stations. In one example, low power subframes can be in the form of a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN), where only the first symbols (e.g., the first 1-2 symbols) are transmitted. In another example, low power subframes can be created by unrestricted eNBs sending signals with a very low power.","In accordance with one aspect, resource alignment can be performed in the time domain such that some subframes exhibit higher interference than other subframes. For example, in order for an unrestricted eNB to serve a UE that comes close to a restricted eNB, the unrestricted eNB can be required to spare the restricted eNB resources in frequency, time, or the like. This can be accomplished using low-power transmissions using MBSFN and\/or other suitable techniques, wherein only a small fraction of respective subframes carry information. Accordingly, when a UE reports its channel condition, the unrestricted serving eNB for the UE can be configured as shown in diagram  to take into account the operation of the restricted eNB. In a first example, subframes for resource coordination can be identified by a UE by determining low power subframes reserved by an unrestricted eNB through CQI reporting and\/or other means. Additionally or alternatively, subframes for CQI reporting can be scheduled at a UE by its serving eNB.","In accordance with another aspect, in order to provide reliable CQI information, CQI measurements can be limited to a subset of DL subframes. For example, UEs served by restricted eNBs can skip over lower power subframes for CQI measurement, as the pilot density and interference levels are different from the projected data transmissions. Additionally or alternatively, UEs that are served by unrestricted eNBs and are close to a restricted eNB can be scheduled to measure subframes that correspond to low power subframes at the restricted eNBs.","Diagram  illustrates an example CQI measurement scheme that corresponds to a 1 subframe delay and a 2 subframe measurement period. It should be appreciated, however, that any suitable delay and\/or measurement period can be utilized. As shown in diagram , UEs close to a restricted eNB (e.g., a restricted femto cell) can be allocated a particular CQI reporting subframe that corresponds to a desired set of measurement subframes. As diagram  further shows, UEs in the coverage area of the restricted eNB can skip over the low power subframes for CQI measurement.","As diagram  further illustrates, CQI reporting can be configured using a CQI delay and CQI management period such that if a UE is instructed to report CQI at a given time it will perform measurements in a predetermined manner. Thus, CQI reporting can be configured in accordance with one aspect such that no channel measurement is conducted by UEs served by a restricted eNB during times at which transmit power is being lowered for MBSFN subframes or the like.","Referring now to , methodologies that can be performed in accordance with various aspects set forth herein are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts can, in accordance with one or more aspects, occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein.

In one example, each data stream can then be transmitted via a respective transmit antenna . Additionally, TX data processor  can format, encode, and interleave traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for each respective data stream in order to provide coded data. In one example, the coded data for each data stream can then be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data can be, for example, a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner. Further, the pilot data can be used at receiver system  to estimate channel response. Back at transmitter system , the multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated (i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for each respective data stream in order to provide modulation symbols. In one example, data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed on and\/or provided by processor .","Next, modulation symbols for all data streams can be provided to a TX processor , which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM).

An RX MIMO\/data processor  can then receive and process the Nreceived symbol streams from Ntransceivers  based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N\u201cdetected\u201d symbol streams. In one example, each detected symbol stream can include symbols that are estimates of the modulation symbols transmitted for the corresponding data stream. RX processor  can then process each symbol stream at least in part by demodulating, deinterleaving, and decoding each detected symbol stream to recover traffic data for a corresponding data stream. Thus, the processing by RX processor  can be complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor  and TX data processor  at transmitter system .

Additionally, RX processor  can further estimate channel characteristics such as, for example, signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SNRs) of the detected symbol streams. RX processor  can then provide estimated channel characteristics to a processor . In one example, RX processor  and\/or processor  can further derive an estimate of the \u201coperating\u201d SNR for the system. Processor  can then provide channel state information (CSI), which can comprise information regarding the communication link and\/or the received data stream. This information can include, for example, the operating SNR.

In addition, a data source  at receiver system  can provide additional data to be processed by TX data processor .","Back at transmitter system , the modulated signals from receiver system  can then be received by antennas , conditioned by transceivers , demodulated by a demodulator , and processed by a RX data processor  to recover the CSI reported by receiver system .
