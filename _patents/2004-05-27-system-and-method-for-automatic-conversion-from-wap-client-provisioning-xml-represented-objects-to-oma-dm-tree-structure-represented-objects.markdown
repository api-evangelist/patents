title: System and method for automatic conversion from WAP client provisioning XML represented objects to OMA DM tree structure represented objects
abstract: A method and system automatically converts a Wireless Internet Protocol (WAP) Client Provisioning (CP) objects to Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) objects. WAP CP is enabled according to XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and defines a standard way to bootstrap mobile device's connectivity settings and application protocol access parameters using XML. OMA DM is also enabled according to XML and provides similar functionality, but is organized according to a mandated tree structure. The present invention automatically converts vendor specific parameters from WAP CP to OMA DM such that the vendor specific parameters are more easily managed by an OMA DM server and client.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE(S) TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is a utility patent application that claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/501,047 filed on Sep. 8, 2003.","Device management is a technology that provides customization, servicing, and personalization of mobile devices such as pen and keyboard-based handheld computers, wireless phones, pen tablets, notebooks, laptops, sensory devices, intelligent devices, embedded devices, and vehicle systems, not excluding any other mobile device. Device management also involves provisioning a mobile device, or providing the parameters to the mobile device to allow the functions of the mobile device to operate. Provisioning mobile devices can be difficult and time consuming. As the capability of mobile devices continues to increase, the number of parameters needed to be provisioned also increases.","Previously, the provisioning of a mobile device was standardized according to the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) developed by the WAP Forum as the de facto standard protocol. WAP may be described as a visual interactive computer telephone voice response system. More recently, the standardization for provisioning has been transitioned to the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and their Device Management (DM) protocol. However, the structure and operation of OMA DM is different than the structure and operation of WAP.","The present invention is directed towards providing a system and method for automatically converting WAP objects within the WAP structure to OMA DM objects within the OMA DM structure.","WAP may be described as a visual interactive computer telephone voice response system. WAP supports most wireless networks and WAP is supported by most operating systems. WAP Client Provisioning (WAP CP) defines a standard way to bootstrap mobile device's connectivity settings and application protocol access parameters using XML. These managed parameters may be extended to a broader range according to vendor specific applications while complying to the WAP CP XML DTD (Document Type Definition).","In contrast, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) Group defines WAP CP as bootstrap mobile device mechanism and OMA DM Protocol as continuous provisioning mechanism which uses a different XML DTD. Accordingly, the OMA DM structure is also enabled via XML, however the OMA DM is mandated to be organized in a tree structure with internal nodes and leaf nodes.","The present invention therefore defines an automatic algorithm to convert WAP CP XML represented vendor specific parameters to the nodes under OMA DM. By such a conversion, the bootstrapped WAP CP vendor specific parameters are more easily managed by an OMA DM server and client.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments for practicing the invention. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Among other things, the present invention may be embodied as methods or devices. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","Illustrative Operating Environment","With reference to , one exemplary system for implementing the invention includes a computing device, such as computing device . Computing device may be configured as a client, a server, mobile device, or any other computing device that provides client provisioning according to Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) guidelines. In a very basic configuration, computing device  typically includes at least one processing unit  and system memory . Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device, system memory  may be volatile (such as RAM), non-volatile (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or some combination of the two. System memory  typically includes an operating system , one or more applications , and may include program data . In one embodiment, application  includes a WAP to OMA DM conversion application . This basic configuration is illustrated in  by those components within dashed line .","Computing device  may have additional features or functionality. For example, computing device  may also include additional data storage devices (removable and\/or non-removable) such as, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in  by removable storage  and non-removable storage . Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. System memory , removable storage  and non-removable storage  are all examples of computer storage media. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by computing device . Any such computer storage media may be part of device . Computing device  may also have input device(s)  such as keyboard, mouse, pen, voice input device, touch input device, etc. Output device(s)  such as a display, speakers, printer, etc. may also be included.","Computing device  also contains communication connections  that allow the device to communicate with other computing devices , such as over a network. Communication connection  is one example of communication media. Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. The term computer readable media as used herein includes both storage media and communication media.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"In this embodiment, mobile device  has a processor , a memory , a display , and a keypad . Memory  generally includes both volatile memory (e.g., RAM) and non-volatile memory (e.g., ROM, Flash Memory, or the like). Mobile device  includes an operating system , which is resident in memory  and executes on processor . Keypad  may be a push button numeric dialing pad (such as on a typical telephone), a multi-key keyboard (such as a conventional keyboard), or may not be included in the mobile device in deference to a touch screen or stylus. Display  may be a liquid crystal display, or any other type of display commonly used in mobile computing devices. Display  may be touch-sensitive, and would then also act as an input device.","One or more application programs  are loaded into memory  and run on operating system . Examples of application programs include phone dialer programs, e-mail programs, scheduling programs, PIM (personal information management) programs, word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, Internet browser programs, and so forth. In one embodiment, application programs  include a WAP to OMA DM conversion application . Mobile device  also includes non-volatile storage  within the memory . Non-volatile storage  may be used to store persistent information which should not be lost if mobile device  is powered down. The applications  may use and store information in storage , such as e-mail or other messages used by an e-mail application, contact information used by a PIM, appointment information used by a scheduling program, documents used by a word processing application, and the like. A synchronization application also resides on the mobile device and is programmed to interact with a corresponding synchronization application resident on a host computer to keep the information stored in the storage  synchronized with corresponding information stored at the host computer.","Mobile device  has a power supply , which may be implemented as one or more batteries. Power supply  might further include an external power source, such as an AC adapter or a powered docking cradle that supplements or recharges the batteries.","Mobile device  is also shown with two types of external notification mechanisms: an LED  and an audio interface . These devices may be directly coupled to power supply  so that when activated, they remain on for a duration dictated by the notification mechanism even though processor  and other components might shut down to conserve battery power. LED  may be programmed to remain on indefinitely until the user takes action to indicate the powered-on status of the device. Audio interface  is used to provide audible signals to and receive audible signals from the user. For example, audio interface  may be coupled to a speaker for providing audible output and to a microphone for receiving audible input, such as to facilitate a telephone conversation.","Mobile device  also includes a radio  that performs the function of transmitting and receiving radio frequency communications. Radio  facilitates wireless connectivity between the mobile device  and the outside world, via a communications carrier or service provider. Transmissions to and from the radio  are conducted under control of the operating system . In other words, communications received by the radio  may be disseminated to application programs  via the operating system , and vice versa.","The radio  allows the mobile device  to communicate with other computing devices, such as over a network. The radio  is one example of communication media. Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery media. The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. The term computer readable media as used herein includes both storage media and communication media.","WAP to OMA DM Conversion Algorithm","The present invention is generally directed to converting WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) CP (Client Provisioning) XML (eXtensible Markup Language) objects to OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) DM (Device Management) objects. As used herein, \u201cobjects\u201d refers to parameters, tags, elements, attributes, content, internal nodes, leaf nodes, and other structures associated with both XML and the tree structure associated with OMA DM.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","310","330","320","310","312","312","320","330","316","340","340","350"]},"Initially, upon boot-up, mobile devices  and  do not include the parameters or settings required to contact services or content through various protocols, such as the WAP protocol. These non-bootstrapped mobile devices are not by themselves able to contact any kind of data service or contact through WAP. These mobile devices need to be loaded, or bootstrapped, with the connectivity information and settings. A provisioning application, such as  or , residing on mobile device  or mobile device , is configured to interact with device management application  on server  to manage the provisioning of the parameters and settings associated with the mobile device. The functionality that is initially provisioned to the mobile device could include network transport connectivity information, settings to change the default security model, application related settings, and other device settings.","Upon boot-up, server  bootstraps the mobile devices with provisioning information that defines connectivity parameters and settings associated with the mobile device. Applications  and  and device management application  may then communicate using any one of several client-server protocols.","Cellular\/pager network  is a network responsible for delivering messages to and receiving messages from wireless devices. Cellular\/pager network  may include both wireless and wired components. For example, cellular\/pager network may include a cellular tower that is linked to a wired telephone network. Typically, the cellular tower carries communication to and from mobile devices, such as cell phones, notebooks, pocket PCs, long-distance communication links, and the like. Server  may also locally connect with mobile devices via wired or wireless transport.","Gateway  routes messages between cellular\/pager network  and WAN\/LAN . For example, server  may send data addressed to mobile computing device  through gateway . Gateway  provides a means for transporting the message from the WAN\/LAN  to cellular\/pager network . Conversely, a user with a device connected to a cellular network may be accessing the Web. Gateway  allows hyperlink text protocol (HTTP) messages to be transferred between WAN\/LAN  and cellular\/pager network . More gateways may be used within the system (not shown).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"500"},"The term \u201celement\u201d refers to the basic unit of an XML document. The element may contain attributes, other elements, content, and other building blocks for an XML document.","The term \u201ctag\u201d refers to a command inserted in a document that delineates elements within an XML document. Each element can have no more than two tags: the start tag and the end tag. It is possible to have an empty element (with no content) in which case one tag is allowed.","The content between the tags is considered the element's \u201cchildren\u201d (or descendants). Hence, other elements embedded in the element's content are called \u201cchild elements\u201d or \u201cchild nodes\u201d of the element. Text embedded directly in the content of the element is considered the element's \u201cchild text nodes\u201d. Together, the child elements and the text within an element constitute that element's \u201ccontent\u201d.","The term \u201cattribute\u201d refers to an additional property set to a particular value and associated with the element. Elements may have an arbitrary number of attribute settings associated with them, including none. Attributes are used to associate additional information with an element that is not included in the element's content.","In this example, WAP CP XML section  includes WAP provisioning element as indicated by tag . A parent characteristic element is included in the WAP provisioning element of type \u201cTAPI\u201d as indicated by tag . TAPI is short for Telephony Application Programming Interface, which is an API for connecting a computing device to telephone services. The standard supports connections by individual computing devices as well as LAN connections serving many devices. Within each connection type, TAPI defines standards for simple call control and for manipulating call content.","The TAPI element includes a number of parameters (parm elements) within its content for controlling telephony aspects of a computing device. For example, parameter  is a parameter for enabling broadcast across a cellular network and its value is shown as set to \u201c1\u201d.","A child element is included in the TAPI element of type \u201cBusy\u201d as indicated by tag . Another child element is included in the Busy element of type \u201cVoice\u201d as indicated by tag . The voice element includes a number of other parameters (e.g., ) related to the voice aspects of the computing device. The WAP CP XML for these vendor specific parameters is therefore somewhat hierarchical with child elements included within other elements along with various parameters for controlling the telephony (in this example) of the computing device. Other embodiments may include other vendor specific parameters and settings than the telephony parameters shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":"500"},"OMA DM tree  forms from internal parent node  that illustrates that the following nodes correspond to vendor specific parameters and settings. Internal parent node  indicates that the nodes following internal node  are related to TAPI or telephony parameters of a computing device (similar to the TAPI element of ). As illustrated, TAPI  includes leaf nodes (e.g., leaf node ) for the various parameters associated with the telephony aspects of a computing device. These leaf nodes are generated from converting the parm elements included in the TAPI tag of  to an OMA DM tree structure.","TAPI  may also include other internal nodes, such as internal node . Internal node  corresponds to the busy element in  (child element of the TAPI element). Additionally, an internal node  is also generated that corresponds to the voice element of  (child element of the busy element). Voice  includes leaf nodes (e.g., ) that are associated with the voice aspects of a computing device. The example in  illustrates the result of a conversion by the algorithm of the present invention from WAP CP XML to OMA DM. The conversion process is described more fully below with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","610"]},"At block , the top level characteristic element (e.g.,  of ) in the WAP CP XML is converted to an interior parent node (e.g.,  of ) under the OMA DM tree structure. The interior parent node may be under any reasonable predefined OMA DM tree interior node. For example, the interior parent node may be placed under a node (e.g.,  of ) that indicates the vendor corresponding to the parameters following the interior parent node. Once the top level characteristic element is converted to an interior parent node, processing continues at block .","At block , the remaining characteristic elements (e.g.,  of ) in the WAP CP XML are converted to an interior nodes (e.g.,  of ) under the OMA DM tree structure. In one embodiment, the hierarchy of the interior nodes under the OMA DM structure are kept the same as the hierarchy of the characteristic elements in the WAP CP XML. Processing continues at block .","At block , the parm elements (e.g.,  in ) in the WAP CP XML are converted to leaf nodes (e.g.,  of ) under the OMA DM tree structure. In one embodiment, the name assigned to each leaf node corresponds to the name attribute of its corresponding parm element. For example, the name of a leaf node is \u201cVoicemail\u201d when the name attribute of the corresponding parm element is \u201cVoicemail\u201d. In a further embodiment, the value of the leaf node corresponds to the value attribute of the parm element. For example, the value of the leaf node is \u201c+14257059982\u201d when the value of the corresponding parm element equals \u201c+14257059982\u201d. In one embodiment, all the parm elements under a specific characteristic element in the WAP CP XML are converted as the children of the corresponding interior node under OMA DM that corresponds to the characteristic element. For example, in , a parm element with a name attribute of \u201cCountryCode\u201d is a child of the TAPI characteristic element. Correspondingly, in , a leaf node named \u201cCountryCode\u201d is also the child of the TAPI interior node. Once the parm elements are converted to leaf nodes, processing advances to an end block where process  ends.","The above specification, examples and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention.
