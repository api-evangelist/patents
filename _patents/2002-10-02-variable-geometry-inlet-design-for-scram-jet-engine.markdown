title: Variable geometry inlet design for scram jet engine
abstract: The present invention relates to an improved variable geometry inlet for a scram jet engine having at least one combustor module. The variable geometry inlet comprises each combustor module having two sidewalls. Each of the sidewalls has a central portion with a thickness and a tapered profile forward of the central portion. The tapered profile terminates in a sharp leading edge. The variable geometry inlet further comprises each module having a lower wall and a movable cowl flap positioned forward of the lower wall. The movable cowl flap has a leading edge and the leading edges of the sidewalls intersect the leading edge of the cowl flap.

A common approach is to use cowl inlet flap(s), whose position can be adjusted during flight. Several approaches to the design of a variable geometry inlet have been presented in the literature. They include, but are not limited to, those that incorporate in-stream strut actuation as shown in , a sidewall housed strut actuation as shown in , and a geared hinge actuation as shown in FIG. .","In-stream strut actuation provides a structurally efficient solution by distributing actuation loads across the width of the flap, but introduces undesirable flow disturbances in the inlet, and requires complicated sealing where the struts penetrate the body panel. Sidewall housed strut actuation eliminates the in-stream struts and their associated flow disturbances, but also requires complicated sealing where the actuation penetrates the extended sidewall structure. Geared hinge actuation eliminates the flow blockage and sealing issues, but requires a larger diameter hinge to house the gears, and is mechanically more complex.","A simple approach is required which eliminates the flow blockage of the in-stream struts, and eliminates the need for complicated seals.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved variable geometry inlet for a scram jet engine.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a variable geometry inlet as above which eliminates flow blockage and the need for complicated seals.","It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a variable geometry inlet as above which is simple in construction.","The foregoing objects are attained by the variable geometry inlet of the present invention.","In accordance with the present invention, a variable geometry inlet for a scram jet engine having at least one combustor module is provided. The variable geometry inlet broadly comprises each combustor module having two sidewalls and each said sidewall having a central portion with a thickness and a tapered profile forward of the central portion which terminates in a sharp leading edge. The variable geometry inlet further comprises each module having a lower wall and a movable cowl flap positioned forward of the lower wall. The movable cowl flap has a leading edge and the leading edges of the sidewalls intersect the cowl flap leading edge.","Other details of the variable geometry inlet design for scram jet engine of the present invention, as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto, are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrate a variable geometry inlet  for a scram jet engine which is designed to provide equal and adjustable flow  and , respectively, to each combustor module  of the engine. As can be seen from , the modules  each have the same width  and a lower surface . Positioned in front of each of the lower surface portions  of a respective module  is a movable cowl flap , , or .","The sidewalls  between adjacent modules  have a central portion  with a desired thickness and a tapered profile  forward of the central portion. The tapered profile  terminates in a sharp leading edge . As can be seen in , the edges  intersect at points  with the leading edges  of the respective cowl flaps , , and . Positioning the sidewall leading edges  in this way avoids potentially damaging \u201cType 4\u201d shock interactions on the sidewall leading edges . It also provides structural volume  to house actuation components .","The variable geometry inlet also has two outboard sidewalls . Each outboard sidewall  has a central portion  with a thickness and a tapered profile  forward of the central portion . Each tapered profile  has an outer surface with a first wall portion  extending in a first plane and a second wall portion  tapered inwardly and an inner surface having a third wall portion  extending substantially parallel to the first wall portion  and a fourth wall portion  tapering outwardly. The second wall portion  and the fourth wall portion  meet to form a sharp leading edge . As can be seen from , the leading edge  of each outboard sidewall  extends forward of the leading edges  of the interior sidewalls  and the leading edges  of the cowl flaps , , and .","As can be seen in , each of the cowl flaps , , and  has side edges  which are flared from a trailing edge  to the leading edge  so as to follow or mimic the profile of the leading edges  or  of an adjacent one of the sidewalls  or . Each of the cowl flaps , , and  is widest at its leading edge . This configuration defines a module capture width . To maintain equal capture width  for each module , the outboard flaps  and  are identical to the inboard flap(s)  and the outboard sidewalls  mimic the internal sidewall profile .","The flaps , , and  rotate about a respective hinge line  between the sidewalls  and . As a result, the sidewall leading edges  and  form a body of revolution  about the hinge line  in order to maintain a constant gap  between a respective side edge  of a respective flap ,  or  and an adjacent one of the sidewalls.","A swept extension  may be added to the outboard sidewall leading edges  to improve inlet performance by reducing local spillage.","The flap system described above is driven by appropriately sized actuators  that push or pull crank arms  which are rigidly attached to the cowl flaps , , and . Referring now to , it can be seen that the flaps , , and  are mechanically synchronized and pivot about hinge pins  and bearing arrangements  that are mechanically attached to the engine static structure  by one or more support blocks . The compact arrangement of these actuation components, as shown in , is important to minimizing sidewall thickness  in the central portions  and , reducing drag, and making efficient use of engine width.","It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a variable geometry inlet design for a scram jet engine which fully satisfies the objects, means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof, other alternatives, modifications, and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace those alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
