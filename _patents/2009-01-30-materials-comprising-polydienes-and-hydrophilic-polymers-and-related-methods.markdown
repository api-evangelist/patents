Current fuel cell membranes typically are based on polymeric materials, such as those available under the registered trademark NAFION\u00ae from E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, Del., United States of America. A NAFION\u00ae polymer is a perfluorinated polymer comprising low levels of ionic groups, which aggregate to form ionic, hydrophilic clusters. These hydrophilic clusters allow transport of water and ions across membranes formed from NAFION\u00ae polymer, making it a useful material for fuel cell membranes, catalysis, and templating.","PEMs based on NAFION\u00ae polymers have long been considered benchmarks in terms of performance characteristics. See Heitner-Wirguin, C., 120, 1-33 (1996). Fuel cell membranes based on NAFION\u00ae polymer suffer several disadvantages, however. For example, NAFION\u00ae polymer is expensive and typically cannot be used in applications requiring temperatures in excess of 100\u00b0 C. Also, the structure of NAFION\u00ae polymer is complex and not fully understood.","Further, the current class of PEM fuel cells, which typically operate at about 90\u00b0 C., is hampered by sensitivities to carbon monoxide (CO) and peroxide formation that limit performance and require the use of high purity fuels. To overcome such sensitivities to CO, complex systems are required to remove CO from the fuel. Further, platinum catalysts typically are required on the anode to minimize the effect of CO on membrane polarization. A polymeric membrane capable of operating at elevated temperatures (e.g., temperatures above about 150\u00b0 C.) would largely eliminate such concerns, because CO adsorption is no longer kinetically favorable at those temperatures.","Given the importance of practical operations of fuel cells with high performance, low cost, and extended lifetimes, various approaches to the synthesis and characterization of PEM materials have been reported. Doyle et al., 147, 34-37 (2001), have reviewed a number of alternative PEM systems, including polymer systems doped with acids or ionic liquids. Inorganic dopants and hybridization procedures also have been used in an effort to improve mechanical, thermal, and water sorption properties of NAFION\u00ae-based PEMs. See Deng. Q., et al., 68, 747-763 (1998); Antonucci, P. L., et al., 125, 431-437 (1999).","There exists, however, a need in the art for improved materials for PEMs, in particular PEMs for sustained operation in fuel cells at elevated temperatures (e.g., temperatures above about 120\u00b0 C., or in some cases temperatures above about 150\u00b0 C.).","Further, there exists a need in the art for improved fabrics, for example for use in breathable chemical and biological protective clothing for military personnel, emergency response teams, industrial and\/or agricultural workers and other applications, and healthcare professionals. Standard protective clothing is made largely from butyl rubber (BR), a material whose impermeability provides an excellent level of protection, but also traps heat and moisture inside the garments. BR garments also are bulky and limit dexterity. For example, a particular problem with gloves made from BR materials is that they constrain hand movement. In a desert combat environment these problems could result in more than simple discomfort and inconvenience.","Thus, there is a need in the art for improved materials for use as fuel cell membranes and as a fabric, for example for use in breathable chemical-biological protective clothing.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method for forming a copolymer comprising a fluorinated polydiene and a sulfonated polystyrene, the method comprising:\n\n","In some embodiments, the copolymer comprising a fluorinated polydiene and a sulfonated polystyrene comprises an architecture selected from the group consisting of a diblock copolymer, a triblock copolymer, a statistical copolymer, a graft copolymer, and a miktoarm star copolymer.","In some embodiments, the polydiene component is selected from the group consisting of 1,4-polybutadiene, poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene), and polyisoprene.

B., et al., 19, 595 (1986), using PhHgCFas the fluorine source, and by Thomson, M. W., 22, 481 (1989), via irradiation of chlorofluorocarbons. Further, Ren, Y., et al., 120, 6830 (1998), have reported a facile method for fluorination of polydienes based upon difluorocarbene addition. This reaction employs the relatively inexpensive hexafluoropropylene oxide as a reagent and does not lead to substantial chain scission or crosslinking.","For example, when polybutadiene with a high 1,4-microstructure is treated with hexafluoropropylene oxide, the conversion is quantitative and the resulting semicrystalline polymer has a Tof 89\u00b0 C., a Tof 150\u00b0 C., and exhibits good thermal stability. A sample of similarly fluorinated polyisoprene retained 99.7% of its weight when heated at 200\u00b0 C. under nitrogen for one hour. See Ren, Y., et al., 120, 6830 (1998). Analogous chemistries carried out on 1,4-polyisoprene, as well as polycyclohexadiene, yield an amorphous product, which also is of interest.","Copolymers of butadiene and styrene can be produced with a range of architectures encompassing diblock, triblock, statistical, and graft copolymers. Triblock copolymers of styrene and butadiene make up a commercially important class of thermoplastic elastomers. When anionic polymerization is employed in the synthesis, well-defined structures having controlled molecular weights, compositions, and narrow polydispersities can be synthesized.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the synthesis of block and graft copolymers of fluorinated polydienes (e.g., butadiene, isoprene, and cyclohexadiene) and polystyrene sulfonate occurs in three steps: (1) synthesis of the polystyrene (PS)-polydiene block copolymer comprising the desired architecture and composition, (2) fluorination of the polydiene blocks, and (3) sulfonation of the PS blocks to yield the final product. The first two steps can yield two other block copolymer materials, a conventional PS-polydiene, as well as a fluorinated polydiene-PS material.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the polybutadiene block of such materials can be partially fluorinated by reaction with difluorocarbene (or perfluoroalkyl iodides\u2014see Scheme 1 below), followed by sulfonation of the polystyrene blocks. After fluorination of the polybutadiene component, the polystyrene segments can be sulfonated using reagents, such as acetyl sulfate or sulfur trioxide, to form poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0121"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"172.80mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08061533-20111122-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS) is an effective proton conductor. In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, if the composition of the copolymer is chosen so that the fluorinated polybutadiene (FPB) volume fraction is considerably larger than the PSS volume fraction, i.e., the content of sulfonated polystyrene in the copolymer is relatively low, then a structure having a hydrophobic semi-crystalline continuous phase containing dispersed nanoscale ionic channels is obtained via self-assembly. By tuning the composition, molecular weight, and architecture (readily done using anionic polymerization), the morphology, structure, and properties is manipulated.","Less pronounced hydrophobic\/hydrophilic phase separation, which would be present in an FPB\/PSS copolymer as compared to NAFION\u00ae material, can lead to advantages in methanol fuel cells due to their difference in permeability. While these native FPB\/PSS copolymer materials might lack adequate thermal stability for use in methanol fuel cells well above 100\u00b0 C., they can be provided at low cost. Also, subsequent modification to form inorganic hybrid materials can be used to improve their high-temperature capability.","Within the context of fuel cells, less distinct phase separated morphologies are beneficial in the sense of less-tortuous proton hopping pathways. The process of fluorination, as described herein below, increases chemical stability. With regard to thermal and morphological stability, insertion of inorganic oxide nanostructures into the hard block regions lock in the phase-separated morphology at temperatures around or exceeding 100\u00b0 C. in the case of membranes expected to operate at high temperatures. Further, by tailoring gradients of intimately incorporated inorganic oxide nanostructures, water activity gradients are generated for the purpose of water management optimization.","Triblock copolymers of styrene and butadiene make up a commercially important class of thermoplastic elastomers. The polybutadiene (PBD) block of such materials can be partially fluorinated by reaction with difluorocarbene, followed by sulfonation of the polystyrene blocks.","A series of ABA triblock copolymers are synthesized, in which the outer A blocks are polydiene, e.g., isoprene (IS), polybutadiene (PBD), and cyclohexadiene (CHD), and the inner B block is polystyrene (PS). This arrangement is the opposite block arrangement to the normal thermoplastic elastomer KRATON-like materials (KRATON Polymers U.S. LLC, Houston, Tex., United States of America) in which the PS blocks are in the A position on the ends of the molecule to provide mechanical reinforcement. In some embodiments, the PS blocks are sulfonated. In some embodiments, the PS blocks are hydrated. In embodiments wherein the PS blocks are hydrated, the PS blocks can be plasticized in the end-use application.","Once fluorinated, the polydiene blocks become strongly hydrophobic and mechanically stiffened. The fluorinated PBD is semicrystalline with a melting temperature of about 150\u00b0 C., and the fluorinated polycyclohexadiene (PCHD) is an amorphous material with a high T. Hydrogenated PCHD is known have a Tbetween about 200\u00b0 C. and about 250\u00b0 C., depending on microstructure. Thus, in some embodiments, the polydienes of the presently disclosed subject matter fulfill a mechanically toughening role.","III.A. Synthesis of Linear ABA Triblocks","Linear triblock copolymers of an ABA architecture, wherein A is polybutadiene (PBD) or polyisoprene (PI) and B is polystyrene (PS), can be prepared. The logic of starting with a simple linear architecture is the ease of synthesis of these materials and the well-known good mechanical properties of the ABA architecture. In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, these materials are made using anionic polymerization and all-glass reactors with breakseals. In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, a double diphenylethylene lithium-based initiator (see below) is used in benzene (with addition of lithium butoxide) at room temperature in the synthesis of the middle block.","A sample of the PS is then taken for characterization and the diene, i.e., either PBD or PI, is added to the reactor to grow the triblock. An advantage of this method is in allowing the synthesis of high 1,4-polydiene (addition of lithium butoxide has minimal effect on microstructure). This synthetic approach also facilitates rigorous characterization of the products.","III.B. Fluorination and Sulfonation Procedures","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, cyclohexane solutions of the styrene\/diene copolymers are subjected to hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO) at 180\u00b0 C. using a high-pressure reactor as reported by Ren. Y., et al., 120, 6830 (1998) in the presence of butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT). At this temperature, HFPO generates difluorocarbene, which selectively adds to dienic unsaturation. The fluorinated products are then isolated, characterized and subjected to sulfonation. Higher fluorine levels can be incorporated through addition of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the diene double bonds, as reported by Ren, Y., et al., 34, 4780 (2001), in which optimized reaction conditions for modification of a styrene-butadiene diblock copolymer can lead to consumption of 95% of the double bonds in the diene block, while preserving the narrow molecular weight distribution.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the PS segments are sulfonated using a SO\/triethylphosphate complex or with acetylsulfate. The former system is most useful for carrying out exhaustive sulfonation of the PS segments, whereas the latter system is effective for carrying out partial sulfonation. In some embodiments, the sulfonations are carried out in a chloroalkane, such as dichloroethane, at ambient or lower temperatures. For polymers containing fluorinated 1,4-PBD segments, however, sulfonations are conducted on solutions at higher temperatures or on thin films of polymer due to the more limited solubilities of these materials.","In some embodiments, materials with initial PS volume fractions of about 0.18 are provided to form PS cylinders in a polydiene matrix. This composition is formulated toward the lower end of the PS cylinder volume fraction range to accommodate some PS volume fraction increase upon sulfonation without pushing the samples out of the cylindrical morphology. Holding the PS volume fraction as constant as possible, the molecular weight of the overall material is varied from a low of about 20,000 g\/mol to a high value depending upon whether (1) the polydiene block is PBD (high of 200,000 g\/mol) or (2) PCHD (high of 30,000 g\/mol). The overall molecular weight of the PCHD-containing materials is limited by synthetic difficulties in achieving PCHD block molecular weights greater than about 30,000 g\/mol. See Hong, K. and Mays, J. W., 34, 3540 (2001); Hong. K. and Mays, J. W., 34, 782 (2001); and Hong, K., et al., Macromolecules, 34, 2482 (2001).","The full molecular weight range is spanned by 4 to 5 samples for each of these two embodiments. For instance, for PS-PBD, the molecular weight ranges from 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 150,000; and 200,000 g\/mol total molecular weight with PS volume fraction about 0.18 in all samples. The molecular weight ranges from about 10,000 g\/mol to about 50,000 g\/mol for PS-PCHD.","Samples from these series are obtained as original PS-polydiene materials, as fluorinated materials, and as fluorinated and sulfonated materials for morphology and properties evaluation.","A series of ABA triblock copolymers are provided in which the outer A blocks comprise polydiene and the inner B block comprises polystyrene (PS) or poly(\u03b1-methylstyrene) (P\u03b1MS). Materials with initial PS volume fractions of around 0.45 are prepared to form alternating PS\/polydiene lamellae. This composition is formulated toward the lower end of the PS volume fraction range for lamellae to accommodate some PS volume fraction increase upon sulfonation without pushing the samples out of the lamellar morphology. Holding the PS volume fraction as constant as possible, the molecular weight of the overall material from a low of about 20,000 g\/mol to a high value depending upon whether the polydiene block is (1) PBD (high of 200,000 g\/mol) or (2) PCHD (high of 110,000 g\/mol). The full molecular weight range is spanned by 4 to 5 samples for each of these two embodiments. For instance, for PS-PBD the molecular weight ranges from 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 150,000; and 200,000 g\/mol total molecular weight with a PS volume fraction of 0.45 in all samples. Samples from these series are obtained as original PS-polydiene materials, as fluorinated materials, and as fluorinated and sulfonated materials for morphology and properties evaluation. Molecular weight ranges similar to those observed for PS-PBD are obtained for P\u03b1MS-PBD, whereas a lower molecular weight ranging from about 10,000 g\/mol to about 50,000 g\/mol is obtained for PS-PCHD and P\u03b1MS-PCHD.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the aim to produce a self-reinforcing rigid matrix of the fluorinated PBD (semicrystalline) or PCHD (high T) surrounding sulfonated PS cylinders is addressed by starting with the following architectures of polydiene backbones and PS grafts: grafted PS blocks at trifunctional (comb), tetrafunctional (centipede) or hexafunctional (barbwire) branch points as provided in . Thus, the synthesis of the initial molecular architectures uses the chemical strategies as provided immediately herein below for constructing well-defined branched and grated molecular architectures in PBD-PS materials as a route to achieving these architectures in the fluorinated and sulfonated materials.","Accordingly, provided herein below is an overview of the strategies employed to make (a) single branch point mixed arm star architectures, and (b) multigraft copolymers with regularly spaced branched points of controlled functionality.","V.A.

Branched and Grafted Block Copolymer Molecular Architecture","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, chlorosilane coupling agents are used to link together living PS and PBD chains, which have been synthesized anionically. The final structure is precisely controlled with regard to the molecular weights of the PS graft blocks and the molecular weights of the PBD connectors between each grafting point. The end-linking chemistry, however, is similar kinetically to a condensation polymerization (step growth) and thus produces a distribution of total molecular weights, i.e. there is a distribution in the total PBD backbone length and the number of PS grafts. Previous work has demonstrated that near-monodisperse samples of graft copolymer with a precise number of grafts can be obtained from the overall reaction product by solvent-nonsolvent fractionation. See Beyer et al., 33, 2039 (2000).","In cases where degradation of chlorosilane-linked polymers at the branch point(s) occurs, more robust multigraft structures can be synthesized by metallating anionically produced polybutadiene (or polyisoprene) with BuLi\/tetramethylethylene diamine, followed by polymerization of styrene from the anions created along the polymer backbone. See Hadjichristidis, N. and Roovers, J. E. L., 16, 851 (1978). This method yields well-defined materials comprising a comb-like architecture where branches are randomly placed along the polymer backbone. Kennedy, J. P. and Delvaux, J. M., 38, 141 (1981), previously reported superior mechanical properties for poly(isobutylene-g-styrene)s of this architecture. Further, morphological work by Xenidou, et al., 31, 7659 (1998) has shown that the constituting block copolymer principle relating graft molecular architecture to morphology can be extended in an average sense to these more architecturally varied materials.","Fluorination and sulfonation procedures of the branched and grafted copolymers disclosed immediately hereinabove are carried out as described hereinabove for the triblock case, with modification as needed.","Using the chlorosilane coupling approach to multigrafts, samples with PS cylindrical domains in a PBD matrix with trifunctional (comb), tetrafunctional (centipede), and hexafunctional (barbwire) junction point architecture can be produced. Due to the effect of branch point functionality on morphology, the volume fraction range of PS in which cylinders is produced varies as the junction point functionality varies. To produce cylinders, the trifunctional comb sample has a PS volume fraction of about 0.40; the tetrafunctional centipede has a PS volume fraction of about 0.20; and the hexafunctional barbwire has a PS volume fraction of about 0.10. Thus, these embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter provide an effect on the relative size of the cylindrical domains (with respect to the matrix) for desired properties.","Further, the polycondensation reaction of macromonomers by which the regular multigraft structures are produced, yields a distribution (polydispersity index (PDI) of about 2) of molecular weight in which all species have the same structure per junction point, but vary in the number of junction points linked along the backbone. Also, fractionation can be used to isolate different fractions with identical structure per junction point, but different (low, middle, and high) average numbers of junction point per molecule. See Beyer, F. L., et al., 33, 2039 (2000); Uhrig, D. and Mays, J. W., 35, 7182 (2002); Iatrou, H., et al., 31, 6697 (1998) and Nakamura, Y., et al., 33, 8323 (2000).","Although these low, middle, and high molecular weight fractions tend to form the same general morphology, cylinders for instance, they differ greatly in the degree of long-range order that can be achieved in the microstructure. The larger the number of junction points per molecule (molecular weight), the poorer the long-range order produced. By examining low, middle and high molecular weight fractions of the overall structure produced by the polycondensation of macromonomers, the influence of microstructural order on mechanical and transport properties can be compared and modified as desired. For example, samples with a high number of junction points per molecule, which, although microphase-separated, did not display long-range order, have been found to exhibit excellent tensile mechanical properties.

The basic strategy, shown in Scheme 2, is similar to that disclosed hereinabove. As shown in Scheme 2, the polycyclohexadiene (PCHD) units in the copolymer are fluorinated using difluorocarbene, followed by sulfonation of P\u03b1MS. Based on the known characteristics of PCHD (Tof about 150\u00b0 C., semicrystalline, ring structure) this material is expected to form a semicrystalline matrix of good thermal stability and high T. The P\u03b1MS segments are sulfonated (P\u03b1MSS) to facilitate proton transport.","The choice of \u03b1MS and a statistical, rather than block, copolymer is based, in part, on two reasons. First, the substitution of the tertiary hydrogen in polystyrene, which is susceptible to oxidative attack by Oor HO, with a methyl group provides a more stable material in membrane applications.

The more weakly phase-separated morphologies formed by these systems can, as discussed hereinabove, offer permeability characteristics favorable for use in methanol fuel cells, coupled with improved thermal stability.

The polymer is then covalently crosslinked (polydiene vulcanization, e.g., with peroxides), thus stabilizing the size and shape of the membrane. In some embodiments, PCHD solutions are covalently crosslinked using sulfur monochloride. The degree of crosslinking can range from about 4% to about 20%, from about 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19% to about 20%. In some embodiments, a chemical dehydrogenation step to aromatize the polymer (i.e., converting it into poly(phenylene)) using p-chloranil, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ), or related reagents is then carried out, see Williamson, D. T., et al., 43(2), 1201 (2002), followed by sulfonation. For example, the sulfonation of low molecular weight, aromatized PCHD results in a water soluble product.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, the aromatized\/non-aromatized PCHD polymers are sulfonated using ClSOH. In some embodiments, the sulfonations are carried out in a chloroalkane, such as dichloroethane, at ambient or lower temperatures. Sulfonation can be performed with other reagents including, but not limited to, acetyl sulfate, sulfur trioxide, sulfur trioxide-dioxane complex, ClSOH-dioxane, ClSOH-diethyl ether, sulfur trioxide-pyridine, sulfur trioxide-trimethyl amine, and sulfur trioxide-dimethyl formamide. The degree of sulfonation can range from about 20% to about 60%, from about 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 28%, 30%, 32%, 34%, 36%, 38%, 40%, 42%, 44%, 46%, 48%, 50%, 52%, 54%, 56%, 58% to about 60%.","Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of forming a proton exchange membrane, the method comprising:\n\n","Thus, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a method of forming a proton exchange membrane, the method comprising:\n\n","The resulting material is covalently and ionically crosslinked, and has a highly aromatic structure, which imparts excellent thermo-oxidative, chemical, and dimensional stability to the membrane. Note that even if complete aromatization of the diene is not carried out, any residual double bonds will be eliminated during sulfonation (alkene sulfonation). Combined covalent and ionic crosslinking of aromatic structures leads to membranes of improved dimensional stability with the potential for reduced methanol permeation. Thus, membranes comprising the currently disclosed materials exhibit outstanding potential for use in methanol fuel cells at temperatures well above 100\u00b0 C. A photograph of a presently disclosed cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (PHCD) membrane is shown in .","Self Assembling Barrier Elastomer (SABrE) materials typically comprise block or graft copolymers of sulfonated polystyrene and polyisobutylene, which have elastomeric mechanical properties. The sulfonated polystyrene self-assembles to form nanometer size hydrophilic domains with cylindrical geometries that provide pathways for water transport (and thus breathability) across the hydrophobic butyl rubber (polyisobutylene) matrix. Due to their extremely small size and to their chemical functionality, these hydrophilic channels are not accessible to chemical and biological threats. Thus, SABrE materials exhibit the characteristic of selective transport. Further, when the SABrE material is based on a graft copolymer comprising many tetrafunctional graft points per molecule, then the material has exceptional mechanical properties.","Such materials can be used as a fabric, which in some embodiments can be a barrier fabric, for example for use as breathable chemical-biological protective barrier clothing for military personnel, emergency response teams, industrial and\/or agricultural workers and\/or other applications, and healthcare professionals. Indeed, any article or item that is desired to be covered can be covered, such as but not limited to plants (indeed, any form of vegetation) or other agricultural applications in an environment where coverage would be of interest for at least a period of time, and industrial equipment that is maintained in an environment where coverage would be desirable for at least a period of time. Standard protective clothing is made largely from butyl rubber (BR), a material whose impermeability provides an excellent level of protection, but also traps heat and moisture inside the garments. BR garments also are bulky and limit dexterity. For example, a particular problem with gloves made from BR materials is that they constrain hand movement. In a desert combat environment these problems could result in more than simple discomfort and inconvenience.","The fluorinated and sulfonated materials of the presently disclosed subject matter are directly applicable to SABrE materials. Microphase separated block copolymers have the potential to economically produce protective fabrics, which in some embodiments act as barrier materials, with improved breathability, comfort and wear resistance. A strategy for doing this is to exploit the excellent barrier properties of an impermeable polymer matrix, while at the same time blending in block copolymers which microphase separate to form membrane spanning channels. Such block copolymers include materials comprising sulfonated PS blocks, Variations in the molecular architecture of graft copolymers can be manipulated to control the nano-scale structure (morphology) and the ability to form long-range order during self-assembly. Synthetic techniques have been developed to produce the precisely controlled molecular architectures, some of which are provided in . Further, such well-defined molecular architecture is related to morphology and properties. As a result, morphology and long-range order of microphase separated structures can be controlled through molecular design.","The presently disclosed subject matter utilizes this control of morphology to tailor properties of fluorinated ionomer materials which share some of the block and grafted architectural features of previously reported non-fluorinated materials.","To optimize performance, the size, shape and symmetry, and overall volume fraction of different types of domains are controlled independently. This independent control, however, is not possible with conventional linear AB diblock copolymers and ABA triblock copolymers for which the nanophase separated morphology which forms (e.g., spheres, cylinders, cubic bicontinuous gyroid, or lamella) is tied directly to the relative volume fractions of the two block materials. For example, if an application such as SABrE demands a material with microphase-separated nanometer length scale cylinders in which the component comprising the conductive cylindrical domain makes up over 50 volume percent of the material, linear block copolymers would not be preferred.","One way to uncouple block copolymer morphology from its rigid dependence on component volume fractions is to vary molecule architecture. By way of example, for mixed arm star architectures such as the AB shown in , the asymmetry factor is: \u03b5=(n\/n)\/(\u03b6\/\u03b6), wherein (n\/n) is the ratio of arm numbers of the two block types and represents the asymmetry due to the architecture and the conformational asymmetry between the two block materials is expressed by the ratio, (\u03b6\/\u03b6), wherein \u03b6is the ratio of segmental volume to the square of statistical segment length for the block material i.","Methods to determine the architectural asymmetry part of a generalized asymmetry parameter for any of the various graft copolymer architectures encountered have been developed. Further, these methods have been tested with extensive morphological studies of model star and graft shaped block copolymers. Also, complex graft copolymer architectures with multiple grafting points (e.g., ) can be understood morphologically by analogy to fundamental building blocks defined as the average structure per junction.","This fundamental component of a larger graft molecular architecture is referred to as the \u201cconstituting block copolymer.\u201d For a graft copolymer with a backbone of A and blocks of B joined to the backbone at trifunctional branch points (see, e.g., ), the constituting block copolymer is an AB single graft copolymer (see ).","Previous characterization data on complex graft copolymer architectures with multiple grafting points has been fit into the framework of a theoretical morphology diagram (see ) calculated by Milner, S. T., 27, 2333 (1994), whose analysis predicts morphology as a function of composition and molecular asymmetry (architecture) for materials with a single junction point. For example, at \u03b5=1, the Milner diagram models linear, conformationally symmetric, AB diblock behavior with symmetric morphology windows around (\u03c6=0.5. As the number of arms of one species increase relative to the other, however, the morphological behavior can become strongly asymmetric with respect to volume fraction. This behavior allows the sought after uncoupling of morphology from volume fraction to be achieved. Thus, the morphology can be varied independently of volume fraction by adjusting the molecular architecture. Milner's theory is not strictly applicable to more complex, multiple graft copolymer materials, however. The use of the building block principle of the constituting block copolymer to understand the morphological behavior of multiple graft materials by mapping them back to the more well-understood behavior of single graft materials has been required. These ideas have been used to develop a rational framework for predicting the morphologies of all the types of molecular architecture shown in .","As disclosed hereinabove,  shows experimental data from previous work on a range of different branched molecular architectures plotted on the morphology diagram. This morphology diagram now provides the background necessary to move forward on materials with similar architectures, but dramatically different fluorinated and charged block materials for different applications, such as fuel cells.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, phase-separated ionomers, such as those described herein, can act as templates for sol-gel polymerizations of metal alkoxides to generate nanostructured membranes. Previous studies involving NAFION\u00ae material have shown that HO molecules hydrogen bond to \u2261SiOH groups on inserted silicate nanostructures and Hhopping is possible along percolated hydration nanostructures. NAFION\u00ae\/silicate membranes have greater internal polarity and hydrative capacity than NAFION\u00ae-Hmembranes due to \u2261SiOH functionalities. See Deng. Q., et al., 7, 2259 (1995); Deng, Q., et al., -. & 7, 177 (1996); Deng, Q., et al., 34, 1917-1923 (1996); and Deng, Q., et al., 9, 36 (1997).","Also, sulfonated poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene) block copolymers and commercial KRATON triblock copolymers can induce domain-targeted sol-gel polymerizations in styrenic regions during film formation resulting in self-assembled organic\/inorganic nanostructured membranes. The water affinity of these block copolymers increases with sulfonation, but dramatically increases after silicate nanophase incorporation. There are cases where sulfonation can induce morphological transformations, which is another variable available for structural tailoring for membrane optimization.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed copolymers of fluorinated polydienes and sulfonated polystyrene and, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene (PCHD) polymers can be used in the following representative applications, including, but not limited to, a proton exchange membrane for a fuel cell, a polyelectrolyte for a battery, and a fabric, for example, for use as breathable chemical-biological protective clothing.","X.A. Proton Exchange Membrane","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed copolymers of fluorinated polydienes and sulfonated polystyrene and the presently disclosed cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene (PCHD) polymers can be used as a proton exchange membrane in an electrochemical cell, for example, a fuel cell.","Referring now to , fuel cell  comprises proton exchange membrane , which, in some embodiments comprises a presently disclosed copolymer of a fluorinated polydiene and a sulfonated polystyrene, and, in some embodiments, comprises a presently disclosed cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) polymer.","Referring again to , proton exchange membrane  is operationally positioned between and contacted with first catalyst layer , e.g., an anodic catalyst layer, and second catalyst layer , e.g., a cathodic catalyst layer, which are contacted with first electrode , e.g., an anodic electrode, and second electrode , e.g., a cathodic electrode, respectively. The body of fuel cell  is formed by layers or plates  and , which comprise channels  and  that are used to transport fuel and\/or waste products to and from first electrode  and second electrode . First electrode  and second electrode  are in conductive communication with electrical output connection E.","X.B. Polyelectrolyte","Polyelectrolytes can form a multitude of structures at various length scales in solution and can display a variety of properties not found in neutral polymers. The properties of these structures are controlled by many parameters, such as the inherent characteristics of the macromolecular backbone, charge types and locations, temperature, ionic strength, pH, and the like.","The presently disclosed copolymers of a fluorinated polydiene and a sulfonated polystyrene and the presently disclosed sulfonated cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) polymer provide a polyelectrolyte for use in, for example, a battery. More particularly, the presently disclosed sulfonated cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) polymer provides a well-defined polyelectrolyte with a lower flexibility than synthetic polyelectrolytes known in the art, due to the incorporation of the poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) ring into the polymer backbone.","X.C. Fabric","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a fabric, which in some embodiments comprises a barrier fabric, comprising the presently disclosed copolymers of fluorinated polydienes and sulfonated polystyrene and, in some embodiments, the presently disclosed cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene (PCHD) polymers.","Such materials can be used as a barrier fabric, for example for use as breathable chemical-biological protective barrier clothing to protect military personnel, emergency response teams, industrial and\/or agricultural workers, and healthcare professionals from chemical and\/or biological agents, including hazardous and\/or toxic chemicals and microorganisms, such as, but not limited to, chemical-biological warfare agents, viruses, bacteria, blood-borne pathogens, air-borne pathogens, industrial chemicals, and agricultural chemicals, in liquid, vapor, and aerosol forms. Further, such materials allow perspiration products to escape from, for example, a body, while preventing the penetration and\/or transport of the aforementioned hazardous and\/or toxic materials.","Further, in some embodiments, such barrier fabric can be used to protect agricultural products, including living and cultivated vegetative products, from, for example, exposure to natural pathogens, such as fungi, chemical and\/or biological pathogens, and frost. In some embodiments, such barrier fabric can be used as a \u201cweed barrier,\u201d which, for example, impedes the growth of undesired vegetative species, while retaining moisture in the soil.","X.D. Sol-Gel Templates","Sol-gel syntheses can be used to produce a variety of inorganic networks from silicon or metal alkoxide monomer precursors. In a typical sol-gel synthesis, a soluble precursor molecule, e.g., a metal alkoxide, is hydrolyzed to form a dispersion of colloidal particles (the sol). Further reaction causes bonds to form between the sol particles resulting in an infinite network of particles in a continuous liquid phase (the gel). The gel typically is then heated to yield the desired materials. The precursors for synthesizing these colloids typically comprise a metal or metalloid element surrounded by a reactive ligand. Metal alkoxides are particularly useful in sol-gel syntheses because they readily react with water. The most commonly used alkoxides are the alkoxysilanes, such as tetramethoxy silane and tetraethoxysilane. Other alkoxides, such as aluminates, titanates, and borates also are commonly used in sol-gel processes.","Membranes, such as porous alumina membranes and etched polymeric membranes, can be used as templates for sol-gel syntheses of, for example, micro- and nanostructures. As provided hereinabove in section IX, in some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, phase-separated ionomers, such as those described herein, can act as templates for sol-gel polymerizations of metal alkoxides to generate nanostructured membranes.","In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides materials based on polydienes (including chemically modified polydienes) in combination with hydrophilic polymers. In some embodiments, these materials comprise sulfonated, crosslinked polydienes and hydrophilic polymers. Suitable hydrophilic polymers include those that can increase water absorption and\/or proton conductivity and such as, but not limited to, poly(alkylene oxide)-containing polymers, e.g., poly(ethylene oxide) (i.e., poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), and derivatives thereof (e.g., monoalkyl or monoaryl ethers of PEG or PPG). Any suitable polydiene can be used. For example, suitable polydienes include, but are not limited to, polybutadiene, poly(cyclohexadiene), and polyisoprene.","The hydrophilic polymer and the polydiene can be covalently attached to one another or can be interspersed with one another and not covalently attached. In some embodiments, the materials can be block copolymers that comprise blocks of polydiene and blocks of hydrophilic polymer. In some embodiments, the materials can be polymer blends of polydiene and hydrophilic polymer. The presently disclosed materials can be used as polyelectrolytes, proton exchange membranes, in electrochemical cells, and as fabrics, such as those described above.","In some embodiments, the polydiene is poly(cyclohexadiene) (e.g., poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (PCHD)). PCHD is of interest for use in alternative high temperature fuel cell membranes due to its unique structure and ready susceptibility to post polymerization modification. For example, PCHD with a 1,4- instead of a 1,2-microstructure can provide materials with good thermal stability. The double bonds (i.e., alkenes) that are present in the PCHD structure can be chemically modified to further tune the performance properties (i.e., proton transport, hydrophilicity, permeability, mechanical properties, morphology, thermal stability, and crystallinity) of the materials. For example, the double bonds can be used to crosslink polydiene-based polymers. The double bonds can also be reacted with sulfonating reagents to sulfonate the polydienes. In addition, the diene that PCHD is prepared from, i.e., 1,3-cyclohexadiene, is of low cost.","In some embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter, a method is provided for preparing a sulfonated, crosslinked polyelectrolyte comprising a polydiene and a poly(alkylene oxide), the method comprising:","(a) providing a polydiene;","(b) providing a poly(alkylene oxide);","(c) contacting the polydiene with the poly(alkylene oxide) to provide a block copolymer or a polymer blend comprising the polydiene and the poly(alkylene oxide);","(d) crosslinking the polydiene; and","(e) sulfonating the polydiene; thereby providing a sulfonated, crosslinked polyelectrolyte.","In some embodiments, the polydiene is linear PCHD comprising at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% 1,4-microstructure. The polydiene can have an average molecular weight of between about 1,000 g\/mol and about 50,000 g\/mol. In some embodiments, the polydiene can have an average molecular weight of between about 5,000 g\/mol and about 40,000 g\/mol. In some embodiments, the polydiene can have an average molecular weight of between about 20,000 g\/mol and about 36,000 g\/mol (e.g., about 20,000, 22,000, 24,000, 26,000, 28,000, 30,000, 32,000, 34,000, or 36,000 g\/mol). As will be understood by those of skill in the art, suitable polydienes can be prepared from the anionic polymerization of dienes and the desired average molecular weight can be tuned based upon conditions of the polymerization.","The hydrophilic polymer, such as a poly(alkylene oxide), can have an average molecular weight of between about 1,000 g\/mol and about 5,000 g\/mol. For example, a poly(alkylene oxide) can have an average molecular weight of about 1,000 g\/mol, 1,500 g\/mol, 2,000 g\/mol, 2,500 g\/mol, 3,000 g\/mol, 3,500 g\/mol, 4,000 g\/mol, 4,500 g\/mol or 5,000 g\/mol. The poly(alkylene oxide) can comprise a poly(alkylene oxide) monoalkyl ether (e.g., a methyl ether, ethyl ether, propyl ether, butyl ether, etc.). In some embodiments, the poly(alkylene oxide) is a poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) monoalkyl ether. In some embodiments, the poly(alkylene oxide) is a poly(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether (i.e., a poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether, also referred to herein as an MePEG).","The synthesis of block copolymers comprising sulfonated, crosslinked polydienes and MePEGs is shown in . As illustrated in , when the anionic polymerization of cyclohexadiene or another diene is terminated with ethylene oxide, the resulting polydiene is hydroxy-terminated (e.g., PCHD-OH-02). The hydroxy-terminated polydiene can be reacted with a halo-substituted poly(alkylene oxide) (e.g., MePEGBr-2K) in the presence of a suitable Bronsted-Lowry base (e.g., NaH) to form a block copolymer of the polydiene and the poly(alkylene oxide) (e.g., PCHD-PEG-O). Any suitable Bronsted Lowry base can be used. In addition to NaH, other suitable Bronsted-Lowry bases, include, but are not limited to, other metal hydrides, sodium butoxide or another metal alkoxide, butyl lithium or another metal alkyl, and non-nucleophilic amines (e.g., pyridine).","The halo-terminated poly(alkylene oxide) can be prepared by substituting a free hydroxyl terminus of the poly(alkylene oxide) with a halogen. For example, the free hydroxyl group of an MePEG can be substituted by a halogen (e.g., bromide, fluoride, iodide, or chloride). The free hydroxyl terminus could also be substituted by another suitable leaving group (e.g., a sulfonate ester such as a mesylate or tosylate) instead of a halogen. Suitable brominating reagents include, but are not limited to, phosphorous tribromide, as shown in  in the synthesis of MePEGBr-2K. Suitable chlorinating reagents include, but are not limited to, thionyl chloride. Suitable iodinating reagents include, but are not limited to, phosphorus triiodide. Reagents for preparing sulfonate esters include, but are not limited to, benzenesulfonyl chloride and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride.","Thus, in some embodiments, providing the polydiene comprises providing a hydroxy-terminated polydiene; providing the poly(alkylene oxide) comprises providing a halo-terminated or sulfonate ester-terminated poly(alkylene oxide) monoalkyl ether; and contacting the polydiene with the poly(alkylene oxide) to form a block copolymer comprises contacting the hydroxy-terminated polydiene with a halo- or sulfonate ester-terminated poly(alkylene oxide) monoalkyl ether in the presence of a Bronsted-Lowry base to form a block copolymer.","The weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) can be manipulated as desired to provide a material (e.g., a polyelectrolyte) having desired characteristics. In some embodiments, the polyelectrolyte comprises a block copolymer with a weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) (i.e. of poly(alkylene oxide) blocks) of between about 5% and about 15%. For example, the block copolymer can comprise about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, or 15% poly(alkylene oxide). In some embodiments, the weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) blocks is about 6.5%. The weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) can be tuned by the changing the molecular weight and\/or molar ratios of polydiene and poly(alkylene oxide) used.","In some embodiments, the polydiene and hydrophilic polymer, such as a poly(alkylene oxide), are not covalently attached to one another. In some embodiments, the polydiene and hydrophilic polymer are both present in a polymer blend. Thus, for example, the polydiene and poly(alkylene oxide) can be mixed together in a solution. The amount of polydiene and poly(alkylene oxide) can be adjusted to provide a desired weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide). In some embodiments, the weight percentage of the poly(alkylene oxide) is between about 5% and about 20%. In some embodiments, the weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) is between about 9% and about 17% (e.g., about 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, or 17%). As with the block copolymers, the weight percentage of poly(alkylene oxide) can be tuned by changing the molecular weight and\/or molar ratios of polydiene and poly(alkylene oxide) used.","Films of any desired thickness can be cast from solutions of the block copolymer or of the polymer blend. In some embodiments, the film thickness is between about 10 \u03bcm (i.e. 1.0\u00d710meter) and about 500 \u03bcm (i.e. 5.0\u00d710meter). In some embodiments, the film thickness is between about 50 \u03bcm and about 100 \u03bcm. Suitable solvents used in preparing the solution include nonpolar solvents that lack reactive groups that can react with crosslinking reagents and are those in which the polymers have sufficient solubility. Such solvents can include, but are not limited to, aromatic solvents, such as toluene, naphthalene, and benzene; nonpolar halogenated solvents, such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and methylene tetrachloride; alkanes, such as hexanes; and ethers (e.g., diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF)).","Double bonds (i.e., alkenes) in the polydiene of the block copolymer or of the polymer blend can be covalently crosslinked prior to, during, or after the casting to stabilize the size and shape of the membrane. Crosslinking can be done via polydiene vulcanization (e.g., with peroxides). Crosslinking can also be done using sulfur monochloride. When sulfur monochloride is used, the sulfur monochloride can be added to the solution of block copolymer or polymer blend prior to casting. The degree of crosslinking can range from about 4% to about 20%, i.e., from about 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19% to about 20%.

High vacuum techniques were sometimes employed and all solvents and monomers were purified according to anionic polymerization standards as described in the literature. See Hadjichristidis, N., et al., 38, 3211 (2000). A difunctional initiator DLI was synthesized by the 2-fold addition of sec-butyllithium to 1,3-bis(1-phenylethenyl)benzene as reported previously (Uhrig. D. and Mays, J., 35, 7182 (2002) and Tung, L. H., and Lo, T. Y.-S., 27, 2219 (1994)) and stored as a 0.1 M solution in benzene. Prior to use, styrene monomer was distilled from calcium hydride under vacuum and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. under pressurized argon. Isoprene monomer was distilled from calcium hydride, and then distilled from 1.0 M dibutylmagnesium solution just before use. 1,3-Cyclohexadiene (1,3-CHD, Aldrich, 97%) was cleaned by treatment over CaH, sodium mirror (three times), and finally n-BuLi or MgBu.","A 250 mL round bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar was dried in a 150\u00b0 C. oven over 24 hours, then sealed with a septum and purged\/cooled with argon. Cyclohexane (150 mL) was cannulated into the flask, followed by 2.2 mL (0.22 mmol) DLi difunctional initiator and 1.2 mL (14.8 mmol) THF. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Styrene monomer (2.0 mL, 17.4 mmol) was charged into the flask and polymerized at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, isoprene monomer (10.0 mL, 76.9 mmol) was charged into the flask and the flask was warmed to 50\u00b0 C. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The polymerization was terminated with degassed methanol, and the ISI triblock copolymer was collected by precipitation in methanol containing 0.2% BHT. Solvent\/nonsolvent (toluene\/methanol) fractionation was used to remove the diblock contaminants.","PS-PCHD diblocks are prepared by either polymerizing 1,3-CHD first, followed by addition of styrene, or by polymerizing styrene first, followed by addition of 1,3-CHD. In a typical experiment, about 85 mL purified benzene was distilled into an evacuated reactor with attached ampoules containing all the necessary purified reagents. The reactor was removed from the vacuum line by heat-sealing after degassing. A 5.5 mL aliquot of sec-BuLi (9.7\u00d710mmol\/mL in hexanes) was added followed by 2.3 g (0.022 mol) styrene. The polymerization started right away (as evidenced by a deep red color) and was allowed to continue for 6 hours before taking an aliquot (approximately 1 mL) for characterization. SEC and MALDI-TOF-MS results indicated a molecular weight of 4.52 kg\/mol with a polydispersity of 1.08. About 2.5 mL of DABCO (3.2\u00d710mol\/mL in benzene) was introduced into the reactor through a break-seal. After stirring about 5 minutes at room temperature, 6.4 g (0.08 mol) of 1,3-CHD was added from another ampoule. The solution turned golden yellow and was allowed to continue to polymerize for another 6 hours before the reaction was terminated with degassed methanol. The final product had a weight-average molecular weight (M) of 18.6 kg\/mol (as indicated by MALLS), a number-average molecular weight (M) of 15.4 kg\/mol (from MALDI-TOF analysis), a polydispersity (M\/M) of 1.03, and a composition of PCHD with 66.0 wt % (as determined by NMR).","An all-glass linking reactor was charged with approximately 2 mL of MeSiClin a small quantity of benzene. An approximately 5% w\/v solution of PSLi in benzene was added to the silane so that the concentration of silane versus the concentration of carbon-lithium bonds, [silane]\/[CLi], =100 while the reactor contents were stirred briskly in a 0\u00b0 C. bath. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature following the addition.","The contents of the reactor were distilled until the solution was too viscous to stir. Fresh benzene was added to make an approximately 10% w\/v solution, and the contents were well mixed. This sequence was repeated twice more. The reactor was then left open to a high vacuum at room temperature for one week. Finally, benzene was added to make an approximately 3% w\/v solution.","LiPILi was prepared as an approximately 3% w\/v solution in benzene, initiated from DLI in the presence of sec-BuOLi ([COLi]\/[CLi]=7). The LiPILi solution and the (PS)MeSiClfrom the linking reactor were adjusted to a stoichiometric ratio of [CLi]\/[SiCl]=1.2, and the solutions were mixed. After 1 day, several milliliters of THF were added (approximately 0.5% v\/v of the finally resulting solution; THF\/Li=100).","Centipede Synthesis. An all-glass linking reactor was charged with 0.200 mmol of SiClin a small quantity of hexane and benzene. An approximately 3% w\/v solution of PSLi was incrementally added to the silane. The first addition was made such that approximately 0.27 mmol of PSLi was added quickly to the chilled reactor (0\u00b0 C. bath, colder than the flask of PSLi at 20\u00b0 C.) with brisk stirring. After the first addition was made, the reactor was allowed to warm slowly to 20\u00b0 C. (isothermic with the flask of PSLi), and further dropwise additions of PSLi were made. The progress of the linking reaction was monitored by removing small aliquots from the reactor and analyzing them with SEC. After approximately 2 equivalents of PSLi (approximately 0.40 mmol) had been added to the reactor, and more importantly the end point was judged by SEC, the titration was stopped.","An approximately 3% w\/v solution of LiPILi in benzene and the (PS)SiClin the linking reactor were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio of [CLi]\/[SiCl]=1.2. After 1 day THF was added (approximately 0.5% v\/v of the finally resulting solution; THF\/Li=100).","Barbwire Synthesis. An all-glass linking reactor was charged with 0.200 mmol of 1,6-bis(trichlorosilyl)hexane (hexachlorosilane) in a small quantity of hexane and benzene. An approximately 3% w\/v solution of PSLi was incrementally added to the silane. The first addition was made such that approximately 2 equivalents (approximately 0.40 mmol) was added to the reactor. After the first addition, approximately 0.5 mL of THF was slowly distilled into the reactor (less than 0.5% v\/v of the resultant linking solution; THF\/Li=30). Further additions were made slowly to a calculated (stoichiometry of reagents and concentration of PSLi) stopping point of approximately 4.3 equivalents of PSLi (approximately 0.87 mmol). The progress of the linking reaction was monitored by removing small aliquots from the reactor and analyzing them via SEC. It was noticed that after addition of beyond approximately 3.7 equivalents of PSLi, the color in the linking reactor steadily grew more intensely golden.","An approximately 3% w\/v solution of LiPILi in benzene and the contents of the linking reactor were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio of [CLi]\/[SiCl]=1.2. After 1 day THF was added (approximately 0.5% v\/v of the finally resulting solution; THF\/Li=100).","Workup and Fractionation. The linking solutions were permitted to react for 3 weeks before quenching. The raw final polymers were stabilized with BHT and precipitated with a large excess of methanol. Fractionation was performed using toluene\/methanol as the solvent\/nonsolvent pair.","Additional details for the synthesis of the presently disclosed poly(isoprene-graft-styrene) copolymers are provided in Uhrig, D., and Mays, J. W., 35, 7182 (2002), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The general procedure for the synthesis of statistical copolymers of 1,3-cyclohexadiene and \u03b1-methylstyrene (\u03b1MS) is provided hereinabove in Scheme 2. Also as shown in Scheme 3, the polycyclohexadiene (PCHD) units in the copolymer are fluorinated using difluorocarbene, followed by sulfonation of P\u03b1MS.","Fluorination of polydienes by generation of difluorocarbene has been reported by Cais, R. B., et al., 19, 595 (1986), using PhHgCFas the fluorine source, and by Thomson, M. W., 22, 481 (1989), via irradiation of chlorofluorocarbons. Further, Ren, Y., et al., 120, 6830 (1998), have reported a facile method for fluorination of polydienes based upon difluorocarbene addition. This reaction employs the relatively inexpensive hexafluoropropylene oxide as a reagent and does not lead to chain scission or crosslinking.","An example of the post-polymerization fluorination of polybutadiene (PBD) and sulfonation of polystyrene (PS) in a PS-PBD block copolymer is provided hereinabove in Scheme 1. After fluorination of the polydiene, e.g., polybutadiene, component, the polystyrene segments can be sulfonated using reagents, such as acetyl sulfate or sulfur trioxide, to form poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS).","The ISI triblock copolymer (3.0 g, 35 mmol double bond content) and 0.4 g BHT was dissolved in 120 mL pretreated cyclohexane and charged into a Parr reactor. The Parr reactor was purged with argon and cooled with liquid nitrogen. Hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO, 98 g, 590 mmol) was transferred into the Parr reactor from a tank using a regulator and tubing. The Parr reactor was warmed to 50\u00b0 C. and stirred for 30 min. The Parr reactor was heated to 180\u00b0 C. and slowly stirred for an additional 20 hours. The pressure was released slowly through a sodium hydroxide solution after the reactor was cooled to room temperature. The solid material in the Parr reactor was dissolved in chloroform, un-dissolved material was removed by filtration, and the filtered solution was precipitated with methanol. The obtained precipitate was dried under vacuum at room temperature.","Proton NMR indicated the quantitative fluorination of the polyisoprene block. GPC characterization revealed that the average molecular weight of the triblock copolymer had changed from 43,900 g\/mol before fluorination to 22,600 g\/mol after fluorination, and the polydispersity index (PDI) went from 1.23 to 1.55.","Fluorinated ISI triblock copolymer (1.8 g) was dissolved in 20 mL dichloroethane (DCE). Sulfuric acid (2.5 mL) and acetic anhydride (3.7 mL) were mixed in a flask, which was then cooled in an ice bath. The sulfuric acid\/acetic anhydride mixture was added drop-wise through an addition funnel into the polymer solution at room temperature. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours. DCE was removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining residue was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water and then titrated to a pH of about 7 with 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The neutralized solution was purified by dialysis in distilled water several times (MW cutoff of the dialysis tube=1,000 g\/mol). The water was removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining dark-brown material was dried under vacuum at room temperature.","Samples of all polymer segments are taken during the reactions (whenever possible) to allow for the independent characterization of the precursor segments and the final block copolymers by absolute molecular weight methods such as osmometry, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and light scattering, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, and infrared (IR) spectrometry.","After the fluorination reactions, the polymer is isolated and characterized by H and F NMR and GPC to check for complete reaction of the diene and to assure that degradation has not occurred. GPC at temperatures up to 220\u00b0 C. is carried out, with light scattering detection, even for specimens exhibiting crystallinity at lower temperatures. After sulfonation, the products are characterized for extent of sulfonation by elemental analysis. The sulfonation conditions chosen have been shown to yield little if any degradation of precursor polymers. Thus, in some embodiments, the molecular architectures and degrees of polymerization should not be altered from their precursor states.","Light scattering and viscometry experiments are used to estimate persistence lengths of the individual polymer segments to calculate conformational asymmetry. Bulk densities are measured for fluorinated polydienes and for sulfonated polystyrenes using standard ASTM methods.","Poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (PCHD) was synthesized under inert gas atmosphere. The materials used in the synthesis of PCHD were prepared as follows. 1,3-cyclohexadiene monomer was purified by stirring with fine-grounded calcium hydride over 24 hours then distilled under argon. 1,4-Diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO) was sublimed under vacuum then diluted in benzene. Cyclohexane was stirred with sulfuric acid for 24 hours and then separated into a cyclohexane fraction. The cyclohexane was washed with water, 10% sodium hydroxide solution, water again, dried with calcium chloride, then distilled from sodium metal and stored under argon. Benzene was purified via the same procedure as cyclohexane. Sec-Butyl lithium (sec-BuLi) (Aldrich, 1.4 M) was used as received.","A typical procedure for synthesizing PCHD is as follows. A 250 mL round bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar was dried in an oven heated to 150\u00b0 C. for 24 hours, then sealed with a septum and purged\/cooled with argon flow. 100 mL of pretreated benzene (or cyclohexane) was charged through a double tipped needle. 1,3-Cyclohexdiene monomer (10 mL, 0.105 mmol) was charged into the flask. DABCO in benzene (approximately 1.7 M, 1.5 mL, 2.55 mmol) was charged into the flask by using a syringe. The mixture was titrated with several drops of sec-BuLi to a very pale color and then the desired amount of sec-BuLi (0.6 mL, 0.84 mmol) was immediately injected. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3-4 hours, then terminated with several drops of degassed methanol. The polymer was collected by precipitating in methanol containing 0.2% BHT. The obtained polymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature and then stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.","A typical procedure for the synthesis of a cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (XPCHD) membrane is as follows. In a 100-mL round bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar, 3 g of PCHD (37.5 mmol double bond units) was dissolved in 20 mL of toluene and then the desired amount of sulfur monochloride (0.15 mL, 1.87 mmol) was added. The ratio of PCHD repeat units to sulfur monochloride was controlled around 20:1 mol\/mol. The mixture was stirred until the viscosity of the mixture increased. The mixture was pulled out onto a TEFLON disc (10 cm in diameter) before forming a gel. Most of the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen flow to form the cross-linked membrane. After the membrane was tough enough to handle, but was not totally dry, the membrane was peeled off carefully.","In one example, a cross-linked poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (XPCHD) membrane was synthesized as follows. To a solution of PCHD (1.5 g) in toluene (\u02dc75 mL) was added dropwise 0.3 g of SCl. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 7 hours. The solution was dividend evenly into three parts and poured into three Fisherbrand Low-Form PTFE dishes (Diameter: 100 mm; Capacity: 100 mL). The solvent was allowed to evaporate slowly overnight in the hood. All three membranes were removed from PTFE dishes, washed with CShexane solution (5 v %) and then hexane. The membranes were dried under vacuum overnight while being pressed with desiccator plates.","The membranes formed are very thin (about 100 \u03bcm in thickness) and very flat (). Moreover, only 0.5 g of PCHD was used for each membrane. The concentration of PCHD was about 2.0 wt %. Typical concentrations used ranged from about 2.0-4.0 wt %. The degree of crosslinking is about 10% (see Table 2). With higher degrees of crosslinking, the resulting membrane tends to break upon drying.

In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter seeks to determine how fluorination and subsequent sulfonation affect the morphological self-assembly of the materials. To address this question, the morphology of the initial PS-PBD material is compared to the fluorinated PS-FPBD material and finally to the fluorinated and sulfonated PSS-FPBD. Morphological characterization of these materials utilizes real-space, transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging and reciprocal-space small angle scattering (SAXS and\/or SANS) techniques. Morphological study of the PS-PBD materials utilizes established techniques and protocols.","The following procedure is a representative method by which the morphology of a block or graft copolymer is evaluated. This procedure is the same general approach that has been employed in previous block copolymer research on PS-polydiene materials to produce a sample representative of the equilibrium morphology, and to evaluate that morphology. See Gido, S. P., et al., 29, 7022 (1996); Gido, S. P., et al., 30, 6771 (1997); Pochan, D. J., et al., 29, 5091 (1996); Pochan, D.

I., et al., 95, 9367 (1991).","Solid films of the block or graft copolymer material, approximately 1- to 3-mm thick, are cast from solution. Toluene is the standard non-preferential solvent for polystyrene (PS) and polyisoprene (PI). Casting from other solvents that are selective for either PS or PI can result in shifts in morphology away from that which the molecule itself would prefer. The degree of long-range order in the samples can then be increased by thermal annealing at about 120\u00b0 C. These casting and annealing conditions have been found to promote self-assembly of well-ordered, nanostructured morphologies in previous studies of graft copolymers.","After annealing, ultrathin sections approximately 30-80 nm thick are prepared for TEM observation by cryoultramicrotoming. The sections of PS-PBD materials are stained in OsOvapors for about four hours to react with the PBD block double bonds, rendering these blocks dark in TEM imaging via mass thickness contrast. See Kato, K., 8, 38 (1967); and Kato, K., 4, 35 (1966).","In the fluorinated PS-FPBD materials, the fluorine atoms attached to the PBD blocks use up the unsaturated sites, thus preventing staining of this block with OsO. The fluorine itself is not a heavy enough element to enhance contrast in TEM. The PS block of the fluorinated samples can be stained with RuO. Thus, stained fluorinated samples will have opposite contrast to the original PS-PBD, i.e., dark stained PS blocks and light FPBD blocks. In the sulfonated and fluorinated PSS-FPBD materials, staining of the PSS block with RuOis possible for a number of reasons. In most cases, the PSS block will not be fully sulfonated and thus unmodified PS monomers will be present to react with the stain. Additionally, the sulfonated PSS monomers might still retain their reactivity with RuO. Finally, the TEM imaging contrast in the PSS-FPBD materials can be enhanced by exchanging the counter ion of the sulfonate group, normally Na, for a heavier cation such as Cs. See Belloni, L., et al., 119, 7560 (2003).","Small angle scattering experiments can be performed on all samples to accurately determine the lattice symmetries and spacings of the morphologies. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to study model graft copolymers. SAXS can be performed, for example, by using a rotating anode source and a two-dimensional area detector. The use of a heavy counterion for the PSS blocks enhances contrast in SANS experiments, but is not necessary to obtain good SANS results.","Further, many of the materials synthesized have deuterated PS blocks. This deuteration, produced by the use of fully deuterated d-PS monomer in the initial anion polymerization, is retained through post polymerization fluorination and sulfonation treatments. Deuteration allows SANS to be used to compare the morphologies of the PS-PBD, PS-FPBD, and PSS-FPBD without interference from chemical treatments or staining procedures.","The investigation of the permeability of the materials to water vapor and methanol, as well as the efficiency of proton transport, is important for applications of the presently disclosed materials in fuel cells and in breathable barrier materials for chemical-biological protection. High water vapor permeability enhances the utility of the materials for breathable barrier applications, and the ability to hydrate the material also is necessary for the fuel cell membrane application. For fuel cell applications, it also is important that the materials limit methanol transport.","Accordingly, the presently disclosed the fluorinated and sulfonated block copolymers can be characterized by using the same sorption balance device and the same morphological analysis of connectivity and transport path tortuosity to investigate their water vapor and methanol transport properties. In the presently disclosed subject matter, it is the PSS domain connectivity that controls the properties. Of course, these transport properties also will be influenced by non-morphological chemical factors, such as degree of PS sulfonation. By developing data of the type shown in  for inert gases, for water vapor and methanol, allows one to choose materials and morphologies to optimize materials for the desired applications.","A major factor controlling vapor or charge transport in the materials is the morphological connectivity of conductive sulfonated PS domains within the nonconductive fluorinated diene matrix. The effect of morphological connectivity on transport properties on model block and graft copolymers of PS and polydiene has been previously reported. See Laverdure, K. S. In ; University of Massachusetts: Amherst, Mass., 2001.","In this previous work, the permeability of non-interacting gases such as N, Ar, O, and COin PS-polydiene materials was studied. In these materials, at room temperature, the rubbery polydiene microdomains are as much as 100 times more permeable to these gases than the glassy PS domains. Therefore, in morphologies, such as polydiene cylinders in a PS matrix or lamellar structures, the sample spanning connectivity or percolation paths in the polydiene domains control the transport behavior.

Of course, these transport properties also are influenced by non-morphological chemical factors, such as degree of PS sulfonation.","Previous work has related the molecular architecture, morphology, and mechanical properties of well-defined multigraft copolymers with the architectures shown in : trifunctional combs, tetrafunctional centipedes, and hexafunctional barbwire. The general results of these studies are that, other things being equal (PS volume fraction and average number of grafts per molecule), increasing junction point functionality increases material strength and elasticity. And for a fixed PS volume fraction and junction point functionality, increasing the number of junction points per molecule increases the strength, strain at break, and elasticity. The best materials from these previous studies equaled the strength and exceeded the elasticity and strain at break performance of commercial thermoplastic elastomers, such as KRATON and STYROFLEX materials (BASF, Florham Park, N.J., United States of America). In the currently disclosed subject matter, the block and graft copolymer materials are mechanically evaluated after they have been fluorinated and sulfonated. Applications of the fluorinated and sulfonated materials as barrier materials for chemical-biological protection or as fuel cell membranes require good mechanical strength and toughness, and in the case of fuel cells good mechanical properties at elevated temperatures of between about 100\u00b0 C. and 150\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0265","num":"0281"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0266","num":"0282"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0267","num":"0283"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"]},"In the mechanical properties evaluation of the presently disclosed graft copolymer cylinders the strength and toughness of a range of materials (Table 1) with different graft functionalities and different numbers of branch points per molecule are compared.

All polymerizations were performed under high vacuum using custom-made glass reactors. Break seals were used to introduce reagents sequentially, and constriction seal-offs allowed intermittent removal of products. In a typical polymerization experiment, about 300 mL of purified benzene was distilled into a reactor with all the purified reagents attached via break-seals. The reactor was removed from the vacuum line after evacuation. Then about 2.0 mL of sec-BuLi (0.5 M in hexane) and 30 mL of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO in benzene, 0.25 M) were introduced into the reactor. After stirring for 5 min. at room temperature, 18 g of 1,3-cyclohexadiene was added. The reaction was allowed to continue for about 6 h. As shown in , termination of the reaction with degassed methanol gave PCHD, while termination with purified ethylene oxide provided hydroxy-terminated PCHD (PCHD-OH-02). The polymer was precipitated in methanol with 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol added to prevent oxidative degradation. The stabilized polymer was collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum. Number-average molecular weights (M) and polydispersity indices were obtained from GPC calibrated with polystyrene standards in THF. The Mof the hydroxy-terminated PCHD (i.e., PCHD-OH-02) was 35.6 Kg\/mol with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.37.","The synthesis of MePEGBr-2K is also illustrated in . Under argon, about 2.0 g of PBrwas added dropwise into a solution of 5.0 g of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (CH(OCHCH)OH; M: 2,000; Aldrich catalog #: 20, 250-9 (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis., United States of America) in 1,2-dichloroethane (approximately 100 mL). The mixture was stirred overnight at r.t., poured onto water, and extracted with CHCl. The extract was dried over MgSOovernight. The drying agent was filtered off. The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was dried under vacuum. The product was obtained as a waxy white solid (4.2 g, 82% yield).","As illustrated in , under argon, to a solution of PCHD-OH-02 (M: 35.6 Kg\/mol, 2.0 g; prepared as described in Example 8.1) in THF was added 200 mg of NaH (60% dispersion in mineral oil) and then 0.2 g of MePEGBr-2K (prepared as described in Example 8.2). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and poured onto water. The polymer was collected by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. About 1.6 g of white solid block copolymer (i.e., PCHD-PEG-02) was obtained as the final product (yield: \u02dc75%). The weight percent of PEG in PCHD-PEG-02 was about 6.5%. The weight percentage of PEG can be tuned by varying the molecular weight of the PCHD and PEG.","Crosslinked membranes (XPCHD-1007 and XPCHD-1008) of two polymer blends were made by mixing poly(1,3-cyclohexadiene) (PCHD; 0.25 g; M: 25466; PDI: 1.53) with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (M: 2000; 25 mg for XPCHD-1007 and 50 mg for XPCHD-1008) in toluene (\u02dc6.0 mL). To the solution of polymer blend was added dropwise 0.05 g of SCl. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 7 hours and then poured into a Fisherbrand Low-Form PTFE dishes (Diameter: 100 mm; Capacity: 100 mL). The solvent was allowed to evaporate slowly overnight in the hood. The membrane was removed from PTFE dishes, washed with CShexane solution (5 v %) and then hexane. The membrane was dried under vacuum overnight while being pressed with desiccator plates.","For comparison, membranes XPCHD-902, XPCHD-1001, XPCHD-1003, and XPCHD-1005 were also made from PCHD only (without PEG). The weight percentage of PEG in XPCHD-1007 and XPCHD-1008 was determined to be 9.1% and 16.7%, respectively. Compared with membranes made from PCHD only, polymer blend membranes were more flexible and less fragile. The degree of crosslinking varied from about 5% to about 10%. With a higher degree of crosslinking, the resulting membranes tended to break upon drying, while with lesser crosslinking, membranes formation tended to be more difficult.","Returning again to , to a solution of PCHD-PEG-02 (0.50 g) in toluene (10.0 mL), 0.10 g of SClwas added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 1 hour, divided evenly and poured into 2 TEFLON\u00ae dishes of 100 mm in diameter. The solvent was evaporated off overnight and the membranes were peeled off with a spatula. Membranes were washed with hexane twice and dried between desiccator plates under vacuum. All membranes were very flat and uniform. Compared with membranes made from PCHD only, the block copolymer membrane was more flexible and less fragile. The weight percent of PEG in XPCHD-1009 was 5.3%.","A cross-linked membrane made from either polymer blends (XPCHD-1007 or XPCHD-1008) or a block copolymer (XPCHD-1009, see ) was placed between two desiccator plates in a 2000 mL three-necked reactor. An appropriate volume of 1,2-dichloroethane was added to immerse the membrane and then ClSOH was added. The molar ratio of ClSOH to the double bond in PCHD ranged from 2.0 to 8.0. A typical ratio was 4.0. The membrane was sulfonated for about 2 h and then washed with CHCl. The membrane was hydrolyzed by immersion in THF for about 15 min. and then in water for about 1 hour. The membrane was washed with plenty of water and then dried between two desiccator plates under vacuum. A typical degree of sulfonation was about 40 mol %.","Proton conductivities were measured at room temperature after soaking membranes in deionized water and then mounting them in a four point probe conductivity cell immersed in water. Before electrical impedance measurements were performed in the frequency range 0.5 kHz to 1 MHz the samples were soaked in water for 24 h. The Z\u2032 intercept from the semicircle in the Nyquist plot was taken, in the usual way, as membrane resistance to calculate conductivity (\u03c3). All membranes showed high conductivity compared to NAFION\u00ae NRE-212 (0.068 S\/cm) under the same conditions, as seen in Table 4. Some of the PEG-containing PCHD membranes had conductivity values up to 0.41 S\/cm under these conditions. Without being bound to any one theory, addition of PEG is believed to be responsible for the big jump in conductivity.

See, for example XPCHD1008_SPCHD102 in Table 5. Membranes made from a block copolymer of PCHD and PEG had not only higher proton conductivity at 80% RH, but also higher proton conductivity at 50% RH than NAFION\u00ae NRE-212. For instance, the membrane XPCHD1009_SPCHD102 had proton conductivity of 245.10 mS\/cm at 80% RH (more than 100% increase compared with NRE-212) and 57.6 mS\/cm at 50% RH (56% increase compared with NRE-212). As shown in , membrane XPCHD1009_SPCHD102 showed higher proton conductivity at all relative humidities ranging from 100% to 20% than NAFION\u00ae NRE-212 although it showed a slightly sharper decrease of proton conductivity vs. relative humidity. The higher proton conductivity at lower (i.e., 50%) RH shown by the presently disclosed XPCHD-SPCHD-PEG membranes is significant in terms of developing cheap, non-NAFION, high temperature, low humidity operable fuel cell membranes.","Membrane water uptake at 25\u00b0 C. vs. RH was determined using a Q5000 vapor sorption analyzer (TA Instruments; New Castle, Del., United States of America). Water uptake vs. RH at 25\u00b0 C. for XPCHD1009_SPCHD102 vs. NAFION\u00ae 112Hmembranes is shown in . The equilibrium uptakes are expressed in terms of moles of water per equivalent of polymer, or average number of water molecules per sulfonic acid group. PCHD membranes absorb considerably more water than NAFION\u00ae at each RH. The difference is even pronounced at low RH which is significant for fuel cell applications. This enhancement is believed to be attributable to the presence of PEG, which can also account for higher conductivity, although cross-linking can also be a factor in the increased water absorption.","TGA studies were performed to determine membrane thermo-degradative stability.  shows mass loss (in Natmosphere) vs. temperature up to 800\u00b0 C. for some representative membranes: a membrane comprising crosslinked PCHD, i.e., XPCHD1001; membranes comprising sulfonated, crosslinked PCHD, i.e., XPCHD902_SPCHD105 and XPCHD902_SPCHD108; and a membrane comprising sulfonated, crosslinked PCHD and PEG, i.e., XPCHD1003_SPCHD109. Different percent remaining original mass up to the high temperature of 800\u00b0 C. were observed for different membranes. While the high temperature curve sections are beyond the range of fuel cell operation, the results are diagnostic of the degree of stability and material cohesion for these materials vs. conditions of sulfonation and the hydrolysis step. Degradation is a multi-step process that reflects the complexity of these chemical structures that include SOH groups, crosslinks and chemical heterogeneity along the backbone. Major mass loss does not occur until up to at least about 200\u00b0 C. for all membranes, including the membrane containing PEG (i.e., XPCHD1003_SPCHD109).","Long and short range macromolecular motions in the presently disclosed PEG-containing membranes were identified using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Loss tangent (tan \u03b4) vs. temperature (T) curves are shown in . Many distinct peaks with different degrees of broadening can be observed for the membranes. The breadth of a peak reflects micro-structural heterogeneity. As indicated in , there is a small peak between \u2212120 and \u221230\u00b0 C. tentatively assigned to local motions of \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014 crosslinks plus motions of \u2014CH\u2014Cl and \u2014CH\u2014OH side chains. The shortest range motions, which are active at low temperatures, are believed to be possible in these groupings. A very broad peak exists between about \u221230 and 200\u00b0 C., believed to be the glass transition (T). This is active at fuel cell operating temperatures, but would most likely shift to lower temperature with sorbed water. The crosslinked PCHD films showed T\u02dc95\u00b0 C. Finally, there is a small peak above 200\u00b0 C. which is believed, based on studies of other ionomers, to be due to disruption of \u2014SOH group aggregates.","The glass transition peak is somewhat broad and there is more than one relaxation active. Without being bound to any one theory, hydrogen bonding interactions among the \u2014SOH groups, which would form physical cross-links, can be responsible for broadening the glass transition peak owing to microstructural\/chemical heterogeneity. It is not fully clear at this point why the low temperature peak for the XPCHD1008_SPCHD101 sample shifts to higher temperature compared to other samples. The glass transition peak for XPCHD1008_SPCHD101 is divided into two peaks. In comparing samples with PEG (XPCHD1007_SPCHD102; XPCHD1008_SPCHD101; and XPCHD1009_SPCHD102; either via blending or copolymerization) and without PEG (XPCHD1003_SPCHD109 and XPCHD1005_SPCHD104) no change in the three peak positions is noticed although some plasticization due to the presence of PEG could be expected.","A change in storage modulus (E\u2032) with increasing temperature is seen in . The initial drop in E\u2032 with increasing temperature resembles a glass transition, although the drop is less than an order of magnitude. All membranes showed an increase in E\u2032 beyond around 0\u00b0 C., indicating material stiffening. Again, without being bound to any one theory, the increase in E\u2032 can involve SOH group associations, which can act as physical crosslinks. An increase in thermal mobility of these hydrogen bonding groups above Tmight impart sufficient mobility for them to migrate to form larger energetically-favorable associations which increases E\u2032 for the membranes with higher conductivities. The final drop in E\u2032 (around 200\u00b0 C.) can be interpreted in terms of the subsequent dissociation of these acid group aggregates, as also reflected by the transition peaks in . This is of special interest for fuel cell membranes at a temperature around 100\u00b0 C. as mechanical stability is desired in that temperature range.","Overall, the results indicate that blending or copolymerization of PEG with PCHD before crosslinking causes a big jump in conductivity most likely through plasticization. The presently disclosed XPCHD-SPCHD-PEG membranes have higher proton conductivity than that of NAFION\u00ae samples not only at high relative humidity (\u226780%) but also at low relative humidity (<50%). In particular, membranes made from a block copolymer of PCHD and PEG, and subsequently crosslinked and sulfonated, have very high conductivity (410 mS\/cm) at 100% RH, and higher conductivity than NAFION\u00ae NRE-212 even at RHs as low as 20%. The presently disclosed XPCHD-SPCHD-PEG membranes are thermally stable up to at least 200\u00b0 C., very flexible, and have good mechanical integrity. In addition, the cost of presently disclosed XPCHD-SPCHD-PEG membranes can be as low as $10\/m, about 1.5% that of NAFION\u00ae (about $800\/m). All these features make them very attractive and commercially feasible for high-temperature fuel cell applications.","It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter can be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.
