{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from and the benefit of the previously filed provisional patent application entitled \u201cWireless Handsfree Headset Method and System with Handsfree Applications,\u201d filed Jan. 18, 2008, having application No. 61\/022,168, and the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to mobile communications devices and to related services and applications, and more specifically, to headsets used with mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), and computing devices, where the headset is configured to operate with software applications and communication technologies residing on the communications devices. The present invention enables wired or wireless headsets to be used to discover applications and services, assist in the provisioning of those applications and services, and cooperate in the execution of applications resident on the communications devices to provide value added services to users of the headset.","Headsets, and particularly wireless headsets, are used with mobile communications devices to enhance the experience of the device user by allowing hands-free operation. This provides greater flexibility and freedom of movement for the user, while enabling the communication device to be placed in a more convenient location. For purposes of describing the present invention, mobile communication devices can include, but are not limited to, mobile phones such as cellular or satellite phones, personal data assistants (PDA's) with cellular phone capabilities, portable computing devices with communications capabilities, or other devices capable of using wireless communication methods and networks. Wired or wireless headsets may also be used with fixed location devices such as desktop computers (PCs), where telephony (such as VoIP) or other services may be provided via a connection to a communications network. In some cases such mobile and fixed location communications devices may be referred to as an \u201caudio gateway\u201d or \u201cvoice gateway.\u201d","Wireless headsets allow communication device users to communicate in a hands-free mode once a call is initiated or received, where initiating or accepting a call typically requires a physical user interaction with a control element of a user interface. Typically, wireless headsets are controlled by, or are configured to operate with, an audio or voice gateway, which as noted, may be a mobile or fixed location communications device such as a mobile phone or personal computer (PC). The audio or voice gateway is the functional unit in communication with the wired or wireless communication network being used for voice and data communications. For the case of a wireless headset, the audio or voice gateway and headset communicate and transfer data using a wireless technology, such as Bluetooth, IR (infrared), or another suitable method. Applications available over the wireless network (which may include applications resident on a wired network that is coupled to the wireless network) may in some cases be accessed using the gateway, typically by establishing a connection to the network using an interface of the gateway.","Although wireless headsets make voice communications more convenient, present embodiments of such devices have limitations that make them less desirable for certain uses and applications. One disadvantage is that it typically requires a multi-step process on the part of a user to access an application and interact with it using the wireless headset. This creates a disincentive for the user to access and use such applications, and limits the utility of the headset as a means of providing access to value added services. Another disadvantage is that most headsets lack sufficient noise suppression or noise cancellation capabilities to enable them to be effectively used with voice input driven applications such as voice recognition, voice based dialing, or voice based execution of application functions. Further, specific models or types of headsets are becoming preferred by users, and those users may wish to utilize their headset with a variety of audio or voice gateways. This means that the user must often re-configure the gateway for use with the headset or find a means of migrating personal data to the new gateway (as is the case when a user changes their mobile phone).","What is desired is a system, apparatus, and method to enable a user of a headset and audio or voice gateway to more effectively discover and utilize applications resident on, or that may be installed on, the gateway or on a server in communication with the gateway over a communications network. It is also desired to have a headset that can interact with an audio or voice gateway that does not require a physical interface to issue commands and receive data or responses to those commands from the gateway or an application. Embodiments of the invention address these problems and other problems individually and collectively.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to headsets used with audio or voice gateways, and to software applications that may be used with such headsets and gateways. In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a headset for use with an audio or voice gateway (and to a method of using the same) to enable a user to discover and interact with applications resident on the headset, gateway, or on a network accessible by the gateway. In these embodiments, the headset may function as an application platform for the control and execution of the applications, thereby providing a user with access to a variety of value added services. The headset typically communicates with the audio or voice gateway using a wireless technology, with voice inputs from the user being used to execute the functions of a desired application or obtain the benefits of a desired service.","The headset and gateway may form a system with the invention providing a method for the provisioning of a communications capability between the headset and gateway, the installation of a voice input driven application on the gateway, and the discovery, installation, and execution of applications resident on the gateway or on a network capable of communication with the gateway. In some embodiments, applications or data may be pre-installed onto the headset to enable the headset to interact with an audio or voice gateway, or with a specific application resident on the gateway or on a network. Further, the pre-installed applications or data may be transferred from the headset to the gateway to permit execution of an application on the gateway under the control of the headset, or configuration of a feature or function of the headset or gateway. In some embodiments, and depending upon the capabilities of the headset and\/or gateway, the headset may transfer data or metadata to the gateway that identifies a location of an application (e.g., a voice input driven interface or application) that may then be accessed by the gateway and installed on the gateway. In another embodiment, an application or data may be transferred to the headset from the gateway to enable the headset user to store personal data or configuration files on the headset and use that data or files with a different gateway.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a headset for use with an audio gateway, where the headset includes a data storage medium, an application stored in the data storage medium, and a file stored in the data storage medium, the file including data or metadata identifying a network location of the application, wherein the headset is configured to communicate with the audio gateway and to determine available methods for transferring or causing the transfer of the application to the audio gateway.","In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of providing a service to a user, where the method includes establishing a communication channel between a headset and an audio gateway, determining the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway, communicating the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway to the headset, transferring an application to the audio gateway, wherein the method of transferring the application is determined in response to determining the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway, and installing the application on the audio gateway, wherein execution of the application provides the service to the user.","In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon, wherein when executed by a processor the instructions implement a method of providing a service to a user, where the method includes establishing a communication channel between a headset and an audio gateway, determining the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway, communicating the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway to the headset, transferring an application to the audio gateway, wherein the method of transferring the application is determined in response to determining the data transfer capabilities of the audio gateway, and installing the application on the audio gateway, wherein execution of the application provides the service to the user.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon review of the detailed description of the present invention and the included figures.","Note that in the drawings, the same reference numbers identify identical or substantially similar elements. To easily identify the discussion of any particular element or act, the most significant digit or digits in a reference number typically to the figure number in which that element is first introduced (e.g., element  is first introduced and discussed with respect to ).","Before proceeding to describe one or more embodiments of the present invention, and to assist with providing a better understanding of the invention, it may be useful to define some terms that will be used in describing the inventive system, apparatus, and method. In the context of the present invention:","in some embodiments, a \u201cvoice gateway\u201d or \u201caudio gateway\u201d refers to a device that is capable of communicating with a headset using voice or audio signals and transferring data and\/or audio signals to a headset via a wired or wireless channel, and which may be used to transfer data and\/or audio signals to another device over a communications network. The gateway may also be used to execute an application resident on the gateway or to control the execution of an application resident on a device connected to the gateway by a communications channel;","\u201cservice discovery\u201d refers to a process by which a first device (e.g., a headset) determines the communications and\/or data transfer capabilities of another device (e.g., an audio gateway), with one result being that the first device can then know which communications and\/or data transfer modes may be used for the installation of applications on the second device; and","a \u201cservice\u201d or \u201cvalue added service\u201d refers to the result of executing an application, such as a software program or applet, or to exercising some function or feature of a device. The result is to provide a user with value, in the form of information, data or another form of output that is of use to a consumer.","Although in the description that follows, some of the embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to use of a wireless headset, it is to be understood that both wired and wireless headsets may be used in embodiments of the invention, unless use of one or the other type of headset is precluded by the application or situation being described.","In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to a system that includes a headset and an audio or voice gateway, although embodiments of the invention include the headset as a separate element as well. The headset may be a wired headset or a wireless headset and may include a data storage element, such as a memory. The headset may include one or more software applications, data files, or metadata stored in the memory. In one embodiment, the headset and gateway establish communications and after service discovery of the capabilities of the gateway, the headset then transfers (or causes the transfer of) a software application, data file or metadata to the gateway. For example, the application may be downloaded from the headset and installed, then executed under control of voice commands from the headset. In another example, the application may be accessed from a network location identified by the headset (e.g., via the metadata) and then downloaded to the gateway. In the case of a data file, the file may be used to configure the gateway for a desired operation or function.","In one embodiment, the application or data file may provide a control interface (e.g., a \u201cdashboard\u201d) for the headset that would not normally be accessible using the gateway. This may enable a user to configure certain services or functions of the headset using the gateway and the gateway's user interface (which in some cases may provide greater ease of use or other benefits to a user). Further, the headset may transfer an API (application programming interface) to the audio or voice gateway and expose the API through the gateway to provide a way for applications (either on the gateway or on a device connected to the gateway by a communications network) to access and share the headset's resident application, sensors, controls, functions, services, etc. Note that the output of an application or the benefit provided by a service may be audio signals or data, and the data may be transformed to an audio stream (via text-to-speech or another suitable technology depending on the form and content of the data) for playback to the user. The playback of the audio stream or transformed data may be through the headset or through another device, such as a phone or computer. In this way a user may select a device or playback mechanism that is best suited to their needs, which in some cases may depend upon the content of the audio stream or data, the features or user interface of the possible playback devices, etc.","In one embodiment, the downloaded application may be one that enables voice commands from the headset to be used to control certain functions or operations of the gateway. Such functions or operations may include initiating a search using the gateway as a connection to the Internet or another network, placing a call, retrieving data stored on the gateway or from another location, accessing a web service or other network resident function, etc. The downloaded application may also enable use of voice commands to control the execution of the functions or operations of a second application, where the second application is resident on the gateway or on a server or other network element connected to the gateway by a communications channel. Further, the downloaded or accessed application may be one that performs a desired function under the control of the headset or gateway.","Thus, in some embodiments, the headset is configured to have a voice based interface to the audio or voice gateway to enable the headset to control the access of data from the gateway or a connected device, and to translate that data into an audio stream that is sent to the headset and heard by the user. In such an embodiment, a physical interface (such as a keypad or control buttons) would not be required to issue commands and receive a response. Instead, voice commands are used to control and navigate the functions or operations of an application installed on the gateway or on a server coupled to the gateway by means of a communications network. In some embodiments, the gateway processes the voice input to receive an instruction set (e.g., a command for an application or metadata) from the headset, retrieve data requested from a source, and communicate the requested data over a wired or wireless audio channel to the user.","Typically, a wireless, hands-free headset utilizes two types of input mechanisms for controlling the operation of the headset and any applications with which it interacts. One of the inputs (e.g., a physical interaction or application of pressure on a button or control) requires a user to use their hand to physically interact with the headset. A second input (e.g., voice) requires a user to speak into the microphone of the headset to accomplish tasks or actions. As mentioned, and as will be described in greater detail, in order to overcome some of the disadvantages of such a dual-input mode user interface, in one embodiment of the present invention, the headset transfers (or causes the transfer of) a software application to the audio or voice gateway. In some embodiments, the application enables voice inputs to be used to issue commands for controlling functions or operations of the gateway, of applications resident on the gateway, or of applications resident on a device in communication with the gateway over a communications network.","Note that the voice input interface application (as well as others a user may want to use) may be stored on the headset or accessed from another source and downloaded to the gateway. Initiation of the download process may be under the control of the headset, for example by transferring data or a message to the gateway identifying a desired application and its location. The gateway may then connect to a network resource (either directly via a wireless network, directly via a wired network, or via a combination of a coupled wireless network and wired network) and access the desired application. The application may be executed over the network or downloaded to the gateway and executed on the gateway, thereby providing a desired function, service or feature to a user.","In some embodiments, the present invention includes a method for enabling wireless binary install operations to and from a wireless headset. In such a method, a wireless headset may use a transport medium such as Bluetooth wireless technology to setup connections for sending and receiving data. The data may include binary, compiled data that can be executed on the audio or voice gateway. The headset may act as a control point when interfacing with other devices such as a mobile cellular phone or a computer. The control point enables the user to create and customize their mobile communication experience by wireless application download or over-the-air data transfer.","In some embodiments, the headset may use Bluetooth wireless technology as the data transfer mechanism, and may use data transfer profiles for data exchange from the headset to the gateway and for controlling certain functions or operations of the gateway. These profiles can be of any suitable protocol or format, including, but not limited to, Object Push Profile (OPP), File Transfer Profile (FTP), Human Interface Device Profile (HID), Personal Area Networking Profile (PAN), Wireless Application Protocol Bearer (WAPB) Profile. Voice data is typically carried via Hands-Free and Headset Profiles (HFP and HSP). Typically, once both devices are bonded and paired, data and voice channels are opened concurrently.","In some embodiments, a wireless headset uses a wireless transport mechanism (e.g. Bluetooth) to discover services available on the gateway or accessible by the gateway, and uses the appropriate negotiation protocol or profile to communicate data and receive information regarding the capabilities of the gateway. In some cases, the headset may store information regarding the capabilities of the gateway and continuously update its knowledge of the gateway's characteristics and specifications through execution of an application that is loaded onto the gateway.","Once a voice command interface application is loaded onto the audio or voice gateway, the gateway may behave as a wireless, portable modem that is capable of data exchange and communication with the headset. The headset may use voice commands for control of the application and gateway functions (via an applet, for example). The voice command interface application executing on the gateway parses and processes the voice commands. Once processed, the voice command may be responded to with the requested information, or confirmed (e.g., an audio reply may be sent to headset).","As an example, a mobile phone under the control of the headset may access an application resident on a network server, where the server is capable of communication with the phone via a device that facilitates data transfer between a wired and wireless network. In other cases, an application may be resident on the mobile phone. Voice commands from the headset are communicated to the phone and used to execute desired functions of the application, whether the application is on the phone or on a server that is part of a network in communication with the phone. As the user speaks, the process of communicating with the mobile phone to provide the desired service is initiated. For instance, a user can be driving and using the headset, which is in communication with the mobile phone on which the application is loaded (or the phone may be in communication with a server on which the application is executing). When the user says \u201cdirections\u201d, a confirmation is received and a response such as \u201cwhere do you want to go?\u201d can be provided. The user can then state an address, and in return receive a message (or a tone) indicating that the directions are available. The user can then say \u201cbegin\u201d, and a first direction may be given to the user. The user can prompt the application for further directions by stating \u201cnext\u201d. The application may be configured to act on key words to provide directions without the user needing to look at the phone or physically interact with the phone. In an embodiment, once the application has the address, the directions may be acquired by the application from a network (typically the Internet). Note that acquiring driving directions is just one example of a service that can be delivered to a user in this manner. Further, for the example of driving directions or another application, the directions or other output could be provided without additional user prompts over a phone call or suitable streaming audio service (e.g., playback from an Internet web-site).","In general, embodiments of the invention include, but are not limited to, being implemented as part of the following operations, actions, methods or processes, with each such operation, action, method, or process capable of being implemented in whole or in part as an apparatus or system that includes a processor executing a set of instructions, as a set of instructions contained on a computer-readable medium, among other embodiments:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","908","906","908","912","910","902","904","906","900","904","902"]},"The chip\/device abstraction layer is a layer that provides a consistent API that sits above the internal DSP\/Processor and lower level device functions. This provides a constant functional API to the upper layers regardless of the underlying processor or processor\/DSP functions. In the situation where one processor\/DSP doesn't provide certain features of another processor\/DSP, the feature can either be written for local emulation or marked\/flagged as not available. The audio management layer provides functional management of the audio features of the headset. By placing this above the device abstraction layer it is generally possible to have instances of the noise suppression or other audio features independent from the processor\/DSP. The service management layer provides the basic API for application and service development. Functions exposed at this layer may include button presses, sensor changes, battery level indications, timers, display interfaces, network interfaces, etc","An example of the operation of the system  will now be described with reference to the circled numbers and arrows in the diagram of . In this example, the figure shows three paths or network connections:\n\n","As shown at path , a voice command may be issued from a headset  through a voice or audio gateway (which will be described in greater detail with reference to the other figures) to a communications network . The voice or audio gateway can be a device capable of communication with (or resident on) a network , or included as part of wired or wireless headset . A voice or audio gateway may support digitized voice, VoIP (voice over Internet Protocol), or traditional voice services. A voice or audio gateway may be comprised of a PC, WiFi Access Point, Cellular phone, Wireless home phone, etc. The voice or audio gateway may also serve as a data gateway for some services. Referring to , , and in the figure, if the voice command is co-processed by a network -based service it may be transported through the Internet or directly to a service of the proprietary network . If the service is a voice-based or audio service, voice or audio is returned to the user. An example is a request for streaming music from a back-end library, a music library located in the home, etc. Another example is a voice-based messaging service. If the voice command is a request for data (from either a back-end service or a service on a co-located network) a data path is established through a data gateway. The data gateway may be included as part of a voice or audio gateway, or be implemented as a separate entity such as a WiFi Access point.","Referring to , , and in the figure, a data command (path ) issued from headset  or generated as a result of a command issued by headset and processed by a voice, audio, or data gateway, or other device is delivered to a back-end server. The data command could be a request for an application or other service, metadata describing a location of an application or service, or metadata defining a command or instruction for an application or service. Data commands are not limited to any standard based protocol and may be a proprietary protocol. This includes using the inventive platform to install a protocol that can run over Bluetooth as only a transport, or a standard protocol such as SMS, HTTP, WAP Push, etc. The service could be provided through the Internet  or directly to the proprietary network .","Referring to , , and in the figure, the requested service, data or application output is returned to headset  through the data network (e.g., the Internet  or the proprietary network  directly). A data service may be any service that could reside on the headset , voice or audio gateway, data gateway, or another device such as a DVR. The service may also be a service that is shared between the headset  and the voice or audio gateway, or data gateway, such as headset configuration management or service management. A shared service may include, for example, a service that is shared or allows voice-driven command and control of functions of headset  or other device including the voice or audio gateway, or data gateway, or home services or devices such as music players, DVRs etc.","The data service can be delivered using any device that requires command\/control. This could include an applet on headset  alone (such as a voice-driven interface where different languages are requested, a streaming music interface, or to remotely program a DVR, etc). Alternatively an application can be installed on a device to allow the device to directly accept voice-driven commands from headset  or to provide a shared service between headset  and the device (such as using the device to control headset features and visa-versa).","When wireless communications networks  are used, such as a cellular network that may be subject to signal fade, packet or signal loss, a shared service between headset  and the voice or audio gateway, or data gateway may be used to buffer the requests and send them as network  becomes available. Headsets  can be connected to a voice, audio or data gateway either directly or through a wired interface. Where wireless headsets  are used, such headsets will typically support multi-pairing or multi-device connection when interfacing with more than one data, voice, or audio gateway.","A wired headset  may include a handset that is equipped with data management platform . Further, in some embodiments headset  may be equipped with a noise suppression system or service, such as one developed by Aliphcom, Inc. Aliphcom's proprietary microphones and noise suppression techniques provide better performance for voice-based services used with headsets. In contrast, other noise suppression systems used in headsets often cause too severe voice signal degradation to effectively support such services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"In the exemplary method or process illustrated in , a headset and audio gateway are used to enable a user of the headset to access a desired application and control the execution of the functions of the application. Note that with reference to the figures and the embodiments of the invention that will be described, an audio gateway refers to an audio or voice gateway, and may include or be part of the functions of a data gateway. The headset may be a wired or wireless headset. In the case of a wireless headset, the headset may communicate with the audio gateway using any suitable technology or protocol, including but not limited to, Bluetooth, infrared, optical, or other radio frequency technology. The \u201cheadset\u201d may also be a speaker phone or other form of audio input and playback device that is capable of communication with the audio gateway. The audio gateway may be one or more of a mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, desktop computer, or other communications device. The audio gateway may also be a game console or device for which a user desires to have the ability to control some or all of the functions or features of the console or device by using voice commands or other signals generated by the headset. The headset and audio gateway may be separate devices or units, or implemented as part of the same device or unit. Further, the headset may be connected to one or more such devices and be used to control features or functions of each such device independently. This may be accomplished, for example, by using an application resident on the headset to switch between the devices and thereby control the desired device.","Note that to improve the operation of the headset and audio gateway system, the headset may incorporate noise cancellation, noise suppression, or voice enhancement technologies. An implementation of a speech sensor and associated components and signal processing that is suitable for use in a headset that may be used as part of the present invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,246,058, issued Jul. 17, 2007, entitled \u201cDetecting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors\u201d, and the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Continuing with reference to , in stage , communication is initiated between the headset and the audio gateway. This may be accomplished by the headset sending a request to the gateway, the gateway sending a request to the headset or another suitable method. Typically, communication is initiated in accordance with a predefined protocol that is compatible with the communications technology being utilized. In some embodiments, this may be part of a \u201cpairing\u201d or similar operation conducted between the headset and gateway. For example, the headset and gateway may exchange a password, encryption key, or other data that may be used to activate or configure a communications capability. At stage  a communication link and\/or data transfer capability is established between the headset and audio gateway. This may involve selection or negotiation of a communications protocol, access and download of a configuration file for the headset or gateway, or other similar process. The result is typically the provisioning or configuration of a communications channel between the headset and audio gateway, thereby enabling the transfer of voice communications and\/or data between the headset and gateway.","At stage  the headset initiates a \u201cservice discovery\u201d function with regards to the audio gateway. The service discovery function enables the headset to become aware of the configuration and\/or communications capabilities of the gateway. This may be accomplished by any suitable method, such as accessing a configuration file stored in the gateway, sending data from the headset to the gateway to determine if the gateway responds, use of a predefined protocol, etc. One goal of this stage is to determine what communications capabilities and\/or data transfer methods are supported by the headset and gateway. This may include determining the user interfaces, data input mechanisms, messaging capabilities, or communications protocols supported by the headset and gateway. This information may be used to determine how to transfer or how to cause the transfer of a desired application to the gateway under the control of the headset.","At stage , the audio gateway is configured to allow the exchange of data and commands (typically voice commands) with the headset. This will typically involve configuring a voice recognition application (e.g., an application that can process voice inputs and output commands or instructions for the control of the application or of another application) resident on the gateway to permit the exchange of voice commands from the headset as inputs. The inputs are interpreted or recognized by the voice recognition application and used to control the execution of a function of that application or of another application, where the other application may be resident on the gateway or on a server connected to the gateway by a suitable network. Note that in some embodiments, the voice recognition application may be resident on a server that is coupled to the audio gateway by a communications network. In such cases the voice recognition application may be downloaded to the audio gateway and installed before the application is configured to enable communications with the headset.","In some embodiments, the voice recognition application may be resident on the headset instead of being on the audio gateway or a server located on a network coupled to the gateway by a communications network. In addition to, or instead, a configuration file or other relevant data may be stored on the headset and used to configure the headset or configure the gateway after being transferred from the headset. As shown at stage , if desired, a voice recognition application may be transferred from a storage element on the headset (e.g., flash memory) to the audio gateway, followed by installation and configuration of the application on the gateway.","Whether the voice recognition application is initially resident on the headset, audio gateway, or on a server the result of stage  or  is to enable a user to utilize voice commands or instructions to control the execution of functions or operations of the gateway, an application resident on the gateway, or an application resident on a server in communication with the gateway over a communications network.","After configuration of the headset and audio gateway to enable use of voice commands, a user may optionally initiate discovery of applications or data resident on the gateway (stage ) or accessible via a network that the gateway is capable of communicating with (stage ). Such applications or data may be \u201cdiscovered\u201d by executing a discovery function using voice inputs from the headset, for example. The object of the discovery function is to determine those applications, features, or functions resident on the audio gateway or a network connected to the gateway (e.g., a corporate network, the Internet, or another public or private network) that may be utilized with the headset to deliver services or data to the user. Typically, these will be applications whose functions can be executed using voice inputs, although they may provide outputs in audio or data format. The discovery process may involve accessing application or data definition files and comparing certain data or application descriptions to those of a configuration file that defines the capabilities of the headset or gateway, for example. The discovery process may also include searching a network for applications that satisfy certain requirements and hence are compatible with the headset and gateway. Examples of such applications or functions include, but are not limited to, banking, directions or mapping, searching databases, controlling a device or system (e.g., an electronic component), audio or music file acquisition and playback, voice activated dialing using data obtained from a personal data file or phonebook, etc. The discovered applications or functions may be made known to the user by providing an audio stream listing the information, providing a menu or list for display on the audio gateway, or another suitable method.","After discovering the available applications or data resident on the audio gateway or on a server or network that the gateway is capable of communicating with, the user may select the desired application(s) or data. This may involve accessing the desired application or data on the audio gateway or network, or downloading the application or data to the gateway where is it installed and made available for access by the user of the headset (stage ). Applications are executed or data retrieved using voice inputs or commands provided by the user from the headset (stage ). This enables the headset user to execute application functions or retrieve data using voice commands. In response to executing the commands or retrieving the data, the audio gateway provides an audio stream or signal to the headset as the output of the command or operation (stage ).

A data listing of the services or capabilities that are compatible with the headset are then sent to the headset by the audio gateway, as indicated at stage . Depending upon what services or capabilities are supported by the audio gateway, the headset may transfer an application stored on the headset to the gateway, as shown at stage . In addition to, or instead of sending an application to the gateway, the headset may send metadata such as an AT command or URL to the gateway (as will be described with reference to ). The AT command or URL may then be used by the audio gateway to access and download a desired application (where the AT command or URL provide information that identifies the application and\/or its location on a network). The AT command or URL may be provided in situations in which download of the application from the headset to the audio gateway is not supported or is otherwise made inefficient due to the services and capabilities of the gateway.","At stage , the audio gateway installs the application (whether received directly from the headset or obtained from another source as a result of a command or metadata from the headset), and executes the application. Note that upon receipt of the application or metadata, the audio gateway will typically automatically attempt to reconnect with the headset (if not already connected).","At this point, and as an example, one of two process paths may follow. One path is shown at stages  and , where voice commands sent by the headset are interpreted by the application on the audio gateway (stage ) and used to initiate execution of a specified function or operation. This may occur as the result of installation on the gateway of a voice recognition application or may be part of another type of application that is configured to utilize a voice input user interface. For example the commands can include commands to get directions, take down notes, find a business, or anything else that can be communicated to the audio gateway with a key word or sequence that the gateway can respond to. In response, the audio gateway sends the requested service or application output to the headset in the form of an audio stream (stage ).","A second process path is shown with reference to stage . In this path, the installed application is used to configure certain features of the headset and\/or gateway. For example, this process can be executed when a user initializes a new headset, in which case an application can customize the headset for language, ring tone, audio tone, etc. As an example, the application installed on the gateway may be a \u201cdashboard\u201d application for the headset that enables use of the gateway user interface(s) to configure certain functions or features of the headset.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3","3","3","304","302","304","302","306","302","306","302","306"]},"In some embodiments, configuration of certain functions or capabilities of headset  may be managed or controlled by device . In such a situation, transferred application  may be an application that provides a \u201cdashboard\u201d function for headset configuration. This enables a user to configure certain functions or features of headset  using the user interface(s) of device . In such a case, confirmation of configuration changes, etc. may be provided by audio or visual responses. Note that in addition to being obtained from data storage on headset , application  may be downloaded to device  by any suitable method, including, but not limited to, wireless or wired Internet (in which case the application may be obtained from a device coupled to device  by a suitable communications network), a data storage device, compact disc, etc. Note also that application  may be an application that enables voice inputs from the headset to be used to control aspects of the operation of gateway  or the execution of another application. Device  is typically capable of communicating with headset  via a suitable communication protocol such as Bluetooth, for example, so that an application or data stored on headset  may be transferred to audio gateway  via a wireless communications technology.","Note that in some embodiments described herein, connected devices  are audio gateways, but implementations of the present invention are not limited to device  acting as an audio gateway. Audio gateways may include, but are not limited to, personal computers (PCs), PDAs, mobile phones, or other devices capable of wired or wireless communication via known networks and protocols. For example (and as described in part with reference to ), in some embodiments, the application may be sent to an audio gateway using Bluetooth as a transport mechanism, after service discovery has been performed by the headset to determine which protocols are supported by the gateway, whether the gateway can receive a certain type of application, etc. In some embodiments, the application may be sent via Bluetooth transports and protocols, where within Bluetooth transports are multiple protocols. For example, an OBEX protocol (which is an object push profile or OPP) may be used. A file transfer protocol (FTP) may also be used.","In some embodiments, the audio gateway or device  may include noise cancellation or signal enhancement capabilities. This may be important in some use cases as inferior audio quality has hampered voice dialing and the provision of other voice services in the past. In some embodiments, improved audio quality may be coupled with management of voice service requests in an asynchronous manner. For example, voice requests, commands, or instructions from the headset may be stored on device  for use with an application on the device or delivery to an application over a connected network at a later time. Similarly, responses to such requests, commands, or instructions from a server or application on a network may be stored on device  for delivery to the headset at a later time. This reduces packet loss and connection loss when the voice services do not need immediate attention. Further, as mentioned, headset  may include noise cancellation, noise suppression or signal enhancement functions that provide increased clarity for the voice commands issued by the headset and enable more effective interaction with the voice recognition application or interface being used on device .","After application  is stored on an audio gateway or device , it is executed on the audio gateway or device. Application  typically provides a service, in which case audio gateway or device  may be configured to have a connection to the Internet or another network , as shown in . In the case of device  being a PC, high speed access to the Internet may include an Ethernet connection.","Once application  has established an Internet or other network connection, audio gateway or device  can reestablish its connection with headset . Once headset  is aware the connection has been reestablished, it typically assumes that the connection is successful. At this point headset  is able to control some or all of the functions and operational features of audio gateway or device , or of an application that may use voice inputs. For example, a user of headset  may issue a voice request or command, such as a request for directions, a request for a notepad, an inquiry that may be used as part or all of a search query, or another form of command that requires audio gateway or device  to the access the Internet or other network  and to provide some sort of service through headset .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D"],"b":["302","306","306","302","306","302"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A","b":["4","4","302","402","306","302","306"]},"As shown in , headset  sends a metadata file or URL  to audio gateway .

Note that application  may be any suitable application that a user of headset  desires to have access to and that may be installed and executed on audio gateway  or other device connected to the Internet or other network . Thus, in some embodiments or use cases, headset  transfers data or metadata representing a resource location or resource identifier to audio gateway , instead of an application.
