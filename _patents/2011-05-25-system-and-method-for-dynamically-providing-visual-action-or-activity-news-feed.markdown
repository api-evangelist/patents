To understand activity recognition better, consider the following scenario. An elderly man wakes up at dawn in his small studio apartment, where he stays alone. He lights the stove to make a pot of tea, switches on the toaster oven, and takes some bread and jelly from the cupboard. After taking his morning medication, a computer-generated voice gently reminds him to turn off the toaster. Later that day, his daughter accesses a secure website where she scans a check-list, which was created by a sensor network in her father's apartment. She finds that her father is eating normally, taking his medicine on schedule, and continuing to manage his daily life on his own. That information puts her mind at ease. Due to its many-faceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.","Types of Activity Recognition","Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition: Sensor-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel data mining and machine learning techniques to model a wide range of human activities. Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering ubiquitous computers and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf.","Levels of sensor-based activity recognition: Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, statistical modeling has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, statistical inference may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or sub goals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.","Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition: Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.","Vision-based activity recognition: It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is computer vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, robot learning, and surveillance, among others.","In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as optical flow, Kalman filtering, hidden Markov models, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.","Levels of vision-based activity recognition: In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation","Approaches of Activity Recognition:","Recognition through logic and reasoning: Logic-based approaches keep track of all logically consistent explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered.","Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning: Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals.","Wi-Fi-Based Activity Recognition","Data Mining Based Approach to Activity Recognition","Plurality of physical action or activities recognition algorithm, research, systems, method, devise can apply or use or employ for identifying, recognizing various types of user or any entities including human, non-human, building, tree, device, machine, bird, group of humans related actions, status, environment, conditions, logs, transactions, events, interactions, and activities including human related like edits, touches, senses, motion, hear, view or see something, taste, experience, environment, reads, eat, drink, like, drive, walk, talk, think, feel, breathe, performance, interaction with people, object or anything, user status & conditions, attention, pick something, running, standing, setting, shopping, doing housework, dancing, singing, jump, fall, preparing dinner & lunch, listing to music, taking medications, watching, washing, bathing, dressing, cleaning, sleeping, resting, buying, selling and plurality of other human or group of humans or environment of human actions, activities, status.","Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location.
