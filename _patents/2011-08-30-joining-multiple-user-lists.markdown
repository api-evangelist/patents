{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/379,281, filed on Sep. 1, 2010. The disclosure of the prior application is considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.","This document relates to presenting content.","Providing relevant advertising content to users is generally important to advertisers and service providers. However, implementing a cost-effective way of providing such relevant advertising content can prove difficult in an ever-changing online market. Further, while relevant information for targeting a particular user may be known by one entity, others may not readily have access to or be able to use such information when, for example, making targeting decisions.","This document discusses systems and techniques by which multiple user lists are joined.","In one aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining two user lists that are associated with the user, each user list including a definition that characterizes members of a respective user list, determining a consumer is a subscriber to the two user lists, determining the consumer has indicated a preference to target members that are included in both user lists, and providing an indication to the consumer for all users that are included in both user lists including providing the definitions associated with both user lists along with the request to the consumer.","In another aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises providing a user interface including a presentation of one or more user lists to a consumer, each user list including a definition that characterizes members of a respective user list, receiving an indication of a selection of two lists from the user lists, receiving an indication of a function for joining the user lists to create a customized list that includes one or more members, and storing the selection and the function for recall when a user associated with both lists provides a request for content.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The presentation includes a list of user lists and meta data describing each definition. The indication of a function is a Boolean AND function. The indication of a function is a Boolean NOT function. The indication of a function is a Boolean OR function. Joining the user lists to create a customized list includes using numerical comparisons and functions using information associated with users who are members of the user lists. The method further comprises determining three or more user lists that are associated with the user, each user list including a definition that characterizes members of a respective user list, determining a consumer is a subscriber to the three or more user lists, determining the consumer has indicated a preference to target members that are included in the three or more user lists, and providing an indication to the consumer for all users that are included in the three or more user lists including providing the definitions associated with the three or more user lists along with the request to the consumer. The method further comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining the user is a member of one or more of the two user lists, determining if the function is satisfied, and providing an indication of the satisfied function along with the request to the consumer.","In another aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises presenting user lists to a consumer, each user list including a definition describing members of a respective user list, receiving a selection of at least two user lists for subscription to by the consumer, creating a customized list including receiving a definition that is a function that relates the at least two user lists, and storing the customized list including the definition.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The function is an AND function. The method further comprises receiving a request for content from a user, determining the user is a member of one or more of the at least two user lists, determining if the function is satisfied, and providing an indication of the satisfied function along with the request to the consumer. The function is a Boolean function.","In another aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises presenting user lists to a consumer, each user list including a definition describing members of a respective user list, receiving a selection of at least two user lists for subscription to by the consumer where at least two of the user lists are associated with a different ownership entity, creating a customized list including receiving a definition that is a function that relates the at least two user lists, and storing the customized list including the definition such that unrelated user list data can be merged resulting in a more complex user list that specifies a consumer-defined combination of characteristics of members of the customized list.","In another aspect, a computer-implemented method comprises determining one or more user lists available for subscription, each user list including a definition that describes members of a respective user list, receiving a selection by a consumer of a subscription to two or more of the user lists, merging user list data including merging at least two user lists including merging the user list data according to a function defined by the consumer, the function describing a desired combination of the definitions associated with respective merged user lists, and providing to the consumer an indication of a user request for content when a request for content is received and the function is satisfied.","Implementations can include any, all, or none of the following features. The request is a request for an ad to be displayed to the user and where the consumer is an advertiser that is to provide customized content to the user. The user list comprises the definition and one or more members each identified by user-specific data. The user list is stored in a table of user lists and where the user-specific data identifies the user. The user-specific data is a global identifier associated with the user in an advertising serving system. The user lists are used by the consumer for adjusting bids in real time. The user lists are used by the consumer for customizing content to be presented to the user.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Advertisers, publishers, and service providers generally may wish to exchange data for purposes of implementing a meaningful way of providing information and\/or services (e.g., advertising content) to online users. If specific content is determined to be meaningful to a particular user, then the user may wish to access the content, purchase the content, or otherwise interact with the content. This interaction can provide revenue to the content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher or service provider). If a particular content provider (e.g., advertiser, publisher, or service provider) can collect data about how specific content may or may not be meaningful to users (i.e., in the form of a user list), the collected data may be used by others in a variety of ways. One use relates to selecting targeted content. Other uses are possible, such as in adjusting bids in an auction based, for example, on user lists that indicate specific content is of interest to one or more users. User lists can be published, sold, licensed or otherwise accessed to assist in providing personalized content to the specific users and increasing revenue for a content provider. In some implementations, the definition of (and components included with) a user list can include: a numeric identifier, a short name, a free-text description (e.g., including a description of the process by which the user list was generated, what type of users are in the user list, etc.), the identifier and\/or name of the user list's owner\/holder, subscribers' names\/identifiers, identifiers of the users who are members of the user list, and so on.","User lists can represent specific user information pertaining to predefined categories. The categories can be defined by the data owners. For example, a user list may include data about one or more users which characterizes the users to a category (e.g., homeowner, craftsman, DVD renter, etc.) to allow targeting of the users by, for example, publishers or advertisers. In some implementations, the user lists can be used to target relevant advertising content.","User lists can be generated and exchanged according to a number of rules, and those rules can be used to market particular user lists to specific consumers. The rules can employ methods of assigning users to particular user lists. Such rules can provide a logical categorization of data, information, or services for the purposes of determining which data content in the user lists is particularly relevant to a number of users.","Methods are described for associating user specific information with one or more user lists that are owned or maintained by a data owner. An association between the user-specific data and the user lists is made. The association can be exploited, for example, for real-time bidding in response to requests for content or to customize content to be provided to a specific user. Other uses of the user list information and associations are possible.","In some implementations, two or more user lists can be \u201cjoined\u201d, meaning that users who are members of the two or more user lists can be members of a user list that logically joins the two or more user lists. In some implementations, the mechanism or function by which the user lists are joined can use Boolean operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT, etc.). As an example, User List XANDY can be the members of User List X AND members User List Y, while User List XORY can be the members of User List X OR members User List Y.","In some implementations, other functions can be used, such as comparison functions. For example, if users' incomes are known, User List I-200 can include members with incomes of $200K or greater. As a result, advertisers can target members of the User List I-200, for example, for ads of products that are likely to be affordable by high-income consumers. Likewise, if user's ages are known, User List A-50-70 can include members who have ages between 50 and 70, and such a user group can be used, for example, by advertisers who want to target people nearing or at retirement age. In another example, advertisers may target ads for high-end investments to the members of the joined user lists I-200 and A-50-70.","In some implementations, the union or intersection of two or more user lists can exist only briefly, for example, for just long enough (e.g., at run-time) for advertisers to target ads to the members of the joined user lists. In some implementations, the joined user lists can be saved, for example, and given a name and a description that includes the semantics and\/or descriptions of the individual user lists and a joining function. In some implementations, consumers of user lists (e.g., advertisers who use them to target specific users who are potential customers) can subscribe to various user lists, e.g., by paying a fee to have access to the information in the user lists. Fees or other monetary arrangements can be, for example, on a per-user basis, a scheduled time, and so on. In some implementations, fees can be tied to the number of ad impressions that are served by the advertisers upon use of the user list information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The user lists can be provided to the data exchange and maintained by the data exchange and\/or by the data owners. User lists can be updated as appropriate to either refine the category\/categories associated therewith or the users that are members of a given list. Management of user lists is described in greater detail below.","The system  includes a data exchange engine  for providing an interface for advertisers and other consumers to discover and\/or license user lists . The data exchange engine  can be configurable to maintain, update, present, license, sell or otherwise manage one or more user lists based on owned or permissioned data. The generated user lists can include user-specific associations characterizing specific online user behavior. The associations can be used, for example, to provide personalized content from an advertising server , a third-party server , or other content provider. The data exchange engine  as described here may parallel the functionality of an online advertisement exchange system for active targeted online advertisers, for example.","The system  includes a data store of customized lists  that are based on user lists . For example, an entry in the data store of customized lists  can include definitions with functions that represent various combinations (e.g., unions, intersections, etc.) of two or more user lists . In some implementations, consumers (e.g., advertisers) can use one or more user interfaces (e.g., provided by the data exchange engine ) to select two or more user lists  to produce a customized list.","In some implementations, the data exchange engine  can create an exchange between owners of permissioned data and consumers of such data. Consumers of the permissioned data can include advertisers that seek to target particular categories of users. In some implementations, the data exchange engine  provides a mechanism for a provider of advertising placement services in targeted online advertising to make available additional third-party data sources to buyers of advertising space. In some implementations, the data exchange engine  can provide user lists to publishers, syndicates, and other data providers for various purposes, including the targeting of advertising content to users.","The data exchange engine  can provide an interface for data owners to securely view and manage their own data (i.e., manage a user list). For example, a data owner can generate and store information in a user list by entering data both manually and automatically. Other entities may be permitted to enter\/maintain information in a user list. Publishers can also extract data for direct sales models or other marketing plans. Although computer hardware is not depicted in the data exchange engine , processors, memory, and other processing components may be included.","The advertising server  can provide advertising content to any number of browsers  via the data exchange engine  or directly. In addition, the advertising server  can be configurable for receiving advertising content requests and providing advertising content to requesting users. In operation, the advertising server  can select advertisements targeted based on one or more criteria and in view of data that is included in one or more user lists. The advertising server  can also provide access to other storage elements, such as ad repositories, in the example shown as ad repository . The ad repository  can be used to store advertising content associated with particular keywords, bidding criteria, advertisers, and targeting criteria. Data storage elements may include any one or combination of methods for storing data, including without limitation, arrays, hash tables, lists, and pairs. The advertising server  can access other similar types of data storage devices, such as user lists , for example. While reference is made to providing advertisements, the advertising server  can provide other forms of content.","In some implementations, advertisers can work with data providers to purchase or license user lists for purposes of targeting certain categories (e.g., demographic categories, interest categories, preference categories). The user lists can be analyzed for quality and other considerations. The advertisers can use the user lists for determining targeting criteria or to modify current bids, for example. In one example use case, an advertiser can subscribe for a period of time to a user list. The user list itself may be defined as being associated with a certain category (e.g., Internet shoppers interested in buying a sports car) of users. Requests for advertisements can be received by the advertising system, and the data exchange can be used to determine for a given user to which user lists the user is subscribed. In a real-time bid example, the advertisers that have subscribed to the user lists may be presented with the request (and necessarily information that the users satisfy the category(ies) associated with the user list(s)), and then may adjust\/submit bids in consideration of such information. This is just one example of a use for the user list data.","The third-party servers  can provide third-party services to any number of browsers  via the data exchange engine . For example, the third-party servers  can provide web services, advertising services, or external APIs (application programming interfaces) to connect to a third-party server. The third-party servers  can include, for example, one or more servers executing a search engine application program. In some implementations, the third-party servers  can include a related information server or an advertising server. Third-party servers  can track user activity using, for example, cookies .","The browser  represents a user browsing the Internet. The browser  can access any website available on a network belonging to a person, or any other type of entity such as a company, enterprise, etc. For example, in  browser  can access a service or website. The service or website can be hosted by the third-party server , or alternatively by another server associated with system . A user can employ the browser  to search the Internet for services, information, or merchandise. The browser  can track user activity using, for example, cookies .","In some implementations, the advertising server  includes one or more advertisement customizers (not shown) operable to customize advertising content according to one or more user lists. In particular, an advertisement customizer can customize the display criteria, language, or other content of an advertisement according to user list information. For example, if a particular user list includes user-entered searching pertaining to purchasing a vehicle, the advertising server  can use the user-entered searching information (e.g., a cookie stored from performing a web search in a browser) to customize the display or content of an advertisement. The customization can, for example, provide the user with a more relevant advertisement.","In operation and for each generated user list, the system  can store, for example in a table-based repository, a list of user lists for which a particular user belongs. The table-based repository can, for example, be represented by a proprietary distributed storage system having a multi-dimensional sorted map as described in the paper entitled \u201cBigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data\u201d by Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, and Robert E. Gruber, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The table-based repository represents a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size (e.g., petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers). Each user list in the proprietary database can be included in one or more tables having multiple dimensions (one of which may be a field for time, allowing for versioning and garbage collection).","The system  can provide an index to the table-based repository. The index can be represented by, for example, a user cookie. For example, the table-based repository may be a set of rows and columns where the rows represent cookies corresponding to particular users and the columns represent a characterization associated with the user list, such as particular categories, keywords, websites, or other descriptive data.","At some point, the user browser  can make a request for advertising content from the advertising server  or the third-party server . The data exchange engine  can retrieve a list of user lists from the table-based repository associated with a received request from a given user and provide the request to identified consumers of the user lists. Any subsequent processing of the request can use the list, for example, for targeting, advertising customization and bid generation. The list of user lists or portions of the list can also be transmitted to a real-time bidder to provide the bidder with pertinent information about one or more users. Other uses are possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","200","104","102","104","200","104","200","102","102","104","102","104","212","200","212"]},"In the example shown, each row represents a single user. A user identifier (not shown) can be used to identify a user. The user identifier can be a user identifier associated with a user in a domain associated with the entity that owns\/provides the data (i.e., a local identifier). In some implementations, such as those where plural different entities provide user lists that are stored in a single table, the user identifier can be of the form of a global identifier associated with the user, such as an identifier that the advertising system assigns to the user. Global identifiers can be associated with \u201clocal\u201d entity identifiers and mapped such that requests that include a local entity identifier can be associated with the global identifier and hence, can be associated with user lists associated with plural entities. As a user can be associated with multiple user lists owned by different data owners, global identifiers can help to tie together those user lists for that user.","In the example shown, each column represents a user list that includes a characterization (sometimes referred to as a definition), such as by way of a particular category(ies), keyword(s), website(s), demographic(s), interest(s), or other user classification. Example characterizations in the table  include sports cars, washing machines, and green living (e.g., including environmentalists, recyclers, low carbon footprint individuals, etc.). The characterization can include descriptors, such as keywords, that describe a given category. Each characterization may embody the combination of plural separate categories or subject matter. For example, the characterization sports cars, may embody those individuals that visited a web site that were interested in cars and those that were particularly interested in sports cars (which themselves represent two different categories). In some implementations, logical combinations of categories or subject matter can be used to define the characterization for a given user list.","Columns - of the table  each can identify, at least at a high level, a different characterization associated with a different user list. For example, the column  identifies users characterized by \u201cCategory A Sports Cars.\u201d Other example characterizations and associated user lists are represented by column  (i.e., \u201cCategory B Washing Machines\u201d) and column  (i.e., \u201cCategory C Green Living\u201d) to name a few examples. The table  can represent hundreds or thousands of characterizations and associated user lists.","In some implementations, each entry in the table  (i.e., the intersection of a row and a column) represents whether the user is a member of a given user list. For example, entry  indicates that user A is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of sports cars, entry indicates that user Don is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of washing machines, and entry indicates that Don is interested in or associated with a user list that has the characterization of people with \u201cgreen\u201d lifestyles. In some implementations, other data may be included in the entry. Other data can include geo-location data, cookie data, further personal data related to the user and known by the data owner, example web pages or example content (e.g., content surfed by the user), keyword searches, location data, website data, side vertical data, page vertical data, formatted text strings (where the data owner may include data related to the particular user in accordance with a definition set by the data owner (e.g., a series of bits that are set or not depending on the individual user's data for things like demographics, other interests, or other data that is different from the characterization but may be of use in targeting information to the particular user)) or other data. For example, entry  includes an indication that user C is not only a member of the user list associated with category C (green living) but also that the user is located at a particular location (e.g., lives in Portland) and is a member of certain demographic groups (e.g., is male).","Identification of user lists to which a person belongs can be made by the data exchange engine  when a cookie or other user identifiable information is received. In some implementations, the data exchange engine  uses the cookie or user identifying information as an index to the user lists . For example, the data exchange engine  can cross reference received user identifier data with particular user list information to determine an association between user list data and the cookie data\/user information. As shown in user lists , a user (A) showed an interest in user list A which is characterized by the keywords \u201csports cars\u201d. For example, the user may, as part of a session with a given data provider, have provided a request to view sports cars made by Lexus such as providing a keyword search for \u201cLexus sports cars.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","102"]},"At stage , a request for content is received from a user. In some implementations, the request for content can be a request to serve an ad, for example, that the data exchange engine  receives as a result of a user (e.g., Don) who is browsing the Internet. Prior to receipt of the request to serve the ad, Don's browser may initially display search results that have been received in Don's browser in response to his search query, such as a query for area appliance stores (e.g., keywords \u201cmajor appliances\u201d). Don may formulate the query to search for a replacement washing machine, for example, and may even include \u201cwashing machines\u201d in the query. The search results may contain several entries for area appliance stores, and Don may select (e.g., click on) one of the search results entries. For example, one entry can be for Gary's Appliances Store, and the entry can include the name of the store, an address and phone number, a map and driving instructions, a snippet that describes the store, a clickable link to a corresponding webpage, and so on. As a result of clicking on the search result, Don's browser can attempt to navigate to the webpage (e.g., www.garysappliances.com) that corresponds to the search result. In this example, the webpage www.garysappliances.com can be designed to include or embed one or more ads, each of which being an available impression that can be served, for example, by the ad server . Thus, in this example, the request for content received from the user Don is a request to serve an ad on www.garysappliances.com. This request can, for example, be received and processed by the data exchange engine  and\/or other engines (e.g., by an advertising server engine).","At stage , two user lists that are associated with the user are determined, each user list including a definition that characterizes members of a respective user list. In the current example, referring to , the data exchange engine  can look up user lists  in the table  that are associated with Don. The look-up can employ user-specific data, such as the user's user identifier (e.g., \u201cDon\u201d or some other identifier as described above), as an index to the row of interest in the table . Further, information from, for example, a cookie on the user's computer (or information from the user's search query) can be used to associate the Category B Washing Machines user list with the user Don, an association depicted in  by the entry in column , signifying that Don is a member of that user list. The data exchange engine  can make the association using the definition for Category B Washing Machines that characterizes members in the user list. Furthermore, the data exchange engine  can determine that Don is also a member of a second user list, that being Category C Green Living, an association depicted in  by the entry in column , signifying that Don is a member of that user list.","At stage , a consumer is determined to be a subscriber to the two user lists. For example, the consumer can be an advertiser, and the data exchange engine  can determine that the advertiser subscribes to both the Category B Washing Machines user list and the Category C Green Living user list. The advertiser may subscribe to both user lists, for example, because the company manufactures appliances (including washing machines) that are energy efficient, and by subscribing to both user lists, the company can target ads to members of one or both user lists. The advertiser may subscribe to several other user lists that are not included in this example, and several other consumers (e.g., other advertisers) may also subscribe to both the Category B Washing Machines user list and\/or the Category C Green Living user list.","At stage , a determination is made whether the consumer has indicated a preference to target members that are included in both user lists. In the current example, the data exchange engine  can determine if the consumer (e.g., the appliance advertiser) has indicated a desire to target ads to users interested in washing machines and green living, such as is the case for the user Don, and may be the case for several other users.","At stage , an indication is provided to the consumer for all users that are included in both user lists, including providing the definitions associated with both user lists along with the request to the consumer. Continuing with the current example, the data exchange engine  can provide the Washing Machines and Green Living user list definitions, a list of users (including Don and potentially others) in both user lists, and the ad request to a consumer (e.g., the particular ad server  that can serve the ad to www.garysappliances.com). The combination of information in this way essentially serves to \u201cjoin\u201d the two user lists. The ad server  that is selected by the data exchange engine  to receive the ad request and the joined information can be a consumer (e.g., one of several ad servers ) that has subscribed to the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists. This example that includes users of both lists is based on the use of the Boolean AND function. In other examples, e.g., if the function is the Boolean OR function, the data exchange engine  can provide to the advertiser a list of users who are in either list.","In some implementations, three or more user lists that are associated with the user can be determined. Furthermore, the data exchange engine  can determine if a consumer (e.g., an advertiser) is a subscriber to the three or more user lists. In some implementations, the data exchange engine  can determine if the consumer has indicated a preference to target members that are included in the three or more user lists. As a result, in some implementations, when a request for content is received, the data exchange engine  can provide an indication to the consumer for all users that are included in the three or more user lists. The indication can include providing the definitions associated with the three or more user lists along with the request to the consumer.","In some implementations, the information acquired in the previous steps, including the user lists, can be passed to a real-time bidder. The bidding in this case can involve bids received from one or more consumers, or advertisers, who can bid on available impressions corresponding to, for example, the website to which the user is navigating. Using the targeting information, for example, bids can be adjusted in real-time. For example, a bid for an available impression may be significantly higher than otherwise because the targeted ad may be more likely to lead to a conversion. In some cases, bidding may occur without the use of the additional targeting information, and the additional targeting information can be used later as needed (e.g., to change the content of an ad). Real-time bidding can be used in other processes, including some or all of the processes - described below with reference to .","In some implementations, optionally and irrespective of whether bidding has occurred using the targeting information, user list and other information can be provided to an ad customizer. Returning again to the example involving ads provided to the user Don, the ad customizer can customize the ad using available information, including information from the two or more user lists to which Don is a member. The customized ad can be served right away and\/or stored in the ad repository . Customization of ads can also be used in other processes, including some or all of the processes - described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","102","102","102"]},"At stage , a user interface, including a presentation of one or more user lists, is provided to a consumer. Each user list includes a definition that characterizes members of each respective user list. As an example, a consumer such as an advertiser can access an application that displays existing user lists and their definitions. In some implementations, the user interface can provide meta data associated with each user list, such as the number of users who are members, the percent of growth over time, statistics representing the geographic distribution (e.g., the numbers of members in Washington, Oregon, etc.), demographics (e.g., gender\/age breakdowns, average incomes, education levels, etc.), ratings information, qualification information (e.g., requirements for the user to qualify for inclusion in the list) and so on. In some implementations, the user interface can identify how the consumer has previously used the user lists in previous joins, and include the number of resulting ad impressions for each, to a name a few examples. Example user lists that the consumer may see include user lists for members who are interested in Washing Machines, Green Living, and so on, representing several other user lists.","At stage , an indication of a selection of two lists from the user lists is received. For example, using controls within the user interface (e.g., checkboxes, mouse clicks, etc.), the consumer can select two user lists to be joined, e.g., the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists, for the purposes of creating a customized list.","At stage , an indication of a function for joining the user lists is received to create a customized list that includes one or more members. Continuing with the current example, the user may select the Boolean AND function for joining the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists in order to produce an intersection representing users who are interested in both categories. The intersection would include users such as Don who is interested in washing machines and living a green lifestyle, as depicted by entries and in . By joining the two lists with the AND function, the consumer is building an intersection of columns  and  in the table . If however, the consumer selects the Boolean OR function, the joining of the user lists produces the union of the two columns, or in the context of the current example, users who are interested in either washing machines OR green living (or both). In some implementations, any Boolean operators can be used in joining user lists, including combinations of ANDs, ORs and NOTs, such as in joins of three or more user lists. In some implementations, the user interface can include easy-to-use symbols that the user can select (e.g., with the mouse) or drag and drop into place to build the logic that represents the customized list. In some implementations, the user interface can display statistics corresponding to the resulting customized list, such as how many users are included in the customized list. In some implementations, the user interface can provide fields or other controls for the consumer to name the customized list and\/or type in a description. The name, for example, can be used by the consumer in order to access the customized list at a later time, e.g., to make changes, etc.","At stage , the selection and the function are stored for recall when a user associated with both lists provides a request for content.

In some implementations, the request for content can be a request to serve an ad, for example, that the data exchange engine  receives as a result of a user who is browsing the Internet and navigating to another webpage that includes a slot for an advertisement. For example, the user can be Gary, who like Don, also belongs to both the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists. The sequence of user actions leading up to the ad request in this example can be similar to those described above for stage  of the process .","At stage , a determination is made whether the user is a member of one or more of the two user lists. For example, when the request for content (e.g., an ad to be served on user Gary's browser) is received, the data exchange engine  can determine if Gary is a member of both the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists. The user lists are just two of the user lists in which the consumer may be interested in Gary's membership. In some implementations, the data exchange engine  can determine all of the user lists to which a user (e.g., Gary) belongs.","At stage , a determination is made whether the associated function is satisfied.

As an example, a consumer such as an advertiser can access an application that displays existing user lists and their definitions. In some implementations, the user interface can provide meta data associated with each user list, such as the number of users who are members, the percent of growth over time, statistics representing the geographic distribution (e.g., the numbers of members in Washington, Oregon, etc.), demographics (e.g., gender\/age breakdowns, average incomes, education levels, etc.), and so on. In some implementations, the user interface can identify how the consumer has previously used the user lists in previous joins, and include the number of resulting ad impressions for each, to a name a few examples.","At stage , a selection of at least two user lists is received for subscription to by the consumer. For example, using controls within the user interface (e.g., checkboxes, etc.), the consumer can select two user lists to be joined, e.g., the Washing Machines and Green Living user lists, for the purposes of creating a customized list. The data exchange engine , for example, can receive the user lists for subscription. In this case, the consumer is designating a subscription to the joined set of user lists.","At stage , a customized list is created. The user list includes a definition that includes a function that relates the at least two user lists. For example, as part of the subscription process and creating a customized list (e.g., based on joining two other user lists), the consumer can define a function that relates the two user lists. For example, using Boolean functions (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), the consumer can create customized lists of various kinds, e.g., Washing Machines AND Green Living, Washing Machines OR Green Living, or Washing Machines AND NOT Green Living, to name a few examples. The latter customized list (i.e., Washing Machines AND NOT Green Living) can be used, for example, to target ads to users who need washing machines but do not care about their energy efficiency. For the purpose of the present example, the Boolean function that the user selects can be the AND function, meaning that the customized list that is created is Washing Machines AND Green Living.","At stage , the customized list and definition are stored. For example, the data exchange engine  can store the customized list in the data store of customized lists .

In some implementations, the user interface can identify how the consumer has previously used the user lists in previous joins, and include the number of resulting ad impressions for each, to a name a few examples. In some implementations, the cost(s) associated with the use of each user list can also be displayed. For example, the costs can be based on the number of users in the user list, the value of the respective information, the number of eventual ad impressions that are served using the user lists, and so on.","In some implementations, some or all of the user lists that are associated with different ownership entities may not be stored by the data exchange engine  in the user lists . For example, ownership entities may store their \u201cowned\u201d user lists and provide permission to the data exchange engine  to access the user lists, e.g., over the Internet.

In some implementations, the process of merging the two user lists can leave the source user lists unchanged.","At stage , an indication of a user request for content is provided to the consumer when a request for content is received and the function is satisfied. In some implementations, the request for content can be a request to serve an ad, for example, that the data exchange engine  receives as a result of a user who is browsing the Internet and navigating to another webpage that includes a slot for advertisement.
