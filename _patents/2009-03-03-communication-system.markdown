title: Communication system
abstract: A cooperating system includes a web server and a communication service control server, where information of an error in a communication network is not notified until the web server makes an inquiry to the communication service control server. To solve this problem, a communication system is configured to include a session control server for controlling communication sessions from/to a plurality of terminals, an application server for communicating with the session control server, a web server for communicating with the application server, and a network for coupling the session control server, the application server and the web server. The application server is configured to transmit status related information including information on each communication session status of the plurality of terminals to the web server. The web server is configured to detect each communication session status of the plurality of terminals based on the received status related information.

The multimedia services include voice, data, video and the like. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has been promoting standardization of an \u201cAll IP based mobile communication network\u201d to provide a multimedia service using an internet protocol (IP) technique on a packet switching network.","A session control system in the All IP based mobile communication network is called an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS). The IMS has been used in the session control technique in the next generation network (NGN).","A session initiation protocol (SIP) is used as a session control protocol (For example, see IETF RFC3261, \u201cSIP: Session Initiation Protocol \u00a74\u201d). The SIP is a protocol for performing session control of the IP multimedia communication specified for internet engineering task force (IETF).","A voice over IP (VoIP) is a representative service using the SIP. The VoIP is a technique which transmits\/receives voice information on the IP network. The VoIP communication using the SIP requires a setting of a virtual speech path (a session) between communication devices which transmit\/receive voice information. Voice data which is IP packetized is transferred through the set virtual speech path. In the VoIP communication, the SIP controls initiation, maintaining and termination of sessions between the communication devices.","Media information such as attributes of the voice data is determined at the session initiation. The media information is notified using a session description protocol (SDP) included in a SIP message. The SDP describes various pieces of session information (an IP address, a port number, a media type, for example).","Further, an application programming interface (API) is being considered for being able to use a communication service provided by a provider from a Web service provided by a third party.","The Parlay Group is a group that specifies an open API which does not depend on a network or a vendor. The Parlay Group is planning to use \u201cParlay-X\u201d as the open API. \u201cParlay-X\u201d specifies APIs for the purposes of the usage in a Web service environment, and the Web service of which usage is not limited to an implemented language. The \u201cParlay-X\u201d provides Web developers with abstracted communication APIs.","The APIs specified in the \u201cParlay-X\u201d include, for example, 3rd party call control (3PCC) which provides a two-party speech service by initiating from a Web application side. (For example, see 5th Draft ES 202 504-2 Parlay X 3.0, \u201cPart 2: Third Party Call\u201d, [online], August 2007).","The Parlay Group cooperates with the European telecommunications standard institute (ETSI) and the 3generation partnership project (3GPP). The \u201cParlay-X\u201d is published by the three groups and defines a standard open interface; however, how the \u201cParlay-X\u201d is implemented is not specified.","In the \u201cParlay-X\u201d, usage of APIs for each service is specified. A request message (including session initiation, session termination and call information query) to a communication system from a Web application server and a response to the message are specified for the APIs to be used for the 3PCC.","However, ways for implementation such as transmitting intervals for the request message and the response message are not specified. Accordingly, in a case where the communication is terminated while the 3PCC service is provided, a way to notify that a server which provides with the Web application terminates the communication from the communication system is needed. For example, although when the communication is terminated, the termination cannot be notified to the communication system to the Web server. Thus, even though the communication is terminated, communication network resources are consumed more than necessary or billing mistakes occur because the Web server cannot detect the termination of the communication.","The object of this invention is to provide a method for a Web server to detect termination of communication sessions.","A representative aspect of this invention is as follows. That is, there is provided a communication system comprising: a session control server for controlling communication sessions from\/to a plurality of terminals, an application server for communicating with the session control server, a Web server for communicating with the application server, and a network for coupling the session control server, the application server and the Web server. The application server is configured to transmit status related information including information on each communication session status of the plurality of terminals to the Web server. The Web server is configured to detect each communication session status of the plurality of terminals based on the received status related information.","According to an embodiment of this invention, a Web server is able to detect termination of communication sessions on a communication system side.","A first embodiment of this invention is described with reference to the drawings.","As a representative example, a detailed description of a communication method using 3rd party call control (3PCC) is given.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"A network according to this embodiment includes IP network N and access networks NA, NB and NC (access network N).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["7","7","7","7","7","7","7"]},"The IP network N and the access network N are connected via access gateway apparatuses (AGWs)  (A, B and C).

In a case where the monitor  of the searched entry is \u201con\u201d, the SIP application server  transmits the Web server  of the message (notify Subscription Request) for notifying that the communication session is terminated (S).","The Web server  which received the message transmits the response message (notify Subscription Response) including a request for terminating the 3PCC service to the SIP application server  (S).
