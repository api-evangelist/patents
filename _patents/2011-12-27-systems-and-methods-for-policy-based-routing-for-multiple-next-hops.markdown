{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present applications claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/427,692, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods For Policy Based Routing For Multiple Next Hops\u201d and filed on Dec. 28, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular, the present application relates to systems and methods for policy based routing for multiple next hops.","In order to improve reliability of their networks, many organizations add redundancy through the use of multiple network links. For example, an organization may have a link to a first internet service provider, and a backup link to a second internet service provider. If one of the providers fails, the other link can be used as a backup to provide full service to the organization. Furthermore, while both links are active, they may be used to balance traffic, improving network throughput for the organization.","Traditional solutions for routing traffic over multiple network links are primarily simple destination address-based forwarding. For example, destination internet protocol (IP) addresses between 10.0.0.0 and 19.255.255.255 may go to a first link, while destination IP addresses between 20.0.0.0 and 29.255.255.255 may go to a second link. These solutions usually require manual setup and frequent tweaking to manage balancing between the links. Furthermore, because they focus only on the destination IP address, they may result in unbalanced loads where one IP receives more traffic than another. For example, a first server at a first destination IP address of 10.0.0.0 may be an email server and process only intermittent, non-time sensitive, short bursts of data. A second server at a second destination IP address of 20.0.0.0 may be a video conferencing server, and require low-latency, high-bandwidth network throughput. With only destination address-based forwarding, usage of multiple links from an organization to these servers may be unbalanced. Additionally, return or incoming traffic cannot be managed with only destination address-based forwarding.","The present application is directed towards policy based routing for intelligent traffic management via multiple next hops. In some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein may provide management of inbound and outbound traffic across multiple network links. These systems and methods may further provide reliability in case of link failure, and provide balancing of traffic, responsive to the latency and bandwidth requirements of various applications. Accordingly, these systems and methods may provide intelligent policy-based routing and network and port address translation, sensitive to application traffic types or protocols, source IP addresses and ports, destination IP addresses and ports, or any combination thereof, and can balance traffic loads among multiple available paths based on multiple traffic characteristics. In some embodiments, the routing may performed on a packet-by-packet basis, a transaction-by-transaction basis, or a session-by-session basis. In other embodiments, the systems and methods may include capabilities for application-aware health monitoring of available network paths. For example, the traffic management system may determine that latency on a link is too high for a first application, but sufficient for a second application, and may rebalance and route traffic accordingly.","In some aspects, the present solution is directed to a method for policy based routing of a plurality of next hops. The method includes matching, by a device intermediary to a plurality of devices and a plurality of next hops, one or more characteristics of a packet to one or more parameters of a policy. The policy specifies whether or not a routing action to a next hop of the plurality of next hops is allowed. The method further includes determining, by the device responsive to the matching, that the routing action is allowed and that one or more next hops of the plurality of next hops is up and selecting, by the device responsive to a load balancing decision, a next hop from the plurality of next hops identified by the policy. The device routes the packet to the selected next hop.","In some embodiments, the method includes matching one or more characteristics of the packet to a corresponding parameter of the one or more parameters of the policy. The one or more characteristics may include one or more of the following: source internet protocol address, destination internet protocol address, source port, destination port, protocol, Virtual LAN (VLAN) and source Machine Access Control (MAC). In some embodiments, the method includes matching, by the filter, the one or more parameters of the policy to the packet comprising one of an incoming packet or an outgoing packet of the device. In some embodiments, the method includes determining, by the device, that one or more next hops is up based on monitoring of a health of each of the plurality of next hops.","In some embodiments, the method includes performing, by the device, a type of load balancing based on a type of protocol of the packet. In some embodiments, the method includes performing, by the device, a request based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. In some embodiments, the method includes performing, by the device, a connection based load balancing for each new transport layer connection to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. In some embodiments, the method includes performing, by the device, time based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops.

Systems and Methods for Providing a Multi-Core Architecture","In accordance with Moore's Law, the number of transistors that may be placed on an integrated circuit may double approximately every two years. However, CPU speed increases may reach plateaus, for example CPU speed has been around 3.5-4 GHz range since 2005. In some cases, CPU manufacturers may not rely on CPU speed increases to gain additional performance. Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products, such as those of software and networking vendors, that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi-core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and\/or rewritten to take advantage of a multi-threaded, parallel architecture or otherwise a multi-core architecture.","A multi-core architecture of the appliance , referred to as nCore or multi-core technology, allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi-core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with , a single network or packet engine is run.

With a packet engine running on each core, the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments, this provides up to a 7\u00d7 increase in performance and scalability.","Illustrated in  are some embodiments of work, task, load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme, such as functional parallelism, data parallelism or flow-based data parallelism. In brief overview,  illustrates embodiments of a multi-core system such as an appliance \u2032 with n-cores, a total of cores numbers  through N. In one embodiment, work, load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A, a second core B, a third core C, a fourth core D, a fifth core E, a sixth core F, a seventh core G, and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N (hereinafter referred to collectively as cores .) There may be multiple VIPs  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines  each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different, varying or similar work load or performance level  across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach, each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine, a VIP  or appliance . In a data parallelism approach, data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card (NIC) or VIP  receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach, processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.","In further detail to , in some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments, a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach, the functions to be performed by the multi-core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments, functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases, different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.","In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to functional parallelism , can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input\/output management (NW I\/O) A, secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol (TCP) functions C. This may lead to a work, performance or computing load  based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to data parallelism , can comprise distributing an amount of work  based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments, distributing work across the cores  according to flow-based data parallelism , can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A-N on each core may be similar, substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and\/or described in conjunction with . In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in , division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .","In the case of the functional parallelism approach, each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine of the appliance. For example, core  may perform network I\/O processing for the appliance \u2032 while core  performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise, core  may perform SSL offloading while core  may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management.

In this the approach, the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse-grained or fine-grained manner. In some cases, as illustrated in  division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.","The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example,  illustrates a first core, Core  A, processing applications and processes associated with network I\/O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I\/O, in some embodiments, can be associated with a particular port number. Thus, outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I\/O A will be directed towards Core  A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I\/O port. Similarly, Core  B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core  D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.","While  illustrates functions such as network I\/O, SSL and TCP, other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example, any of the functions described in conjunction with  may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases, a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments, each core  can handle a particular functionality such that each core  can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example, Core  B may handle SSL offloading while Core  D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.","In other embodiments, work, load or network traffic may be distributed among cores  according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments, data parallelism may be achieved in a multi-core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments, a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments, different threads or instructions control the operation, but may execute the same code. In some embodiments, data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine, vServers (VIPs) A-C, network interface cards (NIC) D-E and\/or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example, each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different, varying or substantially the same amount of data, and as a result may have varying, different or relatively the same amount of load .","In the case of a data parallelism approach, the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs, NICs and\/or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches, the work of the multi-core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example, each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches, the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example, network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases, a core may process data from multiple NICs.","While  illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core , as is the case for VIP A, VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments, a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast, one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core  may include that core  to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments, each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments, each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.","Like vServers, NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments, NICs can be connected to one or more cores  such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets, a particular core  handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment, a single NIC can be associated with a single core , as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments, one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments, a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments, load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores  such that each core  processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core  associated with a NIC may process all functions and\/or data associated with that particular NIC.","While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency, in some embodiments, this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads  of .","In some embodiments, load, work or network traffic can be distributed among cores  based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches, the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.","In flow-based data parallelism , distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data, such as request\/response pairings, transactions, sessions, connections or application communications. For example, network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases, the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core  carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load, data or network traffic.","In some embodiments, the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic, such as a transaction, a request\/response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments, data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance \u2032 may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment, data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction, in some embodiments, can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example, Core  A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server, therefore the load A on Core  A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core  A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core  A.","While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions, in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments, the appliance  can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core  having the least amount of load. For example, the appliance  could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core  A because the load A on Core  is less than the load B-N on the rest of the cores B-N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core  A, the amount of load A on Core  A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance  intercepts a second data packet, the appliance  will allocate the load to Core  D because Core  D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can, in some embodiments, ensure that the load A-N distributed to each core  remains substantially equal.","In other embodiments, load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above-mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per\/packet basis. In other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10, 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core  having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core  can be a number determined by an application, user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments, load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core  for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments, packets can be distributed to a particular core  for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user, program, system, administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses, data packets are transmitted to a different core  for the predetermined period of time.","Flow-based data parallelism methods for distributing work, load or network traffic among the one or more cores  can comprise any combination of the above-mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance , by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores , such as the packet engine, or by any application, program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .","The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in  can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism , data parallelism , flow-based data parallelism  or any portions thereof. In some cases, the multi-core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.","Illustrated in  is an embodiment of a multi-core system , which may be any type and form of one or more systems, appliances, devices or components. This system , in some embodiments, can be included within an appliance  having one or more processing cores A-N. The system  can further include one or more packet engines (PE) or packet processing engines (PPE) A-N communicating with a memory bus .

When a packet engine  becomes associated with a particular entity, that packet engine  can process data packets associated with that entity. For example, should a packet engine  be associated with a first user, that packet engine  will process and operate on packets generated by the first user, or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly, the packet engine  may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine  can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.","In some instances, the packet engine(s) A-N can be configured to carry out the any of the functional and\/or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

Each core A-N, in one embodiment, can be associated with a particular packet engine  such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment, require that each packet engine A-N associated with a core  communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A-N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A-N based in part on the age of the engine's vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine's associated core .","Any of the packet engines running on the cores may run in user mode, kernel or any combination thereof.

In some embodiments, a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types, including TCP\/IPv4, TCP\/IPv6, IPv4, and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments, a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present (for example, two or four). In some embodiments, hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present (for example, 64 buckets). In some embodiments, the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments, the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments, the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.","The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input, such as a sequence of values.

Systems and Methods for Policy-Based Routing for Multiple Next Hops","Embodiments of the systems and methods of the present disclosure are directed towards policy-based routing for multiple next hops. Traditional routing algorithms, even highly sophisticated ones, may never achieve true load balancing for outbound traffic. Application requests may favor one server over another, resulting in more requests to one destination IP than another. With a router that is agnostic to these applications, traffic may not be properly or sustainably balanced.","Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present system, an appliance, such as any embodiments of the appliance  discussed herein, may identify applications generating requests, and apply one or more policies to route and balance the requests accordingly. In some embodiments, the appliance may include traffic filters to identify sections of traffic, such as transactions or sessions, and route this traffic on a more granular basis. In many embodiments, the appliance may include functionality for monitoring the health of one or more links, on an application-sensitive basis. For example, the appliance may monitor a link for latency, and route requests from applications requiring high- or low-latency links accordingly.

A \u201cnext hop\u201d identifies to what intermediate device an information packet can or will be sent next, e.g. to which router, server or network device. This next hop device may then again decide where the information is to be sent (e.g., the next hop from the previous next hop). The packet gets handed one router, server or network device to the next until the packet gets to the physical network of the destination device. In some embodiments, a next hop is considered a network service .

The load balancer may load balance a plurality of next hops. The load balancer may load balance responsive to one or more PBR policies and\/or filtering. The load balancer may perform a type of load balancing based on a type of protocol of the packet. In some embodiments, the load balancer performs a request based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. In some embodiments, the load balancer performs a connection based load balancing for each new transport layer connection to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. In some embodiments, the load balancer performs a time based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. In some embodiments, load balancer selects the next hop based on persistence determined by one of a destination internet protocol address or a source internet protocol address of the packet. In some embodiments, the appliance or vServer translates an internet protocol address of the packet based on the selected next hop.","A monitor or monitoring agent may comprise any program, script, daemon, or other computing routine that reports a performance or operational characteristic of a service, such as a link of a next hop or ISP A-N.

The monitor may determine the health or status of a next hop based on bandwidth usage via the next hop. The monitor may determine the health or status of a next hop based on a number of connections via the next hop. The monitor may determine the health or status of a next hop based on a number of users using the next hop.

The monitor may determine the health or status of a next hop based on round trip times between the appliance and the next hop. The monitor may determine the health or status of a next hop based on latency between the appliance and the next hop. The monitor may determine the health or status based on any corresponding thresholds for the statistical, operational or performance characteristic being monitored.","In further details of embodiments of operation of the system, multiple next hops may be configured for each policy-based rule (PBR). This may be done to achieve Internet link redundancy, efficient load balancing, application specific load balancing and prioritizing. Load balancing may be applied among the plurality of multiple next hops using one or more load balancing algorithms and policies. These algorithms and policies, sometimes referred to as load balancing methods or LB methods, may indicate how to distribute traffic load among multiple links. Through network address translation (NAT) and reverse NAT, these methods may balance inbound and outbound traffic transparently across the multiple internet connections. In one embodiment, the load balancing algorithm may define criteria or thresholds that the appliance may use to select the next hop to which it forwards packets. In a further embodiment, when the selected next hop reaches the configured criteria or threshold, the appliance may select a different next hop. For example, in one such embodiment, a first hop may be configured with a latency threshold of 45 ms. The appliance may route traffic on this hop until the latency increases past 45 ms, and then may route traffic via a different next hop. These characteristics may be narrowly or broadly defined, depending on need. For example, latency thresholds may be defined by ranges, such as low, medium, or high, or specific values.","Furthermore, in some embodiments, load balancing algorithms may be applied at various levels of granularity, to individual packets, to a packet flow, a transaction, a request, a connection, a session, or a group of packets over a predetermined time period. For example, in one embodiment in which an incoming packet is an HTTP or HTTPS request, a load balancing algorithm may be applied on a request-based level of granularity. Next hop selection may be performed for every HTTP or HTTPS request, independent of the number of TCP connections utilized. In another embodiment, the load balancing algorithm may be applied on a connection-based level of granularity. For example, a next hop selection may be performed for each new TCP connection. In yet another embodiment, the load balancing algorithm may be applied on a time-based or session-based level of granularity. For example, with a UDP or other time-sensitive connection, a next hop selection may be performed when the connection is opened, and may be used for a predetermined period of time. This may be referred to as a session, in some embodiments. When the period of time expires, the session may be deleted or closed, and a new session created and next hop selection performed again. This may be done even if the packets still come from the same client. Thus, UDP sessions may be load balanced in ways not possible in simple destination-based routing.","In one embodiment, load balancing algorithms or methods may include round robin based forwarding, in which the appliance may forward the packets to each link regardless of the load on any particular link. In another embodiment, the load balancing algorithms or methods may include least response-based forwarding. In this algorithm, the appliance may select a link with the lowest average response time. In a further embodiment, lowest average response time may be determined on a by-application, by-service, or by-protocol basis. For example, an appliance may include one or more probes or monitors to determine response times via different links of various services. In some instances, perhaps due to traffic shaping or filtering by an internet service provider, HTTP traffic may have a low response time via one link while peer-to-peer or bit torrent traffic has a high response time via the same link. Similarly, another link may have the opposite, with low response times for peer-to-peer traffic and high response times for HTTP traffic. By monitoring the response times on a per-protocol or per-application basis, the appliance may intelligently route traffic based both on lowest average response time, and the specific protocol or application of the packet.","In another embodiment, load balancing algorithms or methods may include forwarding based on hash results. Various data fields and strings in the header and\/or body of network packets may be used with a hashing algorithm to determine an index value which corresponds to a next hop in a list of next hops. Hashing algorithms may be highly efficient, and accordingly, the hash values may be cached, reducing CPU utilization of the appliance by eliminating the need to perform next hop selection for multiple packets in a session or transaction. For example, in one such embodiment using destination-based hashing, the appliance may calculate a hash for a request belonging to a specific subnet or destination address and select a next hop. This hash and selected next hop may be cached, such that future packets with the same destination address (and correspondingly, the same hash value) may be routed to the selected next hop without further selection or load balancing being required. In a similar embodiment, the source address of packets may be utilized for source-based hashing. In another embodiment, both source and destination addresses may be hashed, resulting in even more specific hash-based routing. In many embodiments, hashing packets or performing session-based routing may allow for session persistence. Session persistence, where all packets of a session are transmitted via the same next hop, may be highly desirable, particularly in high loss environments. Retransmissions and out-of-order packets may result in unpredictable behavior if sent via a variety of different links. Accordingly, through the various hashing methods discussed above, a single session comprising multiple packets may be sent via the same next hop, reducing or eliminating this unpredictable behavior.","In still another embodiment, load balancing algorithms or methods may include forwarding based on least bandwidth. The amount of traffic forwarded to each next hop may be monitored over a predetermined period of time, such as in megabits per second (Mbps), and the appliance may select a next hop based on which hop has the lowest current traffic bandwidth value. In a similar embodiment, load balancing algorithms or methods may include forwarding based on fewest or least packets. The appliance may monitor the number of packets forwarded to each next hop over a predetermined period of time, and may select a next hop based on which hop has had the fewest packets over the period of time. In yet still other embodiments, the appliance may monitor one or more conditions of the next hop or an appliance or computing device of each next hop, including CPU usage, memory availability, and response time, and may forward packets to a next hop responsive to which device has the lowest of one or more of these values.","In some embodiments, by monitoring network parameters of a link and\/or a device of the next link, the appliance may perform load balancing and forwarding based on link health. Accordingly, if a link goes down, the appliance may forward traffic to a backup next hop. Unlike traditional link health monitoring, where a link may only be either \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d, in many embodiments, the appliance may monitor a next hop device's health on a per-application basis. For example, the appliance may monitor status including latency and response time, packet loss, memory requirements, CPU utilization, or other characteristics of a next hop device with separate data for TCP, HTTP, SSL, SIP, FTP, RADIUS, DNS, ICMP, POP3, LDAP, MySQL, SNMP, SMTP, RTSP, or any other protocol or application. Thus, for example, a next hop device may be considered \u201cup\u201d for an HTTP communication, while \u201cdown\u201d for an FTP communication. Accordingly, intelligent routing and load balancing decisions may be made on a per-application basis.","In many embodiments, forwarding or routing packets may comprise network address translation. This may be complicated in systems using multiple next hops, where an appliance may forward the packets to a backup next hop when a primary next hop goes down. For example, in a simple destination-based routing system, an appliance may connect to two internet service providers, the first with an address of 203.10.10.0, and the second with an address of 201.1.1.0. Traffic received from a remote address via the first ISP may be translated to 203.10.10.0 and forwarded to clients by the appliance. The clients may correspondingly reply to 203.10.10.0, and the appliance may properly route the traffic to the first ISP via destination-based routing. However, if the first ISP goes down, the appliance may not be able to easily re-route the traffic via the second IP, because the link may not have the appropriate NAT tables. By using the more advanced next hop selection and load balancing algorithms discussed herein for intelligent address translation, the appliance can avoid this problem.","Referring now to , illustrated is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method of intelligent policy-based routing (PBR). In brief overview, packets received by the appliance, may be passed through various packet filters at step . These filters may comprise a set of characteristics, such that matching packets may be processed or forwarded according to the matched set of characteristics. In one embodiment, a policy-based routing action may be marked as ALLOW or DENY. The action may be performed responsive to the packet matching or not matching the specified characteristics. For example, in one such embodiment, if a packet matches all parameters in any of the configured policy-based routing rules that are marked as permit, then the appliance may attempt to route the packet using the next hop configured in the policy at step . Otherwise, the packet is forwarded normally. In another such embodiment, if the packet matches any of the configured policy-based routing rules that are marked as deny at step , then that packet is not subjected to policy-based routing and is forwarded normally. In yet another such embodiment, if the packet doesn't match any of the configured policy-based routing rules at step  or the next hop configured in the policy is down at step , then the packet may be forwarded normally. In a further embodiment, forwarding a packet normally at step  may comprise performing destination-based routing on the packet.","In further details, at step , an incoming or outgoing packet is received by the appliance. The packet may be received from a client intermediary to the appliance and a next hop or ISP. The packet may be received from a server intermediary to the appliance and a next hop or ISP. The packet may be received from a next hop device for transmission to a client or a server. The filter of the appliance may identify or determine one or more packet characteristics. The filter and\/or policy engine may determine if there is any PBR policies or rules that have parameters matching the one or more packet characteristics. In some embodiments, the filter and\/or policy engine determines there is not any PBR policies matching the one or more packet characteristics. In some embodiments, the filter and\/or policy engine determines there is a single PBR policy matching the one or more packet characteristics. In some embodiments, the filter and\/or policy engine determines there are multiple PBR policies matching the one or more packet characteristics.","If there are no PBR policies or rules matching the packet or the packet's characteristics, the appliance may determine not to apply any policy based routing to the packet. The appliance may usr what is referred to as normal routing  for the packet. In some embodiments, via normal routing, PBR is not applied and the packet is forwarded onto a network interface. In some embodiments, via normal routing, PBR is not applied and the packet is forwarded according to any standard or conventional next hop routing or forwarding.","At step , if there are PBR policies or rules matching the packet or the packet's characteristics, the appliance, such as via the policy engine, determines the action for the packet based on the policies(s). In some embodiments of multiple matching PBR policies, the appliance selects one of the PBR policies to apply based on order or prioritization. In some embodiments of multiple matching PBR policies, the appliance applies all of the PBR policies to apply based on order or prioritization. The action may be to ALLOW access, use or forwarding the packet to a next hop. The action may be to ALLOW access, use or forwarding the packet to a next hop based on status of the next hop. The action may be to DENY access, use or forwarding of the packet by policy based routing. The action may be to DENY access, use or forwarding of the packet to a certain next hop. The action may be to DENY access, use or forwarding of the packet to a next hop. The action may be to DENY access, use or forwarding of the packet to a certain next hop. The action may be to use normal routing. If the action is DENY and\/or the next hop is down, the appliance may go to or use normal routing .","At step , the PBR may determine the next hop for the packet. For example, if the action is ALLOW and the next hop is up, at step , the appliance may set the next hop on the packet. The appliance such as via a packet engine or vServer may modify the packet to set a destination or routing IP address to a next hop. The next hop may be specified or determined by the PBR. The next hop may be specified or determined by a load balancer. In some embodiments, the appliance may load balance a plurality of links to the next hop or ISP providing the next hop. In some embodiments, the palace may load balance a plurality of next hops to select one next hop that is UP and for which the packet is ALLOW(ed) to access, user or be forwarded to.","At step , the appliance may perform a type of load balancing based on a type of protocol of the packet. The appliance may perform a request based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. The appliance may perform a connection based load balancing for each new transport layer connection to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. The appliance may perform a time based load balancing to select the next hop from the plurality of next hops. The appliance may select a next hop based on persistence determined by any IP address of the packet, such as destination internet protocol address and\/or source internet protocol address. The appliance may select a next hop based on persistence determined by any tuple of the packet.","At step , the appliance transmits or forwards the packet via a link to an ISP based on the next hop setting of the packet. In some embodiments, the packet is transmitted according to a policy based and\/or load balancing based selection of the next hop. In some embodiments, the packet is transmitted according a normal routing in which the next hop of the packet is not set or changed according to a policy based and\/or load balancing based selection. The appliance may perform network address translation on the source IP address to have the packet routed appropriately via a next hop link or ISP.","Accordingly, the methods and systems described herein provide for intelligent policy-based routing, with support for defining sophisticated policies for making routing decisions and filtering and parsing traffic for redirection according to a configured policy or rule. Furthermore, these methods and systems allow for advanced next hop load balancing, with efficient link load balancing among multiple internet links through intelligent and efficient load balancing algorithms like round-robin, least packets, least bandwidth, hash-based, least response, custom load, or others. Additionally, by monitoring next hop health on a per-application basis, these methods and systems can provide efficient routing responsive to individual network characteristics. The systems and methods can also provide link redundancy and efficiency, by efficiently using backup link bandwidth when the primary link is active, and providing an instant fail over if the primary link fails. Finally, these systems and methods also provide persistency based routing, with source-IP, destination-IP, and combined source\/destination-IP hash based persistency forwarding.","To highlight a few of the benefits of these systems, several examples are provided. These examples are provided for explanation purposes only and are intended to be non-limiting. One of skill in the art may readily appreciate that the following examples may be expanded or applied to similar situations without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Illustrated in  is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system using a port-based routing policy. As shown, a client may connect via an appliance  to a plurality of internet service providers A-B (referred to generally as ISP(s) ). In some embodiments, these may be two connections to a single ISP, such as two cable modems or T1 links; may be two connections of different types, such as a T1 line and an ISDN line; or may be connections to two different service providers. This may be done to ensure reliability if a service provider fails, or to take advantage of different network architectures. For example, as shown in , by using two ISPs , a client via appliance  may have two independent network paths to a server . ISP A A connects via a first network  and a second network \u2033, and ISP B B connects via a third network \u2032 and the second network \u2033. Although referred to as different networks, in many embodiments, these may represent network segments or nodes. Each path to the server may have different network characteristics, depending on length, geographical location, equipment at the ISP or other intermediary nodes, number of hops, etc. While traditional forwarding systems may determine one \u201cbest\u201d path, based on generic qualities, this may not be the best path for different types of traffic. For example, a path may be high latency, but high bandwidth, and may thus be poor for low latency Voice over IP traffic, but excellent for FTP file transfers. By performing the policy based forwarding methods described above, appliance  can take advantage of the best network paths for each type of traffic.","As shown in , a client may transmit two streams of traffic, requests, or packets, the first directed to destination port i (solid line) and the second directed to destination port j (dashed line) at the same destination server . Appliance  may direct these two streams via different next hops, responsive to policies applied to each transmission. This may be done to share the load and also to ensure reliability in case one of the service providers fails.","Referring briefly to , illustrated is a block diagram of the embodiment of the system using a port-based routing policy, during failure of a link. As shown, if an ISP  such as ISP A A fails or goes down, then appliance  can immediately route the traffic directed to this ISP via the second ISP B B. In the policies applied to the traffic, ISP B may be configured as a backup next hop for packets that would be sent to ISP A; and conversely, ISP A may be configured as a backup next hop for packets that would be sent to ISP B.","Referring now to , illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system using an intelligent destination-based routing policy. Similar to the port-based routing discussed above, a client may wish to communicate with two destination servers -at, respectively, destination IP i and destination IP j. By applying polices to the traffic, the appliance  may route different traffic via different ISPs to load balance and efficiently use bandwidth. Unlike traditional destination-based forwarding, the appliance may use the load balancing algorithms and hash-based forwarding discussed above to dynamically select which ISP to use at any time, regardless of the final destination.","Referring briefly to , illustrated is a block diagram of the embodiment of the system using an intelligent destination-based routing policy, during failure of a link. Similar to that shown in , in the policies applied to the traffic, ISP B may be configured as a backup next hop for packets that would be sent to ISP A; and conversely, ISP A may be configured as a backup next hop for packets that would be sent to ISP B. Accordingly, when a service provider link fails or goes down, network traffic may be immediately routed through the other service provider.","Referring now to , illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system with a plurality of paths to a destination with varying network characteristics. As shown, an appliance  may connect to a large number of service providers, which may connect to various network segments. Thus, the appliance may need to provide reverse network address translation for a single client to x out of y links where 1<x<y. For example, a country may have five primary internet service providers available. Three of these service providers may have a direct link to a second country, while two of them may have only indirect links to the second country, via a third or fourth country. Accordingly, the appliance  may determine that, for client to connect to server , three ISPs A-C are fast, low latency links, while ISPs D-are high latency links with several additional hops. The appliance  may use a policy with multiple next hops configured for each packet, with load balanced through the fast links via ISPs A-C. Each fast link may be configured as a backup for the others, and in some embodiments, the slow links D-may be configured as further backups in case each of the fast links goes down simultaneously. In a similar embodiment, a second server (not illustrated) may be located in the third or fourth country and thus, links D-may be faster for this particular server than links A-C. Appliance  may have multiple policies active that route and load balance traffic via the most efficient paths for that particular traffic.","It should be understood that the systems described above may provide multiple ones of any or each of those components and these components may be provided on either a standalone machine or, in some embodiments, on multiple machines in a distributed system.
