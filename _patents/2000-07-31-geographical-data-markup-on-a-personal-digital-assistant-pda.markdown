title: Geographical data markup on a personal digital assistant (PDA)
abstract: A method, system, and article of manufacture provide the ability to redline or mark up geographic information on a personal digital assistant (PDA). An application on the PDA is configured to obtain map data from a server and display the map data on a screen of the PDA. Markup data is obtained from a user through a stylus that is used to markup the map displayed on the PDA. A file comprised of the markup data is created and then uploaded from the PDA to the server. Accordingly, the markup data comprises a markup layer that is stored locally on the PDA and uploaded (synchronized) with the server automatically when a list of a set of maps is updated.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to electronic maps and geographic information, and in particular, to a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for marking up and redlining maps and geographic data on a personal digital assistant (PDA).","2. Description of the Related Art","Computer implemented geographic information systems (GIS) are known in the art. Such GIS provide for the retrieval and display of geographic information (e.g., maps). Additionally, the ability to redline or mark up an architectural drawing is known in the art. Such redlining capabilities allow a user to superimpose or draw a shape, text, or other information on an existing drawing. However, the use of a GIS on a personal digital assistant (PDA) and marking up or redlining a map displayed on a PDA are not known or disclosed in the art.","Field\/utility technicians such as gas company employees, salespersons, plumbers, insurance adjusters, or any type of employment that requires travel to different locations, often utilize or require access to maps and geographic information. Further, such technicians often need to interact with and markup or redline a map to refer to at a later time. For example, a plumber\/contractor may want to determine where the main gas line or water line on a street is located. Additionally, if the main gas line or water line is not in the location specified in the map (or such data is not available), the plumber\/contractor may want to markup the map to indicate where the gas line or water line is located. While out in the field, the technicians often do not have a network connection, and carrying a laptop or desktop computer is cumbersome and impractical. Thus, it is desirable to have a small (handheld) portable computing device with the capabilities to display, interact, and markup geographic information both online and offline.","Prior art handheld computing devices (also referred to as palm PCs or personal digital assistants (PDAs)), are often used to access and utilize personal information. Many handheld computing devices are available in today's marketplace. Typically, handheld computing devices are only slightly larger than the size of one's palm (hence, the name palm PC) and have a small display screen for viewing a plethora of items. Software can be installed on a PDA to provide enhanced functionality. For example, a personal productivity tool may be installed to provide access to a calendar, contacts, email, Internet browsing, audio books, and audio recording capabilities. Card slots may also be available to provide additional memory or other functions (e.g. a modem). Additionally, some PDAs have infrared (IR) ports for communication.","The PDA environment, however, poses several challenges for geographic information systems and markup\/redlining in terms of memory, storage, processor speeds, wireless transmission rates, and display attributes. For example, PDAs commonly only maintain 96K or less of memory, 2 Mb (megabytes) or less storage, a 13 MHz processor speed, and a black and white or gray scale display mechanism. Displaying a map and maintaining the ability to redline or markup a map on a PDA must be within such limitations.","Thus, there is a need for a geographic information system that overcomes the above described deficiencies on a portable handheld electronic device such as a PDA.","One or more embodiments of the invention provide for redlining or marking up geographic information on a personal digital assistant (PDA). Embodiments include the ability to synchronize markup data on a PDA with a server and the graphical user interface for creating markup data. The PDA maintains the functionality commonly available in a standard client comprised of a complete computer system. The PDA provides uploadable, sharable redlining data (created from scribbles on the field).","PDA clients can markup the map data that is downloaded with each mapset. The markup graphics elements include a redline and a text note. The redline is a zero width vector that mimics ink flowing from a stylus, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. The text note provides text blocks, represented on the map as note symbols anchored at a point, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. Any number of these objects can be included in the markup layer of a specific mapset. Each mapset references a single markup layer.","Markup layers are stored locally and uploaded (synchronized) with the server automatically when the mapset list is updated. The markup layer, being a component of the mapset's data cache, either remains on the client or is purged with the mapset. If the mapset and associated markup layer stay on the client, subsequent edits may be made to it. These edits are copied up to the server at the next synchronization. Once a mapset leaves the PDA device, markup objects leave with it. When the map is accessed again, the note or redline object may or may not be with it, depending on how this map is handled on the server.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","One of more embodiments of the invention provide for redlining and markup capabilities on a geographical information system (GIS) implemented on a personal digital assistant (PDA). Software on the PDA is enabled to provide such functionality. PDA users (e.g., technicians) can make scribbles and annotations on a map displayed on a PDA using a paper and pencil metaphor. To accommodate such redlining, embodiments provide a redline object that consists of geometric scribbles (points, lines, polygons, symbols), GPS (global positioning system) input coordinates, annotations (positioned text with font information, etc.), and a georeference system that allows the redline object to be integrated into a spatial database using a server and displayed on other maps. The redlining system captures user input and allows for redline objects to be uploaded to a server. Further, the level of sharing on the server side is configurable (e.g., personal, group, global, etc.).","Accordingly, PDA clients can markup the map data that is downloaded with each mapset. The markup graphics elements include a georeferenced polyline redline and a georeferenced text note. The georeferenced polyline redline is a zero width vector that mimics ink flowing from a stylus, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. The georeferenced text note provides text blocks, represented on the map as note symbols anchored at a point, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. Any number of these objects can be included in the markup layer of a specific mapset. Each mapset references a single markup layer.","Markup layers are stored locally and uploaded (synchronized) with the server automatically when the mapset list is updated. The markup layer, being a component of the mapset's data cache, either remains on the client or is purged with the mapset. If the mapset and associated markup layer stay on the client, subsequent edits may be made to it. These edits are copied up to the server at the next synchronization. Once a mapset leaves the PDA device, markup objects leave with it. When the map is accessed again, the note or redline object may or may not be with it, depending on how this map is handled on the server.","General Architecture","Hardware Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","118","102","104","106"]},"A thick client  as utilized in the existing MAPGUIDE GIS is more fully described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/411,506, entitled \u201cVECTOR-BASED GEOGRAPHIC DATA\u201d, by Gregory A. Roy, et. al., filed on Oct. 4, 1999, which is a continuation patent application of U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,135 issued on Oct. 12, 1999 (application Ser. No. 08\/757,706 filed on Oct. 30, 1996), by Gregory A. Roy et al., entitled \u201cVECTOR-BASED GEOGRAPHIC DATA\u201d which application is fully incorporated by reference herein. Such a thick client  may comprise a computer with a web browser (enhanced with a plugin or viewer) connected to a web server  that communicates with a MapGuide server  to retrieve data (e.g., raster data, standard data format (SDF) data , attribute data , etc.).","A thin client includes three classes of devices: handheld personal computers (HPC), palm-held personal computers (PPC or PDA), and smart phones. Using these devices, a thin client  may not provide the full processing and memory capabilities as a thick client . For example, as described above with respect to PDAs, thin clients  often have memory less than 100K, storage of less than 2\u20134 MB, processor speeds of 13 MHz, and limited display attributes. Consequently, additional server  side support (e.g., more generalized display data, simplified project files, de-cluttering services, and possibly server management of user state) may be utilized. A typical combination of resources may include a network\/Internet  comprising the Internet, LANs, WANs, SNA networks, or the like, clients  and  that are PDAs, personal computers or workstations, and servers  that are personal computers, workstations, minicomputers, or mainframes.","The network\/Internet  connects client computers  and  executing the appropriate software applications to server computers  executing Web servers , MapGuide servers , and servlets . MapGuide servers  and servlets  may be located within or part of Web server . The server  and its components may also be referred to as a back office system. Such a back office system maintains access to corporate databases, synchronization utilities, etc. The Web server  is typically a program such as IBM's HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) Server or Microsoft's Internet Information Server. The servlet  communicates with thin client  through Web server  such that any additional processing required by a thin client  may be performed by the servlet . The servers  also execute a Common Gateway Interface (CGI)  (or Netscape Application Programming Interface (NSAPI), Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), etc.), which interfaces between the Web server  and a database management system (DBMS)  that may be utilized to retrieve relevant geographical data (such as SDF data, raster data, Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) data, etc.) from database .","Generally, components \u2013 and \u2013 all comprise logic and\/or data that is embodied in or retrievable from a device, medium, signal, or carrier, e.g., a data storage device, a data communications device, a remote computer or device coupled to the computer via a network or via another data communications device, etc. Moreover, this logic and\/or data, when read, executed, and\/or interpreted, results in the steps necessary to implement and\/or use the present invention being performed.","Thus, embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and\/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d (or alternately, \u201ccomputer program product\u201d) as used herein is intended to encompass logic and\/or data accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media.","Those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this exemplary environment without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, those skilled in the art will recognize that any combination of the above components, or any number of different components, including different logic, data, different peripherals, and different devices, may be used to implement the present invention, so long as similar functions are performed thereby. Specifically, those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be applied to any database, associated database management system, or peripheral device.","Software Architecture","In accordance with the hardware descriptions, thick clients  are complete computer systems with web browsers and full processing capabilities. However, the hardware limitations of a PDA device necessitate software limitations. Accordingly, to enable a geographic information system and to enable redlining and markup capabilities on a PDA device, a thin client  is provided. To accommodate the thin client, additional support on server  may be utilized. For example, server  may provide for the conversion of data, more generalized display data, simplified project files, de-cluttering services, and possibly server management of the user state.","The architecture of the invention includes a data model that combines static raster layers (static raster data for multiple layers) with live vector objects to deliver good display and download performance, and also provides interactive selectable objects.","Vector based maps (also referred to as \u201cmap layer data\u201d consisting of geographic information\/data for one or more layers) are served by a servlet  and are an encoded and spatially indexed vector representation of the geographic data. Such vector maps provide for a more \u201cinteractive\u201d display with flexible zooming on the client , highlighting, etc. Alternatively, the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) representation as proposed by the WorldWideWeb Consortium (W3C) may be utilized. SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves), images, and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled, transformed, and composited into previously rendered objects.","A display background (that is raster based) for the geographic data and display layers is managed as a multi-level library of raster tiles. The raster layers are composed from multiple vector layers on servlet , resulting in better download and display performance. The raster map on the thin client  allows panning (virtual roaming paradigm), and zooming across multiple levels. A smart-cache on thin client  allows the swapping of compact tiles from the database to memory, in a manner appropriate to the device. A single workspace per map provides the definition of the map and the display attributes for the layers on the thin client .","To view and interact with geographic data on a thin client  (such as a PDA), maps from one or more locations and associated attributes are combined into a mapset. The mapset contains the geographic data in a generalized, differentially encoded, indexed vector data. The mapset is transferred from server  to thin client .","Thin client  users (e.g., technicians) can make scribbles and annotations on a map displayed on a thin client using a paper and pencil metaphor. To accommodate such redlining, embodiments provide a redline object that consists of geometric scribbles (points, lines, polygons, symbols), GPS (global positioning system) input coordinates, annotations (positioned text with font information, etc.), and a geo-reference system that allows the redline object to be integrated into a spatial database  using server  and displayed on other maps. The redlining system captures user input and allows for redline objects to be uploaded to server . Further, the level of sharing on the server  side is configurable (e.g., personal, group, global, etc.).","Markup data is uploaded from thin client  to server  for processing the markup data on the server. The processing includes creating an executable that reads a database file containing the markup data (in the form of pixel coordinates) and converts or transforms the pixel coordinates to Mapping Coordinate System (MCS) and Latitude\/Longitude (Lat\/Lon) coordinates and outputs a standard data format (SDF) file. In the SDF file, point objects represent markup text and polyline objects represent markup redlines. Additionally, the markup data can be geo-referenced on server  in a MWF (Map Window File)  where the original mapset (that the markup is based on) came from.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["102","106","102","204","102","106","206","208","210","212","206","212","110","108","112","114","120","128"]},"To process thin client  markup data, the synchronization application  uploads the markup database PDB file from the thin client  to the server . The file may be uploaded to a \u201cmarkups\u201d subdirectory within the directory on the server  that the mapset was downloaded from. A \u201cmarkups\u201d subdirectory exists for each user of the system (e.g., within each user id). To upload the PDB file, an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) \u201cPUT\u201d command may be utilized. A \u201cPUT\u201d command provides for storing an enclosed entity under a specified URI (Uniform Resource Identifier that identifies the resource upon which to apply a request).","Markup Publisher  is started on the server  and the server  administrator loads the markup database PDB file that was just uploaded. From the markup publisher , the server  administrator runs the markup publisher executable  to begin processing the data. The executable  makes a call into Java classes with ActiveX Wrapper  to convert the pixel data to MCS coordinates. Markup publisher  then launches an instance of a MapGuide application (e.g., using MapGuide server ) with the same map URL (Uniform Resource Locator) where the original mapset data came from. Markup publisher  utilizes the instance of the MapGuide application to convert the MCS coordinates to Lat\/Lon coordinates. Once the data has been converted to Lat\/Lon coordinates, markup publisher  uses the SDF COM Toolkit  to create an SDF file. The SDF file can be used to superimpose the geo-referenced markup entities on the original MWF  map. Appropriate administrator personnel on a thick client  or another thin client  can then review the markup changes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["102","300","102","106","204","302","206","106","304","106","102"]},"A user (or the markup publisher ) then initiates a command (by running an executable) to begin processing the data. The command loads the Java classes with ActiveX wrapper . At step , a call is made from markup publisher  to a Java class to read the header and markup data from the PDB file and convert the pixel data to MCS coordinates.","Markup publisher  then launches an instance of a MapGuide application (with the same map URL where the original mapset data came from) at step . Subsequently, markup publisher  may wait for an \u201conMapLoaded\u201d message to be sent from the MapGuide application. The \u201conMapLoaded\u201d message indicates when the MCS coordinates have been converted and completed loading. In response to the \u201conMapLoaded\u201d message, markup publisher  reads the MCS coordinates from the Java classes and makes a call to the MapGuide application to convert the MCS coordinates to Lat\/Lon coordinates at step . The toolkit  is then utilized to create and write out the Lat\/Lon coordinates to an SDF file at step . The SDF file can then be used to superimpose the geo-referenced markup entities on the original MWF map.","As described above, the synchronization application  is responsible for uploading markup data from the thin client  to server . Synchronization application  is also responsible for deleting the markup data associated with mapsets that are no longer available on the thin client . The markup upload process is intertwined with the mapset download process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["204","400","102","204","402","204","204","102","404","204","406"]},"At step , synchronization application  sends all resident markup data to a specified server  directory (e.g., \u201c<server-path>\/<username>\/markups\u201d) using HTTP \u201cPUT\u201d requests. If any of the PUT requests fail, the synchronization operation is terminated and an error message is displayed on the PDA . Synchronization application  downloads new mapsets at step  and deletes unreferenced mapsets at step . At step , synchronization application  deletes any markup data associated with deleted mapsets. Thereafter, synchronization application  returns to the calling application or terminates.","Java classes with ActiveX wrapper  provide the ability to read header and markup data from the PDB file and the actual markup entities and converting them to MCS coordinates. Additionally, the classes may provide public methods for accessing the data maintained within the classes through a Windows executable via the ActiveX wrapper.","Redline\/Markup Features","As described above, thin clients  may markup the map data that is downloaded with each mapset. The markup graphics elements include a georeferenced polyline redline and georeferenced text note. The georeferenced polyline redline is a zero width vector that mimics ink flowing from a stylus, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. A tool tip is a small popup window that presents a short description of a toolbar button's purpose when the mouse is positioned over a button for a period of time. The georeferenced text note provides text blocks, represented on the map as note symbols anchored at a point, and an associated text note that pops up as a tooltip when the object is selected. Any number of these objects can be included in the markup layer of a specific mapset. Each mapset references a single markup layer.","Markup layers may be provided in two forms: \u201ccorrection\u201d and \u201cannotation\u201d. The \u201ccorrection\u201d form shows errors in the underlying map data that require action by the map authors (e.g., if a water main or other device is not located where provided in the map). The \u201cannotation\u201d form is used to record information that augments the map data (e.g., to indicate that a leak or power failure at a specific map location has been fixed). Both forms are stored on the server  and are accessible by other map users, but only the \u201ccorrection\u201d markups are of interest to the map maintainers.","Normally, a user is redlining in \u201cannotation\u201d mode. When a map error is discovered, the user begins a \u201creport map error\u201d process\/function. Thereafter, the markup screen is cleared, leaving only the base map. The user then draws markup entities to describe the problem. When finished, the user ends the \u201creport map error\u201d operation, possibly filling out a note\/form on the overall map error. The system then returns to the \u201cannotation\u201d mode with all of the previous annotation entries visible.","Redline Object",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 5"],"b":["102","602","602","600","102","500","102","502","504","600","102","600"]},"At step , the user chooses \u201cfinish\u201d from the redline menu to end the redline. Upon selecting \u201cfinish\u201d, a redline text edit box  is displayed at step . At the bottom of the redline text edit box are two buttons: \u201cDone\u201d  and \u201cDelete\u201d . The user enters any desired text at step . Once the user has finished entering text, the \u201cDone\u201d button  may be selected to complete the creation operation or the \u201cDelete\u201d button  can be selected to delete the redline entry at step . If the user presses the \u201cDelete\u201d button , a confirmation dialog box obtains confirmation\/rejection regarding whether the user wants to delete the redline entry. If no text is entered, the default text entry may comprise the text \u201cNote\u201d or the user's name and the date of the entry.","In the creation process, a single \u201cUndo\u201d action may be supported. However, a \u201credo\u201d command may not be supported. Further, the user may not have the ability to pan or zoom while drawing a redline entry and clipboard text cut\/copy\/paste functions may not be supported.","To modify an existing redline, the user selects the redline object . Thereafter, a tooltip appears with as much of the text as can be shown. If underlined, the text is editable. To access and edit the text, the tooltip is touched again to access text entry screen . The user can then edit the text and select \u201cDone\u201d  upon completion.","To delete a redline, the user selects the desired redline object  on a displayed map . The tooltip associated with the selected redline appears underlined, indicating that the tooltip is linked to something. Tapping on the tooltip text displays the redline text edit dialog box . The user can tap the delete button  in the text entry box  to delete the redline.","Markup Note Object","In addition to the redline line as described above, a markup note object may be placed on a map. A markup note object is a symbol that is drawn at the point where the note object is inserted.
