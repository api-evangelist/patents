title: Vehicle airbag arrestor
abstract: An airbag arrestor mountable about a vehicle steering column carrying a steering wheel and a airbag module is non-axially movable with respect to the vehicle steering wheel and steering column during airbag inflation by containing and redirecting airbag inflation gasses oppositely from the steering wheel through an open end of the airbag arrestor enclosure secured about the steering column. The airbag arrestor includes a flexible, ballistic grade material enclosure having a sidewall extending between an open end and an opposed closed end. An attachment in the form of a strap constructed of a ballistic grade material is tightenable about the sidewall of the enclosure adjacent the open end to non-axially movably secure the enclosure about the vehicle steering column.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the priority date of the co-pending provisional U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/241,313, filed Oct. 18, 2000 in the name of Robert D. Burgess and entitled \u201cVEHICLE AIRBAG ARRESTOR\u201d, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.","Today's vehicles are provided with passenger restraint devices, such as inflatable airbags, which are mounted in various locations within the vehicle, including within the steering wheel.","Sensors mounted at appropriate locations within the vehicle provide a signal to an inflation device when a predetermined amount of force contact is made with another object. The inflation device generates or supplies a quantity of gas to inflate the airbag and thereby cushion the forward movement of the driver of the vehicle and resulting from a front collision.","While airbags have proven to be effective in saving people's lives by minimizing injuries during a front vehicle collision, it has been found that in certain circumstances the airbag inflation device may be armed, but may not have gone off. This armed stated lasts for a predetermined period of time, such as two minutes, before the inflation device resets itself to an inactive state.","Frequently, in serious collisions, the driver is trapped within the surrounding vehicle body and literally, the vehicle body must be cut away from the driver in order to remove the driver from the vehicle. The so-called \u201cjaws of life\u201d are used in such a situation. A further complication in vehicle collisions is that an emergency person, such as a fireman, E.M.S., etc., may be required to attend to a driver trapped within a vehicle until the vehicle sheet metal is cut away or removed to enable the driver to be removed from the vehicle. Such emergency persons may be required to give resuscitation, C.P.R., or other medical assistance until the driver can be removed from the vehicle and attended to in a more adequate facility, such as a hospital, E.M.S. vehicle, etc.","In such a circumstance, the emergency person's head can be situated between the airbag in the vehicle steering wheel and the driver's head. This places the emergency persons head in a precarious position, particularly where the airbag inflation sensor may have been activated, but, for some reason, the inflation device has not yet activated to inflate the airbag.","In the event that the airbag inflates under its considerable force and speed when the emergency person's head is between the airbag and the driver's head, the emergency person's head will be forced into the driver's head, thereby creating the potential for serious injury to the emergency person as well as to the driver.","One attempt to address this problem is an emergency service device in the form of a circular steel plate with two large hooks protruding from an upper portion. The rear side of the steel plate is fitted with a series of triangle deflators which engage and rip open the airbag. The main body of the steel plate is slotted to accommodate the adjustable placement of a secondary inner body in the form of a rectangular steel plate with two hooks protruding from a lower portion. When assembled together, the upper and lower portions of the two steel plates can be adjusted to accommodate different steering wheel dimensions. A tensioning knob extends through the circular plate and allows adjustment of the lower hooks on the inner plate. Once the hooks are securely in place, the tensioning knob is tightened. A dust cover is fastened around the steering wheel and the plate\/hook assembly and tightened in place about the steering column by a strapping band. Ventilation openings are provided between the inner surface of the dust cover and the steering column when the dust cover strap is tightened.","However, this prior attempt at an airbag arrestor addresses the aforementioned problems with a complicated, multi-part device which requires several attachment steps and a tightening operation to secure the main device in place, and an additional installation step to add the dust cover. This takes time and can be a cumbersome task in the typically confined space existing in a crushed vehicle after a collision. At the same time, the dust cover in this device provides only a dust containment enclosure for the smoke and debris emitted by the airbag module during airbag inflation. The dust cover is not intended to suppress the entire airbag inflation as it is only provided as a dust and debris control enclosure.","Thus, it would be desirable to alleviate these potential problems. It would also be desirable to provide a device which contains the inflation of a vehicle airbag without significant expansion of the airbag. It would also be desirable to provide an airbag containment device which can be easily employed by an emergency person, preferably by one hand. It would also be desirable to provide an airbag containment device which can be repeatedly used in many emergency situations.","The present invention is an vehicle airbag arrestor which uniquely arrests and contains the inflation pressures in the vehicle airbag when the airbag arrestor is mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and steering column.","In one aspect, the airbag arrestor of the present invention includes a flexible, high strength enclosure having an open end. An attachment means is mountable about the enclosure to non-axially movably mount the enclosure about a vehicle steering column and a vehicle steering wheel containing an airbag module. The high strength, yet flexible nature of the material employed to form the airbag arrestor enclosure enables the enclosure to be easily mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and airbag module and a portion of the vehicle steering column and be securely fixed in place by the attachment means; while at the same time having sufficient strength to resist any substantial axial movement of the end of the enclosure with respect to the vehicle steering column and steering wheel so as to contain and redirect the explosive forces generated during airbag inflation.","The attachment means is, in one aspect, in the form of a strap or cord which is carried on the enclosure or is attachable to the enclosure. A connector can be mounted on the strap to enable a free end of the strap to be tightened about the enclosure to conform a sidewall of the enclosure adjacent to the open end tightly about the vehicle steering column while still allowing ventilation through the open end of the enclosure.","In another aspect, the connector includes at least one and possibly two biased latched members mounted in a body through which both ends of the strap or cord extend. Either free end of the cord can be drawn in one direction away from the body to tighten the cord about the enclosure. However, the latch members prevent reverse loosening movement of the strap thereby maintaining the strap in the tightened position until the associated latch member is moved to an unlatched position. In this position, one end of the strap or cord can be pulled through the latch thereby loosening the strap for removal of the enclosure from the steering column.","The airbag arrestor of the present invention overcomes certain deficiencies found in prior art airbag arrestors in that the present airbag arrestor may be easily and quickly installed and secured in a fixed, substantially non-axially movable position about a vehicle steering column and steering wheel without requiring an excessive number of mounting steps. The present airbag arrestor may be secured in place about the vehicle steering column by an essentially one hand operation which can be crucial in emergency conditions.","The present airbag arrestor uniquely confines and redirects the explosive gasses generated during airbag inflation away from the outer end of the airbag arrestor enclosure. This provides increased safety to emergency personnel which may have his or her head positioned between the airbag in the vehicle steering wheel and the driver while giving emergency care or attempting to remove the driver from the vehicle.","Referring now to the drawings, and to  in particular, there is depicted a first aspect of an airbag arrestor  according to the present invention. The airbag arrestor  is in the form of an enclosure  formed of a strong, but flexible material. The enclosure  has a generally cylindrical portion  extending from a first end  to an opposed second end . A generally flat end wall  is formed at the second end  of the sidewall . The enclosure  is preferably formed of a one-piece construction, although the sidewall  and the end wall  may be formed as separate panels or members which are securely joined together, such as by stitching, etc.","The first end  defines an interior opening end having a diameter sufficient to enable the first end  to be slid over a vehicle steering wheel  shown in phantom in FIG. .","Although the enclosure  preferably has the shape shown in , it will be understood that the enclosure  may take other shapes, such as a generally spherical shape extending from the first end .","In general, the enclosure  is formed with a steering wheel encompassing portion formed adjacent to the end wall  and a steering column attachment portion adjacent to the first end .","The enclosure  has a suitable length to facilitate easy mounting over a vehicle steering wheel  while enabling the first end  to be cinched down or tightened to a small diameter to hold the enclosure  securely and substantially non-movably on a vehicle steering column  to which the steering wheel  is mounted. The sidewall  may have a length sufficient to dispose the first end  over the steering column  axially over any elongated levers, such as a transmission shift lever, windshield wiper control lever, etc., which are typically mounted on vehicle steering columns to control various vehicle operating circuits and devices. Alternately, the sidewall  may have an elongated length sufficient to enable the first end  to be disposed entirely over all such levers and further along the length of the steering column  while enabling the first end  to be cinched down to a small diameter substantially in tight engagement with the outer diameter of the steering column .","The enclosure  is preferably formed of a lightweight, flexible, yet strong material. One preferred material is ballistic material used in soft body armor. KEVLAR is a typical fiber employed in such soft body armor. While the use of ballistic material is preferred, it will be understood that the enclosure  may be formed of other strong, but flexible materials having sufficient strength to not expand to any significant degree despite the full force inflation of an airbag within the interior of the enclosure  as described hereafter.","Attachment means  are mounted on the enclosure , generally adjacent the first end  as shown in FIG.  and in greater detail in FIG. . The attachment means  functions to enable the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded to its full open diameter; yet to be able to be cinched or tightly secured in a significantly smaller diameter in secure, substantially non-movable engagement about the vehicle steering column . Ideally, the attachment means  provide such tightening engagement of the first end  of the enclosure  about a vehicle steering column  through a one-handed operation as described hereafter.","One aspect of the attachment means  is shown in . The attachment means  include an elongated strap  preferably formed of a strong, lightweight, flexible material, such as ballistic material, i.e., ballistic grade NYLON, etc. The strap  has a first end  and an opposed second end . Portions of the strap  are wound about shafts or legs  and , respectively, mounted in a connector .","As shown in , the second end  of the strap  is wound about the shaft  at one end of the connector  after the portion of the strap  adjacent to the second end  is passed underneath one end leg  of the connector , around the shaft  and then into engagement with an adjoining portion of the strap . Securement means, such as stitching , are employed to join the second end  of the strap  to an adjoining portion of the strap .","The upper portion  of the strap  extends from the point of attachment to the second and is slidably mounted about the first end  of the enclosure , such as by passing the strap  through loops or other securement means  formed on the enclosure . Thus, the portion  of the strap  extends completely around the periphery of the first end  of the enclosure  to a portion  shown in  which loops around the first shaft  in the connector , passes under an opposite end leg , and terminates in the first end .","In this arrangement, the first end  of the strap  is movable away from the connector  to tighten the strap  and the first end  of the enclosure  in a smaller diameter in tight engagement with the exterior of the vehicle steering column  as shown in FIG. . The end portion of the strap  extending from the first end  is held underneath the end leg  of the connector  to tightly retain the strap  in any tightened diameter. Upward movement on the leg  of the connector  will release the cinching force thereby enabling the strap  to be re-expanded to its normal, enlarged diameter.","Use of the airbag arrestor  will now be described in conjunction with FIG. . As shown in , an airbag  is mounted within the vehicle steering wheel  rotatably affixed to the vehicle steering column . Although not shown in , a conventional transmission shift lever, windshield wiper control lever, headlight control lever, etc., are normally mounted on the vehicle steering columns. However, an ignition key switch  is depicted by way of example only.","First, the first end  of the enclosure  will be expanded to its fullest diameter and the open first end  will be slid over the steering wheel . The enclosure  will be pulled over the steering wheel  until the end wall  is disposed in contact with or in close proximity to the steering wheel . The attachment means or strap  will then be grasped at one end, such as the free first end , and pulled to tightly compress the first end  of the enclosure  into secure engagement with the exterior surface of the vehicle steering column .","In this position, the airbag arrestor  of the present invention is securely mounted on the steering column  so as not to exhibit any substantial axial movement away from the steering wheel  in a direction toward the vehicle driver. However, due to the flexible nature of the side wall  and end wall  of the enclosure , some expansion in overall size may occur; but not to any significant amount. The enclosure  will contain any inflation of the airbag . The gases used to inflate the airbag  will escape through the first end  of the enclosure .","After the airbag arrestor  is no longer needed, the connector  is released and the strap  expanded to its full diameter enabling the enclosure  to be removed from the vehicle steering wheel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["70","10","70","72","74","32","48","76","77","72","76","78","80","78","76"]},"The first end  of the latch member  is provided with a secure gripping surface , such as knurling, serrated teeth, etc., which dig into and engage the strap  looped around one end of the body .","A hand release surface  is provided at the opposite end of the latch member  for pivoting the latch member  in the direction to disengage the gripping surface  from the strap  thereby enabling the strap  to be retracted with respect to the body  so as to enable the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded to its fullest diameter.","At the same time, the first end  and the strap  may be pulled under force through the latch member . The gripping surface  prevents reverse movement of the strap  unless the hand release surface  is engaged to pivot the gripping surface  away from the strap .","Another aspect of the latch or connector member according to the present invention is shown in FIG. . In this aspect, a strap  is in the form of a cord, formed of ballistic grade NYLON, for example, having first and second free ends  and , respectively. Both ends of the strap  extend through bores in a latch body . From the latch body , the two ends of the cord  extend through a folded-over portion on the first end  of the enclosure .","The latch body  carries two identical latch members  and , each of which is provided with a gripping surface  at one end. The gripping surfaces  are disposed in the bores in the latch body . Biasing springs  carried on the latch body  bias the latch members  and  into a position in which the gripping surfaces  fixedly engage the two portions of the cords  to prevent reverse movement of the two portions of the cords through the body . However, downward pivotal movement of one end of either latch member  and  will disengage the gripping surface  from the respective portion of the cord  thereby enabling the respective portion of the cord  to be pulled through the latch body  to enable the diameter of the first end  of the enclosure  to be expanded.","Reverse directional pulling of either end ,  of the cord  away from the latch body  reduces the length of the cord  within the first end  of the enclosure  thereby reducing the diameter of the first end  to enable the first end  to conform in snug engagement with the vehicle steering column.","Thus, there has been disclosed an airbag arrestor which uniquely arrests and contains the inflation pressures in a vehicle airbag when the airbag arrestor is mounted about a vehicle steering wheel and steering column. The airbag arrestor includes a flexible enclosure which can be easily mounted in a substantially non-expandable manner about a vehicle steering wheel. Attachment means in the form of a strap or cord is carried at an open end of the enclosure and extends through a connector to enable the first end of the enclosure to be cinched into a tightened, small diameter shape in secure engagement about a vehicle steering column, typically by a one-handed operation, to prevent substantial axial movement of the airbag arrestor enclosure along the vehicle steering column under airbag inflation forces."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The various features, advantages and other uses of the present invention will become more apparent by referring to the following detailed description and drawing in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
