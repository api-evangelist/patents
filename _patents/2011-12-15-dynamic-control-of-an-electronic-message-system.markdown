title: Dynamic control of an electronic message system
abstract: Methods of dynamic control of an electronic message system are described. In an embodiment, a system which is separate from a messaging service within the electronic message system generates an event signal which relates to an event external to the messaging service. The event signal is received by the messaging service and this triggers a dynamic update in one or more electronic messages which are identified based on the event signal received. For example, the dynamic update may result in the message content being displayed in a different manner or the message being delivered or deleted. Examples of external events include a community response to a particular message, based on a subset of information about the message which has been shared, the location of one or more users and a change in membership of a group.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["There are now many different email systems in use. Many of these systems allow a user to specify rules about how incoming messages are handled or displayed. For example, emails received from a particular sender may be color-coded or directed to a particular folder. Many email systems also include junk mail filtering mechanisms such that emails received from particular senders do not appear in a user's inbox but are directed to a specific junk email folder on receipt and the messages may be automatically deleted after a defined amount of time.","The embodiments described below are not limited to implementations which solve any or all of the disadvantages of known electronic message systems.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key\/critical elements or delineate the scope of the specification. Its sole purpose is to present a selection of concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Methods of dynamic control of an electronic message system are described. In an embodiment, a system which is separate from a messaging service within the message system generates an event signal which relates to an event external to the messaging service. The event signal is received by the messaging service and this triggers a dynamic update in one or more electronic messages which are identified based on the event signal received. For example, the dynamic update may result in the message content being displayed in a different manner or the message being delivered or deleted. Examples of external events include a community response to a particular message based on a subset of information about the message which has been shared, the location of one or more users and a change in membership of a group.","Many of the attendant features will be more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Like reference numerals are used to designate like parts in the accompanying drawings.","The detailed description provided below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of the present examples and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present example may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth the functions of the example and the sequence of steps for constructing and operating the example. However, the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different examples.","As described above, existing email systems include mechanisms which evaluate emails on receipt and based on this evaluation change the way in which they are displayed (e.g. by displaying them in a particular color) or move them into a particular folder (e.g. by putting them in a junk email folder). These actions are often based on user-specified rules and although an email may be examined more than once, each email is only evaluated once at any place in the system, e.g. when the email is received by the email system (for junk email filtering) and when it reaches the recipients inbox (for application of any user-specified rules).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","102","103","102","103","104","106","104","106","104","106","104","108","104","104","108"]},"The external system  comprises any system or service which is not an integral part of the messaging service  (i.e. it is outside the scope of the messaging function and message exchange procedure within the system , ). The external system  is therefore clearly distinguishable and separate from the messaging service . The external system  and the messaging service  communicate via a programmatic interface (e.g. an API). As shown in the two schematic diagrams in , the external system  may be external to the electronic message system  or within the electronic message system . Where the external system  is within the electronic message system  but external to the messaging service  (i.e. separate from the message exchange process), the external service  may use aspects of the messaging service  (e.g. user lists within the messaging service ). For example, if the sender decides to change the color of the font during the authoring process, that is not an external event since it is part of the message authoring and sending. However, if the electronic message system has a mood detector that continuously monitors the sender's mood and based on the mood, interfaces with the message exchange process (i.e. the messaging service  or parts of that service) to forward all the user's sent messages to the monitoring physician, or displays the messages that the physician already received at the top of the physician's inbox, the mood detector is an external system within the meaning described herein and the message that interfaces to the messaging service comprises an external event signal.","The electronic message systems ,  shown in  may be based on a client-server architecture, a peer to peer architecture, a hybrid approach or any other architecture.","According to the method, a subpart of the electronic message system ,  (e.g. the messaging service  or a user account  via the messaging service ) receives an event signal  from the external system  (block ). This event signal  relates to an event external to the messaging service  (and which may, in some examples, also be external to the electronic message system) and the event may have occurred within the external system  or may have occurred externally to the external system  but been detected or recorded by the external system . In response to receipt of the event signal (in block ), the electronic message system ,  (e.g. the subpart receiving the event signal or the messaging service ), identifies one or more electronic messages, based on the event signal received, and then triggers a dynamic update to the identified electronic messages within the system (block ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","210","210","212","218","212","214"]},"The message store management function  (or message management function) manages the storing of received, sent and drafted messages. The message access management function  (or message account management function) maintains a list of user accounts handled by the messaging service  (i.e. those accounts within the electronic message system in which the messaging service  is located). The message viewing function  (or message display function) sends instructions to client applications or whatever application renders the messages on a display in order that the recipient can consume the message. These instructions detail what information to display and how it should be displayed on the screen to the user and in some instances, this viewing function  may take into account the properties of the client display. The message editing (or authoring) function  enables the sender to create a message.","It will be appreciated that a messaging service  need not comprise all the functions shown in  and in some examples, additional functions may be provided. Where messages are not displayed graphically, the message viewer function  may be replaced (or supplemented) with an alternative function which provides the message to the viewer in a non-graphical form, e.g. by providing the message in audible format.","The external event signal  which is received (in block ) may connect with a different part of the messaging service  depending upon the type of dynamic update which is to be triggered (in block ). For example, if the messaging system receiving the event signal needs to resend or forward a message, the event signal may connect with the message exchange function  within the messaging service . In other examples, the event signal may connect with the message viewer function , e.g. to change the way that messages are displayed.","The electronic message system ,  may, for example, be an email system (such as Microsoft\u00ae Exchange) and the electronic message may be an email message, calendar appointment, meeting request, task notification etc. In other examples, the electronic message system may be a text messaging system (e.g. an SMS or pager system), instant messaging system (e.g. where IM messages are stored) or other system for transmitting electronic messages.","In an example, the external system  may be a social networking system\/application (e.g. which may be external to or within the electronic message system , ). In other examples, the external system  may be another type of networking tool (e.g. business networking tools or other specialist networking tools), a business management system\/application (e.g. for tracking human resources information, organization charts etc) or a user location system\/application (e.g. which tracks and stores the positions of users, for example, using users' cell phones, where a user gives permission for this data to be collected and used in this way). Further examples include a system or application which monitors and tracks external variables such as weather (e.g. temperature), stock prices, currency exchange rates, etc. As described above, the external system  is separate from the messaging service  and in particular from the message exchange function  within the messaging service . In many examples, the external system  is not an electronic message system, although in other examples, it may comprise an electronic message system which serves a different population of users (or account holders).","The event signal  which is sent by the external system  comprises any input to the electronic message system ,  that is not generated through the internal operations of the messaging service . In various examples, the event signal  may comprise an electronic message (e.g. email, IM message, calendar event, posting, text message, signaling packet, etc) which is triggered by an external event, such as actions within a social networking system, a change in organization structure made within a business management system, an update to a distribution list, an external variable meeting predefined criteria (e.g. a stock price reaching a target value, a temperature exceeding a particular value), a particular user (or group of users) being in a predefined location or a group of users being in the same place (i.e. co-located). In some examples, the event signal electronic message may contain information relating to the external event (e.g. a value of an external variable or data describing the change in organization structure); however in other examples, the event signal may be triggered by an external event but the resulting electronic message sent from the external system  to the electronic message system ,  may be generic (i.e. such that it does not contain information relating to the external event).","In some examples, the event signal  may relate to a particular electronic message (or messages) within the electronic message system ,  and this message (or messages) to which it relates may be identified in the event signal. In such an example the event signal  itself defines which electronic message(s) within the electronic message system ,  is dynamically updated in response to receipt of the event signal  (in block ). In other examples, however, the event signal may not identify a specific electronic message (and in many examples the external system  may not be aware of what messages are within the electronic message system , ) and instead the electronic message system ,  (e.g. the messaging service ) may determine which electronic message(s) within the electronic message system should be dynamically updated (in block ) as a result of receipt of the event signal (e.g. based on pre-defined propagation triggers).","Where the event signal does identify a specific message (as described above), the electronic messages within the electronic message system ,  may each have a unique identifier (e.g. a message ID) which may be in the form of a number (e.g. a sequential number, a value which is a hash of the message details\/contents etc), string, globally unique identifier (GUID), or any other format. Alternatively, the message may be identified based on characteristics of the message where a combination of characteristics is likely to uniquely identify a message (e.g. a combination of any of sender, recipients, title and number of characters in the message, whether a message has an attachment, a message type etc). There may be time-restrictions within the system such that only messages sent within a defined period of time (e.g. the last month) may be able to be dynamically updated using the methods described herein.","In other examples, the event signal may not identify a specific message, but may identify message characteristics such that the signal relates to any message with those characteristics, e.g. all messages sent to a particular combination of recipients (who may be defined in terms of a distribution list) or all messages of a particular type (e.g. email, calendar entry, etc). Again, as described above, there may be time-restrictions associated with this, such that the event signal only relates to messages with particular characteristics which were generated in the preceding 24 hours, week, or other specified time period. The message which is updated in block  may, therefore, be identified based on the event signal and in some examples based also on other parameters.","There may be multiple parties (e.g. a sender and one or more recipients) associated with an electronic message which was identified as a result of the event signal  (e.g. identified within the signal itself or determined by the electronic message system based on the event signal) and the dynamic update which is triggered as a result of receiving the event signal may affect all parties referenced in the electronic message (e.g. sender and recipients of an email message irrespective of whether a recipient was in the \u2018to\u2019 field or the \u2018cc\u2019 field, the organizer of an electronic appointment and all those invited, etc) or the update may affect only the sender (or originator) of the electronic message or any other subset of parties (e.g. only the recipients or only those on the \u2018cc\u2019 list).","The event signal  may be received by the messaging service  for action at the messaging service itself or the event signal  may be delivered to a particular account  through the messaging service . The subpart of the electronic message system ,  (e.g. the messaging service  or a user account ) which receives the event signal  may then trigger the dynamic update (in block ); however the dynamic update may be implemented at that subpart or at another subpart within the electronic message system. For example, an event signal may be received at user account  (via the messaging service ) which triggers a dynamic update that is implemented by that user account  and in some examples at multiple other user accounts  (e.g. at the user account of each recipient of the message being updated). In such an example, the subpart which receives the event signal may send a trigger message to the other subparts which will actually implement the dynamic update. In other examples, the event signal may be propagated within the electronic message system until it reaches a particular subpart (which may be defined within the event signal), i.e. there may be subparts that receive the event signal but do not trigger the dynamic update and instead forward the event signal onto another subpart (e.g. via the messaging service ). For example, where an update affects only the sender\/originator (which may be collectively referred to as the \u2018owner\u2019 of the electronic message), the event signal  may be propagated within the electronic message system ,  towards the owner's user account  and the dynamic update may be processed by the owner's user account  or by the messaging service.","The term \u2018dynamic update\u2019 is used herein to refer to an update which is performed whenever it is triggered and so electronic messages are not simply updated a fixed number of times as they progress towards the recipient (i.e. once at each of a number of defined stages), and then not re-evaluated subsequently. The same electronic message may be updated many times (e.g. as a result of multiple event signals) and in some examples, the message may be updated every time the message is viewed by a user (e.g. where this update comprises checking for update triggers and implementing any triggers identified).","The dynamic update which is performed may result in the electronic message(s) content being displayed in a different manner, the message(s) being forwarded to another user or deleted from a user's account (e.g. deleted from their inbox or calendar with or without approval or confirmation from the user) or the message(s) being resent to one or more of the original recipients. In other examples, the dynamic update may result in other changes to the electronic message(s), such as a change in the content of the message itself, and further examples are described below. As described above, dependent upon the update which is performed, different functions within the messaging service  may be involved.","Although  shows only one external system , there may be multiple external systems which send event signals to the electronic message system ,  and any external system  may send messages to one or more electronic message systems , . The sending of event signals  to the electronic message system ,  may use a pull or push model. Where a pull model is used, the external system  may set state which is then read by the electronic message system , .","The schematic diagrams in  show a single electronic message system , ; however in many examples, the sender of an email message may belong to a different electronic message system to one or more of the recipients (i.e. the sender and the recipient may have user accounts  in different systems). In such an example, as shown in , an electronic message environment  may comprise more than one electronic message system ,  with the sender's user account  in a different system to a recipient's user account . As described above with reference to , the external system  may be within the electronic message environment  (and in some examples within an electronic message system) or the external system  may be external to the electronic message environment .","In examples where the sender and at least one recipient are in different electronic message systems, the message exchange function  within the sender's messaging service  may receive the event signal and send instructions to the recipient's electronic message system (or to the messaging service within that system) to perform the required dynamic update. Alternatively, as all the message systems involved (e.g. all those within the message environment) are treated equally, an event signal may instead trigger an update starting from a recipient's account (rather than the sender's) and as a result instructions may be sent to the sender's electronic message system (or to the messaging service within that system) to performed the required dynamic update.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["402","402","404"]},"As described previously, the event signal is received by the electronic message system (or messaging service) from the external system (block ) and as a result of receiving this message, the electronic message system triggers a dynamic update to one or more electronic messages associated with the group\/community that has been updated (block ). Where the change in the group includes addition of new members, the dynamic update may comprise forwarding one or more electronic messages to the new members (e.g. forwarding all meeting requests for the group to the new members or forwarding emails sent between members of the group to the new members) and in such an example, the event signal may connect with the message exchange function  within the messaging service . In some examples, there may be a time-restriction on which electronic messages are forwarded, e.g. so that only recent messages (such as those sent within the last week\/month) are forwarded to the member joining the group. Where the change in the group includes the removal of members from the group, the dynamic update may comprise removing future calendar appointments relating to the group from the removed members' calendars, removing access to previously sent email messages within the group and\/or changing the permissions for the removed members in relation to previously sent email messages, calendar appointments etc (e.g. such that they can no longer forward these messages onto anyone else) and in such an example, the event signal may connect with the message access manager  within the messaging service . In some examples, where a distribution list is stored within the electronic message system (in addition to, or instead of, being stored in the external system), the receipt of the event signal may also trigger an update to the stored distribution list and again in this example, the event signal may connect with the message access manager  within the messaging service .","Such a method can ensure that meeting requests (which may also be referred to as calendar appointments) reflect the current membership of the group. With existing email systems, it is necessary to manually update meeting requests to include\/exclude users and this is a particular problem with calendar appointments which include recurrence (e.g. a regular group meeting every month) where the initial meeting request may have been sent out many months previously and in the intervening period there may have been many changes to the group membership. Where emails sent between members of the group (which may comprise project related email discussions) are forwarded to the new members, the new members are brought automatically up to date with the current group discussions. Should a member of a group lose all their email (e.g. as a result of equipment loss or failure), by removing the member from all the groups they belong to and then adding them back in, emails for each group will be resent to the member who had lost their email and so potentially enable them to recover some or all of their lost messages.","In an example system which implements the method of , the electronic message system may comprise an email system. In other examples, the system may comprise any kind of electronic message system which enables collaborative working (e.g. Microsoft\u00ae Lync or Microsoft\u00ae Live Meeting), such that, for example, if a person joins a team or a meeting late, they can automatically be provided with the information that was shared prior to their joining.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 1 and 4"],"b":["502","504","502","504"]},"The subset of information relating to the message which is shared does not comprise all the information about the message (e.g. recipients, title, content, etc) but may, for example, comprise details of the message title and message recipients but not the message content, alternatively the subset of information may comprise the content but not the recipients (e.g. for reviews, collaborative decision making or voting). In some examples, a user may specify the particular subset of information which is shared and in other examples this may be predefined or determined by the messaging service  or external system  (e.g. which specifies the information it should receive).","In this example the external system comprises a social networking system or application (or other networking tool) and the group of users may be defined by the electronic message system or the external system. Where the group of users is defined by the electronic message system, the messaging service within the electronic message system or characteristics of the group are defined (leaving the external system to identify a group satisfying these characteristics), this additional information is sent by the electronic message system to the external system along with the subset of information about the message. The group of users with which the information is shared may be totally distinct from the recipients of the original message sent (in block ) or there may be a small amount of overlap (e.g. a few of the recipients may be members of the group but the majority of the group members are not recipients of the original message).","On receipt of the subset of information from the electronic message system (and any information defining the group), the external system identifies the group of users (if necessary) and then shares the information with the group of users. The external system then subsequently receives feedback from members of the group of users (block ). In an example, the feedback may comprise an indication of approval or disapproval of the original message, ratings or comments (e.g. relating to a new product), an indication of the volume of responses etc. In one example application, such a method may provide parental control over individual accounts or monitoring by an administrator of open forum messaging systems. An event signal is then generated by the external system based on the feedback received (block ) and the event signal may comprise an aggregate of all the feedback received (e.g. an overall approval indicator) or a required action which is determined by the external system based on the aggregate of all the feedback received. The event signal is received by a subpart (e.g. the messaging service  or a user account ) in the electronic message system (block ) and as a result the system triggers a dynamic update to the original electronic message which was sent by the user (block ).","In an example, this dynamic update (in block ) may change the way that the message is displayed either to the sender (when viewing the messages in a folder of items that have previously been sent) and\/or the way that the message is displayed to the recipients and in such examples, the event signal may connect with the message viewer function  within the messaging service . In another example, the dynamic update may result in the message being deleted from the inbox of all recipients or those recipients who have not yet read the message (e.g. where the feedback received indicates disapproval of the group of users in the external system or where a parent blocks the sending of a message by their child) and in such an example, the event signal may connect with the message store manager  within the messaging service . In a further example, the message which was sent by the user (in block ) may be delayed from reaching the recipients until the event signal is received (in block ) and in this case the dynamic update may comprise releasing the message for delivery to the recipients or deleting the message (and possibly informing the sender of this deletion) and in such an example, the event signal may connect with the message exchange function  within the messaging service . In yet another example, the dynamic update (in block ) may comprise changing the permissions associated with the sent message (e.g. blocking forwarding if the feedback was negative from the group within the external system or allowing forwarding if the feedback was positive).","Such a method enables the electronic message system to be controlled in part according to social\/global sentiment or based on a community response within a social networking system. In a specific example, a recipient of an email message may be able to gain an indication of the community sentiment relating to the particular message (which may, for example, be a review, political campaign message, advertisement, etc) based on the color of the text within the body of the email message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 1"],"b":["4","5","602","604","606","604"]},"As described previously, the event signal is received by the electronic message system (block ) and in response to this a dynamic update to one or more electronic messages is triggered (block ). In this example, the dynamic update may comprise changing the way that electronic messages are displayed to a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["1","4","6","702"]},"In such a system, a user may provide consent for the collection and use of location data in this way when signing up to a messaging service which implements this method. In other examples, a user may be provided with an opt-out facility so that they can prevent their location being tracked and used in this way. Furthermore, any location data collected is stored in a secure manner and may be deleted as soon as it is not required. In various examples of this method, only current user location is required and in such examples, a single location data point may be stored for each user and updated regularly, so that no tracking data for a user is stored. In further examples, a user may choose whether to provide their data to the system (e.g. through recording and updating their location in a social networking system).","In this example, the external system generates an event signal (block ) either in response to the location of one or more users satisfying predefined criteria (block ) or in response to a change in the location of one or more users (block  is omitted). The event signal includes location data which may comprise the known location of a user (e.g. \u201cuser A at location X,Y\u201d where X,Y are coordinates) or an indicator that predefined criteria have been satisfied (as determined in block , e.g. \u201cCondition 3 satisfied\u201d).","As described previously, the event signal is received by the electronic message system (block ) and in response, the system triggers a dynamic update to an electronic message (block ). In this example, the dynamic update may comprise releasing a previously sent message or changing access permissions to a message (e.g. such that a user can read the message if in location Z, but not at other locations). The event and\/or the dynamic update which is triggered may be based on the location of a single user, who may be the sender or a recipient of the message and the trigger may affect the message for just that single user, for multiple users (e.g. for all recipients) or for all users associated with the message (i.e. sender and recipient). In an example, only when the sender is at (or has reached, but may subsequently have left) a particular location, the recipients may be able to read a message. In other examples, the event and\/or the dynamic update which is triggered may be based on the location of multiple users where the group of users may be defined by the electronic message system (e.g. the recipients of the message) or another system (e.g. a social networking system which is an additional external system which interfaces to the electronic message system and\/or the user location system). For example, recipients may only receive a previously sent message when a group of users (who may be the recipients themselves) are co-located or when they are all at a specific location. In this example, the electronic message system may delay delivery of a message until the dynamic update is triggered or may allow delivery but prevent a message from being read until the dynamic update occurs.","In such an example, a subsequent event signal generated by the external system and received by the electronic message system may indicate further changes in user(s) location(s) (e.g. \u201cCondition 3 no longer satisfied\u201d) and this may result in the reversing of any actions which were triggered as a result of receiving the first event signal (e.g. canceling access permissions which were granted).","In this example method, the pre-defined conditions which may be used to define when the event signal is generated (in blocks -) may be specific to a particular message. In such an example, a user may be able to specify location criteria when drafting a message and then when this message is sent by the user, the electronic message system may extract the location criteria and then either send them to the external system (for use in block ) or store them and evaluate them when an event signal is received (in block ) to determine whether to trigger a dynamic update to the particular message or not.","The example shown in  and described above, provides a method of securing electronic messages based on the locations of one or more users. For example, sensitive email messages may be set so that they can only be read by users within the workplace but cannot, for example, be read when a user is outside of the workplace, irrespective of the type of device (e.g. desktop PC or handheld device) that the user uses to view their email messages.","Although  show four variations of the method shown in , it will be appreciated that aspects of any of the examples may be combined in any way. In describing each flow diagram different examples are given for the dynamic update to an electronic message (in blocks , ,  and ) and any of the examples given in any of the methods may be applied to any of the other methods.","In the methods described above, the external system  sends an event signal  which is received by an electronic message system and triggers an update. In a variation of the methods described above, the external system may receive a notification of the completed action (e.g. of the triggering or completion of the dynamic update) and this notification may be received based on the same mechanism that enables the external system to communicate with the message systems in order to send the event signal. Consequently any of the methods shown in FIGS.  and - may be modified to include an additional step of sending a notification back to the external system that a certain action has been completed and this step is performed after the event signal has been received and acted upon.","In many of the examples described above, the update propagates from a sender's account or messaging service to a recipient's account or messaging service. This functionality may, for example, be achieved using one of two approaches. The first approach involves creating a middleware that connects the external system(s) with the electronic message system, where the middleware performs analysis of the external data and \u2018translates\u2019 it into the form that the message system can further process\/propagate through the messaging service. Alternatively, the message system may be enhanced with the analysis of the external signals and then instantiate actions through the messaging service.","In other examples, however, the changes may flow in the opposite direction (i.e. the update may propagate from a recipient's account or messaging service to a sender's account or messaging service) or the external event signal may link into both the sending and receiving message systems (or messaging services). As described above, there is equal capability for all message systems involved. In an example scenario where both the sending and receiving messaging services may be involved, the external event is related to one of the recipients, e.g. the person is knighted and has a new title of \u2018Sir\u2019 instead of \u2018Mr\u2019. In order that the new title is propagated through the recently received messages, the messages need to be changed backward through the messaging channel. In such a scenario, the event signal may be sent to either or both the sender's messaging service and the recipient's messaging service, messages involving the person with the new title are identified and a dynamic update is triggered to action the change in title.","The methods described above may treat all the messaging systems involved in the message transmission equally (i.e. the method may treat the sender's messaging system and the recipient's messaging system equally). Thus, the method may activate the transmission based on a signal received from the recipient's of a message or invitee to a meeting (where the electronic message is an appointment or meeting request) rather than the entity that initiated the original message\/invite.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","104","106"]},"Computing-based device  comprises one or more processors  which may be microprocessors, controllers or any other suitable type of processors for processing computer executable instructions to control the operation of the device in order to either trigger dynamic updates in response to receipt of an event signal or to implement the dynamic update in response to a trigger message received from another node in the electronic message system. In some examples, for example where a system on a chip architecture is used, the processors  may include one or more fixed function blocks (also referred to as accelerators) which implement a part of the method of triggering\/performing dynamic updates to electronic messages (or any other part of the methods described above) in hardware (rather than software or firmware). Platform software comprising an operating system  or any other suitable platform software may be provided at the computing-based device to enable application software , ,  to be executed on the device. The application software may include the messaging service  and\/or one or more user accounts . In some examples, the methods described herein may be implemented in middleware that can communicate with any electronic message system and the appropriate functions within the system (e.g. as shown in ).","The computer executable instructions may be provided using any computer-readable media that is accessible by computing based device . Computer-readable media may include, for example, computer storage media such as memory  and communications media. Computer storage media, such as memory , includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other non-transmission medium that can be used to store information for access by a computing device. In contrast, communication media may embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal, such as a carrier wave, or other transport mechanism. As defined herein, computer storage media does not include communication media. Therefore, a computer storage medium should not be interpreted to be a propagating signal per se. Although the computer storage media (memory ) is shown within the computing-based device  it will be appreciated that the storage may be distributed or located remotely and accessed via a network or other communication link (e.g. using communication interface ).","The computing-based device  may receive event signals via the communication interface  and\/or from a trigger input device  via an input\/output controller . The input\/output controller  may further be arranged to output display information to a display device  which may be separate from or integral to the computing-based device . The display information may provide a graphical user interface. The input\/output controller  is also arranged to receive and process input from one or more devices, such as a user input device  (e.g. a mouse or a keyboard). This user input may be used to create electronic messages (where the node is acting as a client, e.g. in block  of ), specify rules associated with an electronic message (as described above with reference to ) etc. In an embodiment the display device  may also act as the user input device  if it is a touch sensitive display device (e.g. where the node is a tablet PC or smart phone or where the user has a touch sensitive display connected to a desktop PC). The input\/output controller  may also output data to devices other than the display device, e.g. a locally connected printing device (not shown in ).","Although many of the examples are described and illustrated herein as being implemented in an email system, the system described is provided as an example and not a limitation. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the present examples are suitable for application in a variety of different types of electronic messaging systems, including calendar systems, text message (e.g. SMS) systems etc.","The term \u2018computer\u2019 or \u2018computing-based device\u2019 is used herein to refer to any device with processing capability such that it can execute instructions. Those skilled in the art will realize that such processing capabilities are incorporated into many different devices and therefore the terms \u2018computer\u2019 and \u2018computing-based device\u2019 each include PCs, servers, mobile telephones (including smart phones), tablet computers, set-top boxes, media players, games consoles, personal digital assistants and many other devices.","The methods described herein may be performed by software in machine readable form on a tangible storage medium e.g. in the form of a computer program comprising computer program code means adapted to perform all the steps of any of the methods described herein when the program is run on a computer and where the computer program may be embodied on a computer readable medium. Examples of tangible (or non-transitory) storage media include computer storage devices comprising computer-readable media such as disks, thumb drives, memory etc and do not include propagated signals. The software can be suitable for execution on a parallel processor or a serial processor such that the method steps may be carried out in any suitable order, or simultaneously.","This acknowledges that software can be a valuable, separately tradable commodity.
