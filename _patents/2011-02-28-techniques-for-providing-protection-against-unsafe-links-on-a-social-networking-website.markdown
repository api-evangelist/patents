embodiment, the one or more processors may be configured to access the safety rating for each of the plurality of links by accessing a web reputation service.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the safety rating of a link may indicate a safety risk level associated with the link.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the safety rating may indicate at least one of a high safety risk level, a medium safety risk level, and a low safety risk level.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings. While the present disclosure is described below with reference to exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other fields of use, which are within the scope of the present disclosure as described herein, and with respect to which the present disclosure may be of significant utility.","Currently, a social networking website (e.g., www.Facebook.com, www.Twitter.com, www.MySpace.com) may provide online users with limited protection against cyber crimes (e.g., security breaches, privacy breaches, data breaches) using a blacklist detection technique, a violation report technique, or a combination of both. A blacklist detection technique may operate by comparing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a domain name to a list of URLs or domain names known to be malicious. If, for example, a URL or domain name appears on the list, the blacklist detection technique may remove the URL or domain name from the social networking website. The blacklist detection technique, however, fails to provide sufficient protection because it is static and can be easily circumvented using URL redirection.","A violation report technique may operate by removing a URL or a domain name from a social networking website based on one or more violation reports (e.g., a report drafted by an online user and indicating that a URL or a domain name is associated with malicious activity) submitted by one or more online users of the social networking website. Similar to the blacklist detection technique, the violation report technique fails to provide sufficient protection because it is slow to respond to real-time threats as a result of its reliance upon human intervention (e.g., the drafting of the violation report). Accordingly, current protection mechanisms utilized by social networking websites may be ineffective and inefficient.","In one embodiment, certain techniques for providing protection against unsafe links (e.g., URLs, hyperlinks) on a social networking website are provided. In such an embodiment, a safe application accessible via a social networking website may be initiated (e.g., activated, accessed, added) by an online user of the social networking website to scan links associated with a user profile of the online user. After initiation, the safe application may request and receive permissions data from the online user.","Permissions data may include any data that indicates whether permission has been granted for the safe application to perform a particular task by an online user. For example, first permissions data inputted by an online user may permit the safe application to access a news feed and a display area (e.g., a Facebook wall) associated with a user profile of the online user. In another example, second permissions data inputted by an online user may permit the safe application to access a news feed and a display area associated with a user profile of the online user while the online user is not logged into the social networking website. In another example, third permissions data inputted by an online user may permit the safe application to post (e.g., display) information (e.g., a link analysis report) in a news feed, a display area associated with a user profile of the online user, or a combination of both. In yet another example, fourth permissions data inputted by an online user may permit the safe application to periodically (e.g., once a month) transmit a message to the online user and one or more other online users of the social networking website (e.g., friends of an online user).","Based on the permissions data received, the safe application may initiate a demand scan procedure, an automatic scan procedure, or a combination of both. A demand scan procedure may initially scan links in data associated with a user profile of an online user (e.g., a news feed, a display area, a message board) after initiation of the safe application. Accordingly, the demand scan procedure may immediately launch after permissions data indicating at least a grant of permission to access a news feed and a display area (e.g., a Facebook wall) associated with a user profile of the online user is received.","In one embodiment, the demand scan procedure may determine the safety rating of each link posted in data associated with the user profile of the online user (e.g., a news feed, a display area, a message board) within a period of time (e.g., links posted within the last 24 hours). A safety rating may indicate a safety risk level that indicates the likelihood that a particular link is associated with any, or combination, of a security risk, a malicious download, a browser exploit, and a phishing website. For example, a first link (e.g., a link to an article on the New York Times website) may be associated with a low safety risk level. In another example, a second link (e.g., a link to a picture on a blog website) may be associated with a medium safety risk level. In yet another example, a third link (e.g., a link to an executable on a website known to contain malicious content) may be associated with a high safety risk level. Based on the safety ratings determined, the demand scan procedure may output an analysis of one or more scanned links in a link analysis report.","An automatic scan procedure may periodically (e.g., once every hour, once every 3 hours, once a day) scan newly posted links in data associated with a user profile of an online user (e.g., a news feed, a display area, a message board) after activation of the automatic scan feature of the safe application. Accordingly, the automatic scan procedure may be initiated after permissions data indicating at least a grant of permission to access a news feed and a display area (e.g., a Facebook wall) associated with a user profile of the online user, a grant of permission to access a news feed and a display area associated with the user profile of the online user while the online user is not logged into the social networking website, a grant of permission to post (e.g., display) information (e.g., a link analysis report) in a news feed, a display area associated with a user profile of the online user, or a combination of both, and a grant of permission to periodically (e.g., once a month) transmit a message to the online user and one or more other online users of the social networking website (e.g., friends of the online user) is received.","In another embodiment, the automatic scan procedure may periodically determine the safety rating of each newly posted link located in data associated with the user profile of the online user (e.g., a news feed, a display area, a message board). Based on the safety ratings determined, the automatic scan procedure may output (e.g., post) an analysis of one or more scanned links (e.g., the links that indicate a medium safety risk level or a high safety risk level) in a link analysis report to a display area in the user profile (e.g., a Facebook wall) of the online user. Accordingly, one or more other online users of the social networking website may be able to review the posted link analysis report.","The safe application may also allow an online user of the social networking website to pre-check a link prior to sharing the link with other online users of the social networking website. Accordingly, the online user may access the safety rating of a link prior to sharing the link with other online users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","110","120","140","140","200","110","120","140","140","150","140","160","1","140","160","1","140","142","144","146","140","140","170","170","180","1","140","140","110","120","150","140","190","120","122","124","126","128"]},"With reference to computer system  of , modem , network interface , or some other method may be used to provide connectivity from one or more of client  and client  to network .
