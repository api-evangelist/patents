Recursive trackers, which include bearing trackers, such as alpha-beta and Kalman, require initial values of all states that will be updated as new data arrives. An alpha-beta recursive tracker is more fully described in the technical article of T. Benedict and G. Bordner, \u201cSynthesis of an Optimal Set of Radar Track-While-Scan Smoothing Equations,\u201d Institute of Radio Engineers Transactions on Automatic Control, AC-7, Jul. 1962, pp 27\u201332. The Kalman recursive tracker is more fully described in the book by A. Gelb, Chapter 4, Applied Optimal Estimation, Mass. Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1974.","For all recursive trackers, the closer the initial values are to the actual values, the higher the probability that the tracker, in particular the bearing tracker, will successfully acquire (i.e., begin following) the target. States requiring initialization for modern narrowband trackers are bearing, bearing rate, frequency, frequency rate, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Initial values for bearing and frequency are readily available if an operator, such as the tracker operator, clicks on a line that he has observed on a beam's spectragram (gram). The initial bearing can be set equal to the steering angle of the beam whose gram was clicked, and the initial frequency can be set equal to the center frequency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) bin containing the clicked point on the gram. Initial values for bearing rate, frequency rate, and SNR, however, are not readily available; they, therefore, are usually set to default values. The typical default value used for bearing rate is zero. This default setting of zero frequently results in a failure to acquire targets that have high bearing rates, i.e., rates significantly different from zero. It is desired that an acquisition system be provided that provides initial values for bearing rate and SNR, so as to more readily acquire targets that have high bearing rates.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide for means to improve narrowband tracker acquisitions in scenarios that have high bearing rates with the means providing relatively accurate estimates of initial values of bearing, bearing rate, and SNR using beam spectral data for a short time interval preceding the actual initiation operation of the acquisition system, that is, before assigning a bearing tracker to a target.","In accordance with one aspect, a method is provided by the present invention for a bearing tracker that provides estimates for a target's bearing, bearing rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to assigning the bearing tracker to a target. The method comprises the steps of: a) receiving acoustic signals from objects emitting acoustic signals, the signals being received on multiple beams each comprised of a band of frequencies; b) performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the received beams; c) examining each beam's FFT data to determine which beam contains a narrowband signal to be tracked; d) providing a normalizing process of the band of frequencies of each beam so as to create approximately unit mean data in all frequency bins that do not contain a narrowband signal and providing a normalized beam spectral data matrix herefrom in a three-dimensional array comprising beam\/frequency\/time; and e) utilizing the beam spectral data over a small frequency interval containing the narrowband signal to provide the estimates for the target bearing, bearing rate and signal-to-noise ratio.","As discussed in the \u201cBackground\u201d section, tracking systems have difficulties in acquiring targets having high bearing rates due to the inability to provide realistic estimates of the true values for bearing rate, frequency rate and SNR. The present invention provides means particularly suited to improve narrowband tracker acquisitions in scenarios that have these high bearing rates. More particularly, the present invention provides means that estimate, in a relatively accurate manner, initial values of bearing, bearing rate, and SNR using beam spectral data for a short time proceeding the initialization action. The principles of the present invention that provide for an accurate bearing rate estimate, may be best described by first generally discussing a bearing rate scenario.","Suppose a line passes through point (x, y) in the xy-plane and makes an angle \u03b8 measured clockwise with respect to the y-axis. Further, suppose that \u03b8 is restricted to lie within the set {\u03b8}. If x is bearing, y is time, and the line is a target track, then the target's bearing rate is tan (\u03b8).","Assume that measurements along lines corresponding to each of the {\u03b8}are available in the form: \n\n\nwhere \u03b4is the Kronecker delta function, and \u03b8=\u03b8. Let j\u2032 be the value of j that maximizes mean estimates given by: \n\n","It can be shown, and as will be further described, that \u03b8is a maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b8 and is one of the principles of the present invention. The description of the invention may be better understood by first making reference to abbreviations and acronyms given in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"BTR","Bearing time recorder"]},{"entry":[{},"ENBIT","Enhanced narrowband beam interpolation tracker"]},{"entry":[{},"FFT","Fast Fourier Transform"]},{"entry":[{},"Gram","spectragram"]},{"entry":[{},"Hz","Hertz"]},{"entry":[{},"IBW","Initialization bandwidth"]},{"entry":[{},"ID","Identification"]},{"entry":[{},"IID","independent identically distributed"]},{"entry":[{},"MRA","Maximum response axis"]},{"entry":[{},"PNB","Passive narrowband"]},{"entry":[{},"SNR","Signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"entry":[{},"SPN","Signal-plus-noise"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"With reference to , there is an apparatus , and a method of operation thereof, that includes a hydrophone array  that receives acoustic signals in the water from all potential sources including any underwater objects.

The bearing of the beam whose gram was clicked is designated brgclick; the frequency of the gram FFT bin clicked is designated freqclick; the beam number corresponding to the bearing of the beam is designated jbeam-click; the FFT bin number corresponding to the frequency of the gram FFT bin is designated binclick; and the total number of beams formed from forward to aft endfire is designated numbeams.

The purpose of the normalization is to create approximately unit mean data in all frequency bins that do not contain a narrowband signal. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","The program segment  is the second step in the processing of the present invention and stores the latest normalized, beam\/frequency spectral data matrix from step  in a three-dimensional array (beam\/frequency\/time) that extends numscans updates into the past. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","The program segment  is the third step and retrieves a subset of the data from the beam\/frequency\/time matrix created in program segment . The subset consists of the values from all beams and all time, but only over a narrow frequency interval centered about freqclick. This frequency interval is referred to as the \u201cinitialization bandwidth\u201d (IBW) and is measured in units of Hertz (Hz). The number of FFT bins in the IBW is designated by nbinsIBW. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","The program segment  is the fourth step and creates a matrix named btr having numscans rows and numbeams columns. Each element in marix btr corresponds to a particular update and a particular beam, and the value of the element is computed as the arithmetic average of the normalized spectral values contained in the IBW bins corresponding to that particular update and that particular beam. The value of each element in matrix btr may be interpreted as an estimate of normalized signal-plus-noise (SPN) in the IBW. An image plot of this matrix is referred to herein as the \u201cIBW bearing time recorder\u201d (BTR). Because the operator had already observed target energy in the IBW before he clicked on a gram to assign a tracker, the IBW BTR should reveal a trace associated with the target's movement across beams over the time interval covered by numscans updates. If numscans is not too large, the target's trace on the IBW BTR will be approximately linear and the slope of the trace will be directly related to the target's bearing rate. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","The program segment  is the fifth step and locates the target's trace on the IBW BTR and then computes the target's bearing, bearing rate, and SNR from parameters of the trace.

The beamwidthapprox function computes an approximate beamwidth using inputs of an MRA angle of the clicked beam, the clicked frequency, the aperture length of the array, which the acquisition system  uses, and the speed of sound. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","With regard to the processing performed by program segment , beam MRAs are assumed to be equally spaced in cosine of the steering angle. This condition, in conjunction with a value of numbeams, can be used to compute the amount of separation between the MRAs. Knowing the beamwidth and steering direction of the clicked beam allows computation of the amount of cosine space occupied by \u00bdbeamwidth. It is then a straightforward operation to compute the number of beams whose steering directions lie within M beamwidth of the clicked beam, which is designated beamtolerance. If beamtolerance is less than 2, it is replaced by 2. The processing of parameters involved in these calculations are handled by the function calcbeamtol. The calcbeamtol function computes the number of beams that will be used as anchor points for candidate slope estimates on each side of the clicked beam. An approximate beamwidth is calculated using inputs of the steer direction of the clicked beam, the clicked frequency, the array aperture length, and the sound speed. The amount of cosine space occupied by one-half of the beamwidth is computed. The separation in cosine space between beam MRAs is calculated by using an input value for the total number of beams, which allows computation of the number of beam MRAs contained in one-half of a beamwidth. The function outputs this value unless it falls below 2, in which case, it outputs a value of 2. After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","With regard to the processing performed by program segment , if the operator always clicked on the gram of the beam pointed closest to the target at that time, then possible target traces on the IBW BTR would consist of a set of lines of different slopes, each passing through the beam whose index is ibeamclick at the latest update. This set of lines is referred to as a \u201cfan\u201d, and the beam through which the fan's lines pass on the latest update is referred to as the \u201canchor beam\u201d of the fan. It is assumed in program segment  that the slope increment between adjacent lines in the fan is small and that the magnitudes of the slopes of the lines at the two edges of the fan are large. Sometimes, it is difficult for an operator to tell precisely which beam is steered closest to the target when the operator is looking at grams from a number of beams in the target's neighborhood. Thus, it is possible that the target's trace will lie in a fan having an anchor beam that is near, but not equal to, ibeamclick. Program segment  assumes that the anchor beam lies within \u00b1 \u00bd beamwidth of ibeamclick. The index of the first beam in this subset is simply (ibeamclick-beamtolerance), and the index of the last beam is (ibeamclick+beamtolerance). After completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .","Program segment  assumes that there is only one target signal present in the IBW. If the target's trace passes through the first anchor beam of the IBW BTR, then the trace will approximately overlay one of the lines in the associated fan. As previously stated, values contained in matrix btr may be interpreted as estimates of normalized SPN. Because signal is present along the trace only, the average of the SPN values in matrix btr along the line underlying the trace will be higher than along any other line in the fan. Hence, the line within the fan, along which the average btr values is maximum, will be designated as the \u201cbest line\u201d for that fan. Also, the average of the btr values along the best line will be saved as an estimate of SPN for that fan. The determination of which elements of btr lie along any given line in the fan is handled by the function rateest.","The rateest function computes average powers along a fan of BTR lines emanating from a specified beam at the latest update. Each average is an estimate of SPN power along that line. If a target's trace is present on the BTR, then the line that most closely overlays the trace will have the highest SPN value. Hence, the line with the highest SPN is called the best line in the fan. An estimate of bearing rate is computed from the slope of the best line. This function returns the estimated bearing rate and the associated estimate of SPN.

That is to say, the narrowband being tracked is omitted. Program segment  calls this variable band noise level. An estimate of the linear SNR in the IBW is computed as: \n\n","If the SNR is too low (snrlinibw<=1), program segment  assumes that the SNR is too low for reliable initialization estimates. Program segment  sets snrlinibw to a default value designated by snrlin ibwand then outputs the following default values.

Upon completion, program segment  passes control to program segment  via path .\n","With regard to program segment , it should first be recalled that the index number of the best line's anchor beam is saved in a variable named bestbeam. Program segment  provides the fbeam2brg function converts a zero-based, floating point beam number to a corresponding bearing. Program segment  further provides equations for converting a bearing angle to a beam number, a beam number to a bearing angle, a beam rate to a bearing rate, and a bearing rate to a beam rate. All conversions assume that the beam number is zero based, and that beams are equally spaced in cosine space.","For all equations provided by program segment , b is a zero-based, floating point beam number, N is the total number of beams, \u03b8 is the bearing angle in radians, and t is a time in any unit such as second, minute, or update.\n\nThe conversion of bearing \u03b8 to beam b is \n\n\nThe conversion of beam b to bearing \u03b8 is \n\n\nLet \n\n\nSubstituting (7) into (6) and differentiating with respect to time gives \n\n\nThe derivative of (7) with respect to time is \n\n\nSubstituting (9) and (7) into (8) provides an expression that allows computation of bearing rate \n\n\ngiven a beam rate \n\n\ni.e., \n\n\nEquation (10) can be rewritten to allow computations of beam rate given a bearing rate, i.e., \n\n","The manipulation provided by equations (5)\u2013(11) corrects the index number into the beam's associated steering direction. The converted value is denoted by program segment  by the variable name bestbrguncorrected. Depending upon the target's SNR and bearing rate, the target may already have moved to another beam before the operator sees its line on a gram. Computed corrected initialization estimates are provided by the enbit function.","The enbit function is the top function call. The inputs consist of a bearing and a frequency that result from an operator's click on a gram of a beam containing a target the operator wants to track. Other required inputs are the number of updates (scans) of processing  data history, the number of FFT bins in the IBW, the sound speed, and the time between data history updates. The data history contains the most recent numscans of floating point, narrow-window normalized (noise-only mean=1), and passive narrowband (PNB) data. This function retrieves the subset of data from all beams that lie within an IBW centered about the clicked frequency.","The retrieved data are averaged across the IBW on each beam for each scan in the history, and the averaged values are used to create a narrowband BTR over the history time span. A number of beams in the neighborhood of the clicked beam are selected as start points for fans of line averages over the BTR data. The line that most closely matches the target's track (which will be approximately linear for small values of numscans) will have the largest average value and is the best line; its average value is taken as an estimate of SPN power in the IBW, which is then used to compute an SNR estimate in the IBW.","If the SNR estimate is greater than 0 dB, then (1) the slope of the best line is used to compute an estimate of bearing rate, (2) the endpoint of the best line corresponding to the most recent update is used to compute a preliminary estimate of the target's bearing, and (3) a final bearing estimate is computed by applying a rate-dependent correction factor to the preliminary estimate to compensate for lag delays. If the SNR estimate is less than 0 dB, then enbit returns a default value of 0 radians\/min for its bearing rate estimate, a default SNR, and the steering angle of the clicked beam for its default bearing estimate.","It should now be appreciated that the present invention provides improved estimates of a narrowband target's bearing, bearing rate, and SNR for use in initializing narrowband trackers allowing these trackers to acquire targets having high bearing rates. The estimates are computed using normalized beam spectral data from a short time interval preceding the initialization action. The only action required by an operator is to place his beam gram cursor over a line he wishes to track, and then click.","It will be understood that various changes and details, steps and arrangement of parts and method steps, which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appending claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The appended claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of this invention.
