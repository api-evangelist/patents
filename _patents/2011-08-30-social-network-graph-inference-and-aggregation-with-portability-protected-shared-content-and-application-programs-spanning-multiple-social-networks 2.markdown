title: Social network graph inference and aggregation with portability, protected shared content, and application programs spanning multiple social networks
abstract: An application program spans a plurality of digital social networks. The application program includes an inferred digital social network. Consent is obtained from a plurality of users of the digital social networks to participation in the inferred digital social network. Information is automatically obtained from the digital social networks for the users, through a plurality of respective communication channels, which can be application program interfaces or covert or subliminal channels. The information includes link information between each of the users and other individuals in the digital social networks. The information is aggregated for the users to form the inferred digital social network, corresponding to a graph having nodes representing the users and the other individuals and having links between the nodes representing social relationships. Each of the users is enabled to send and receive message information with other users, to view profile information of other users, and to view social contact information of other users, through the inferred digital social network. In response to inputs from the users, the application program provides state information to the digital social networks spanned by the application program that the digital social networks cause to be communicated to users of the digital social networks.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of F. David Serena, Provisional Application No. 61\/511,983, filed Jul. 26, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety.","The field of the invention generally relates to computer-based social networks, and more particularly to social networks inferred from pre-existing traditional social networks, and application programs that span multiple pre-existing traditional social networks.","Computer-based social networks such as FACEBOOK, GOOGLE+, PING, or LINKEDIN provide opportunities for individuals to maintain, nurture, and develop relationships with friends or business contacts. These networks typically enable their participants to view profiles of other participants, and to link with other participants with whom a pre-existing actual relationship exists or with whom an actual social or business relationship is desired. Typically, once linked together through a computer-based social network, participants can exchange communications, photographs, or other media content, and can view the identities of persons with whom the other participant has relationships through the social relationship network.","Social networks can be represented by a graph structure wherein nodes are individuals or other entities and links (potentially weighted) represent connections between the parties. It has been assumed in modern large social networks such as FACEBOOK, GOOGLE+, PING and LINKEDIN that the network itself is owned by the major providers. Many of the rights, however, are owned by the constituent members of the social network (some of these ownership rights of the user are actually specified in \u201cterms of service\u201d).","Graph inference is a technology that determines graph content through observations and logical inference. The technology is to determine overall graph structure from partial information. Social networks contain more state information (such as photos, multimedia, games, privacy information, blocking of individuals) than the standard definition of a social graph, and edge weightings of the graph may be implied to designate link quality information, as is detailed in Serena, \u201cRelationship Networks Having Link Quality Metrics with inference and Concomitant Digital Value Exchange,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/177,856, filed Jul. 7, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, individuals have a view of the world via social networks that does not contain all links but contains a view of connectedness, including degrees of separation to neighbors in the graph structure (for example, suggested friends lists can be used as a basis for garnering information about the social graph).","In one general aspect, the invention provides a method of operating an inferred digital social network. Consent is obtained from a plurality of users of at least one digital social network to participation in the inferred digital social network. Information is automatically obtained from the digital social network for the plurality of users of the digital social network. The information includes link information between each of the plurality of users and other individuals in the digital social network. The information is aggregated for the plurality of users to form the inferred digital social network, corresponding to a graph having nodes representing the plurality of users and the other individuals and having links between the nodes representing social relationships.","This aspect of the invention takes advantage of the fact that individuals or entities in a traditional social network can infer the overall structure of the traditional network in the individual's or entity's neighborhood and cognizant network (perhaps by many observations), and thus the individuals or entities in essence own their view of the graph structure and its appurtenant content (such as photos, comments, multi-media, texts, and video, subject to digital rights management, copyright, and privacy restrictions). These views of graph structure and content, to which the individual or entity has a legal right and technical ability to obtain, can be aggregated, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, to infer the graph structure of the traditional social network. Thus, this inference process can be either cooperative or non-cooperative with respect to the traditional social network providers. The inferred social network resulting from this process can be implemented independently of the traditional social network and function as its own social network. In certain embodiments the inferred social network and its appurtenant content is stored and implemented as a distributed peer-to-peer social network, and in other embodiments it is stored and implemented on a central server, or on a hybrid centralized and distributed network.","Further, cryptographic techniques (such as those set forth in Sections 3.6 and 3.7 of Bruce Schneier, , John Wiley & Sons, 1996, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference) can be applied to secure the interparty communications within the inferred social network, with secrets that can be decrypted only in concert with N other parties. So, shared content within the inferred social network (whether implemented with centralized server architecture or peer-to-peer architecture) can be kept private, away from any traditional social network provider. Consequently, privacy is no longer dependent on the stated objectives of a corporation that implements a traditional social network; rather, privacy is ensured by the storage mechanism itself of the inferred social network provided by the invention. For example, although traditional social networks have stated privacy policies, a member of a traditional social network could, for example, copy a profile page from the traditional social network and e-mail it someone. The privacy ensurance mechanism provided by this embodiment of the invention, in contrast, cryptographically ensures privacy by the storage mechanism itself, thereby preventing the kind of copying described above. This cryptographically ensured privacy can be extended to the inferred graph structure itself, such that the inferred graph structure itself can be reconstituted only by decryption in concert with N other parties.","One objective of inferring the graph structure in accordance with the invention is to create a portable social network extrinsic to any major entity (such as corporations that own traditional social networks), thereby allowing the users of the portable social network, individually and in aggregate, to own their own copy of a social network. The personally generated social network can have attached content and individual parameters (such as privacy settings) that supplement the online experience. The invention allows the individuals in aggregate to create a portable social network that could be copied to another traditional social network provider if members of the portable social network agree. So, for example, the portable social network could migrate from a first traditional social network to a second one, causing the first traditional social network to lose comments, conversations, etc., and the second traditional social network to obtain new users and new posts. Thus, this embodiment of the invention facilitates transfer of subnetworks of the social graph of a traditional social network to another traditional social network.","Thus, the consumer benefits from the increased portability described above, and from privacy that is cryptographically enforced rather than merely dependent on a stated policy of traditional social network providers. The portability and migration capability allow for the consumer or groups of consumers to transfer from a traditional social network provider without losing the extensive connections and state information intrinsic to the traditional social network.","The portability and inference infrastructure provided by the invention can be supported by direct subscription or could be advertising supported. Advertising can be provided by sending queries to the users and allowing the users to self-target the advertising by responding to the queries. Alternatively, data can be mined from the inferred digital social network and advertisements can be targeted to users based on the mined data. Alternatively, data can be directly mined locally from individual client computing devices with which individual users communicate with the inferred digital social network, and advertisements can be directly targeted to the individual client computing devices based on the mined data.","In another general aspect, the invention provides a method of operating an inferred digital social network, in which information is automatically obtained from a digital social network for a plurality of users of the digital social network. The information includes link information between each of the plurality of users and other individuals in the digital social network. The information is aggregated for the plurality of users to form the inferred digital social network, corresponding to a graph having nodes representing the plurality of users and the other individuals and having links between the nodes representing social relationships. Each of the plurality of users is enabled to send and receive message information with other ones of the users, to view profile information of other ones of the users, and to view social contact information of other ones of the users, through the inferred digital social network.","Thus, the inferred social network can, in follow-on actions, operate as its own stand-alone social network, albeit with information garnered from the inference process as well. In certain embodiments of the invention, this feature allows users to operate as a fully self-sufficient social network between migration periods from one underlying traditional social network to another. In other embodiments, the stand-alone inferred social network does not employ portability and is used instead permanently as a stand-alone social network.","In another general aspect, the invention provides a method of operating an application program spanning a plurality of the digital social networks. State information is obtained automatically from the plurality of digital social networks through a plurality of respective communication channels, which can be application program interfaces or covert or subliminal channels. Input is received from at least one user of the application program in response to the state information obtained from the plurality of digital social networks. In response to the input from the user of the application program, other state information is provided to the plurality of digital social networks that the digital social networks cause to be communicated to users of the digital social networks. This aspect of the invention makes it possible for multiple digital social networks to be spanned by applications such as online games, personal networking applications, gift-sending applications, product promotion applications, applications for identifying who is looking at a user's profile, applications for ranking connections to a user on the digital social networks, mobile messaging applications, and inferred digital social networks of the type provided by other aspects of the invention as described above.","In certain embodiments the spanning application is a program that provides a unified user meta-interface to enable sharing of content simultaneously across the plurality of digital social networks. This application program can enable digital social networking between the plurality of users across the plurality of digital social networks by enabling content sharing between the plurality of digital social networks. The content shared between the plurality of digital social networks can include a message sent from one of the users of one of the digital social networks to at least another of the users of another one of the digital social networks.","The details of various embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","With reference to , there is shown the computational infrastructure of an inferred digital social network system. A group of traditional social network provider servers , , and  are accessible to client computers  operated by users of the traditional social networks, intrinsic applications, and direct queries  from external servers  and  (for example, there is a FACEBOOK app that runs on FACEBOOK itself that allows certain queries). The inferred social network according to the invention is aggregated from information sources in a manner described below, and stored and accessed on inferred social network provider servers  and client computers . In alternative embodiments, the storage and accessing occurs entirely on one of computers . The arrows in the diagram represent network connections between the components to which the arrows point. As is discussed below, peer-to-peer social networking and centralized processing are conducted with respect to the inferred social network provider. The inferred social network can have all of the properties of a traditional social network, but the social network may be owned directly by the individuals participating in this system.","Intrinsic in the establishment of the inferred social network is the ability to target market to its members. Members may benefit from receipt of advertising, including incentives, coupons, and other promotional material, such as digital value, cash, or watermarked advertising with digital cash as described in Serena, \u201cEmbedding digital values for digital exchange,\u201d U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009\/0076904, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Members may choose to self-target advertising, and the self-targeting can be based on the members allowing localized searching of content by providers of advertising. Privacy can be maintained by allowing local searches on shared inferred network content, as is described below. Advertisers and marketers may view a group that has inferred their own social network and is now portable as an attractive target for specific ads. The group may share demographic aspects that allow them to demand greater incentives from advertisers. The advertising process will support the corporation that purveys the infrastructure for the inferred social network, and will provide a revenue stream for the provision of tools within the inferred social network. The infrastructure for the distributed computation required by the inferred social network, as is described below, provides capability for delivering advertising to the participants in the system and allowing individuals to reclaim their own network and contacts as their own property, in view of the fact that the individuals are generating the content delivered to the traditional social network. Furthermore, the inferred social network's business can be the subject of subscription-based pricing.","Thus, the portable inference infrastructure shown in  can be supported by direct subscription or could be advertising supported. Advertisements can be delivered through the browsing mechanisms or applications on client computers  with which users interact with private social network provider servers , ,  and inferred social network provider server . Advertisements can also be delivered through interaction with the inferred social network system. For example, third parties could be allowed to mine data from the inferred social network system and deliver advertisements in response, or keyword search information could be sent from the inferred social network system to the third party. The advertisements can be self-targeted. In other words, a user can opt into advertisements in which the user is interested, such as through a third party sending the user a query and the user responding. Advertisements may also be key-word directed, or replaced from other objectionable advertisements, for example. The advertising may be served up directly to the client infrastructure  based upon local information and data on client computers . In addition, advertising preferences may be set for the inferred social network.","Advertisements are served to client computers  or inferred social network provider servers  by a targeted advertising server . In connection with interactions between targeted advertising server  and client computers , targeted advertising servers  may load code and advertising on client computers  for local keyword search not shared with inferred social network provider servers , thus, allowing users to rest assured that others in the network cannot see user-specific advertisements, which would be based solely on the searches done on the user's own machine . Advertisements are served locally at client computers  and usage data is conveyed to targeted advertising server  from client computers .","Thus, the inferred social network system can allow for advertising, including purveyance of digital value, based on local searches of keywords on client computers . The advertising process causes advertisements to be stored on a user's local machine , based on self-targeting and keyword conveyance based on local searches of the content list. Therefore, the central advertisement server need only collect conveyance information and need not search conversations in the typical manner to convey advertisements. The advertisements would be resident on a client machine  and private information could be searched privately and advertisements targeted, while the private conversation (or other multimedia interaction) need not be stored on a central server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1000","1020","1000","1020"]},"In this document a graph G is defined as an ordered pair (V, E) of a set V of vertices or nodes and a set E of edges, which are two-element subsets of V. A line graph of an undirected graph G is defined as another graph L(G) that represents the adjacencies between edges of G. That is to say, any two vertices of L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges in G share a common endpoint (\u201care adjacent\u201d).","Users , , , and  in  opt in to the inferred social network, and so a graph structure  is inferred based on the information about traditional social network  obtained from the observations of users , , , and . In some instances, user  may be inferred from knowledge of  and 's connections. Traditional social network graph  represents the graph structure stored in the traditional social network provider's system. Depending on the resolution of a unique login name of user  (in order to ensure that common names are distinguished from one another, as is done by credit agencies) the inferred graph  may show two connections to separate nodes from  and  rather than one node  connected to both nodes  and . Until sufficient information is garnered and the unique login identity of node  is ascertained, node  might not be resolved to a unique user. The inference algorithm uses profile information and other information garnered from user , ,  and 's data sources to resolve the ambiguity concerning user .","The algorithmic process for inferring a digital social network is outlined in . In step , known adjacency links with potential weightings are obtained with respect to a particular user of one or more \u201ctarget\u201d traditional digital social networks, as is described in Serena, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/177,856, supra. Then, in step , the system for inferring the digital social network merges this information with other views of the adjacency links for the same user as well as other users, in an iterative process, taking into account privacy restrictions of the inferred social network (discussed below). Aggregation logic  is then applied. Aggregation logic  uses timestamps of the links, which show the links as of a certain time, since the graphs are constantly changing, to resolve the current view of the network or networks. When individual views are aggregated a view of the target social network or networks can be inferred that is of higher fidelity, including an ability to see far into the target network or networks, compared to the target traditional social network provider data model from which data is mined. From a real-time computational standpoint, the target network or networks have a time rate of change (i.e., additions, modifications, and deletes) and the graph inference model will lag behind the changes in the target network or networks. Eventually, however, the individual views in aggregate will catch up to the target network or networks for a specific time step. This time lag is a reality that is well known to those skilled in the art of database design. This invention addresses the time lag by capturing additions, modifications, and deletions to individuals' graph structures by allowing corresponding additions, modifications, and deletions to the user interface (discussed below) of the inferred social network.","Once the aggregation is complete, step  causes each user's locally accepted view of the inferred graph to be stored, with admissible appurtenant digital content (such as digital content consistent with digital rights management restrictions, or photos legitimately taken from an underlying traditional networks based on privacy restrictions or copyright restrictions). In step , an overview of the entire inferred graph is stored, with privacy protections of the type shown in  (discussed below). If information is stored locally at a client computer, it is encrypted if the operator the local machine is not supposed to see that information. If information is stored in a central server, the central server stores privacy information so the central server does not send data to parties who should not obtain it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 17","FIG. 6","FIGS. 3 and 4"],"b":["5000","5010","5020","5000","5050","5050","5010","5020","5300","5150","5150","5400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 3","FIG. 9"],"b":["9020","9020"]},"A user typically interacts from an application , such as a browser, with a traditional social network provider . After a one-time opt-in process for each traditional network (shown in , discussed below), a query process , which could log in automatically to the traditional social network, can directly query transaction traditional social network provider . The queries to traditional social network provider  may be in http or https accesses, intrinsic FACEBOOK apps or other traditional social network apps, target ad information queries, or other database query mechanisms. Query process  can also query transaction monitor application , thereby pulling information from a user's computer such as new information from an OUTLOOK contact list or other contacts list. Query process  can also query target advertisement information (see box  in ), for example by obtaining the target advertisement information through an application program interface of traditional social network provider , the application program interface being designed for advertising purposes and providing data that the advertisers use to target advertisements. This advertising data can be used to obtain information about the graph and its content. In addition, often browser application  interacts with OUTLOOK or other social network contact management systems . This information leaves residual markers in the host user's social contact list database for social network contact management system , such as a FACEBOOK URL, webpage address, or LINKEDIN photos having a LINKEDIN logo on them. Transaction monitor application  queries the intrinsic data of social network contact management system  (such as whatever data is in a user's OUTLOOK contacts list), and also monitors the process of additions, edits, insertions, and deletions into or from database to garner the user's direct neighbor list. A merge process  (which corresponds to blocks - in ) accesses data sources from different users and applies internal inference logic to further characterize the connections of the social network graph. As more and more people opt in to the inference process a better picture of the social network emerges for all users. Aggregated information is more comprehensive than the individual views of the traditional social network data.","Not only do transaction monitor application  and query process  garner information about the graph structure; the actual multimedia and text content (such as conversations) is stored privately. Once the graph structure is known from , this data can be added to the appropriate nodes or links. The information such as multimedia, photos, text, and music content, is placed in a database for retrieval based on the inferred graph structure of the network. The starting point for user interaction with the inferred digital social network is shown in , which presents the entry point for the inferred social network functionality for a user (who might have been invited into the inferred social network by a friend on a traditional social network). The system allows a user to enter a login name and password in box , and to register for the inferred social network using register button . Button  allows downloading of supporting applications to facilitate all of the aspects of the inferred social network. Terms of service must be agreed to using box , and the terms of service can be accessed using box . In addition, help with the login initiation process is available through system help link . Upon completion of the user consent and initiation of participation process, the inferred social network can be accessed with all of the functionality of a traditional social network.","After the user consents to participation in the inferred social network, the user can \u201copt in\u201d to the inferred network obtaining information from multiple traditional social networks.  shows an opt-in interface that allows the user to opt in to multiple social networks, thereby capturing as much state and graph theoretical link information as is available. The opt-in process captures login information so that the user's automated inference engine can engage in direct queries of each traditional social network provider. Column  allows for entering of login information or editing of same. Column  displays some status information about the target network. Columns  and  display graphics and naming of the traditional social network providers. An opt-in button  allows for commencing inference on a particular target traditional social network.","Once the user as elected to opt in to a traditional social network through the process described above, the user is allowed to set inference methods and privacy settings for the particular traditional social network, through the user interface shown in . Login credentials are obtained through boxes  for a given traditional social network represented by logo . The user sets the level of inference by the system with respect to the particular traditional social network using menu , and the user sets privacy settings associated with the inference process using menu . The settings are captured and saved when the user selects save box , or else the settings are canceled. The settings for privacy can allow defined subgraphs of users to join in the inference process, and can set the extent to which the inferred social network results are shared. Menu  can also be used to select the types of inference allowed. For example, shared information can be constrained to native friends in the manual settings of the inferred social network. Alternatively, privacy settings for the inference process can depend on a particular degree of separation such as \u201cfriends of friends.\u201d This process restricts the collaborative setting for the inference process to a specific subgraph or subgroup in a user's inference network. Similarly in menu , the inference model can be selected along with sources of the information: \u201cDirect queries\u201d may be possible with such instruments as intrinsic FACEBOOK or GOOGLE+ apps; \u201ccollaborative inference\u201d is the process described herein that allows for groups of people or entities to pool their inference capabilities to obtain a more accurate model of a traditional social network's graph structure.","After the user has consented to participation in the inferred social network () and \u201copted in\u201d to the inferred network obtaining information from multiple traditional social networks (), the user can access an inference network display, an example of which is shown in .  displays a graph isomorphic to graph  of . The links , , , and  represent multi-traditional social network connections (i.e., connections from multiple traditional social networks in the same view) and some native connections for the inferred social network. For example, links  and  may represent LINKEDIN connections in concert with a link for the inferred social network, and link  may be a link that is a FACEBOOK link. Link  may represent a link that exists solely within the inferred social network itself. Individual users in the graph are represented by nodes , ,  and . The basic information for the links and nodes is accessible through the inferred network connections. Individual links in  can be color-coded to indicate the source traditional social network for the information. The user can click on the nodes and links to pull up the appurtenant social content and information associated with the nodes and links.","After the social network is inferred, additional content can be added to the interaction. Interactions can take place extrinsic to the traditional social network providers, and content can be stored and accessed in a cryptographically secure manner by applying basic \u201csecret splitting\u201d protocols such as those set forth in the following references: Sections 3.6 and 3.7 of Bruce Schneier, , supra; A.

This portability allows individuals or groups of individuals to migrate between traditional providers en mass\u2014possibly to make a political statement. This portability also allows groups of individuals to boycott certain providers if they do not like their privacy or advertisement disbursement methodologies for example. Boycott rights have special status in many countries for asserting consumer protections. For example, if a parent group wants to move its children off of the major provider of the social network they can do so with this portable inferred social network schema. An additional example could be a group of children on a network maturing at the same time and migrating en mass to a traditional social network while preserving their shared content. The portability allows the moving group to control its online experience with respect to the social network and ensure that the group's policies are being adhered to by the traditional provider. The group migration rationale and rights are often intrinsic to many worldwide legal systems. The group may use actual migration or the threat of migration to change onerous legal terms of service or negotiate payments for the intrinsic value of that group's inferred social network.","Migration can be an assertion of intrinsic legal rights of an individual or group and their implicit and explicit rights over their own social network and connectivity in the host legal system. Countries may actually adopt laws that are more conducive to the assertion of group legal rights of migration across traditional social network providers. These existing rights can support the maintenance of the inferred social network by individuals and their groups. Certain rights of the individual and groups transcend any terms of service to aggregate and analyze the data from their own social contacts. For example, a traditional social network typically restricts what can be done on the network, but the private network of the invention is not so restricted. While these rights of individuals and groups are host-country specific, generally it is acknowledged that ownership of one's social contacts is one's own right in concert with one's social network's acquiescence In other words, if other people acquiesce to participating in an individual's social network, then an individual has the right to what they agree to. Distributed peer-to-peer functionality and storage of information can be employed, with no central server, thereby ensuring against inappropriate restriction by governments hostile to freedom of speech and association.","Voting by formed subgroups of an individual (all the people who have opted into an individual's or subgroup's private network) can be conducted once an inferred social network has been established. Subgroups of the network can vote to extricate themselves from onerous terms of service that do not sufficiently respect privacy rights, protection of minors, or free expression, for example. These terms of service can be renegotiated by threatening transfer of one's group to another social network. This kind of action has been largely precluded due the complexity of maintaining ones interconnections across multiple traditional social networks. The present invention facilitates such transfers, while maintaining privacy of the social network graph in an open format that enforces privacy through cryptological techniques and conducts agreement\/voting protocols for group decision-making. Whenever people aggregate information, there are consequences to other people, such as their privacy, and cryptological techniques provide a mechanism for protecting privacy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["801","802","805","807","815","855","850","860","810","820"]},"The private social network framework described above can support types of shared content that are meta-traditional-social-network. In particular, there can be games (see ) that span a number of social networks. The games can be designed to engage participants across several social networks simultaneously. The system can cooperatively play games and share content across multiple social networks simultaneously. Other games could pit groups from one social network against another for \u201ctug-of-war\u201d games based on relative strengths of their social connections. In general, a plug-in application framework for the inferred social network can be provided to allow not only games but general applications that work in the inferred social network framework. The apps can be such things as contact management tools to manage contact migration from one traditional social network to another. For example, a particular user could have a friend on LINKEDIN that he thinks would be better suited to a connection on FACEBOOK. The app facilitates management of contact migration across social networks. The user's friend could be added to FACEBOOK and delete from LINKEDIN. The inferred social network maintains all contacts and the network model. Also, relationship networks as described in Serena, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/177,856, supra, can span a number of traditional social networks while being supported by the private social network framework described above. Other types of applications that can be supported by the inferred social network include applications for marketing, barter, auction, or exchange of digital value, applications for suggesting friends or reaching individuals who are not yet participants of social networks.","Thus, the inferred social network supports content extrinsic to traditional social network providers, thereby enhancing the traditional social network experience. The inferred social network also supports concurrent management of multiple traditional social networks, such as, at a minimum, supporting simultaneous conversations across multiple networks and supporting content sharing between platforms. In, addition privacy settings and digital rights management can be set across multiple platforms.","The inferred social network as a stand-alone network will have profile information about the user. That profile information can be added to or deleted from the managed traditional social networks or vested only in the inferred social network. For example, resume information may be posted to LINKEDIN by the inferred social network; however FACEBOOK and GOOGLE+ would not obtain that information.","The inferred social network can be stored either as a distributed system, central server, peer-to-peer system, or hybrid (for example, the peer-to-peer functionality of the inferred social network can be supplemented with centralized servers for ease of computation in early instantiations of network). The specific details of the network storage method and retrieval can be abstracted away though standard data queries that hide the concurrent and distributed logic from application programming interfaces with which the inferred social network interacts. Once the abstracted data structure adequately addresses concurrency, versioning, and shared accesses, the system allows for the standard queries of the traditional social network and advanced queries of the inferred, private social network. The advanced queries allow for spanning multiple social networks and managing interactions across networks. Furthermore, the profile can be searched to obtain friends with shared interests (based on profile information) and to manage friendship placement in and removal from the appropriate traditional social network.","As was mentioned above, the inferred social network can operate as a functional traditional social network, as is shown in . First the inference process defines and aggregates information to form the network (step ). Then, in an iterative process, the network is used as a functional social network (step ). The functionality that is provided by traditional social networks such as GOOGLE+ and FACEBOOK can now be executed. Illustrated in the figure are some elements of the functionality; however, basic functionality as is known to those skilled in the art may be incorporated. For example the inferred social network allows its users to send and receive messages (step ). Further, content can be shared such as photos or video (step ). Both profile and contact information can now be viewed (steps  and ). The inferred social network described above is one example of an application that spans multiple traditional social networks and supports applications, such as games, that also span the multiple traditional social networks. A similar framework can support other types of \u201cspanning\u201d applications, entirely distinct from inferred social networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 14","FIG. 1","FIG. 14"],"b":["11140","11100","11110","11120","11130","11140","11100","11110","11120","11130","11140","11100","11110","11120","11130","11100","11110","11120","11130","11140","11140","3001","3000","3003","13000","13010","13020","13040","13030"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":["12001","12002","12003"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["13000","13010","13020","13040","13000","13010","13020","13030"]},"In particular, social network providers , , and  may or may not provide an API for accessing their information and designing applications that are resident on their network. The API may be of sufficient maturity to allow for standard communication mechanisms. In the absence of direct API procedure calls for communications, however, it is possible to convey information through covert or subliminal channels. The literature known to those skilled in the art provides example methods whereby accessing information such as web links can convey binary values. Once binary values have been conveyed, standard communication mechanisms may be constructed out of the covert channel. A covert channel can be used to write from a read-only API, such as by toggling between multiple read accesses, as is known in the art, and on top of the covert channel it is possible to build communication constructs such as sockets, remote procedure calls, or other communication mechanisms. This practice allows the traditional social network intrinsic API to be expanded to convey additional information. This information will be used as input to the social network spanning application as it performs standard execution on its appurtenant host platforms.  depicts the general operation of a social network spanning application. The application is capable of gathering input data and interacting with the social networks through multiple APIs appurtenant to the social networks (block ). The application also obtains user input into the spanning application (block ). The information is aggregated and the application can run and communicate with multiple social networks through clients, servers and social network APIs (block ). If the intrinsic API of the social network does not support communication with the server or client infrastructure, a covert channel known to those skilled in the art may be used for this purpose. The social networks accessed by the spanning application can conditionally include an inferred social network of the type described above. An example application could be a game, (such as FARMVILLE or any similar social-network-based game), in which players are obtained from multiple social networks. The game communicates messages about the state of the game back to the multiple social network APIs (block ) after computing what changes in state information have occurred. The game can be played across all social networks simultaneously. Yet another example is a spanning application that serves up shared content that is accessible to selected users but stored extrinsically to any one social network, the shared content including items such as photos or conversations, including private photos that only friends share and not held on any one social network. Other examples or spanning applications include: opt-in advertising applications for multiple social networks; personal networking applications, such as business networking applications; gift sending applications; product promotion applications; search Engine promotion applications; applications for identifying, across multiple social networks, who is looking at a user's profile; birthday greeting applications for multiple social networks; applications for ranking connections to a user on multiple social networks; mobile messaging and SMS applications; applications for publishing blogs, media, and other material to multiple social networks; applications for customer interaction on multiple social networks, including targeted advertising applications and customer feedback applications; e-mail list management applications; polling applications; coupon applications; contest applications; appointment scheduling applications; shopping cart applications; and, many other types of applications.","Another example of a spanning application is an application that ensures consistent messaging and conversation state across multiple social networks. As is shown in , such an application manages multiple social networks simultaneously and functions as a meta-interface to the multiple social networks. With the meta-social networking system management interface one can obtain cognizance of content and conversations across multiple social networks. An inferred social network may or may not be included as one of the social networks spanned by the spanning application, and in general this spanning application may either be supported by an inferred social network architecture of the type described above or it may operate wholly independently of any inferred social network architecture. The meta-interface and management system allows for maintenance of private content (e.g., photos, music, video, and other media represented by icons  or, in other examples, the conversation as a whole). Conversations and interactions between users can span multiple social networks, shown in network interfaces  and . The meta-interface displays responses to content shared between networks and maintains the conversation state across the meta-social-networking construct. For example, Alice broadcasts on all networks that she saw a great video (comment ). Bob responds only on traditional social network  that he enjoyed the video to  and posts content (possibly private as described herein) to a shared context extrinsic to all of the traditional networks (media represented by icons ). Eve and Stewart respond on their respective traditional social networks  and  (comments ). And finally, in the conversation Alice and Bob post (not necessarily in tandem) a comment to all networks, possibly inclusive of the inferred network (comment ). Interfaces  and  represent user interface elements to the underlying social networks to enable the user to manage the multiple social networks simultaneously from one meta-social networking program. The multiple social network interfaces may be a graph such as is shown in , albeit links and nodes may be colored with which social network each link or node originated from. This interface shown in  is illustrative and may take other user interface forms known to those skilled in the art of user interface design and social networking programming. Privacy settings and Digital Rights Management for the conversation elucidated in  may be applied by the user or the owner of the content shared. In , the user sends messages from one social network to another user that may be confined to only one social network. For example, in comments , Stewart may only belong to traditional social network  and Eve may only choose to belong to traditional social network . Standard messaging protocols know to those skilled in the art will be applied to facilitate transmission across multiple social networks.","A system has been described whereby individuals can take back ownership of their own social network information by collaboration technically and politically to obtain a picture of the network: \u201cthe inferred social network.\u201d This view of the network is distributed, time-stamped, and versioned so that collaborating individuals can use it as one does a traditional social network with additional functionality as enumerated herein. Advertising and incentives derived from the inferred social network can be purveyed to users and remuneration can be meted out to the appropriate parties. Furthermore, privacy is no longer just a stated property of shared online content; it is protected by known cryptographic protocols and techniques such as those described in the cryptology references cited above. The flow of data in this system can be distributed in such a manner that individuals \u201cown their own\u201d social network and establish connections via inference and behavior as a traditional social network does. In essence, the individuals own their own picture of the social network both legally and technically. Applications can be developed that span multiple social networks, both traditional and inferred social networks. Such spanning applications can be supported by the inferred social network or can function independently of an inferred social network. The inferred social network infrastructure can be supported by all forms of advertising or direct subscription. While nothing herein should preclude the operation of the inferred social network as a traditional social network, the invention is not just social network analysis; it is social network analysis to establish a useable inferred social network or equivalently meta-social-network interface with added features, as well as spanning applications that work across multiple social networks.","While several particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications and combinations of the invention detailed in the text and drawings can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
