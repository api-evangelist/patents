{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Consumer adoption of mobile devices, such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, pagers, personal digital assistants, and the like, is increasing. These devices can be used for a diversity of purposes ranging from basic communications, to establishing business transactions, to managing entertainment media, as well as a host of other tasks. Moreover, such mobile devices possess the capability to establish communication sessions using different technologies. That is, the mobile devices typically include circuitry to operate in a cellular network as well as circuitry to establish communications over a wireless data network. Unfortunately, existing approaches fail to effectively integrate the differing technologies.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for better integration of telecommunications technologies and services.","An apparatus, method and software for providing call failover to a packetized voice session are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Although the various embodiments are described with respect to the Internet Protocol (IP) based voice sessions and WiFi services, it is contemplated that these embodiments have applicability to other communication protocols and telecommunication services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","101","103","101","101","100","103","105","105","10","105","101","100"]},"With the advent of the Internet, an increasing number of individuals have been migrating from the use of traditional communication based technologies to synergistic multimedia platforms. The popularity and convenience of the Internet has resulted in the reinvention of traditional telephony services. These services are offered over a packet switched network with minimal or no cost to the users. IP (Internet Protocol) telephony, thus, have found significant success, particularly in the long distance market. In general, IP telephony, which is also referred to as Voice-over-IP (VoIP), is the conversion of voice information into data packets that are transmitted over an IP network. Users, such as including enterprises, also have turned to IP telephony as a matter of convenience in that both voice and data services are accessible through a single piece of equipment. The continual integration of voice and data services further fuels this demand for IP telephony applications.","Under the scenario of , mobile devices  and  are configured to communicate using mobile network  and wireless data network . The mobile devices  and  are illustrated as mobile (cellular) telephones, but may alternatively be other kinds of portable devices, such as personal digital assistants or communicators. It is also contemplated that the mobile devices  and  may support any type of interface for executing the failover procedure. In addition, mobile devices  and  may facilitate various input means for receiving and generating information, including touch screen capability, keyboard and keypad data entry, voice-based input mechanisms, accelerometer (e.g., shaking the mobile device  and ), and the like. Any known and future implementations of mobile devices  and  are applicable. It is noted that, in certain embodiments, the mobile devices  and  may be configured to establish peer-to-peer communication sessions with each other using a variety of technologies\u2014i.e., near field communication (NFC), BLUETOOTH, infrared, etc.","Mobile network  can be a wireless access and transport network, such as a cellular (2G, 3G, 4G, or above), 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, or satellite network; and may employ various mobile communication technologies including, for example, in cellular networks, global system for mobile communications\/universal mobile telecommunication system (GSM\/UMTS) technologies (i.e., 3GPP technologies) and code division multiple access (cdmaOne\/CDMA2000) technologies (i.e., 3GPP2 technologies). In certain embodiments, wireless data network  can be a local area network (LAN), which utilizes WiFi technology. The LAN may utilize the dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign \u201cprivate\u201d DHCP internet protocol (IP) addresses to mobile device  as well computing device . It is contemplated that device  can be configured to execute a \u201csoft\u201d phone to establish voice communication sessions with other devices, e.g., mobile devices  and .","Alternatively, network  can be a metropolitan area network (MAN), or a wide area network (WAN) that interfaces other systems and\/or networks; e.g., the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, as well as a circuit switched telephony network \u2014for example, a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Thus, voice station  is reachable by the various user devices , , and .","When a caller places a voice call to a called party, the mobile network  maintains the call until one of the parties seek to terminate the communication. However, in certain scenarios, due to poor signal strength, the call may fail. From the users' perspective, call failure is highly undesirable, especially when the call is urgent or of some import. Traditionally, the users need to resort to manually re-establishing the call; such process can be rather burdensome and inefficient (in terms of time and use of network resources). For example, each party (not knowing the true case of the failed call) may concurrently attempt to call the other party at around the same period. Such uncoordinated attempts may result in each party simply defaulting into each other's respective voice mails (as the network would detect a busy signal). This reconnection process is particularly distracting if one or both of the parties are operating a vehicle. Hence, the failover service of system  addresses this issue by anticipating the call failure and appropriately initiating a call failover procedure that fully leverages the capabilities of the mobile device and network resources.","As shown, to enable the failover service, each of the participating devices (e.g., devices , , and ) may include a call failover application (e.g., applications , , and ). Depending on the particular service deployment, the call failover applications , , and  can be standalone applications that do not require network interaction or \u201cthinner\u201d applications whereby the main functions reside within the network.","Under the scenario of , mobile device  can establish a cellular voice call  with voice station  over the mobile network  and PSTN . During the course of the voice session , mobile device  begins to experience a weak signal condition such that the voice session can no longer be sustained. For example, when the mobile device  enters an area that is likely to result in dropping of the call\u2014e.g., a tunnel, a building, remote area with sparse coverage, etc., call failover application  can monitor the drop in signal strength below a predetermined threshold and initiate a call failover procedure. These call failover applications  and  can directly interact to execute the failover procedure, and\/or involve the wireless call failover platform to employ certain network functions. With the impending failure of the cellular call, mobile device  and the voice station  can coordinate to establish an independent voice session  over the wireless data network , while placing the cellular call \u201con hold\u201d or otherwise suspending the call until the call is lost.","By way of example, the packetized voice session is established using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). A detailed discussion of SIP and its call control services are described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 2543, entitled \u201cSIP: Session Initiation Protocol\u201d; RFC 3515, entitled \u201cThe Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Refer Method\u201d; RFC 3261, entitled \u201cSIP: Session Initiation Protocol\u201d; and RFC 3725, entitled \u201cBest Current Practices for Third Party Call Control (3 pcc) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)\u201d; all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. SIP is used to create and terminate voice calls over a data network (e.g., network ). However, it is understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would realize that the H.323 protocol and similar protocols can be utilized in lieu of SIP. The H.323 protocol, which is promulgated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), specifies a suite of protocols for multimedia communication. SIP is a signaling protocol that is based on a client-server model. It should be noted that both the H.323 protocol and SIP are not limited to IP telephony applications, but have applicability to multimedia services in general.","Since SIP can be used for signaling, a media session transported using schemes such as RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol)\/UDP (User Datagram Protocol), RTP\/TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), RTP\/SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), and AAL (ATM Adaptation Layer)\/ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) among many others; this service allows calling between schemes in an efficient way.","Other call scenarios exist, e.g., whereby mobile device  engages in a cellular call  with another mobile device  (as seen in ). Here, mobile device  has connectivity to a wireless data network  that is separate and distinct from the wireless data network . In a mobile device to mobile device situation, the call failover applications  and  can independently monitor for signal degradation for the respective devices  and . Upon determining unacceptable signal strength by either one of the mobile devices  and , the corresponding device can initiate the failover procedure to establish a voice call over the networks  and .","In one embodiment, computing device  may be associated with a user of mobile device  and can interface wireless call failover platform  to access functions and settings of the platform  with respect to the failover service. According to certain embodiments, the computing device  may utilize a graphical user interface (GUI), such as a browser application or any web-based application, to input and update settings and configurations for the user's particular device through the web browser. Alternatively, the configuration can be performed by the communication device itself.","Although the failover service is described with respect to switching over from a cellular call maintained by mobile network  to a packetized voice call over wireless network , it is contemplated that the failover can occur from the packetized voice call to the cellular call.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["107","109"]},"In step , either the mobile device  or device  detects a signal degradation or failure on cellular link established over mobile network . As mentioned, the detection can be based on a variety of factors and parameters to measure and predict an impending signal failure. For example, reception strength can readily be measured and compared to a minimal strength threshold value to trigger the failover process. In addition or in the alternative, the mobile devices  and  can utilize other information to predict call failover; for example, location information (e.g., obtained through a Global Positioning System (GPS)) can indicate a known poor reception area. Also, weather or environmental information may be factored in for processing by the detection mechanism (as executed by the particular call failover application). In this example, it is assumed that mobile device  detects that it is within a building with poor reception. Once the signal failure is detected by device , as in step , the device  determines whether a wireless connection is available. For instance, mobile device , which in this example includes wireless networking circuitry, can detect presence of wireless data network , thereby availing the user of the option of failing over to a voice session established over the wireless data network . If the failover service is part of a managed service operated by a service provider, according to certain embodiments, wireless call failover platform  can facilitate the authentication of the subscribers of the service as well as managing the distribution of the call failover applications ,  and . In one embodiment, the detection of the degraded signal can be analyzed at the failover platform , which can collect data relating to environmental conditions and location-based information, etc., in addition to signal measurements from the mobile device . In one embodiment, wireless call failover platform  can assist with signaling to the other participant device  about the impending call failure; e.g., by sending an alert to the call failover application  for presentation to the user.","In step , once a wireless data connection is detected, the cellular call can be disconnected, and the call failover application  can concurrently activate a packetized voice call application (e.g., VoIP call). In one embodiment, the packetized voice call application can be a separate application; alternatively, such application can be native or integrated with the call failover application . In step , the cellular call now effectively passes over to a VoIP call using a wireless connection supported, in part, by network . The VoIP call can transverse various networks, e.g., the global Internet, to ultimately reach wireless data network  that serves mobile device .","According to certain embodiments, the establishment of the connection may be signaled to the user of mobile device  using a variety of notification mechanisms, for example, a short message or an audible and\/or visual indicator (e.g., ring to the caller and a beep tone to the called party) indicating that the call will be terminated due to a signal problem and that a failover to a VoIP call has been initiated. Once the new connection is up, the mobile devices  and  remain in communication until the users end the call.","As an option, the call failover application  may monitor signal strength on the wireless data network  and revert back to the cellular network  to continue communicating (assuming the cellular connection can be sustained). Consequently, per step , mobile device  may selectively re-establish the cellular call if the packetized voice call over network  fails\u2014e.g., wireless data coverage is exceeded.","Continuing with the example of , the failover process from the perspective of the user interface is provided, according to one embodiment. Under the scenario of , it is assumed the mobile devices  and  have established a cellular call over a cellular link or connection. In step , the user is presented with a notification of unstable signal strength by mobile device , for instance. The process then involves generating and providing a prompt to the user to launch call failover application , as in step . In one embodiment, the user may decline to have the call failover. Alternatively, the user may provide an input to invoke the call failover application (per step ). At this junction, the cellular call may be placed on hold (or effectively be terminated), as in step . In one embodiment, during this period, the other party may receive some form of notification (e.g., visual and\/or audible indicator) that the call failover procedure is in progress. By way of example, this notification can be signaled directly by call failover application , or in conjunction with platform . Next, the other device (e.g., mobile device ) is also notified of the failover of the cellular call to the VoIP call, per step . In this manner, the user of mobile device  can be prepared to accept the call by another means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 6 and 7"],"b":["300","100","300","301","303","305","307","300"]},"According to exemplary embodiments, user interface  may include one or more displays , keypads , microphones , and\/or speakers . Display  provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that permits a user of mobile device  to view dialed digits, call status, menu options, and other service information. The GUI may include icons and menus, as well as other text and symbols. Keypad  includes an alphanumeric keypad and may represent other input controls, such as one or more button controls, dials, joysticks, touch panels, etc. The user thus can construct user profiles, enter commands, initialize applications, input remote addresses, select options from menu systems, and the like. Microphone  coverts spoken utterances of a user (or other auditory sounds, e.g., environmental sounds) into electronic audio signals, whereas speaker  converts audio signals into audible sounds.","Communications circuitry  may include audio processing circuitry , controller , location module  (such as a GPS receiver) coupled to antenna , memory , messaging module , multiple transceivers  coupled to antenna , and wireless controller  coupled to antenna . The transceivers , according to certain embodiments, employ differing technologies\u2014e.g., cellular communications and wireless data communications (e.g., WiFi). Memory  may represent a hierarchy of memory, which may include both random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). Computer program instructions and corresponding data for operation can be stored in non-volatile memory, such as erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and\/or flash memory. Memory  may be implemented as one or more discrete devices, stacked devices, or integrated with controller . Memory  may store information, such as one or more user profiles, one or more user defined policies, one or more contact lists, personal information, sensitive information, work related information, etc.","Additionally, it is contemplated that mobile device  may also include one or more applications and, thereby, may store (via memory ) data associated with these applications for providing users with the call failover functions, browsing functions, business functions, calendar functions, communication functions, contact managing functions, data editing (e.g., database, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.) functions, financial functions, gaming functions, imaging functions, messaging (e.g., electronic mail, IM, MMS, SMS, etc.) functions, multimedia functions, service functions, storage functions, synchronization functions, task managing functions, querying functions, and the like. As such, control signals received by mobile device  from, for example, platform  may be utilized by API(s)  and\/or controller  to facilitate remotely configuring, modifying, and\/or utilizing one or more features, options, settings, etc., of these applications. It is also contemplated that these (or other) control signals may be utilized by controller  to facilitate remotely backing up and\/or erasing data associated with these applications. In other instances, the control signals may cause mobile device  to become completely or partially deactivated or otherwise inoperable.","Accordingly, controller  controls the operation of mobile station , such as in response to commands received from API(s)  and\/or data stored to memory . Control functions may be implemented in a single controller or via multiple controllers. Suitable controllers  may include, for example, both general purpose and special purpose controllers and digital signal processors. Controller  may interface with audio processing circuitry , which provides basic analog output signals to speaker  and receives analog audio inputs from microphone . In exemplary embodiments, controller  may be controlled by API(s)  in order to capture signals from camera  or microphone  in response to control signals received from platform . In other instances, controller  may be controlled by API(s)  to cause location module  to determine spatial positioning information corresponding to a location of mobile device . Still further, controller  may be controlled by API(s)  to image (e.g., backup) and\/or erase memory , to configure (or reconfigure) functions of mobile device , to track and generate device usage logs, or to terminate services available to mobile device . It is noted that captured signals, device usage logs, memory images, spatial positioning information, and the like, may be transmitted to platform  via transceiver  and\/or wireless controller . In this manner, the captured signals and\/or other forms of information may be presented to users and stored to one or more networked storage locations, such as user profiles repository (not shown), or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components and facilities of system .","It is noted that real time spatial positioning information may be obtained or determined via location module  using, for instance, satellite positioning system technology, such as GPS technology. In this way, location module  can behave as (or substantially similar to) a GPS receiver. Thus, mobile device  employs location module  to communicate with a constellation of satellites. These satellites transmit very low power interference and jamming resistant signals received by GPS receivers  via, for example, antennas . At any point on Earth, GPS receiver  can receive signals from multiple satellites, such as six to eleven. Specifically, GPS receiver  may determine three-dimensional geolocation (or spatial positioning information) from signals obtained from multiple satellites. Measurements from strategically positioned satellite tracking and monitoring stations are incorporated into orbital models for each satellite to compute precise orbital or clock data. Accordingly, GPS signals may be transmitted over two spread spectrum microwave carrier signals that can be shared by GPS satellites. Thus, if mobile device  is able to identify signals from the satellites, receivers  may decode the ephemeris and clock data, determine the pseudo range for each satellite and, thereby, compute the spatial positioning of a receiving antenna . With GPS technology, mobile device  can determine its spatial position with great accuracy and convenience. It is contemplated, however, that location module  may utilize one or more other location determination technologies, such as advanced forward link triangulation (AFLT), angle of arrival (AOA), assisted GPS (A-GPS), cell identification (cell ID), observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA), enhanced observed time of difference (E-OTD), enhanced forward link trilateration (EFLT), network multipath analysis, and the like.","Mobile device  also includes messaging module  that is configured to receive, transmit, and\/or process messages (e.g., EMS messages, SMS messages, MMS messages, IM messages, electronic mail messages, and\/or any other suitable message) received from (or transmitted to) platform  or any other suitable component or facility of system . As previously mentioned, platform  may transmit control singles to mobile device  in the form of one or more API  directed messages, e.g., one or more BREW directed SMS messages. As such, messaging module  may be configured to identify such messages, as well as activate API(s) , in response thereto. Furthermore, messaging module  may be further configured to parse control signals from these messages and, thereby, port parsed control signals to corresponding components of mobile device , such as API(s) , controller , location module , memory , transceiver , wireless controller , etc., for implementation.","According to exemplary embodiments, API(s)  (once activated) is configured to effectuate the implementation of the control signals received from platform  or from call failover applications resident in other devices. It is noted that the control signals are utilized by API(s)  to, for instance, remotely control, configure, monitor, track, and\/or capture signals from (or related to) camera , communications circuitry , and\/or user interface . In this manner, visual and\/or acoustic indicia pertaining to an environment surrounding mobile device  may captured by API(s)  controlling camera  and microphone . Other control signals to cause mobile device  to determine spatial positioning information, to image and\/or erase memory , to configure (or reconfigure) functions, to track and generate device usage logs, or to terminate services, may also be carried out via API(s) . As such, one or more signals captured from camera  or microphone , or device usage logs, memory images, spatial positioning information, etc., may be transmitted to platform  via transceivers  and\/or wireless controller , in response to corresponding control signals provided to transceivers  and\/or wireless controller  by API(s) . Thus, captured signals and\/or one or more other forms of information provided to platform  may be presented to users and\/or stored to one or more of user profiles repository, or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components and facilities of system .","It is also noted that mobile device  can be equipped with wireless controller  to communicate with a wireless headset (not shown) or other wireless network. The headset can employ any number of standard radio technologies to communicate with wireless controller ; for example, the headset can be BLUETOOTH enabled. It is contemplated that other equivalent short range radio technology and protocols can be utilized. While mobile device  has been described in accordance with the depicted embodiment of , it is contemplated that mobile device  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"b":["105","105","401","403","405","407","409","411"]},"The controller  may execute at least one algorithm relating to functions of the wireless call failover platform . For example, the controller  may interact with the session module  to monitor signal levels of registered mobile devices (e.g., devices  and ) for triggering of the call failover as described above with respect to . If, for instance, a signal failure in a communication session over cellular occurs, the session module  will detect the impending signal failure on the cellular link (or alternatively on the wireless data link); this detection may be aided by actual measurement information from the particular mobile device. The session module  may, for example, store data relating to the establishment and termination of the cellular call and the VoIP call for the purpose of billing.","Also, the session module  may operate with the account manager  to determine whether the mobile devices are indeed valid subscribers to the call failover service. User account information, along with user preference information for the service, may be stored in a user account database ; such information may include the user's telephone number assigned to the particular mobile device, device identifier associated with the mobile device, etc. If, for instance, the account manager  determines that the user is a registered user, the account manager  may cause the session module  to complete the wireless call failover process. On the other hand, the session module  may not initiate completion of the wireless call failover process, instead if the user (of the receiving device) is not a subscriber to the call failover service, the account manager  may generate a prompt to offer a subscription to such user.","The controller  may further utilize the communication interface  to communicate with other components of the system . The communication interface  may include multiple means of communication. For example, the communication interface  may be able to communicate over short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), internet protocol, instant messaging, voice sessions (e.g., via a phone network), email, or other types of communication. According to one embodiment, such methods may be used to transmit messages or alerts to inform users of information relating to the failure of the communication session. These messages or alerts can then be utilized by the respective user devices (e.g., mobile devices  and , voice station , etc.) to generate notification messages including such information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A"],"b":["501","503","505","507","507","505","507"]},"In another scenario, if the mobile device  cannot detect a wireless network, a message box  may be presented to notify the user to attempt the call when either the cellular signal level improves or the WiFi connection is detected. Consequently, message box  can state the following: \u201cCell connection is about to fail. No WiFi detected. Please try again when signal level improves or WiFi is detected.\u201d In other of the scenarios, an audio indicator may be provided as well\u2014e.g., a beeping tone or a user specified sound.","The GUI of  are from the perspective of the calling device (e.g., mobile device  of the scenario of ), while  provides an exemplary GUI for the receiving mobile device (e.g., device ). In the example of , mobile device (e.g., device ) can receive a notification that alerts the called party that the originating mobile device  has experienced a signal failure and that a VoIP call is being established over a WiFi connection. Accordingly, a message box  is provided as follows: \u201cWARNING: Failover procedure initiated by caller. Accept call over WiFi?\u201d At this point, the user may elect to continue the conversation with the calling party over a different voice session without anyone of the parties having to manually establish the VoIP call. Advantageously, such arrangement improves the user experience, while providing a new source of revenue for service providers. Moreover, system resources are not unnecessarily expended to re-establish the cellular call.","The processes described herein for providing a call failover procedure may be implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof.

For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","700","700","700","700"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","In one embodiment, the chip set or chip  includes merely one or more processors and some software and\/or firmware supporting and\/or relating to and\/or for the one or more processors.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus .
