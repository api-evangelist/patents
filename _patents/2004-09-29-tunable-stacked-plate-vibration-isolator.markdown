Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to vibration isolators, and more particularly to a tunable stacked metal plate vibration isolator used for damping vibrations in an electrical device.","2. Description of the Related Art","Within this application several publications are referenced by Arabic numerals within brackets. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all these publications in their entireties are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application for the purposes of indicating the background of the invention and illustrating the general state of the art.","Generally, vibration isolation optimization involves reducing the magnitudes of acceleration transmitted from moving components of devices, machines, structural systems, mountings, etc. to supporting devices, structures, and foundations, etc. Similarly, vibration isolation optimization involves reducing the support motion transmitted to instruments, equipment, or peripheral devices of an overall system. When the forces generated by moving components of a system are transmitted to other components (instruments, etc.) in the system, undesirable vibrations are often generated in the entire system, wherein instruments and equipment can malfunction and suffer extreme damage through failure if not properly isolated from the vibration source. Usually, vibration isolators use elastic material such as cork, rubber, urethane, or neoprene to provide damping to the system.","The electronic components in an artillery shell are often subjected to significant vibrational energy, which causes deleterious effects on the electronic component itself and attached elements. In order to reduce the vibration level experienced by the electronic component, damping mechanisms which isolate the vibrational energy are used. There are many forms and varieties of conventional vibration isolators. However, these conventional devices are not easily tunable without additional machining and, in fact, often require complex machining. Moreover, many of these conventional devices use elastomers. Unfortunately, the use of elastomers introduces significant temperature dependence for efficient performance. Such extreme temperature requirements often result in degradation of the vibration isolator when operated over a wide temperature range or of the electronic component itself.","Therefore, due to the limitations of the conventional vibration isolator devices and processes, there remains a need for a novel vibration isolator device, which does not use elastomers, is compactly sized, and is easily tunable, and which provides proper vibration isolation to an attached device.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides an apparatus for reducing vibrations in a device, wherein the apparatus comprises a plurality of stacked metal plates, wherein the stacked metal plates move frictionally opposed to one another upon excitation of the device, and wherein movement of the stacked metal plates produces damping of the vibrations. The apparatus further comprises a clamp retaining the stacked metal plates, wherein the clamp adjusts a force holding the stacked metal plates together, and wherein the clamp controls an amount of friction produced by the movement of the stacked metal plates. Also, the surfaces of the stacked metal plates comprise a machined surface finish, wherein the machined surface finish and choice of plate material controls the amount of friction produced by the movement of the stacked metal plates. Moreover, the stacked metal plates are dimensioned and configured to generate a specific frequency response to the input vibration. The apparatus further comprises a retaining means attaching an outer edge of the stacked metal plates to a peripheral support and a retaining mechanism attaching an inner edge of the stacked metal plates to the device. In one embodiment, the metal plates further comprise a central opening for receiving the device.","In another embodiment, the invention provides an apparatus for reducing vibrations in an electrical component of an artillery shell, the apparatus comprising a stack of metal plates, wherein the metal plates move frictionally opposed to one another upon vibration excitation of the artillery shell, and wherein movement of the metal plates causes damping of the vibrations.","Furthermore, in another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing vibrations in an electrical component of an artillery shell, wherein the method comprises stacking a plurality of metal plates, attaching the metal plates to the electrical component, creating vibrations in the artillery shell, and damping the vibrations transmitted to a mounted electronic component by moving the metal plates frictionally opposed to one another. Additionally, the method further comprises retaining the metal plates using a clamp, adjusting a force holding the metal plates together using the clamp, controlling an amount of friction produced by movement of the metal plates using the clamp, and controlling an amount of friction produced by movement of the metal plates using the choice of plate material and a machined surface finish on the surfaces of the metal plates, wherein the metal plates are dimensioned and configured to generate a specific frequency response to the input vibration.","There are several advantages achieved by the novel aspects of the invention. Specifically, the advantages of the invention include, but are not limited to, the invention's complete reliance on metal components without the use of elastomers, its compact size, and its tunability. The invention is tuned by adjusting the relationship between parts by varying the torque on the clamp screws, which are part of the retaining mechanism. Moreover, the multi-functionality of the invention is also advantageous, because while a preferred embodiment of the invention is to implement a vibration isolator for use in reducing vibrations in an electrical component in an artillery shell, the invention may also be used for the vibrational isolation of any component in a high frequency vibration environment. Other high frequency environments include, but are not limited to, vehicle ballistic shock, armored vehicle main gun firing, vehicle subjected to mine blast, payload during spacecraft launch, item dropped on a hard floor, and payload in any sort of vehicle.","Furthermore, the invention uses friction from interplate plate shearing as the vibration energy absorbing means instead of using conventional elastomers, which can suffer from performance limitations. Moreover, the system provided by the invention can be configured for a wide range of natural frequencies, which allows it to be useful in a wide range of applications. Additionally, according to the invention the isolator may prove useful in any high acceleration, high frequency vibration environment.","These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.","The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for a novel vibration isolator device, which does not use elastomers, is compactly sized, and is easily tunable. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 through 5","FIGS. 2"],"b":["10","20","10","30","30","50","30","10","40","30","40","30","40","30","40","41","43","41","42","30","20","42","41","30","20","3","5","30","20"]},"Also, the surfaces of the stacked metal plates  comprise a machined surface finish, wherein the machined surface finish as well as the choice of plate material, controls an amount of friction produced by the movement of the stacked metal plates . Preferably, the plates  comprise aluminum. However, other metals known to achieve machined surfaced finishes may also be used in accordance with the invention. Moreover, the stacked metal plates  are dimensioned and configured to control a frequency response of the damping of the vibrations. Manners of achieving a machined surface finish are well known in the art. However, with respect to the machined surface finish of the metal plates  provided by the invention, a rougher finish would result in more friction and more shearing. However, this is simply a parameter that can be varied to further tune the device. As such, it is possible to use alternating metals, to take advantage of the different coefficients of friction of different metals such as of brass, copper, steel, etc.","Essentially, the vibration isolator  comprises two parts: the stack of metal plates  and the retaining clamp . According to an embodiment of , three plates may be used. However, the optimal number of plates is determined by the mass of the component to be isolated, the desired frequency response, and the expected vibration loading. As such, there is not a limit to the number or thickness of the plate as long as they support the required load.","In the  example of a system, which may implement the vibration isolator  of the invention includes an electronic component , two peripheral supports  used for holding an outer edge of the stack of metal plates  and for introducing vibrations, a retaining means  used for retaining an outer edge of the stack of metal plates  to the support , and a retaining mechanism  used for retaining a central or inner edge of the stack of metal plates  to the electronic component (device) . These are all parts of the system into which the vibration isolator  fits. The retaining mechanism  generally comprises a securing mechanism , such as a screw or bolt, a receiving mechanism  for receiving the securing mechanism , and a securing clip  circumferentially arranged on the electronic component , which is then configured on the uppermost metal plate , and which surrounds the device . The securing clip  includes apertures arranged therein for accepting the securing mechanism .","The number of plates , thickness, and clamping force are variable to impart different isolation parameters. Due loads applied to the system, the support  may vibrate up and down while the electronic component  remains still. As the peripheral support  vibrates, the layered plates  shear between each other to dampen the vibration energy as it propagates to the electronic component . As the metal plates  shear with the surface portions of the plates rubbing against each other, the vibrational energy in the support  dissipates into heat generated by the friction between the shearing plates . The clamp  is used to adjust the force holding the plates  together, and thus the clamp  controls the amount of friction between the plates . For example, the applied torque on the clamping mechanism  may range from 5 in-lb to 20 in-lb.","Another embodiment of the peripheral support may include a full circumferential support as illustrated in . In this configuration, the supports  and , completely encircle the plates . This support provides additional support to the electronic component  in high acceleration environments as will providing more efficient damping between plates .","The number of plates  and the thickness of each plate  can be varied to allow for different isolation parameters such as the maximum displacement and natural frequency. Preferably, the stacked plates  should be capable of supporting the electronic component  when subjected to the operating environment without failure. Moreover, the plates  should also not allow the electronic component  to be displaced beyond a design limit (which depends on the application of use), otherwise connecting mechanisms, such as cables will stretch and break.","The natural frequency is a critical design parameter of any vibration isolation system. In fact, the component being isolated will inevitably suffer failure if it is subject to vibrations beyond its designed amplitude and frequency. As such, the invention addresses and solves these concerns with the novel use of the stacked plates  in order isolate the vibrations.","In another embodiment illustrated in the flow diagram of , the invention provides a method for reducing vibrations in an electrical component  of a device such as an artillery shell, wherein the method comprises stacking  a plurality of metal plates , attaching  the metal plates  to the electrical component , creating  vibrations in the device , and damping  the vibrations by moving the metal plates  so that they are frictionally opposed to one another. The method further comprises retaining  the metal plates  using a clamp , adjusting  a force holding the metal plates  together using the clamp , controlling  an amount of friction produced by movement of the metal plates  using the clamp , and controlling  an amount of friction produced by movement of the metal plates  using a machined surface finish on the surfaces of the metal plates , wherein the metal plates  are dimensioned and configured to control a frequency response of the isolator.","Experimental tests were conducted to test damping effects of a vibration isolator according to the invention. The results of the experiment indicates that varying the number of plates changes only the stiffness of the isolator (and thus its resonant frequency), but does not affect how rapidly energy is absorbed. Additionally, varying the friction coefficient between plates changes the rate of energy dissipation, but has negligible effect on the stiffness. These relationships are important when tuning an isolator for a specific application, such as the applications described below.","The advantages of the invention are several. These include, but are not limited to, the reliance on metal components without the use of elastomers, its compact size, and its tunability. The apparatus  is tuned (tunability) by adjusting the relationship between the various components of the apparatus by varying the torque on the clamp screws . Moreover, the multi-functionality of the invention is also advantageous, because while a preferred embodiment of the invention is to implement a vibration isolator  for use in reducing vibrations in an electrical component  in an artillery shell, the invention may also be used for the vibrational isolation of any component in a high frequency vibration environment. Other high frequency environments include, but are not limited to, vehicle ballistic shock, armored vehicle main gun firing, vehicle subjected to mine blast, payload during spacecraft launch, item dropped on a hard floor, and payload in any sort of vehicle.","Furthermore, the invention uses friction from interplate plate shearing as a vibration energy absorbing means instead of using elastomers, which can suffer from performance limitations. Moreover, the system provided by the invention can be configured for a wide range of natural frequencies, which allows it to be useful in a wide range of applications. Additionally, according to the invention the isolator may prove useful in any high acceleration, high frequency vibration environment.","The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily modify and\/or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept, and, therefore, such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments.
