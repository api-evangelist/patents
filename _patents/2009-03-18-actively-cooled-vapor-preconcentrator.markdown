{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application was made with Government assistance under National Institutes of Hometown Security Grant No. GB051411. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to the field of analyte collection. The invention particularly may be useful, for example, in analyte detection and analysis systems and methods, as might be used for the collection, detection, and analysis of a wide range of vapors or gases, particulate, and liquid bound analytes. Another field of the invention is analyte storage and delivery. Embodiments of the invention may be useful, for example, to store and deliver hazardous materials, including explosive related materials, toxic industrial chemicals (TICS), or chemical or biological agents or toxins in a controlled manner.","In many analytical systems, discovering the nature of an unknown substance requires the substance to first be collected. There are detector systems that analyze a fluid flow analyte stream, e.g., vapors or gases, particulates, and liquid bound analytes. Some detector systems are based, for example, on an optical analysis that determines analyte characteristics by subjecting a quantity of the analyte to a light beam and measuring the scattering or fluorescence effects. Spectroscopic detector systems, for example, are sometimes based upon the optical effects produced by analyte samples. There are both quantitative and qualitative analysis detector systems.","Before a sample may be analyzed by spectroscopic or many other types of analytical techniques, the sample must be collected and then delivered to a detector system. Many samples of interest are available outside of a controlled setting. One important use for analyte analysis is for safety testing environments that humans occupy. There is a heightened awareness in modern times of the potential for the intentional detonation of explosives or release of chemical or biological agents into environments occupied by humans. For example, environments might include open or enclosed spaces in work environments, public environments, military environments, etc. Many building environments with ducted HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) have the potential for the intentional release of TICS or chemical and biological agents into closed or open spaces occupied by military or civilian personnel. Manufacturing operations also have the potential to permit the escape of hazardous chemicals or biological agents into a manufacturing environment or to an external environment surrounding a manufacturing plant.","In some situations, detection may be desirable in a matter of seconds, but in others, an extended period of time may be used for collection before performing an analysis. An example of the latter case involves workers that may be exposed over a time period to unacceptable levels of harmful agents. Another example of the latter case is when cargo containers are transported from country to country by sea, in which case it may be desirable to collect a sample over a period of several days prior to analysis.","In uncontrolled settings and controlled settings, analytical resolution and the sensitivity of detection are dependent upon the efficiency of analyte collection and the efficacy of delivery of collected analyte to a detection system. It is desirable, for example, to detect very low levels of toxic or hazardous materials in a particular environment. Gas chromatography and other analytical techniques can employ a variety of detector types, and have been demonstrated to be very sensitive analysis methods, among other benefits. Another analytical technique employs a chemresistor based device, which uses a detector whose resistivity changes when it is exposed to particular chemical vapors. Whatever the type of detector system, however, concentrating analyte in a stage prior to the detector system can improve detection limits for the analyte(s) of interest, and can also provide a more reliable quantitative or qualitative determination of an analyte.","Constructing a portable field instrument for collection, storage, concentration, and possibly on-site analysis also presents challenges. Compactness is an important factor to provide an instrument that is useful in the field, but one that competes with other design constraints in the case of a portable field instrument. Among other important factors are the sensitivity discussed above, the time scale required to collect and analyze a sample (preferably short), the amount of fluid flow that may be achieved (limited by tolerable pressure drops and pump capacity) while maintaining good analyte-sorbent material interaction, and the amenability of a device's collection hardware to be integrated with other parts of a field instrument. Low weight, durability, and low electrical power consumption are also desirable qualities for prolonged field use.","It can be difficult to collect a sufficient amount of analyte in particular environmental conditions, such as in ambient surroundings having higher temperatures. For example, if a gas stream is warmer, it may interfere with the efficacy of the analyte collection system. On the other hand, cooling the sorbent material may help to reduce analyte bleed during a collection period. However, providing cooling for a collection device while also allowing for portability, ease of manufacture and use, and relatively low power consumption provides several challenges.","Embodiments of the present invention provide, among other things, an analyte collection system. An example analyte collection device includes a microscale plate having an active area that includes a plurality of perforations extending therethrough. The plurality of perforations are arranged to permit passage of an analyte fluid flow through the microscale plate. A heating element is provided for heating the active area, and a thermal distribution layer is disposed over at least a portion of the active area. For cooling the active area at or below an ambient temperature, an active cooler is provided.","An analyte collection system having a plurality of preconcentrator chips is also provided according to embodiments of the present invention. According to other embodiments of the invention, a self-contained micro analytical system is provided having a large volume preconcentrator, an analyte collection device, a detector system, a power source, and a controller. Methods for concentrating an analyte from an analyte fluid flow and delivering the analyte are also provided herein.","Generally, embodiments of the invention provide, among other things, apparatuses and systems for collecting trace vapors from an analyte, such as explosives, chemical agents, and other materials, to concentrate the analyte for subsequent delivery to a detector. Analyte collection systems including a preconcentrator are also provided according to embodiments of the invention.","In exemplary embodiments, an analyte collection device in the form of an actively cooled vapor preconcentrator is provided herein. An example analyte collection device has at least one flow-through microscale plate. This plate, which may be in certain embodiments a sorbent plate, is configured and arranged to collect analyte and deliver a concentrated pulse of analyte, preferably to a detector system, upon demand through heating. The microscale plate includes an active area that has a plurality of perforations (through holes) extending therethrough. During analyte collection, analyte fluid flow, such as analyte vapor, is permitted through the microscale plate. Fluid flow for a collection period is generally perpendicular to the active surface of the microscale plate. Excellent interaction may be achieved between the analyte fluid flow and a sorbent coating on the active surface.","An active heater, such as but not limited to a heating element, is provided to heat the active area quickly during desorption for delivery of the analyte. Preferred embodiment plates include an integrated heater trace (such as a metal resistive trace) as an active heater. Preferably, the active heater is disposed over the surface of the microscale plate and is thermally insulated for allowing quick heating of the active area. For example, the active heater may be disposed on a thermal insulating layer that is formed on the surface of the microscale plate, over the active area.","To improve collection, an active cooler, for example, embodied in a cooling element, is provided for cooling the active area below ambient temperature. The active cooler preferably is in thermal communication with the microscale plate, and more preferably is in thermal communication with a thermal distribution layer disposed over at least a portion of the active area. The thermal distribution layer may be, for example, a layer of weak thermally conductive material. Various embodiments are possible for the active cooler.","The thermal distribution layer, and thus the active area, is cooled by operation of the active cooler during the collection period, whereas the active area is quickly heated via the active heater during adsorption period. Providing a thermally insulated heater with a thermal distribution layer allows the thermal distribution layer to stay cool while collecting analyte from a warmer gas stream. The temperature difference between the collection region (the active surface of the microscale plate) and the impinging gas is a function of the thermal power transferred between them. On the other hand, the ability to generate large amounts of thermal energy via the thermally insulated active heater allows the active area to be rapidly heated to produce a sharp analyte pulse. Thus, after a period of collection, analyte may be provided to a detector system from the microscale plate by heating the plate.","Such analyte collection systems provide preconcentration of vapors while also providing the ability to operate below ambient temperatures or maintain a temperature while collecting in a warmer gas stream. Analyte collection systems according to embodiments of the present invention are particularly useful for use as a second stage preconcentrator, such as in a two-stage, self-contained micro analytical system, though they may also be provided as a stand-alone preconcentrator.","It is possible to use more than one, e.g., a series, of the micro scale plates. In some embodiments, an analyte collection system is provided having a series of preconcentrator chips. Each of the preconcentrator chips includes a microscale plate having an active area with perforations extending therethrough for analyte fluid flow through the plates. The respective active areas of the preconcentrator chips may, though not necessarily, be aligned with one another. Sorbent coating is preferably provided over the active area, along with a heating element and a thermal distribution layer. An active cooler is provided for cooling each of the active areas below an ambient temperature. The active cooler may be, as a nonlimiting example, a single element or a plurality of elements. Individual microscale plates may be arranged so that at least some of the respective perforations in the series of plates are at least partially aligned with a solid portion of another plate in the series of plates. In this way, a portion of fluid flow through a hole in one plate is initially brought into contact with a solid portion of a downstream plate before being redirected through a hole of the downstream plate. However, the plates may be arranged in other ways as well.","More than one sorbent may be used on different sections, respectively, of microscale plates, either on a single plate or multiple plates, allowing a device to collect more than one type of analyte. A single plate, for example, may include multiple sorbent sections. In another embodiment, each of a series of plates include a single sorbent while the series of plates includes multiple sorbents by having at least one plate coated with a different sorbent than other plates in the series of plates.","Embodiments of the invention may include both modular collection devices and stand alone analysis devices having a collection device and a detector system, e.g., a transducer, control circuitry, a microprocessor with suitable memory, pneumatic fluidics, and the like. Both modular collection devices and stand alone devices according to embodiments of the invention may be highly compact. An example modular collection device unit can be made small enough, for example, to be conveniently worn on a person, affixed to a vehicle, inserted into the process flow of a machine in a production line, attached to plant life, portions of buildings, in ventilation systems, on cargo, on baggage, in baggage screening areas, etc. For example, a modular collection device of the invention may be clipped to a belt or clothing, or attached to clothing by a hook and loop fastener, e.g., VELCRO\u00ae. In an example method of use, such a device may be carried in an environment by a person to collect a sample, and then attached to a detector system after a period of collection. The same is true to a perhaps marginally lesser extent for stand alone analysis devices of the invention, depending upon the scale and type of the detector and detector system used. In an example, a highly compact and complete micro analytical device of the invention includes a detector system in a MEMS integration with a collection device including flow through microscale sorbent plates, a microcontroller, a power source, and electronics.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that may not be to scale, which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Dimensions and illustrated devices may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. Devices and arrays according to embodiments of the invention may be fabricated by processes well-known to the semiconductor device and MEMS communities. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-2","b":["10","10","10","12","14","12","12"]},"In preferred embodiments, the microscale plate  is microfabricated using known or to-be-known microfabrication techniques. For example, in the embodiment shown in , the microscale plate  includes a microfabricated silicon substrate  having a generally planar upper surface  with a plurality of perforations  (through holes) extending therethrough. Preferably, the perforations  are arranged in a two-dimensional array, such as the array shown in , though it is to be understood that the particular size, number, and arrangement of the perforations may vary. The planar area over which the perforations  are arranged defines an active area  (see ) on and\/or through which analyte is collected. However, it is also contemplated that the active area  may extend beyond or be within this planar area, and the active area may also be defined by less than all of the perforations . These perforations  extend completely through the microscale plate  so that in operation, the analyte fluid flow passes through the plurality of perforations as the analyte passes across the active area . The plurality of holes may be provided by standard microfabrication techniques, as a nonlimiting example. A particular example microfabrication technique that may be used is reactive ion etching (RIE). In a nonlimiting example embodiment, each of the perforations has an approximate size of 100 \u03bcm\u00d7300 \u03bcm, and depth of 25 \u03bcm.","A layer of thermal insulating material  is disposed over the surface  of the silicon substrate  in the active area  to provide thermal insulation for an active heater, such as but not limited to an active heating element  that heats the active area. The thermal insulating layer  is perforated to align with the perforations  in the silicon substrate . In a nonlimiting example the thermal insulating material is polyimide. Other thermal insulating materials that may be used include parylene, Teflon\u2122 and photoresist. The heating element  is disposed over the thermal insulating material . An example heating element is a metal resistive trace that is disposed around and between the perforations  along the active area . Such a resistive trace may be formed on the thermal insulating layer , for example, using standard microfabrication techniques. A pair of metal pads , as shown in , may be provided as contacts (though other embodiments of contacts are contemplated) for coupling a current to the heating element  via a power source and interfacing the heating element with suitable control electronics, such as a controller having suitable logic. In operation, the heating element  is activated to release collected analyte after collection. Other heating mechanisms may also be used in embodiments of the invention including, for example, radiation induced heating or heating by conduction or convection mechanisms. However, the heating element  embodied in a resistive trace is useful to provide the highly desirable rapid heating and deliver a concentrated pulse. If another heating mechanism is used, it should be chosen and configured to produce a rapid desorption effect, while not interfering with the active cooler  used during the collection period.","To assist in cooling the active area , a thermal distribution layer  is disposed over at least a portion of the active area . Preferably, as shown in , the thermal distribution layer  is disposed over the silicon substrate  and over the entire active area , including the thermal insulating layer  and the heating element . In this way, careful management of thermal energy can be provided to both cool the arriving analyte and heat the active area . However, the thermal distribution layer  may be configured or disposed in other ways as needed or desired. The thermal distribution layer  preferably is a layer of weak thermal conductivity. In other words, it is preferred that the thermal distribution layer be somewhat thermally conductive. An example range of thermal conductivity for the thermal distribution layer  is 70 W\/m-K-150 W\/m-K. In an example embodiment, the thermal distribution layer  is a layer of silicon nitride or similarly thermally conductive material. The thermal distribution layer  is perforated to align with the perforations in the thermal insulating layer  and the silicon substrate .","A layer of sorbent material (not shown) preferably is disposed over the layer of partially thermally conductive material , over the active area . A nonlimiting example for the layer of sorbent material is Naval Research Laboratory's HC polymer. Artisans will find guidance for selecting appropriate sorbent materials, including Naval Research Laboratory's HC polymer, in \u201cChoosing Polymer Coatings for Chemical Sensors\u201d, McGill, R. A.; Abraham, M. H.; Grate, J. W., CHEMTECH 24, 9 (1994), p. 27-37. Preferred sorbent coatings will have high temperature stabilities, which are necessary for thermal cycling.","The selectively actuated active cooler  is in thermal communication with the thermal distribution layer  to cool the active area  to at or below ambient temperature at zero analyte flow. An example active cooler  is a Peltier cooler that includes three layers. A first electrode\/insulator layer  is a first electrode and electrical insulator pair that is formed on or attached to the microscale plate , and more preferably on the underside of the silicon substrate . A p-n semiconductor layer  contains p type and n type semiconductor material formed on the first electrode layer . Formed on the p-n semiconductor layer  is a second electrode and electrical insulator pair layer . The first electrode\/insulator layer  and the second electrode\/insulator layer  form a reversible cold side and hot side of the peltier junction. Further, as arranged in  and for cooling purposes, the first electrode\/insulator layer  provides a \u201ccool\u201d plate, while the second electrode\/insulator layer  provides a \u201chot\u201d plate. Example materials for the first and\/or second electrode\/insulator layer ,  and the p-n layer  include, but are not limited to, copper on ceramic or an electrically conducting layer on an oxidized silicon wafer, and pellets of n and p type bismuth-telluride electrically connected in series, respectively, with the second electrode\/insulator layer  identical to the first layer . The active cooler  is coupled to a suitable controller and power supply (not shown) for selective operation.","In the embodiment shown in , the active cooler  is in thermal communication with the silicon substrate , which is in turn in thermal communication with the thermal distribution layer  disposed over the silicon substrate and extending over the active area . Thus, with a Peltier cooler, during analyte collection, to cool the active area , the Peltier cooler  is activated, and the cooled first electrode layer  cools the silicon substrate , which in turn cools the thermal distribution layer , including over the active area .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1-2"],"b":["10","22","22"]},"Thus, to concentrate analyte from an analyte fluid flow and deliver the analyte (for example, to a detector), the active area  of the microscale plate  is cooled (step ) to at or below ambient temperature at zero analyte flow, such as by activating the active cooler . In an example embodiment, selective activation of a Peltier cooler cools the first electrode layer , in turn cooling the silicon substrate  and thus the thermal distribution layer , which is disposed at least partially (and preferably entirely) over the active area .","During or after the cooling step , the analyte fluid flow is directed (step ) through the (cooled) active area  (that is, in a direction substantially perpendicular to the active surface), via a fan or other suitable apparatus. The weak thermal conductivity of the thermal distribution layer , along with high thermal conductivity of the silicon layer , helps maintain the active area  at or below ambient temperature during this collection period, even if the ambient gas stream is warmer. If the collection period is not yet over (step ), analyte fluid flow continues to be directed (step ) through the analyte collection device . If the collection period is determined to be over (step ), the analyte collection device  begins adsorption period. Particularly, the active cooler  is either turned off or reverse biased (step ) (that is, operated so that the first electrode  is the \u201chot\u201d electrode and the second electrode is the \u201ccool\u201d electrode). The silicon substrate  and thus the thermal distribution layer  begin to heat up. Shortly thereafter (e.g., approximately 0-10 seconds), the heating element  is activated (step ) to flash heat the active area  and desorb the collected analyte. The active heating element  combined with the thermal insulating layer  allows the active area  to be rapidly heated to produce a sharp analyte pulse. A carrier gas is introduced (step ) in a flow substantially perpendicular or parallel to the active area  to deliver the desorbed analyte. The carrier gas, such as but not limited to air or nitrogen, delivers the collected analyte to another device. A pump, for example, may be employed to deliver the carrier gas. An example destination device is a detector, such as the example detector shown in .","Because certain Peltier solid state coolers can be relatively inefficient, careful management of the cooler size, and thus power consumption should be considered to improve cooler efficiency, particularly if the preconcentrator is used in portable applications. For example, the thermal mass of all components should be minimized and well insulated.","In an alternative embodiment analyte collection device, the active area  is cooled using the adiabatic expansion of gasses, i.e., the Joule-Thomson effect. Thus, in an example analyte collection device according to this embodiment, the Peltier cooling system  is replaced with a gas delivery system (not shown) including outer, thermally conductive plates in contact with the silicon substrate . By adiabatic expansion of the gasses within the gas delivery system, the thermally conductive plates are cooled, thus cooling the silicon substrate  and in turn cooling the thermal distribution layer  and the active area . Except for the substitution of the gas delivery system for the Peltier cooling system , this alternative embodiment may be made similarly to the analyte collection device  shown in .","Similar to the gas delivery system described above, another alternative embodiment analyte collection device replaces the Peltier cooling system  with a chilled liquid delivery system. For example, a chilled liquid delivery system (not shown) includes outer, thermally conductive plates, which are disposed in contact with silicon substrate . By delivery of the chilled liquid through the system, the thermally conductive plates are cooled, thus cooling the silicon substrate  and in turn cooling the thermal distribution layer  and the active area . Except for the substitution of the chilled liquid delivery system for the Peltier cooling system , this alternative embodiment may be made similarly to the analyte collection device shown in .","Other nonlimiting example active coolers include direct vapor compression (vapor-compression cycle cooling), thermionic, vortex tubes, air cycle, magnetic cooling, Stirling cycle, Malone refrigeration, thermoacoustics, pulse tube, water cycle systems, etc. The present invention is not intended to be limited to a specific type of active cooler.","Though the silicon substrate  is preferred for providing support to the microscale plate , it is not required in all embodiments. The material for the plates may be any material amenable to microfabrication processing. This includes semiconductors and dielectrics. Silicon semiconductors are suitable, as are Group III-V materials. Dielectrics include ceramics, glass, polymers, crystalline quartz, fused silica, etc. To the extent the substrate is used for heat transfer from the cooling element, it is desired that the substrate exhibit thermal conductive properties. However, it is also contemplated that the active cooler cool the active area  directly via the thermal distribution layer .","In another alternative analyte collection device , shown in , the microscale plate itself is fabricated as a Peltier cooler (or part of a Peltier cooler) to provide the active cooler. Thus, instead of the silicon substrate  for structural support as in the analyte collection system shown in , an actively cooling substrate  is provided from a stack of materials to provide a first electrode\/insulator layer , a p-n layer , and a second electrode\/insulator layer .","Examples for the layers , ,  include, but are not limited to, an oxidized silicon wafer with conductive traces, pellets of p and n type bismuth telluride or silicon, and a second oxidized silicon wafer with conductive traces. Such layers may be formed, for example, using known or to-be-known microfabrication techniques. The layers  or  of the cooling substrate  may be coupled to a suitable controller and power supply for operation.","The actively cooling substrate  is perforated, such as by standard microfabrication techniques, to provide the perforations  and define the active area . In the embodiment shown in , the first electrode\/insulator layer  provides the \u201ccool\u201d electrode, and the active area  is defined at or near the perforated portion of the first electrode layer  (as shown in ). Thus, as with the embodiment shown in , the active area  is preferably covered with the thermal insulation layer , the heating element  (with pads ), and the thermal distribution layer . The active area  is cooled by the perforated thermoelectric junction provided by the actively cooling substrate .","The silicon substrate  of  is helpful in particular embodiments to provide structural support to the microscale plate, and more particularly the active area . However, it is also contemplated that the active surface of the microscale plate may include a three (or more) layer stack without silicon behind it. For example, the silicon substrate  may be replaced with a silicon outer frame (not shown) that supports at a perimeter, but is not directly behind, the active surface. The active surface in an example embodiment may be formed by the thermal insulating layer (e.g., polyimide) with the heating element formed thereon, and the thermal distribution layer (e.g., silicon nitride) formed as an upper layer. The thermal distribution layer may be embodied in a plate that extends to the silicon frame for outer support and for cooling. Particularly, an active cooler, including but not limited to a Peltier cooler, a chilled liquid delivery system, and\/or a gas delivery system with a device for expanding the gas, can be in thermal communication with the silicon frame to cool the frame and in turn cool the thermal distribution layer.","Another alternative embodiment analyte collection device has an active area that includes only two materials instead of the several materials shown in the analyte collection device  of . This alternative embodiment includes a thermal distribution layer of a weak thermally conductive material and a heating element disposed thereon. The thermal distribution layer is formed over the silicon substrate  or suspended over a silicon frame. The thermal insulating layer is omitted from this example embodiment.","Though the heating element  shown in  and - is in a particular arrangement to surround the perforations , alternative arrangements for the heating element(s) are possible. For example, in an alternative analyte collection device, a second set of heaters are placed near the edge of the perforations  in the active area . The heaters are heated during collection to prevent analyte from accumulating on cool silicon surfaces not already covered. It is also contemplated that the resistive traces of the example heating element  may be used to divide the active area  into a plurality of zones for collection and delivery.","In another alternative analyte collection system  of the present invention, shown in , a plurality of preconcentrator chips  are provided in a stacked arrangement. Each of the preconcentrator chips  includes the microscale plate  shown in . Particularly, each of the preconcentrator chips  includes, in order, the silicon substrate , having perforations  to provide an active area  thereon, the thermal insulating layer , the metal heating element , and the thermal distribution layer .","To support the preconcentrator chips  and providing cooling to the thermal distribution layers , a set of vertically stacked (in the orientation shown in ) thermally conductive chip mounts  are provided, including an inner, vertical, thermally conductive surface  and a plurality of inwardly extending supports  for holding individual chips. Nonlimiting example materials for the thermally conductive surface  and the inwardly extending supports  include aluminum and silver, respectively. A vertically extending Peltier cooler  surrounds the thermally conductive chip mounts , and includes a first, inner electrode\/insulator pair  (a \u201ccool\u201d side), a p-n layer , and a second, outer electrode\/insulator pair  (a \u201chot\u201d side). For distributing heat from the second, \u201chot\u201d electrode , a heat sink  may be provided on an outer portion of the analyte collection system . The heat sink  may include, for example, a machined aluminum block.","Operation of the analyte collection system  is similar to that of the system  shown in . The vertical arrangement of the Peltier cooler  allows cooling of the active areas of each of the preconcentrator chips . Analyte flow to the preconcentrator chips  preferably runs from top to bottom, perpendicular to the active areas  and through the perforations  in each chip. However, after desorption, the analyte preferably also flows perpendicular to the active areas  towards a sensor, in contrast to the embodiment shown in  (which preferably, though not necessarily, uses desorption flow in a direction parallel to the active area).","The analyte collection device , ,  may be used as part of a micro analytical system. Preferably, the micro analytical system is self-contained, though this is not necessary in all embodiments. An example of a micro analytical system , shown in , incorporating the analyte collection device  includes a two-stage vapor preconcentrator  contained within a housing . The housing  may be configured to be highly compact for a self-contained field analysis device, for example. The two-stage preconcentrator  includes a large volume preconcentrator  in a first chamber , which preferably includes one or more perforated, sorbent plates  for collecting analyte. A collection flow, as shown in , preferably runs through the large volume preconcentrator , for example perpendicular to surfaces of the sorbent plates . After a certain collection period, desorbed analyte is carried via a carrier gas in a desorption flow to a second chamber , which houses the analyte collection device  or analyte collection device of other embodiments of the present invention. The walls of the housing , including those of the first chamber  and the second chamber , should be inert to the analyte(s) of interest, either because of material properties or by active heating to the active areas to avoid sorption. A valve  may be disposed between the first and second chambers ,  (that is, between the large volume preconcentrator  and the actively cooled analyte collection device ) for selectively allowing fluid flow to the second chamber . In certain embodiments, the large volume preconcentrator  may have a narrowed end to interface with the second chamber . After a collection period by the analyte collection device , during which air flow preferably is in a direction perpendicular to the active area(s)  of the analyte collection device, the desorption flow runs parallel to the active area(s) for output to a detector system , for example via a valve . An example detector system  may include but is not limited to an ion mobility spectrometer. Fluid flow may be controlled by a pump that may or may not be integral to the detector and valves  under suitable integrated electronics.  is a block diagram of the micro analytical system  of . The large volume preconcentrator , the second stage (cooled) preconcentrator , and the detector  are powered by a suitable power supply (not shown), e.g., a battery, and controlled by a controller, such as but not limited to a microcontroller  having suitable logic. The microcontroller , which is provided with feedback via one or more sensors , selectively controls operation of an airflow system including one or more fans or pumps  and the valves , and further selectively controls the large volume preconcentrator  and second stage preconcentrator . The valves operate to permit flows to be directed into and out of the large volume preconcentrator  and the second stage preconcentrator  during periods of analyte collection and concentration therein.","Generally, the microcontroller  runs the overall system . For example, the microcontroller  directs the fans  and valves  for inducing collection flows, and one or more pumps  for inducing desorption flows. In operating the large volume preconcentrator , the microcontroller  opens an outlet and provides power to the fan  to induce a flow through the plate or plates. After a collection period, the microcontroller  selectively operates a heater  during desorption. If multiple heaters (e.g., traces) are used, the microcontroller  preferably controls each heater individually. For example, if multiple zones are used, the individual heaters in these zones may be operated at different times to enhance selectivity of the system. The microcontroller  may embody or access memory for sensor  data and analysis. Similarly, during the second preconcentration stage, the microcontroller  selectively operates the active cooler(s)  during the collection period, and the active heating element(s)  during the desorption period.","During collection, the large volume preconcentrator is unenergized and left at ambient temperature. Once the collection period has ended, a valve downstream of the large volume preconcentrator (not shown) is closed and the valve(s)  between the preconcentrators and downstream of the actively cooled device is\/are opened. Simultaneously, the actively cooled analyte collection device  is cooled followed by the thermal desorption of the large volume preconcentrator , effectively transferring collected analyte to the actively cooled preconcentrator. The valve(s)  between large volume and actively cooled preconcentrators is\/are closed. With flow established to the detector , cooling is turned off and the active area of the cooled preconcentrator  is heated. Suitable measurements  from the large volume preconcentrator  and the second stage preconcentrator  may be provided.","Various devices and methods for analyte collection have been shown and described, having various features and benefits. Example actively cooled vapor preconcentrators can operate at or below ambient temperatures or maintain a temperature while collecting in a warmer gas stream. By providing a thermally insulated heater with a weak thermal conductor, the nitride can stay cool while collecting analyte from a warmer gas stream. The temperature difference between a collection region and impinging gas is a function of the thermal power transferred between them. The ability to generate large amounts of thermal energy via the microfabricated heater traces combined with the thermally insulating polyimide allows the active surface to be rapidly heated to produce a sharp analyte pulse.","Analyte collection devices according to embodiments of the present invention can be used as second stage preconcentrators. Actively cooled vapor preconcentrators can enhance the detection limits of various trace detectors for explosives, chemical agents, toxic industrial chemicals, and other illicit materials in portable and stationary applications. Example preconcentrators can enhance detection limits for detectors and analytes in liquid environments.
