{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/041,001 titled \u201cSystem for Targeted Delivery of Networked Content, filed Mar. 27, 1997 by Michael M. Tso et al. and assigned to Intel Corporation, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to the field of data communications for personal computers (PCs), and in particular to a system for delivering content, such as targeted on-line advertising, to a client device, where such delivery is not in response to a specific request for such content.","2. Related Art","The Internet is quickly becoming the preferred data communications medium for a broad class of computer users ranging from private individuals to large multi-national corporations. Such users now routinely employ the Internet to access information, distribute information, correspond electronically, and even conduct personal conferencing. An ever-growing number of individuals, organizations and businesses have established a presence on the Internet through \u201cWeb pages\u201d on the World-Wide Web (\u201cthe Web\u201d).","As the popularity of the Internet has grown, so too have opportunities for on-line marketing. Advertising through the Internet has become enormously popular. Indeed, in some cases on-line services like e-mail are provided free of charge as long as users are willing to receive on-line advertisements.","On-line advertisements are typically included as an integral part of the content on Web pages. This approach suffers from a variety of limitations. For example, users tend to follow hyperlinks and move from one Web page to another, much like \u201csurfing\u201d the channels on a television. Unfortunately, such user behavior reduces the impact of advertising, as advertisements generally require captive audiences to be most effective. There is currently no reliable method for ensuring an Internet user's attention.","To illustrate another limitation, advertisers generally must purchase individual rights on particular Web pages to distribute their advertisements, since the link to an advertisement is authored into the content. This makes advertising sales a difficult proposition given the enormous number of Web pages on the Internet. Enterprises known as \u201cconsolidators,\u201d such as Doubleclick, purchase rights on certain pages and allow many advertisers to share the same space, but such approaches do not solve the fundamental problem that advertising space on each Web page must be individually acquired.","Yet another limitation of existing approaches to on-line advertising relates to difficulties in achieving so-called \u201ctargeted advertising,\u201d wherein advertisements are specifically tailored to the recipient's interests and preferences. Targeted advertising on the Internet has typically been attempted using a device known as a \u201ccookie,\u201d which is a data item used to maintain client-specific information, such as a marketing profile, accessible by facilities that do not necessarily communicate with one another. For example, a cookie stored on a client device may be accessed by any number of Web sites which that client device visits, assuming those Web sites are preconfigured to do so. Unfortunately, propagating this type of functionality to the many thousands of Web sites on the Internet is impractical.","Another approach to targeted advertising on the Internet involves deriving profile information by analyzing the Web sites that particular users visit, as maintained in a standard logging device known as a \u201cclickstream.\u201d Again, however, there is no one widely-implemented mechanism for collecting clickstreams. Even for those Web sites so-equipped, the current state of the art requires the resource-intensive task of merging logs from all of the sites visited by a user.","Still more limitations of existing approaches to on-line advertising relate to the nature of the on-line advertisements themselves. On-line advertisements are typically limited in richness due to unacceptable additional latencies that would be introduced by large or highly-rich advertisements. Also, since advertisements must be rendered by a browser installed on the client device, advertisers are restricted with respect to the use of more sophisticated, non-standard data formats and compression techniques. Only those datatypes supported by the browser may be used.","In view of the foregoing limitations, there is a need for a system capable of providing targeted distribution of content to network users without requiring widespread changes to existing network infrastructures.","An embodiment of the present invention is implemented in a method for presenting dynamic content to a user of a client device. According to that embodiment, a requested data object is presented to a user. Dynamic content is automatically presented to the user in addition to the presentation of the requested data object. The dynamic content comprises information provided by a dynamic executable module running on the client device.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a system for the targeted distribution of dynamic content without the limitations of existing approaches, such as those described above. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be applied to on-line advertising in a manner that significantly improves over existing technology, particularly with respect to distribution, targeting, and feedback collection. It should be noted, however, that the scope of the present invention extends well beyond on-line advertising. The same mechanisms and methods described herein may be advantageously applied to applications involving many different types of dynamic content including, but not limited to, subscription services (for example, news, weather, stock quotes), distribution of automatic software updates, or virtually any so-called \u201cout of band\u201d information (that is, information not directly associated with a user request which expects an immediate response, such as a deferred, periodic, or implicit user request). In other words, \u201cdynamic content\u201d as used herein refers broadly to content that is not specifically requested by a user. Thus, while the following detailed description is written in terms of on-line advertising applications, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the same or similar embodiments may be readily adapted for many other types of applications.","Looking now at a first embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in , a client device  may access a plurality of content servers  through a network device . Client device  includes a browser , such as Netscape\u2122, which enables a user of client device  to retrieve and display network data objects, such as Web pages resident on content server . Content server  may reside, for example, on the Internet and be accessible through standard HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) calls; however, the present invention is not limited to any particular network or communications method. In this particular embodiment, network device  is a network proxy through which a plurality of client devices  access network resources such as content servers . Alternatively, network device  may itself comprise a network server, a content server, or some other type of stand-alone computer or distributed system of computers coupled, for example, to an ISP's (Internet Service Provider's) network, a corporate network, or anywhere on the Internet. Although  illustrates only a single client device , network device  will typically be configured to provide multiple client devices with access to network resources.","Network device  includes an advertising service provider  responsible for managing the provision of dynamic content to client device . In this particular embodiment, advertising service provider  distributes advertising content to client device  by embedding a dynamic advertising module (DAM)  into one or more Web pages  downloaded to client device . Advertising service provider  may comprise a software module installed in, or otherwise executable by, network device . Dynamic advertising module  may comprise a dynamic executable module of a type known in the art implemented, for example, using a Java applet or similar utility, which automatically executes upon being loaded onto client device .","Dynamic advertising module  is programmed to control the display of advertising content on client device . An advantage of this approach, as opposed to having advertising service module  simply embed advertising content into Web page , is that most of today's common browsers will display information from such an embedded executable module in a window separate from a requested Web page. This not only eliminates any concerns about disrupting the layout of the Web page, but also provides a more aesthetically-appealing presentation. Another significant benefit provided by the use of dynamic advertising module  is that there is no need for client device  to be pre-configured with any special software to support the presentation of advertisements.","In possible variations of the embodiment illustrated in , network device  may be configured to ensure that only a single instance of dynamic advertising module  is active on client device . Moreover, where client device  includes a local cache storage (not shown) accessible by browser , network device  may be configured to avoid downloading another instance of dynamic advertising module  if one already resides in the cache.","The foregoing embodiments may be implemented, for example, as part of a system for dynamically transcoding network content. With reference to , network client  communicates with an external network  through a transcoding server . Network client  includes a browser , such as the Netscape Navigator v.3.0 browser (although the invention is not limited in this respect), which manages the presentation of data to a user. In the illustrated arrangement, network client  is \u201cnon-enabled,\u201d meaning no specialized transcoding software is preloaded on network client . Network  may comprise, for example, the Internet. In this particular arrangement, network client  communicates requests for information to, and receives information from, transcoding server  over a client\/server communications link . Transcoding server  in turn communicates with computers resident on network  through server\/network communications link . The respective communications links ,  may comprise any suitable communications media known in the art.","Transcoding server  may be configured to provide a wide variety of transcoding services to network client  and\/or network devices, such as content servers, with which network client  communicates. In this context, the term \u201ctranscode\u201d refers to virtually any type of addition, deletion or modification of data transmitted to or from network client  by or through transcoding server . In addition to the provision of dynamic content such as advertising, examples of such transcoding services include data compression, image scaling, and dynamic removal of predetermined content. In the context of the present invention, the provision of dynamic content may be the only transcoding service provided to a particular client device, or may be only one of a variety of services.","As illustrated in , transcoding server  may include a transcoder  with a parser  and a plurality of transcode service providers . Parser  is configured to act upon data received by transcoder , such as a request for a network object generated by client device  or a reply to such a request provided by a content server or other device on network . In this particular example, parser  is responsible for selectively invoking one or more of transcode service providers  based upon a predetermined selection criterion. With reference to , advertising service provider  may be implemented, for example, as a transcoding service provider .","In the arrangement shown in , transcoding server  includes an HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) remote proxy , capable of accessing network  over server\/network communications link . HTTP remote proxy  provides functionality different from known network proxies, which generally are little more than a conduit for requests to, and replies from, external Internet resources, in that it is capable not only of examining such requests and replies, but also of acting upon commands in the requests by, for example, determining whether or not to transcode content. Moreover, using transcoder , HTTP remote proxy  is capable of changing content received from network  prior to returning it to a requesting network client .","Looking more closely at the arrangement shown in , transcoder  is coupled to HTTP remote proxy . Parser  manages the transcoding of data to be transmitted from transcoding server  to network client . To this end, parser  controls transcode service providers  to selectively transcode content based on a predetermined selection criterion. For example, one or more transcode service providers  may provide the capability to compress and\/or scale different types of data content, such as image, video, or HTML (HyperText Markup Language), in addition to providing content blocking functionality as discussed above. Transcoding server  may also include a server-side cache memory  managed by a server-side cache interface . Server-side cache memory  may be used to store both original and transcoded versions of content for later transmission to network client  without the need to re-retrieve the content from network  or to re-transcode the content.","Parser  may comprise a relatively simple, uniform interface to HTTP remote proxy , and may provide an API (Application Programming Interface) for transcoding data received by HTTP remote proxy . Parser  manages one or more transcode service providers  that are accessed through a common SPI (Service Provider Interface). In this particular implementation, parser  is designed in compliance with the Windows Open Systems Architecture (WOSA), and may be implemented as a Win32 DLL (Dynamic Link Library). The WOSA architecture, described in (Microsoft Corp. 1995), enables additional transcode service providers  to be dynamically added to the system to provide new features and\/or better transcoding algorithms, while at the same time not requiring changing or retesting other software components in the system.","Like parser , server-side cache interface  may be modeled after a standard Get\/Set interface. Server-side cache memory  essentially \u201cowns\u201d all cached objects, in that it manages the properties and storage of the objects and may invalidate any non-locked object at any time; however, the actual format of any given cached object is known only by parser  and its associated transcode service providers . Thus, for data integrity and transcoding efficiency purposes, all access to server-side cache memory  in this arrangement is through parser .","In operation, transcoder  may use a Read( ) call to read data from a specified cached object data stream. For example, transcode service provider  may invoke this call and tunnel stream data through HTTP remote proxy  directly to network client . Similarly, a Write( ) call may be used to cache data from a new HTTP data stream. This call will append an incoming data stream received from, for example, a Web server or transcode service provider , to an opened cache stream which may be concurrently read using the Read( ) call.","Parser  may be configured to include the following calls:\n\n","The GetScaledObject( ) call is similar to GetObject( ), and is also used to request an object from server-side cache memory ; however, it adds support for requesting a particular version of that object, such as a high-quality rendition. Unlike traditional caching proxies, transcode service providers  can use server-side cache memory  to store several different versions of an object to support clients with different communications and\/or presentation capabilities. Thus, an additional \u201cStage\u201d parameter may be used to indicate which version of the cached object is to be returned to network client . Where transcode service provider  is configured to scale network content, it may use this parameter to request a version of a cached object having, for example, a default scaled quality, a refinement to a better-quality version, or the original non-scaled version.","In this particular arrangement, when network client  requests a hypertext object, HTTP remote proxy  uses either the GetObject( ) or GetScaledObject( ) call (depending on if network client  is capable of receiving scaled\/transcoded datatypes) to retrieve the hypertext object from parser . If the hypertext object is not found, parser  uses the CreateEntry( ) call to create an entry (in effect, a placeholder) in server-side cache memory  for the new object. The new entry is returned to HTTP remote proxy , which requests the hypertext object from network . As a data stream for the hypertext object is returned, HTTP remote proxy  calls parser  using the PutObject( ) call, passing into this call the new entry and the handle to the data stream to be placed into the entry. Parser  selects an appropriate transcode service provider  based, for example, on the content type of the data stream. In this context, the term content type encompasses a datatype, an HTTP MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type, a content format, and so on. The selected transcode service provider  uses a separate thread to read the incoming data stream, transcode it (for example, scan for predetermined content and delete it if found), and place it within the entry of server-side cache memory . The current thread immediately returns to HTTP remote proxy , which once again calls GetScaledObject( ) (or GetObject( ). This case will always result in a cache hit. This thread then works simultaneously with the separate thread in the PutObject( ) to tunnel data (either original or transcoded) from transcoding server  to network client .","As discussed further herein, the configuration shown in  is just one of many different ways in which embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. For example, the dynamic content provisions functionality could be implemented in a so-called \u201cenabled client\u201d containing specialized software for performing the functions attributed to dynamic advertising module  in FIG. . Similar to the configuration of , such specialized software may be implemented, for example, as a client-side transcode service provider, as part of a local proxy, as part of the browser running on the client device, or as an add-in module running on the client device. The present invention is not limited in this regard.","By way of further illustration,  provides a flow diagram illustrating a method for distributing content using, for example, a system such as that of  or FIG. . According to this embodiment, processing may begin upon receipt of a data object, such as a data stream representing a requested Web page, to be downloaded to client device  (Step ). Prior to downloading the data object, the device performing the method, such as network device , embeds code into the data object to provide dynamic advertising content (Step ). This code may comprise, for example, dynamic advertising module  of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. . The data object with the embedded code is then downloaded to client device  (Step ). In a variation on this embodiment, network device  may be configured to determine whether client device  is to receive dynamic advertising content. Such a determination may be performed either upon receipt of a request for a data object from client device , or upon receipt of the beginning of a response to such a request from content server . Such a determination may be based upon, for example, an authorization table maintained or otherwise accessible by advertising service provider .","According to another embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in , browser  of client device  includes a dynamic advertising module  which essentially integrates into browser  the functionality described above for the dynamic advertising module  of FIG. . Dynamic advertising module  may be implemented, for example, as a software routine within browser , or as a separate executable module which browser  may invoke. In this way, browser  may be configured to render advertisements as it displays user-requested content. In addition, dynamic advertising module  may cause browser  to fetch advertisements from one or more network locations.","According to yet another embodiment, illustrated in , client device  may be a so-called \u201cenabled client,\u201d whereby dynamic advertising functionality such as that described above is provided through specialized software installed on client device . In this embodiment, client device  includes a local proxy  coupled to browser  which intercepts all network communications to or from client device . Client device  also includes a dynamic advertising module  coupled to a graphical user interface (GUI)  capable of displaying so-called \u201crich\u201d advertisements (that is, high-quality content) represented in datatypes which may not be supported by browser . Local proxy  is configured to maintain contact with network device  in the same manner as dynamic advertising module  of the  embodiment; however, since local proxy  intercepts all requests issued by browser , a significant portion of the work that network proxy  might otherwise be required to do, such as recording clickstreams, can be handled at the client-level by local proxy  and\/or dynamic advertising module . Such an approach is especially advantageous where overall system performance may be improved by off-loading work from network proxy , such as where network proxy  services a large number of client devices.","Among the features which may be provided by particular embodiments of the present invention, including those illustrated in , is session-based advertising. The goal of session-based advertising is to provide an advertiser with a relatively \u201ccaptive\u201d viewing audience for advertising content. With reference to the embodiment illustrated in , session-based advertising may be implemented by coding advertising service provider  and\/or dynamic advertising module  to fetch and display advertisements from one or more predetermined network locations using, for example, standard HTTP calls. Dynamic advertising module  may then control how long an advertisement is displayed, regardless of which Web page(s)  the user visits through browser . The fetching and\/or display of advertisements may be based upon an existing user profile maintained, for example, in a user profile table (not shown) accessible by advertising service provider . The advertiser is thus given the closest thing possible to a captive audience, since the targeted advertising can be constantly displayed even when the user rapidly changes the content being viewed. Moreover, since the content displayed by dynamic advertising module  appears regardless of what Web page  the user is viewing, there is no need for the advertiser to request any content changes from particular content providers in order to display their advertisements.","In possible variations of this embodiment, dynamic advertising module  may be configured to maintain contact with advertising service provider  (for example, through HTTP \u201cPOST\u201d messages) so that the advertisements displayed reflect any changes in the original user profile resulting from activities during the current session. In other words, the user profile may be updated as a result of the user's activities during the current session, and those updates may be reflected in the dynamic content presented during that session. Advertising service provider  may also set and\/or change configuration information controlling the operation of dynamic advertising module , such as how long to display each advertisement. It is also possible to integrate existing on-line advertising techniques into dynamic advertising module , such as the feature of known banner advertisements which enables users to click on an advertisement to access a location on the network predetermined by the advertiser, such as the advertiser's corporate presence server.","As alluded to above, it may be beneficial to collect and record clickstreams for individual users for purposes of developing and\/or updating user profiles useful in highly-targeted advertising. This may be done, for example, by a browser, a local proxy, a network proxy, or a content server. It may be preferable, however, to implement such a feature in a network proxy (such as that shown in ) to avoid having to modify existing client- or server-side devices. Another advantage of the network proxy approach, at least compared with a server-based approach, is the elimination of the sometimes difficult task of having a content server determine which logs correspond to particular users. The difficulty arises because IP addresses are often dynamically assigned on a per request basis, meaning a particular user's requests over the course of a single session may reach a content server with a number of different IP addresses. By contrast, according to the proxy-based embodiments discussed herein, a unique IP address may be assigned and used for all requests during any particular user session, making the clickstream collection and recording mechanism straight-forward and accurate.","As a further refinement providing even greater targeting capabilities, the clickstream gathering mechanism may be configured to weight a user's interest in particular Web pages or Web sites (that is, a group of pages from the same Internet domain). For example, network device  of  may be programmed to measure a user's interest by how long the user spends looking at a particular Web page or site. This information may be derived from the HTTP transactions between client device  and content server , such as by timestamping requests received from client device  in a log maintained by network device . Such a feature is most advantageously provided with either a proxy-based or a browser-based implementation because such implementations enable an accurate account of every request issued from client device . By contrast, currently-known approaches using server-side logs do not work as well because server logs cannot easily detect the \u201cclick\u201d by which the user leaves the current server (rather, it will generally only be detected by the new server to which the user goes). Similarly, user interest may be measured by how many hyperlinks the user follows from the same Web page or site, and\/or how frequently the user visits a particular Web page or site over time. To facilitate such features, network device  may be configured to maintain a user history log including entries for each user to which dynamic advertising content is provided.","Where a measurement mechanism is provided for tracking how long a user spends at a particular Web page or site, the mechanism may include a timeout facility for ignoring out-of-bounds values which might otherwise skew results. A suitable timeout period may be on the order of five minutes for any particular Web page. Such a timeout feature is beneficial to ensure that the Web page which a user last looks at before he\/she turns off their system (or leaves for an extended period of time) does not get misinterpreted as the user having spent an extremely long time looking at that page.","In one particular implementation of a time-based weighting feature, network device  may be programmed to perform the following time-stamping algorithm:\n\n","Another advantageous feature which may be provided by embodiments of the present invention, including those illustrated in , is the ability to download dynamic content to client device  primarily in a background mode, thereby avoiding the introduction of excessive latency into downloads of \u201cregular\u201d (that is, specifically requested) user content as a result of the addition of advertising information. In essence, the goal is to prevent competition between advertisements and user-requested content during data transfers to client device . As one example of how this goal may be achieved, dynamic advertising module  (whether resident in browser  or elsewhere in client device ) may generate requests for advertising content to be displayed using a distinguishable request (for example, a particular \u201cPOST\u201d message, a regular HTTP \u201cGET\u201d with a particular URL, or any other form of predetermined inter-device communication). Network device  will then be able to distinguish requests for advertisements (or any other low-priority content) from user-initiated content requests (or any other high-priority content), and ensure that user-initiated content requests always get processing preference.","According to a particular implementation of this feature, network device  maintains state information about all of the advertisement requests being currently processed (for example, a list of sockets being used for data transfer). This information may be keyed by a unique identifier for each client device , such as an IP address. Each new connection accepted by network device  may then be categorized either as an advertisement request or as a user content request. If the former, the request is added to the list and processed if no other high-priority requests are being processed; otherwise, the network device  may systematically abort all other low-priority requests and begin processing the higher-priority request. In such a case, the low-priority requests will have to be restarted at a later time, either by network device  or by dynamic advertising module . Alternatively, rather than aborting the low-priority requests, network device  may temporarily suspend all processing related to low-priority requests and begin processing the higher-priority content request. The suspended request may remain unprocessed until all outstanding high-priority content requests have been satisfied. This alternative has the advantage of making more efficient use of network resources by not discarding partially-transferred content and maintaining the state of the connection (thus saving overhead required for setting up new connections).","The just-described approaches for background processing may be implemented using existing protocol stacks. A possible alternative approach takes advantage of overlapped input\/output features that are available in some protocol stack implementations, such as Winsock2. Such an alternative approach provides a more fine-grained priority than the methods just described by waiting for the completion of each high-priority send operation instead of waiting for the end of the high-priority socket. This mechanism makes use of the feature in such protocol stacks which notifies the calling application when each send operation completes. Low-priority (or out of band) send operations can be delayed until all (or most) previous high-priority send operations are completed. Thus, both high- and low-priority sockets may be opened simultaneously, but low-priority data is only sent when the in-band socket goes idle (for example, due to server or network congestion). This is especially useful for embedded content streams such as video or persistent HTTP streams. Other optimizations are also possible, such as multiple priority levels, or anticipating socket\/send completion based on average data throughput. This solution increases utilization of the communications link to the user without increasing user-visible latencies.","Another benefit provided by embodiments of the present invention is that it becomes possible to provide richer advertising content than is practical with existing on-line advertising methods. Since advertising need not add additional latency to the user's browsing, it is practical to download dynamic content including arbitrary complex objects, such as executables, as well as graphical or other multimedia data. For example, an embodiment of the present invention may be used to download a demo version of a software program being advertised, enabling the user to click on the advertisement and instantly try out the demo without waiting for the demo to be downloaded. Similarly, a preview clip of a music CD or movie may be shown to a user after it has been completely downloaded. Likewise, a \u201cfloating\u201d animation (that is, one not framed in a window) that the user can interact with while browsing may be provided in the manner of a screen-saver. Thus, advertisements can be very interactive and very rich, greatly increasing their effectiveness. Moreover, rich advertisements may be further improved by installing software, such as an advertisement player, on a client machine. This would permit downloading only data (for example, sound, images) and instructions on how to playback the data. Savings in download time can then be realized because the player would contain most of the executable code that would otherwise have to be downloaded with every advertisement.","Embodiments of the present invention likewise enable advertisements to be targeted to a degree not readily achievable with existing technology. Whether the mechanisms are implemented in a network device or in client-based software, a wide variety of targeting criteria are possible. For example, targeting may be based upon a list of Web pages for which demographic data is available. To illustrate, it is known that a high percentage of visitors to the Dilbert\u2122 cartoon page are white-collar office workers, who may be good candidates to receive advertisements for such items as luxury cars. Targeting may also be based on keywords in the content page, the request, or the URL accessed. A proxy (local or network) may scan for predetermined keywords and then decide which category of advertising to request. For example, if a user is viewing a Web page containing many occurrences of the words \u201cstock\u201d and \u201ctrade,\u201d the user would likely be a good candidate for a discount brokerage advertisement. Unlike existing mechanisms that scan requests for keywords, embodiments of the present invention do not require any special software on the content server.","Targeting may also be based on user profile information. Such information may be collected through any of a wide variety of known methods, such as personal surveys or clickstream analysis, and then used to match profiles requested by advertisers. Embodiments of the present invention enable any advertiser to use this type of targeting capability on any Web page, regardless of whether the Web page already has a hyperlink to another advertiser or group of advertisers, since the matching may be done at the proxy (and possibly completely independent of the content). Targeting may also be based on recently-installed and\/or frequently-used client-based applications. For example, software on a client machine can gather information by examining the client system (for example, the Windows registry and\/or file system on PCs) for the date when applications were installed (or are frequently run). This enables advertisers to target advertisements for software add-ons, upgrades, and related products.","Yet another possibility is targeting based on client computer capabilities. For example, the client machine may be queried for its media and processing capabilities (for example, by looking at which type of software device drivers are loaded\/active). This allows rich content to be customized for each user's computer capabilities to prevent instances where the client is unable to consume all of the data transferred due to system limitations, such as advertisements with audio or those requiring high-resolution video being downloaded to clients lacking the capability to render such content. It should be noted that the foregoing targeting possibilities are presented only by way of example, and not by way of limitation.","Embodiments of the present invention may be distributed, for example, as a set of instructions residing on a storage medium. Such a storage medium might be a memory of a computer; a piece of firmware; a portable storage device, such as a diskette or other magnetic storage device, or a CD-ROM; or any other medium on which it is known to store executable instructions.","Although the present invention has been described largely with reference to embodiments for processing requests for data from the Internet, persons skilled in the art will recognize that it is equally applicable to other networking environments. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be used to distribute dynamic content to users on an \u201cintranet.\u201d An intranet typically is a secure corporate network modeled after the Internet architecture, and generally includes mechanisms for communicating with external networks such as the Internet.","The foregoing is a detailed description of particular embodiments of the present invention. The invention embraces all alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the letter and spirit of the claims, as well as all equivalents of the claimed subject matter. For example, the foregoing embodiments need not be implemented in network devices which communicate using HTTP. The same methods described herein may be applied to any network element capable of intercepting network requests, such as protocol stacks on clients, servers, proxies or routers, or in specially-configured routers or other specially-built hardware which can intercept packets transmitted over a network. Likewise, the gathering of user profile information and demographics (for example, clickstreams) may also be done at the client using either local software or an enhanced browser. Persons skilled in the art will recognize from the foregoing detailed description that many other alternatives, modifications and variations are possible."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
