No. 09\/864,496, published as Application Number 20020193905 filed on May 24, 2001 and the disclosure of this prior applications is considered part of (and is incorporated by reference in) the disclosure of this application. This application is a continuation of and claims priority to an application entitled \u201cA Manufacturing Method and Software Product for Optimizing Information Flow\u201d filed on Oct. 17, 2001, having Ser. No. 09\/981,949, and published as Application Number 20030074424.","This invention relates generally to Manufacturing and, more specifically, to Information Technology.","Over the last 25 years or more, manufacturers have invested in computer systems to help run their operations. Manufacturers designed the systems on an ad hoc basis. Early manufacturing information systems were custom built with specific software developed for a particular manufacturer's operating style, hardware, or reporting needs. These custom systems proved to be costly not only at the installation and implementation phases but also later when debugging after implementation. Because such a system is unique to the manufacturer, there exists no insight gained in the course of service of a particular product. Each installation was sui generis, an installation onto itself.","Throughout the nineties, large manufactures have moved toward the purchase of high-end commercial off-the-shelf software for the purpose of defining and completing several of the tasks necessary to manufacture product. The motivation for doing so was, at least two-fold. Manufactures spent less for the purchase of commercial grade off-the-shelf software, and the manufacturer could anticipate less downtime during service cycles because developers have derived much of the knowledge of particular glitches and bugs in servicing similar installations of the same software.","Nonetheless, these off-the-shelf software products carried with them a new hidden cost. Each of the off-the-shelf applications are, themselves, designed as the top-level logic necessary to control specific portions of the manufacturing process. Each functions as though in a vacuum without significant interaction with other systems.","Unfortunately, by placing these software products at the highest level, information managed by a particular software product is not accessible to those specifically permitted to use the information. Thus, MRPII\/ERP systems cannot share information with CAD\/CAM systems and likewise, CAD\/CAM systems cannot share information with numeric control systems. Enterprise systems stand alone. As each system is put in place, it stands autonomous, where it reigns supreme over information necessary in its particular domain. As a result, the manufacturer who purchases some of the best software products in each field ends up isolating the information used for each phase of manufacturing.","Very few cross-system information portals exist. Those that do exist such as Enovia\u00ae for the CATIA\u00ae computer assisted drafting and design program do not actually port information across but rather act as a browser and extension of the program and not a proper portal for information by other manufacturers. The bridge is a human bridge, carrying information to the site needed. While such bridges do allow the broadcast of information controlled by the software, they do not afford an actual sharing of information between programs without the introduction of key operator error.","As a result of the vast number of computer products used in manufacture, the information necessary to make decisions within the factory exists in a patchwork quilt of domains in the control of a plurality of high-end programs analogous to the resources of feudal England in the control of a number of feudal lords. The effects of this feudal control over information can be seen through various sets of eyes within the manufacturing system. In studies conducted by the applicant, up to 45% of some worker's time spent in production is attributable to logging into and out of the various domains that control tools, design specifications, manpower tasking, and planning data. For instance, a lead machinist might spend 33 minutes per day per task receiving job assignments for the day; for each order it may take as much as 13 minutes to check the appropriate tools out of the tool crib and the necessary part data for assembly. The actual production of the part may take as little as 12 minutes per order, but then logging off of a particular part may take an additional 8 minutes per order. In short, a large part of a productive worker's day is given over to the task of logging into and out of various systems necessary to control data or tools.","On average, in one person's workday, 55% is spent in activities that add value to the manufactured product, the other 45% is given to administrative overhead of logging into and out of various systems to schedule work, track work, gather data necessary to do work, closing the work, and notifying a system of the completion of that work. Manual methods order and input data, order tools, parts and information, and execute hundreds of repetitive and routine transactions as though they were decisions requiring human judgment.","The administrative overhead of logging into and out of various systems has also proven to be the least satisfying portion of an individual worker's job tasking for a given day. The tasks appurtenant to the logging into and out of various systems are repetitive and redundant, and while computers have allowed automated production of many assemblies in the manufacturing process, they have not delivered on their promise to take repetitive and redundant work out of the realm of skilled labor. Computers are very well suited to performing the tasks of logging into and out of various domains and removing the information management overhead from the worker's day.","What is needed is a higher-level meta-layer of software that will lessen the information overhead and will be an effective port of information to all individuals at any level of the manufacturing process. Such a solution could also be used to port critical information to vendors, customers, and suppliers thereby allowing rapid changes in tooling in response to perceived needs. Management decisions with regard to such needs will be better informed where information can be ported to decision makers. A highly intuitive interface for presenting the information is desirable as the same will allow data that was previously available only to specialists to be presented to all who need to be \u201cin the know\u201d without paying a high training premium. Thus, what is needed is a browser-like interface for bi-directional access to manufacturing data.","The instant invention is a method, software product, and system for sharing information within a manufacturing facility. By use of a browser and a uniform look and feel of the data presented to the browser, the inventive system presents the information that might assist any employee of the manufacturing facility with in any aspect of employment. By virtue the inventive system, the employees of the facility may access information without separate log-ins; may automate numerous of the processes within the facility including checking out tools and cutters from tool cribs; requisitioning materials; and, signing off of various tasks for timekeeping purposes.","The present invention comprises a high-level meta-layer for integrating the communications within a manufacturing facility comprising a graphic user interface, a structured data exchange and software wrappers allowing access to the several software servers within the manufacturing facility.","In accordance with further aspects of the invention, allows remote access to the software servers allowing employees to perform their tasks at locations remote to the factory.","In accordance with other aspects of the invention, the graphic user interface is implemented with a browser making the look and feel of the operation of the software uniform for all users.","As will be readily appreciated from the foregoing summary, the invention provides for implementation across great geographic distances allowing for the provision of workstations remote from the factory floor.","Modern factories comprise numbers of automated machines and tooling that are driven by embedded processors. Servers in these factories send detailed specifications for the produced parts, sub-assemblies, assemblies, and products. Computers also manage administrative functions; these functions include the provision of materials, parts, and tools. Each of these existing or \u201clegacy\u201d systems are built for the task at hand and generally will not include a single standard for sharing data and transmitting information to other legacy systems within the factory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["50","55","60","65","48","35","45","30","40"]},"The inventive system set forth in  represents a shift in the paradigm of modern manufacturing systems. Unlike the past, human hands rarely, if ever, touch the manufactured product. Several are the products, such as, for instance, integrated circuitry chips, where the touch of a human is fatal to the manufacture of the product. Even without consideration of such dangers to the product, humans have proven poorly suited to the transport of products through a factory and thus, factories have removed the human touch. Repetitive motions are the realm of automation. People bring insight, wisdom, and knowledge, collective skill, to the assembly lines.","Here, the inventive system set forth in , presumes minimal human contact with the product. Automated legacy systems handle product transport and assembly. Generally, cameras integrated into the legacy systems give visual information at cutting edges, critical location points, and along lines of part movement. These legacy systems deliver this information to display screens on the equipment or on pendant operator interfaces.","The most striking element of the invention evident in  is the presence of the network gateway  tying all of the legacy systems together. Another term for legacy systems is commercial-off-the-shelf or COTS. Those skilled in the art know several ways to tie such legacy systems together. Articles such as those funded by DARPA Contract F30602-96-C0333 such as: , Timothy Fraser, Lee Badger, and Mark Feldman, published in the Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy; , Calvin Ko, Timothy Fraser, Lee Badger, and Douglas Kilpatrick, published in the Proceedings of the 9th USENIX Security Symposium, Denver, Colo., Aug. 14-17, 2000; --() , Andreas Polze, May 1999, TECHNICAL REPORT, CMU\/SEI-99-TR-001, ESC-TR-99-001; , Daniel Plakosh, Scott Hissam, and Kurt Wallnau, March 1999, COTS-Based Systems Initiative, Technical Note, CMU\/SEI-99-TN-010; --, Robert C.

Sledge, PhD, October 2000.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["68","68","68"]},"To support that browser , the system has a graphic user interface engine such as JAVA. One of the requirements for a suitable engine is that the interface engine be suited to a distributed computer environment. Today, major software makers are fostering an object-oriented view of distributed computing. Any graphic user interface engine apropos to a distributed computer environment will work for such an application and every reference herein to JAVA is intended to include all such engines.","One reason for designating Java as one of the several engines available for this application is that JAVA is a programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the Internet. It was designed to have the \u201clook and feel\u201d of the C++ language, but it is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a Web page. Applets make it possible for a Web page user to interact with the page.","JAVA has portability within a network. The source program is compiled into what Java calls byte code, which can be run anywhere in a network on a server or client that has a Java virtual machine. The Java virtual machine interprets the bytecode into code that will run on the real computer hardware. This means that individual computer platform differences such as instruction lengths can be recognized and accommodated locally just as the program is being executed. Platform-specific versions of your program are no longer needed.","The code is robust, here meaning that, unlike programs written in C++ and perhaps some other languages, the Java objects can contain no references to data external to themselves or other known objects. This ensures that an instruction cannot contain the address of data storage in another application or in the operating system itself, either of which would cause the program and perhaps the operating system itself to terminate or \u201ccrash.\u201d The Java virtual machine makes a number of checks on each object to ensure integrity.","Java is object-oriented, which means that, among other characteristics, an object can take advantage of being part of a class of objects and inherit code that is common to the class. Objects are thought of as \u201cnouns\u201d that a user might relate to rather than the traditional procedural \u201cverbs.\u201d A method can be thought of as one of the object's capabilities or behaviors. For these reasons, JAVA stands as one among the candidates for operation as the Graphic User Interface.","Extending from the Graphic User Interface Generator  to the Networking Infrastructure  is a Structured Data Exchange . The Structured Data Exchange  is the mediating language between the several legacy systems within the distributed computer environment. If the Graphic User Interface  is the two-way communications portal between the system and the individual user, there must be a translation means between the uniform language of the graphic user interface  that will interpret the signals the interface generates into requests for the legacy programs as objects.","One means of enabling this system is to \u201cobjectify\u201d the legacy programs. If a user click on a screen evokes the projection of the parts catalogue on the screen, the Graphic User Interface Generator  will generate a code in terms that will generally be uniform over the page. Once the code identifies a function, the Structured Data Exchange  develops a uniform means of packaging the request as a request for an object. Doing so requires two things to occur. First, the system designer must make the requests uniform across all platforms. Second, the responses to those requests must be uniform across all platforms. If, for instance, there exist two definitions for a part (distinct as it appears in each of two legacy programs), that part must have a definition that reflects one or the other of the definitions, or, itself, is a third definition. Implicit is a lookup table that allows the translation of uniform part definition into the remaining definitions necessary so that the part in one program means the part in another program and means the part across the system. The Structured Data Exchange  will use that uniform language.","The network infrastructure  is any such network structure as in common use. In information technology, a network is a series of points or node interconnected by communication paths. Networks can interconnect with other networks and contain sub-networks.","The most common topology or general configurations of networks include the bus, star, and token ring topologies. Networks can also be characterized in terms of spatial distance as local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN), and wide area networks (WAN).","Another classification for a given network is the type of data transmission technology in use on it (for example, a TCP\/IP or Systems Network Architecture network). The network might carry voice, data, or both kinds of signals; the network might be public or private; the network might be either dial-up or switched, dedicated or non-switched, or virtual connections; and by the types of physical links (for example, optical fiber, coaxial cable, and Unshielded Twisted Pair). Large telephone networks and networks using their infrastructure (such as the Internet) have sharing and exchange arrangements with other companies so that larger networks are created. All of these are possible platforms for this system; each platform is qualified by using appropriate protocols.","The network is the central trunk of the system. The several components, the browser , the graphic user interface , and the structured data exchange , have as their purpose the translation of the user requests to computer-readable requests on the network . The remaining components have a rough symmetry in purpose, facilitating communication between the legacy servers  and the network interface . Set forth in the diagram are several of the most common means of facilitating the conversation between these legacy servers  and the network .","CORBA is a very common means of \u201cwrapping\u201d legacy software.","Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is an architecture and specification for creating, distributing, and managing distributed program objects in a network. It allows programs at different locations and developed by different vendors to communicate in a network through an \u201cinterface broker.\u201d CORBA was developed by a consortium of vendors through the Object Management Group (OMG), which currently includes over 500 member companies. Both International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and X\/Open have sanctioned CORBA as the standard architecture for distributed objects (which are also known as components). CORBA 3 is the latest level.","The essential concept in CORBA is the Object Request Broker (ORB) . ORB  support in a network of clients and servers on different computers means that a client program (which may itself be an object) can request services from a server program or object without having to understand where the server is in a distributed network or what the interface to the server program looks like. To make requests or return replies between the ORBs , programs use internal API's , either the General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) and, for the Internet, its Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP). IIOP maps GIOP requests and replies to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer in each computer. An application program interface (\u201cAPI\u201d and sometimes spelled application programming interface) is the specific method prescribed by a computer operating system or by an application program by which a programmer writing an application program can make requests of the operating system or another application.","Another means of connecting legacy servers  to the network through wrappers . In programming, a wrapper  is a program or script that sets the stage and make possible the running of another, more important program. Wrappers  can \u201cobjectify\u201d legacy programs. By wrapping the access to these legacy servers, the servers operate within their own environment while the wrappers may simulate the interactions that a logged in user would normally supply to the system. The wrapper  mediates the language of the legacy server  and the structured data exchange .","Still another means is to work around the legacy software by creating a data browser. For many high level data sets, such as those constructed in a computer assisted drafting program, it is not necessary to invoke all aspects of a very complex software, nor is it desirable. Once the design engineers have fully defined the product, access to the design plans should be on a read only basis. Data browsers  look past the software to the data to inform the system. Autodesk\u00ae offers such a viewer known as Volo View\u00ae. It is within the scope of programmers skilled in the art to readily draft source code for such viewers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"For each user logging on to the system, the system must impart security levels for each of the legacy servers consistent with the user's role in production. Each role evokes a constellation of log-ins to the several servers unique to that role. With each of the legacy servers, there exists a level of access and that level of access might be variable across the servers.","The role definition screen as portrayed in  allows a system administrator access through the browser  with a standard browser screen . On that screen, the administrator defines an association between a user and the roles appropriate for that user. In a preferred embodiment, the roles are displayed in a matrix, as shown . The matrix is a detail view of the look-up table. In this instance, the matrix portrays some of the NC Machine Shop Operators, the Assembly Mechanics, and the Quality Improvement Inspectors. Among the names set out as an example is the operator , John Smith , with the log-on user account bjs2774 . The association between these three identity elements role-name-user account, defines the constellation of security rights for John Smith. Beyond that, as Mr. Smith is an operator the computer now knows a great deal more about him.","When Mr. Smith logs in on a job, the computer knows what assignments Mr. Smith will receive. Beyond that, because of associations stored within the computer between assignments or tasks and tools, the computer is aware of the necessary tools and materials. Still further, the computer can provide, at the browser detailed pictorial instructions showing the best method stored therein for completing the task. The computer obviates the needs to sign into the tool crib to check out tools, to request materials for the task, to requisition cutters, and to look up assembly instructions. All of this is possible because of the association between Mr. Smith and his role.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["118","120","122","124","155"]},"Within this page are many of the elements set forth to assist and to organize the employee. Primary among these is the organizer element comprising the e-mail browser  and the calendar . In this embodiment, the elements draw from software such as Microsoft Exchange\u00ae  and Microsoft Schedule+ , though any commercially available software would serve with equal facility.","Apart from the several organizer elements, the Personal Portal is user-customizable. Mr. Smith  has included links to his benefits page  from the Human Resources Department; the Company Stock ticker ; the Dow Smith Index ticker ; and a series of bookmarks . He has also added news links such as Reuter's Headlines ; Yahoo News ; the local weather ; his personal investment portfolio ; and the box scores for Kansas City .

For any single part, the catalogue can present the part number, a verbose description, a due date, an estimated completion date, book time for production, an operation code, and the assignment to Mr. Smith, the status report, and for whom the part might be held. This information would normally exist in manuals or in stovepipe information systems at the assignment desk for reference. By lowering the threshold to this information, the manufacturer assures the ease of checking. Lowering this threshold, in turn, assures better quality control.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"181"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["170","170"]},"Not only will the system inform the actions of machinists and machinery operators but also those assembling the various machined parts.  portrays the actual placement of the parts with instructions filled with photographs .

In , the operator reviews the quality control report  as quickly as the inspectors generate it.

Mr. Smith logs on through his laptop  onto the gateway  to get the access unique to Mr. Smith's needs. The constellation of servers will allow Mr. Smith to log onto the job with Timekeeping ; to get materials from workcenter management ; and, all of the data from the necessary servers , ,  and . As a final example, though not intended to limit the range of the uses for the system,  presents servers available to Mr. Smith's lead machinist. This, too, is a unique constellation of servers available according to the known needs of the lead machinist.","As previously stated, the paradigm of the inventive system is to wrap the individual employees in a single unified interface allowing them to interact with the factory through a single unified browser portal. Understanding this paradigm, one can readily see that remote construction is possible by full exploitation of the inventive system. By use of this remote construction, skilled employees can be isolated from the environmental concerns of the shop floor. Where, for instance, noise or the presence of noxious fumes are a concern, the invention will allow these skilled employees to work removed from the noise or fumes. Indeed, where the vagaries of the labor market require it, the manufacturer might hire the skilled employees in an area where such employees are available, and the manufacturer might provide a remote factory control center close to the employee's residence while the work is done on a shop floor thousands of miles away.","Not only does the system curtail and tailor permissions, access and security for the various users, but additionally, the process can automate all of the necessary administrative support for their work. Inherent in the system is not only the knowledge of who is using the system, but for what they wanted to use it. To aid them in that, the system will log them onto and off the various servers necessary based upon the principal log-in. Extending that same principle, the system can order tools without waiting for the specific order from the user.
