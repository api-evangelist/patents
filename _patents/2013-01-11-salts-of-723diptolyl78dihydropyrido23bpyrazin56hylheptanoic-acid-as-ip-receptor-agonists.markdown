Exogenous administration of an agonist of the IP receptor has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH.

A crystalline form of this salt has been found to entrap a significant amount of solvent in the crystal structure which is only released upon melting. Furthermore, and especially importantly, as mentioned above, certain sulfonic acid esters are known to exert genotoxic effects and great care must be taken to minimise and preferably prevent their synthesis during drug substance production and storage. Consequently the mesylate salt of 7-(2,3-di-p-tolyl-7,8-dihyrdro-pyrido[2,3-b]pyrazin-5(6H)-yl)heptanoic acid is difficult to formulate, especially as an inhalable dry powder.","The Applicant investigated a large number of alternative salts to address the aforementioned issues noted in formulating the compound.

In particular, the compounds are suitable as IP receptor agonists and may be tested in the following assays.","Activity of compounds at the IP receptor (IP receptor) is assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation in CHO cells stably expressing the IP receptor (CHO-IP) using the PerkinElmer AlphaScreen assay. This technology measures the endogenous production of cAMP, in a non-radioactive luminescence proximity homogenous assay. A biological reaction occurs between streptavidin coated donor beads, biotinylated cAMP and anti-cAMP acceptor beads, bringing the donor and acceptor beads close enough together so that upon excitation a fluorescence signal is produced. On production of endogenous cAMP, competition between the biotinylated cAMP and cellular-derived cAMP causes a reduction in the fluorescent signal. The reduction in signal is proportional to the amount of cAMP being produced, thus it is possible to quantify the amount of cAMP being produced on stimulation with agonist.","Test and reference compounds are prepared at 100\u00d7[final] in 100% DMSO, and diluted 1:3 using a Biomek Fx (Beckman Coulter). This is followed by an intermediate dilution to give 5\u00d7[final] in assay buffer (HBSS containing 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w\/v) BSA). 5 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7[final] test compounds, reference compounds and buffer\/DMSO control are then transferred to a 384-well white OptiPlate, containing 20 \u03bcL CHO-IP cell suspension (15,000 cells\/well, prepared from frozen), and plate is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. A cAMP standard curve is constructed for each experiment (concentration range of 10000 nM to 0.001 nM, in assay buffer) and 25 \u03bcL of each concentration added to the last two columns of the assay plate. The incubation is terminated by the addition of lysis buffer (dHO; 0.3% (v v) Tween-20) containing 20 units mLstreptavidin coated donor beads and biotinylated cAMP (pre-incubated for 30 minutes) and 20 units mLanti-cAMP acceptor beads, which are added to the lysis buffer just before addition to the assay plate. The assay plate is then incubated at room temperature in the dark, for 60 minutes with gentle shaking, and read on the Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).","The raw data of the reference compounds, test compounds and controls are converted into cAMP concentrations, using the cAMP standard curve, in GraphPadPrism (GraphPad Software Inc). ECas well as maximal values of the agonist curves are determined using a 4-parameter logistic equation. The % maximum response values of all test compounds are determined using the top of the treprostinil concentration-response curve.","7-(2,3-di-p-tolyl-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-b]pyrazin-5(6H)-yl)heptanoic acid has an ECvalue in the data measurements described above of 0.00011 \u03bcM.","Therapeutic Use","The present invention also provides a method of treating a condition or disease that is affected by the activation of the IP receptor comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect or embodiments (i)-(vii) of the first aspect.","The present invention also concerns the use of a compound as defined in the first aspect or embodiments (i)-(vii) of the first aspect for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition or disease that is affected by the activation of the IP receptor.","The present invention also provides compounds as defined in the first aspect or embodiments (i)-(vii) of the first aspect in salt or solvate form for use in the treatment of a condition or disease that is affected by the activation of the IP receptor.","The compounds as defined in the first aspect or embodiments (i)-(vii) of the first aspect, hereinafter referred to alternatively as \u201cagents of the invention\u201d activate the IP receptor and are useful in the treatment of several diseases and disorders, and in the amelioration of symptoms thereof.","Without limitation, conditions or diseases that are affected by the activation of the IP receptor include pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), conditions related to platelet aggregation, atherosclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperglycemia, inflammatory conditions and fibrosis. In certain preferred embodiments the condition or disease affected by the activation of the IP receptor is pulmonary arterial hypertension.","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has a multifactorial pathobiology. Vasoconstriction, remodeling of the pulmonary vessel wall, and thrombosis contribute to increased pulmonary vascular resistance in PAH (Humbert et al, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 2004, 43:13 S-24S.).

The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of symptoms of PAH.","Antiplatelet Therapies (Conditions Related to Platelet Aggregation)","Antiplatelet agents (antiplatelets) are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example, in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots (e.g., coronary thrombosis).","In a myocardial infarction, the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward (preferably within 30 min), antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.","A transient ischemic attack (\u201cTIA\u201d or \u201cmini-stroke\u201d) is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries, usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs. Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain, pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen-rich blood flow (ischemia) to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina, antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.","Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high-risk patients, taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes. Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure(s).","Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery, rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation, the atria (the heart's upper chambers) rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain (embolism).","There is evidence that an IP receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy (see, e.g., Moncada et al., 1977, 1:18-20). It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the IP receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis (Murata et al, 1997, 388:678-682).","IP receptor agonists can be used to treat, for example, claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications, arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction caused by serotonin, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement. (See, e.g., Fetalvero et al, 2007, 82:109-118; Arehart et al, 2007, 14:2161-2169; Davi et al, 2007, 357:2482-2494; Fetalvero et al, 2006, 290:H1337-H1346; Murata et al, 1997, 388:678-682; Wang et al, 2006, 103:14507-14512; Xiao et al, 2001, 104:2210-2215; McCormick et al, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 2007, 35:910-911; Arehart et al, Circ. Res., 2008 Mar. 6.).","IP receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy, for example, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention, and the like, including complications resulting therefrom. IP receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with, for example, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), echistatin (a disintegrin) or, in states of hypercoagulability, heparin. (See, e.g., Chan., J. Nutr., 1998, 128:1593-1596; Mardla et al, Platelets, 2004, 15:319-324; Bernabei et al, Ann. Thorac. Surg., 1995, 59:149-153; Gainza et al, J. Nephrol., 2006, 19:648-655.)","The IP receptor agonists disclosed herein provide beneficial improvement in microcirculation to patients in need of antiplatelet therapy by antagonizing the vasoconstrictive products of the aggregating platelets in, for example and not limited to the indications described above.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for reducing platelet aggregation in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising an IP receptor agonist disclosed herein.

It is the leading cause of mortality in many countries, including the United States. Atherosclerosis, as the term is used herein, shall be understood to encompass disorders of large and medium-sized arteries that result in the progressive accumulation within the intima of smooth muscle cells and lipids.","It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can confer protection from atherosclerosis, such as from atherothrombosis (Arehart et al., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Stitham et al., 2007, 82:95-108; Fries et al., 2005, 445-451; Egan et al., 2004, 306:1954-1957; Kobayashi et al., 2004, 114:784-794; Arehart et al., 2008 Mar. 6). It has been shown that defective IP receptor signaling appears to accelerate atherothrombosis in humans, i e that an agonist of the IP receptor can confer protection from atherothrombosis in humans (Arehart et al., 2008 Mar. 6.)","The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof.

In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of atherosclerosis in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising an IP receptor agonist disclosed herein.","Asthma","Asthma is a lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory airway disorder characterised by airway eosinophilia, increased mucus production by goblet cells, and structural remodeling of the airway wall. The prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased worldwide in recent decades. It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the IP receptor in mice augments allergic airway inflammation (Takahashi et al., 2002, 137:315-322). It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can suppress not only the development of asthma when given during the sensitization phase, but also the cardinal features of experimental asthma when given during the challenge phase (Idzko et al., 2007, 117:464-72, Nagao et al., 2003, 29:314-320), at least in part through markedly interfering with the function of antigen-presenting dendnuc cells within the airways (Idzko et al., 2007, 117:464-472; Zhou et al., 2007, 178:702-710; Jaffar et al., 2007, 179:6193-6203; Jozefowski et al., 2003, 3:865-878). These cells are crucial for both the initiation and the maintenance phases of allergic asthma, as depletion of airway dendritic cells during secondary challenge in sensitized mice abolished all characteristic features of asthma, an effect that could be completely restored by adoptive transfer of wild-type dendritic cells (van Rijt et al., 2005, 201:981-991). It has also been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by human alveolar macrophages (Raychaudhuri et al., 2002, 277:33344-33348). The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of asthma, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a IP receptor agonist disclosed herein.","In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a IP receptor agonist disclosed herein.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Activation of the IP-receptor may also be beneficial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Taprostene, an IP-receptor agonist, suppressed the generation of the CD8+ T cell chemoattractants CXCL9 and CXCL10 from human airway epithelial cells in vitro (Ayer, L. M., S. M. Wilson, S. L. Traves, D. Proud, M. A. Giembycz. 2008324: 815-826.). Beraprost, an IP-receptor agonist, protected rats against the development of experimental cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, possibly by means of a concerted inhibitory action on alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis, oxidative burden, matrix metalloproteinase expression, and proinflammatory cytokine generation. (Chen, Y., M. Hanaoka, P. Chen, Y. Droma, N. F. Voelkel, K. Kubo. 2009296: L648-L656.)","In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating COPD in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising IP receptor agonist disclosed herein.","Hyperglycemia","Although hyperglycemia is the major cause for the pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), enhanced vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation in diabetic patients has also been implicated to play a role in disease progression (Cameron et al., 2003, 367:607-614). Agonists of the IP receptor promote vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. Improving microvascular blood flow is able to benefit diabetic complications (Cameron, 2001, 44:1973-1988).","It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can prevent and reverse motor and sensory peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (Cotter et al., 1993, 347:534-540).

(2006, 83: 1359-1365), and Hotta et al. (1996, 45:361-366). It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can reduce increased tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF-[alpha]) levels in diabetic patients, implying that an agonist of the IP receptor may contribute to the prevention of progression in diabetic complications (Fujiwara et al, 2004, 112:390-394).","Evidence that topical administration of an agonist of the IP receptor can result in a decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits and dogs and thereby have beneficial effect in the treatment of glaucoma is given by Hoyng et al. (Hoyng et al, 1987, 28:470-476).","Agonists of the IP receptor have been shown to have activity for regulation of vascular tone, for vasodilation, and for amelioration of pulmonary hypertension (see, e.g., Strauss et al, 2007, 28:127-142; Driscoll et al, 2008, 9:65-81). Evidence for a beneficial effect of an agonist of the IP receptor in the treatment of hypertension is given by Yamada et al. (2008, 29:412-418).

It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can inhibit a chemokine (CCL 17)-induced chemotaxis of leukocytes (CD4<+>Th2 T cells) (Jaffar et al, 2007, 179:6193-6203). It has been shown that an agonist of the IP receptor can confer protection from atherosclerosis, such as from atherothrombosis (Arehart et al, 2007, 14:2161-2169; Stitham et al, 2007, 82:95-108; Fries et al, 2005, 445-451; Egan et al, 2004, 306:1954-1957; Kobayashi et al, 2004, 114:784-794; Arehart et al, 2008 Mar. 6).
