title: Method and system of extracting label:value data from a document
abstract: This disclosure provides an exemplary method and system for extracting structured label and value pairwise textual data from a textual document. According to an exemplary method, initially a layout analysis is performed resulting in one or more alternatives for grouping and ordering the textual elements of interest. Next, textual elements are tagged as including a label term, a value term or a label and value term. Finally, a sequence-based method is applied to the tagged elements to generate one or more sequence listings representative of the label and value pairwise data structure(s) and label:value pairwise data is extracted.

Specifically, according to an exemplary embodiment, a method and system is provided to extract data from a document including a tabulated layout, e.g., forms, invoices, etc.","While the use of electronically created and recorded documents is prevalent, many such electronic documents are in a form that does not permit them to be used other than for viewing or printing. To provide greater accessibility to the content of such documents, it is desirable to understand their structure. However, when electronic documents are recovered by scanning a hardcopy representation or by recovering an electronic representation, e.g., PDF (Portable Document Format) or Postscript representation, a loss of document structure usually results because the representation of the document is either at a very low level, e.g., bitmap, or an intermediate level, e.g., a document formatted in a page description language or a portable document format.","Geometric or physical page layout analysis can be used to recognize the different elements of a page, often in terms of text regions and image regions. Methods are known for determining a document's logical structure, or the order in which objects are laid out on a document image, i.e., layout objects. Such methods exploit the geometric or typographical features of document image objects, sometimes using of the content of objects and a priori knowledge of page layout for a particular document class. Geometric page layout analysis (GPLA) algorithms have been developed to recognize different elements of a page, often in terms of text blocks and image blocks. Examples of such algorithms include the X-Y Cut algorithm, described by Nagy et al., \u201cA PROTOTYPE DOCUMENT IMAGE ANALYSIS SYSTEM FOR TECHNICAL JOURNALS\u201d, CSE Journal Article, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, pages 10-22, July, 1992 and the Smearing algorithm, described by Wong et al., \u201cDocument analysis system\u201d, IBM Journal of Research and Development, volume 26, No. 6, pages 647-656, November, 1982. These GPLA algorithms receive as input a page image and perform a segmentation based on information, such as pixel information, gathered from the page. These approaches to element recognition are either top-down or bottom-up and mainly aim to delimit boxes of text or images in a page. These methods are useful for segmenting pages one dimensionally, into columns.","In addition, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/911,452, filed Jun. 6, 2013, by Herv\u00e9 D\u00e9jean, entitled \u201cMETHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR GENERATION OF DOCUMENT STRUCTURES BASED ON SEQUENTIAL CONSTRAINTS\u201d, a method and system is provided that structures a sequentially-ordered set of elements, each being characterized by a set of features. N-grams, i.e., a sequence of n features, are computed from a set for n contiguous elements, and n-grams which are repetitive, e.g., Kleene cross, are selected. Elements matching the most frequent repetitive n-gram are grouped together under a new node, and a new sequence is created. The method is iteratively applied to this new sequence. The output is an ordered set of trees.","A common task in document analysis is extracting data from an unstructured document, sometimes referred to as indexing. The extracted data can correspond to a single piece of text, such as an invoice number, or to structured data including several fields, such as an invoice item having a description, price per unit, total amount, etc. For purposes of this disclosure, this structured data is referred to as sdata (structured data).","A primary issue in extracting structured data is the lack of correspondence between the sdata\/data fields and the way their layout is performed, except for documents which mostly follow a layout template such as forms. In some documents, one homogeneous block can contain all the data fields. In another document, each field may be spread over table cells. No generic algorithm can systematically provide segmentation where found layout elements correspond to a single sdata. An analysis combining layout information and content information is then required to identify complete sdata.","This disclosure provides a method and system to extract data from documents including a tabulated layout, such as forms, especially invoices. The method and system targets a specific data type called label:value, the label part corresponding to a string representing the data label, associated to its value part.","U.S. Pat.

More specifically, the extracted data is structured as a label:value pair, to provide semantic interpretation of the underlying knowledge conveyed by the form.","More specifically, presented in this disclosure is a method and system for extracting data from forms, e.g., invoices. According to an exemplary method, a specific data type referred to as a Label:value is targeted, the label part corresponding to a text string representing a corresponding data label, associated to its value part.","While the detailed description provided herein specifically addresses exemplary embodiments including the extraction of information from forms, it is to be understood the disclosed method and systems of extracting information apply to documents including a tabular layout in general.","Initially, textual and graphical elements are extracted from an input document such as an image document or native digital document. Then, layout structure candidates are generated where one element may belong to several layout structures, where the layout structure candidates are generated using content and graphical elements associated with the input document. Then, content corresponding to information labels is tagged.","The disclosed method and system only applies to information represented by a label:value structure. Given a set of information to be extracted, referred to as targeted information, a best match assignment is completed between targeted information and all extracted label:value pairs.","As briefly explained in the background section, a specific field of data extraction is invoice data processing where information is extracted from scanned invoices. One current approach relies on templates to extract targeted information. However, in many situations this approach is not usable because of the number of templates required. A second approach is to extract data by spotting data on a page. This basic method initially matches an information label using text string matching and regular expressions. Then, the method defines a zone around the matched text string and finds in this zone a value potentially compliant with the information type. Some positional constraints can be added, such as \u201clook for information on the first page\u201d top, etc. See Bill Janssen, Eric Saund, Eric Bier, Patricia Wall, and Mary Ann Sprague, article entitled \u201cReceipts2go: The Big World of Small Documents\u201d, In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng '12), Sep. 4-7, 2012, 4 pages. Similarly, \u201camount\u201d key phrases that indicate a total are required to appear \u201cAbove\u201d or \u201cLeftOf\u201d a currency amount entity in order to be associated with it. One drawback of this approach, which extracts data locally, is only a near context is used, which does not provide a way to assess its confidence, i.e., the \u201cnear\u201d context can be far away. Furthermore, as the size of the set of matching rules increase, support becomes complicated.","The method and system of extracting pairwise data described herein is applied to extract information referred to as label:value information. Within a form, a customary manner of presenting data is to associate a term, i.e., label, and its respective value. The layout of label:value information can vary where a list or tabulated structure with various cell granularities is presented in a form document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"With reference to , described now are the steps of an exemplary method of extracting label:value pairwise data.","Step A) Text extraction : optical character recognition (OCR) for document image, text extraction through an Application Programming Interface (API) for a digital document  such as PDF.","Step B) Graphical segments extraction : image analysis for document image or extraction through an API for digital document .","Step C) Layout Analysis : several layout analyses are performed, using content and graphical lines.","Step D) Content tagging : content is tagged in order to identify labels and values occurrences.

For instance, the concept USlnvoiceNumber is associated with the following textual variations:","InvoiceNumber: \u2018invoice number\u2019, \u2018invoice no\u2019, \u2018invoice #\u2019, \u2018sales invoice\u2019, \u2018bill number\u2019, \u2018freight invoice\u2019, \u2018freight bill number\u2019.","For example, using the canonical designation (InvoiceNumber) and concept instances the terms associated to it ('invoice number', \u2018invoice no\u2019, . . . ).","Notably, this kind of lexical resource is present in similar applications, with one difference: Usually, this lexical resource only focuses on targeted data, i.e., the final dataset to be extracted. Here, this list is extended to any label:value data present in the types of processed documents, especially frequent label:value data. The list is extended for two reasons:","First, identifying most of the labels allows for identifying the label:value structures.","Second, it allows for a better handling of OCR noise. Some OCR quality requires the use of string fuzzy matching between terms and labels. Strings whose edit-distance is above a given threshold are comparable, i.e., treated as equal. While fuzzy-matching allows for mapping noisy strings with a concept, it may also lead in practice to map a string to several concepts, as shown in Table 3 below, listing extracted label strings and associated matched concepts with scores normalized relative to a longest a common string. A strategy is then required to select the best matches. A simple strategy includes selecting the best match among all matches, to validate it, and iterate over the remaining matches ignoring the current matched concept.","Two main difficulties arise from the fact that some terms are very short which biases the edit-distance score (for example vat, ate [noisy], rate, date), and because some terms appear in many concepts, such as invoice, number, hence reducing the edit-distance score. The frequency of the terms invoice and number in the invoice terms is shown.
