No. 12\/104,313, filed Apr. 16, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,887,248 B2, issued Feb. 15, 2011, which claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/913,025, filed Apr. 20, 2007, entitled SWIVEL ATTACHMENT AND BRANCH LINE RESTRAINT. The disclosures of the above-referenced applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to devices for supporting utility loads and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a swivel attachment and\/or branch line restraint device that provides enhanced angular versatility in the connection of installation components to support a pipe, branch line or other load suspended from a support surface, against undesirable sway such as may be caused by seismic disturbances.","2. Description of the Related Art","There are many products and assemblies used by construction, building, plumbing and electrical contractors and workers for bracing and supporting pipes, ducts, sprinkler systems, fans, air-conditioners, electrical cables, communication lines and other loads from ceilings, beams, studs, walls and floors. These products include clamps, braces, cables, hooks, straps, hangers, plates, and brackets, among other items.","Many installations involve the coupling or connection of components which are angularly offset relative to one another. Typical devices used to provide such orientations have several drawbacks.","In many cases, a number of installation components have to be utilized to provide the desired installation structure. Disadvantageously, the use of numerous such components not only adds to the cost, but also undesirably adds to the installation time, which further adds to the overall cost.","In several cases, conventional installation components used for connection purposes can lack the desired degree of versatility to provide a reliable and\/or compact installation. In these cases, custom components may have to be manufactured in an attempt to achieve the desired goal. Again this undesirably adds to the overall cost, and may also disadvantageously not provide for efficient use and utility.","Many devices commonly used in the industry for connection purposes in an installation can be difficult to install and expensive. Additionally, and undesirably, these devices may not be suited for reliably sustaining loads.","Some embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide a swivel attachment and\/or branch line restraint device with angular versatility and mobility for facilitating connection of installation components to support a pipe or other load relative to a support surface. Advantageously, in accordance with certain embodiments, the device provides a plurality of rotational or swivel degrees of freedom, which are substantially independently controllable, for its mating portions, which respectively engage corresponding mating portions of other installation components. The device provides various embodiments which can desirably be configured in male-female, male-male or female-female arrangements to enhance device utility and\/or versatility, thereby advantageously allowing for use in a myriad of applications, installations, and the like, to reliably sustain loads.","Certain embodiments provide a swivel attachment generally comprising a rotatable barrel, a saddle, a rotatable stud and a connector pin. The rotatable barrel generally comprises a first mating portion that is rotatable relative to a first rotation axis and substantially in a first plane. The saddle generally houses the barrel and generally comprises a slot exposing at least a portion of the first mating portion. The rotatable stud generally comprises a second mating portion that is rotatable relative to a second rotation axis and substantially in a second plane. The connector pin couples the barrel, the saddle and the stud such that the first mating portion and the second mating portion are substantially independently rotatable for connection to respective installation components.","Certain embodiments provide a swivel attachment generally comprising a first portion, a second portion and a coupling mechanism. The first portion generally comprises a rotatable first mating portion. The second portion generally comprises a rotatable second mating portion. The coupling mechanism is substantially intermediate the first portion and the second portion, and connects the first portion and the second portion to provide or enable substantially independent rotation between the first mating portion and the second mating portion.","Certain embodiments provide a method of supporting a load using a swivel attachment. The method generally comprises rotating a first portion of the swivel attachment and matingly connecting the first portion to a first installation component wherein the first portion generally comprises a first mating portion. A second portion of the swivel attachment is rotated and matingly connected to a second installation component wherein the second portion generally comprises a second mating portion. The rotating of the first and second portions generally comprises substantially independent rotation between the first mating portion and the second mating portion, and wherein the first installation component is connected to the load and the second installation component is connected to a support structure.","For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages and novel features of the invention have been described herein above. Of course, it is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught or suggested herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.","All of these embodiments are intended to be within the scope of the invention herein disclosed.
