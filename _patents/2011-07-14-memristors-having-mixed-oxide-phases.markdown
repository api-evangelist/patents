{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under Contract No. HR0011-09-3-0001, awarded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The government has certain rights in the invention.","The continuous trend in the development of electronic devices has been to minimize the sizes of the devices and to improve functionalities of the devices. While the current generation of commercial microelectronics are based on submicron design rules, significant research and development efforts are directed towards exploring devices on the nano-scale, with the dimensions of the devices often measured in nanometers or tens of nanometers. In addition to the significant reduction of individual device size and much higher packing density as compared to microscale devices, nanoscale devices may also provide new functionalities due to physical phenomena on the nanoscale that are not observed on the micron scale.","For instance, electronic switching in nanoscale devices using titanium oxide as the switching material has recently been reported. The resistive switching behavior of such a device has been linked to the memristor circuit element theory originally predicted in 1971 by L. O. Chua. The discovery of the memristive behavior in the nanoscale switch has generated significant interest, and there are substantial on-going research efforts to further develop such nanoscale switches and to implement them in various applications. One of the many important potential applications is to use such a switching device as a memory unit to store digital data.","Memristor switch devices, which are often formed of nanoscale metal\/metal oxide\/metal layers, employ an \u201celectroforming\u201d process to enable resistive switching. The electroforming process involves a one-time application of a relatively high voltage or current that produces a significant change of electronic conductivity through the metal oxide layer. The electrical switching arises from the coupled motion of electrons and ions within the oxide material. For example, during the electroforming process, oxygen vacancies can be created and drift towards the cathode, forming localized conducting channels in the oxide. Simultaneously, O ions drift towards the anode where they evolve Ogas and cause physical deformation of the junction. The gas eruption often results in physical deformation of the oxide, such as bubbles, near the locations where the conducting channels form, and the delamination between oxide and electrode. The conducting channels formed through the electroforming process often have a wide variance of properties depending on how the electroforming process occurred. This variance of properties has relatively limited the adoption of metal oxide switches in computing devices.","In addition, in order to be competitive with CMOS FLASH memories, the emerging resistive switches need to have a switching endurance that exceeds at least millions of switching cycles. Reliable switching channels inside the device may significantly improve the endurance of these switches.","Reference is now made in detail to specific examples of the disclosed memristor having mixed oxide phases and specific examples of ways for creating the disclosed memristor having mixed oxide phases. When applicable, alternative examples are also briefly described.","As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","As used in this specification and the appended claims, \u201capproximately\u201d and \u201cabout\u201d mean a \u00b110% variance caused by, for example, variations in manufacturing processes.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the drawings accompanying this disclosure, which illustrate specific examples in which this disclosure may be practiced. The components of the examples can be positioned in a number of different orientations and any directional terminology used in relation to the orientation of the components is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. Directional terminology includes words such as \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cbottom,\u201d \u201cfront,\u201d \u201cback,\u201d \u201cleading,\u201d \u201ctrailing,\u201d etc. Herein, the term \u2018about\u2019 when applied to a value generally means plus or minus 10% unless otherwise expressly specified. Moreover, examples herein are intended to be illustrative only and are presented for discussion purposes and not by way of limitation.","It is to be understood that other examples in which this disclosure may be practiced exist, and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense. Instead, the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims.","Memristors are nano-scale devices that may be used as a component in a wide range of electronic circuits, such as memories, switches, and logic circuits and functions. When used as a basis for memories, the memristor may be used to store a bit of information, 1 or 0. In a memory structure, a crossbar array of memristors may be used. When used as a logic circuit, the memristor may be employed as bits in a logic circuit that resembles a Field Programmable Gate Array, or may be the basis for a wired-logic Programmable Logic Array.","When used as a switch, the memristor may either be a closed or open switch in a cross-point memory. Throughout the last few years, researchers have made great progress to improve the switching efficiency of these memristors. For example, tantalum oxide (TaO)-based memristors have demonstrated superior endurance over other nanoscale devices capable of electronic switching. In lab settings, tantalum oxide-based memristors have demonstrated over 10 billion switching cycles whereas other memristors, such as tungsten oxide (WO) or titanium oxide (TiO) based memristors, require a sophisticated feedback mechanism for avoiding over-driving the devices or an additional step of refreshing the devices with stronger voltage pulses in order to obtain an endurance in the range of 10 million switching cycles.","TaO-based memristors with such superior endurance may be a candidate for non-volatile memory applications. Multilevel cells with TaOare one feasible solution to achieve ultra-high density memory. By \u201cmulti-level\u201d is meant that bits are stored as different resistance levels in chip cells, and these levels are changed by applying a voltage to the cells. TaO, for example, has an almost unlimited number of intermediate states between fully ON and fully OFF.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","108","110"]},"Memristors using TaOalone have shown exceptionally high endurance (>10cycles) and have stable ON and OFF states, but the intermediate states have been found to be meta-stable, resulting in a jump of the memristor to the ON state after only hours of operation. This effect is apparently due to diffusion of the mobile species (O) in the TaOlayer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A and 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","202","204","202","202"]},"The ON state appears to be stable. Also, intermediate states smaller than 8 K\u03a9 appear to be stable.","Without subscribing to any particular theory, it appears that either thermal or electrical perturbations may cause the instability in the intermediate states. Such instability leads to reduced retention and reliability. Essentially, the diffusion or drift of the mobile species (O) in the TaOmaterial is too high.","An example of the device exhibiting the instability of intermediate states is depicted in . The device  includes a bottom, or first, electrode , a metal oxide layer, or switching layer, , and a top, or second, electrode .","In an example, the bottom electrode  may be platinum having a thickness of about 10 to 100 nm, the metal oxide  may be tantalum oxide (TaO) having a thickness of about 3 to 20 nm, and the top electrode  may be tantalum having a thickness of about 10 to 100 nm. The thickness range for the bottom electrode  includes nano scale crossbar devices.","In some examples, the switching function of the memristor is achieved in the switching layer . In general, the switching layer  is a weak ionic conductor that is semiconducting and\/or insulating without dopants. These materials can be doped by native dopants, such as oxygen vacancies or impurity dopants (e.g. intentionally introducing different metal ions into the switching layer ). The resulting doped materials are electrically conductive because the dopants are electrically charged and mobile under an electric field that may be assisted by Joule heating. Accordingly, the concentration profile of the dopants inside the switching layer  can be reconfigured by electric fields, leading to the resistance change of the device under electric fields, namely, electrical switching.","In some examples, the switching layer  may include a transition metal oxide, such as tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, or other like oxides, or may include a metal oxide, such as aluminum oxide, calcium oxide, or magnesium oxide, or other like oxides. In one example, the switching layer  may include the oxide form of the metal of one of the electrodes , . In alternate examples, the material of switching layer  may be ternary oxides, quaternary oxides, or other complex oxides, such as strontium titanate oxide (STO) or praseodymium calcium manganese oxide (PCMO). In yet other examples, the switching layer  may include nitrides and\/or sulfides.","An annealing process or other thermal forming process, such as heating by exposure to a high temperature environment or by exposure to electrical resistance heating or other suitable processes, may be employed to form one or more switching channels  in the switching layer  to cause localized atomic modification in the switching layer. In some examples, the conductivity of the switching channels may be adjusted by applying different biases across the first electrode  and the second electrode . In other examples, the switching layer  may be singularly configurable. In yet other examples, the memristor's switching layer  may be a single layer, a bi-layer, or a multi-layer structure. For example, in a bi-layer structure, the device can have a relatively thin mixed metal oxide layer (for example, about 3 to 6 nm thick) and a relatively thick heavily reduced oxide layer (for example, about 10 to 200 nm thick). In these examples, also known as forming-free memristors, no process for forming a switching channel(s) is needed, since the oxide layer is so thin that there is no need to apply a high voltage or heat to form the switching channel(s). The voltage applied during normal operation of the switch is sufficient for forming a switching channel.","In one example, the memristor may be switched OFF and ON when oxygen or metal atoms move in the electric field, resulting in the reconfiguration of the switching channel in the switching layer . Particularly, when the atoms move such that the formed switching channel  reaches from the first electrode  to the second electrode  (as shown in ), the memristor is in the ON state and has a relatively low resistance to the voltage supplied between the first electrode and the second electrode. Likewise, when the atoms move such that the formed switching channel  has a gap known as the switching region (not shown) between the first electrode  and the second electrode , the memristor is in the OFF state and has a relatively high resistance to the voltage supplied between the first electrode and the second electrode. In some examples, more than one switching channel may be formed in the switching layer .","The switching layer  may be between the first electrode  and the second electrode . In some examples, the first electrode  and the second electrode  may include any conventional electrode material. Examples of conventional electrode materials may include, but are not limited to, aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), gold (Au), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), ruthenium oxide (RuO), silver (Ag), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W), and tungsten nitride (WN).","In accordance with the teachings herein, the immunity to thermal or electrical perturbation is improved in the intermediate states by slowing down the diffusion or drift of the mobile species (O) in the TaOmaterial. The result is improved retention and reliability.","One way to slow down the diffusion or drift of the mobile species is to add another (at least one), thermodynamically more stable metal oxide into the TaOmaterial. For convenience, the less stable metal oxide (here, TaO, may be referred to as the \u201cfirst metal oxide\u201d and the more stable metal oxide may be referred to as the \u201csecond metal oxide\u201d. By \u201cthermodynamically more stable\u201d is meant an oxide having stronger chemical bonds. Specifically, the free energy of formation of the more stable metal oxide (second metal oxide) is more negative than the free energy of formation of the less stable metal oxide (first metal oxide). Examples of such materials that are thermodynamically more stable than TaOinclude, but are not limited to, SiO, AlO, HfO, ZrO, CaO, TiO, BO, LiO, MgO, and YO. In an example, the second metal oxide may be SiOalone, AlOalone, or a mixture of SiOand AlO.","Likewise, these teachings may be extended to other metal oxides. Examples of such metal oxides and additional oxides, or second metal oxides, that are thermodynamically more stable than the metal oxides, or first metal oxides, are listed in the Table below. One or more of the additional metal oxides may be added to the first metal oxide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["METAL OXIDE (FIRST","ADDITIONAL OXIDE (SECOND"]},{"entry":["METAL OXIDE)","METAL OXIDE)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["WO","SiO, TiO, CaO, ZrO, HfO, or YO"]},{"entry":["TiO","CaO, ZrO, HfO, or YO"]},{"entry":["HfO","LaO, SmO, or SrO"]},{"entry":["ErO","SmO"]},{"entry":["YO","SrO"]},{"entry":["ZrO","LaO, SmO, or SrO"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In all cases, the use of \u201cx\u201d in \u201cO\u201d is the oxygen\/metal ratio in the oxide, or the number of oxygen atoms per metal atom (i.e., where x=2.5 is equivalent to TaO=TaO). This is in contrast to the use of \u201cx\u201d in a metal oxide formula such as TaO(or TaO), in which case \u201cx\u201d is used to denote the oxygen deficiency from TaO. In the latter case, the value of x may be less than about 0.2.","In all cases, the metal oxide\/additional oxide system may have the following features: (1) only two stable solid phases are formed; one phase is relatively resistive and the other is relatively insulative; (2) the resistive phase has a certain amount of oxygen solubility. In particular, the oxygen solubility may range up to about 70 at %. While the oxygen solubility in the resistive phase would be about 22 at % in the bulk state, higher solubility may be achieved in a resistive phase that is in the nanoscale regime and is amorphous (often referred to as a Fermi glass).","The combination of the metal oxide\/additional oxide need not form two separate phases, although this is one example. The combination may alternatively form a solid solution. In such a case, an amorphous structure may be formed, also called a Fermi glass.","Typically, the amount of additional oxide added is about 30 atomic percent (at %). However, this value may be varied to some extent, so that, depending on the specific oxide systems, in general, the amount of additional oxide added may be in the range of about 10 to 70 at %. Further, more than one additional oxide may be added to achieve the desired result.","Without subscribing to any particular theory, it appears that the added oxide reduces diffusivity of elements within the oxide to stabilize the intermediate states. This effect may be due to a stronger bond between O and the metal in the more thermodynamically stable second metal oxide.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["304","404","404","304","408","308"]},"The memristor shown in  can be either non-crossbar (blank bottom electrode, blank oxide, patterned top electrode), or crossbar (patterned bottom electrode, patterned\/blank oxide, and patterned top electrode).","The combination of the two metal oxides as disclosed herein may lead to ultra-high endurance (greater than 10 billion switching cycles) and retention (due to the presence of the additional metal oxide(s)) at the intermediate states for multi-level cell memory applications.","The mixed oxides may be formed by co-sputtering, sputtering with compounded targets, ALD (atomic layer deposition), alternating layer deposition (another ALD), evaporation with compounded sources, CVD with multiple sources, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","500","500"]},"The bottom, or first, electrode  may be formed , such as by sputtering, evaporation, ALD, co-deposition, chemical vapor deposition, IBAD (ion beam assisted deposition), or any other film deposition technology.
