Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to law enforcement technologies and security, and more particularly to techniques for determining the origin and direction of travel of supersonic projectiles.","2. Description of the Related Art","Systems and methods are known that can determine the general location of the sniper and trajectory of supersonic projectiles, such as bullets and artillery shells, by measuring parameters associated with the shockwave generated by a projectile. Current systems, however, generally require a distributed array of acoustic sensors to detect the arrival times, amplitudes and frequency characteristics of a projectile's shockwave and the muzzle blast from a firearm. In addition, such systems typically require real-time operating systems (e.g., UNIX, LINUX, etc.) and generally require an elaborate time synchronization mechanism so that all the deployed sensors have a common time reference to determine the exact time of arrival for both shockwave and the muzzle blast for supersonic gun fire with common reference time frame.","Conventional systems typically employ an antenna with a plurality of acoustic sensors, which can be relatively closely spaced (e.g., 1 meter apart) or widely dispersed (e.g., mounted on a vehicle or carried by soldiers on a battlefield), with each sensor measuring shockwave pressure omni-directionally at its respective location. One exemplary antenna may include, for example, a total of seven omni-directional microphones, with six microphones distributed over the surface of a sphere (approx. diameter 1 m) and the seventh microphone located in the center of the sphere. Other exemplary antennae employ four microphones arranged in a tetrahedron formation that are amenable to carry on by a person. In general, the microphones in existing systems are arranged in an array configuration and their output is collected by a common data collection unit with a common time reference. Additionally, existing array based sniper localization systems require the orientation of the array with respect to true north to be determined in order to estimate the location of the sniper and the trajectory of the bullet.","Such array based sensors systems, however, are less suitable for man-wearable systems. In addition, when the sensors are distributed, time synchronization among the sensors is critical. If an operating system that is not a real-time operating system is employed (e.g., Windows\u00ae CE operating system), the synchronization among the sensors is not guaranteed. As a result, the time of arrival estimates of different events (e.g., shockwave and the muzzle blast from a firearm) could be off by 1-2 seconds making the localization of the firearm impossible.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment herein provides a system comprising several acoustic sensors distributed over an area, for determining the trajectory of a supersonic projectile and firing position of the trajectory. Each acoustic sensor comprising: an internal clock; an acoustic sensor positioned in a known location and encountering pressure waves generated by the supersonic projectile passing proximate to the acoustic sensor, the acoustic sensor comprising a transducer collecting pressure wave information and generating pressure wave information signals in response to the pressure waves, the pressure wave information signals having a time series information signal calibrated to the internal clock; a first processor processing the time series information signal to provide parameter information for determining the trajectory of the supersonic projectile; the first processor comprising: a shock threshold detector receiving the time series information and recording arrival times of shock wave components of the pressure waves; a blast threshold detector receiving the time series information and recording arrival times and amplitude information of potential blast wave components of the pressure waves; a discrimination processor discriminating the potential blast wave components to classify each of the potential blast wave components as a blast wave, a shock wave, or neither, and storing arrival times of each of the potential blast wave components classified as the blast wave; and a localization estimation processor calculating an estimated trajectory of the projectile based on the blast wave and the shock wave arrival times and calculating an estimated firing position of the projectile.","In such a system, each acoustic sensor would determine the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the muzzle blast and shockwave time of arrivals. These measured TDOAs from several acoustic sensors are used to estimate the location of the sniper and the trajectory of the bullet. In such a system, the localization estimation processor may calculate an initial miss-angle (gamma \u03b3), the angle between the trajectory and the line joining the sensor and the firing position, and may estimate and calculate the estimated trajectory of the projectile and the estimated firing position of the projectile from the initial gamma estimate. Additionally, the initial gamma estimate may equal 0.01. In addition, the localization estimation processor may estimate a minimum and a maximum distance of the estimated firing position of the projectile. Furthermore, the maximum distance of the estimated firing position of the projectile may be set to a maximum detection range of the acoustic sensor. Moreover, the maximum distance of the estimated firing position of the projectile may be set to 500 meters.","Furthermore, the localization estimation processor may calculate the trajectory vector \u0168, further it may calculate {hacek over (\u03b3)}using \u0168, further it may calculate the firing position {tilde over (Z)} using {hacek over (\u03b3)}and TDOAs, which is further used to estimate the miss-angle {circumflex over (\u03b3)} which is further utilized to compute \u0168 in a continuous loop until the",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"g","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"num"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b3","mo":"\u22d2"},"mi":"k"},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03b3","mo":"\u22d3"},"mi":"k"}],"mo":"-"}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":"k "},"Another embodiment herein also provides a method for estimating a firing position of a supersonic projectile, the projectile producing a pressure wave, the pressure wave comprising at least a shock wave and a blast wave, the method comprising: positioning a single acoustic sensor in a known location; generating a pressure wave information signal at the acoustic sensor in response to the pressure wave; filtering unwanted harmonics in the pressure wave information signal; converting the filtered pressure information signal into a time series signal; recording shock wave arrival times of shock wave components of the pressure wave; recording blast wave arrival times of blast wave components of the pressure wave; determining a shock wave arrival time of the shock wave components and a blast wave arrival time of the blast wave components; and calculating an estimated firing position of the projectile based on the shock wave arrival time and the blast wave arrival times.","According to such a method, calculating an estimated firing position of the projectile may comprise: calculating an initial gamma estimate; and calculating the estimated firing position of the projectile from initial gamma estimate.

In the latter case the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and\/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.","The embodiments herein may comprise hardware and software embodiments. The embodiments that are implemented in software include but are not limited to, firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. Furthermore, the embodiments herein can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can comprise, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium.
