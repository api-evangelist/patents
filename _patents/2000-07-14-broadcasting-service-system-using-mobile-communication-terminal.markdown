However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["101","104","102","103","104"]},"Herein, the television broadcasting system  may be a moving picture and audio information broadcasting system, an analog television broadcasting system, a digital television broadcasting system, or other moving picture information broadcasting system.","The conventional analog broadcasting system includes a NTSC (National Television System Committee) broadcasting method, a PAL (Phase Alternation Line) broadcasting method, and a SECAM (Sequential Couleur Avec Memoire) broadcasting method, which are commonly used.","And the conventional digital broadcasting system includes a ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) method of America, a DVB (digital Video Broadcasting) method of Europe, and a digital broadcasting method of Japan. Herein, the ATSC method of America adopts a MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2), Dolby AC3 and 8VSB, and the DVB method of Europe adopts a MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) and an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing).","As described above, in the digital television broadcasting system, the video and audio signals are provided as a compressed digital data (bit stream). Herein, the compressed digital data has a protocol in relation to reception and transmission. Accordingly the digital broadcasting information agreed with the protocol includes the video and audio data and EPG (Electronic Program Guide) and additional data, which are processed together.","In  of the present invention, processing of the digital video signal compressed as the MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) is described.","When the television broadcasting system  is the digital television broadcasting system, the video information provided to the digital television is a compressed-encoded information as the MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) standard over communication path . Accordingly a format converter  for converting the compressed-encoded information into an MPEG4 (Moving Picture Experts Group 4) used as an image standard of the mobile communication network is included.","Meanwhile, when the television broadcasting system  is the analog television broadcasting system, the television broadcasting system  (moving picture provider) or the format converter  can have a converting unit which converts the provided video information into a digital signal having a certain format used in the mobile communication network transmission standard.","The format converter  receives the MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) videotext provided from the television broadcasting system , and format-converts the MPEG2 videotext into the MPEG4 (Moving Picture Experts Group 4) videotext used in the mobile communication network.","The format converter  will be described with reference to the accompanying .","The format converter  can convert the MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) videotext into H.26L, H.263, or H.26X format.
