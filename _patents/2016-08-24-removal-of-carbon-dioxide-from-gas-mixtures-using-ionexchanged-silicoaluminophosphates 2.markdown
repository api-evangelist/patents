title: Removal of carbon dioxide from gas mixtures using ion-exchanged silicoaluminophosphates
abstract: Na-SAPO-34 sorbents were ion-exchanged with several individual metal cations for COabsorption at different temperatures (273-348 K) and pressures (<1 atm). In general, the overall adsorption performance of the exchanged materials increased as follows: Ce<Ti<Mg<Ca<Ag<Na<Sr. The strontium exchanged materials excelled at low-pressure ranges, exhibiting very sharp isotherms slopes at all temperatures. The Sr species were responsible for the surface strong interaction and the cations were occupying exposed sites (SIIâ€²) in the materials Chabazite cages. All the sorbent materials exhibited higher affinity for COover the other gases tested (i.e., CH, H, Nand O) due to strong ion-quadrupole interactions. Sr-SAPO-34 sorbents are by far the best option for COremoval from CHmixtures, especially at low concentrations.

The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to the selective removal of COfrom light gas mixtures. More specifically, it relates to the use of ion-exchanged M-SAPO-34 materials for the adsorption of CO.","The selective removal of COfrom mixtures of gases is necessary to help addressing environmental and energy related problems, respectively. For example, it is well known that the efficient capture of COfrom industrial emissions will help to mitigate greenhouse effects. On the energy side, a considerable part of the natural gas reserves in the US (\u02dc17%) is treated to remove high COconcentrations, as the pipeline quality for COconcentration is less than 2%. This \u201ccontaminant\u201d reduces the energy content of natural gas, causing it to miss the pipeline quality requirement for minimum heating value (970 BTU\/ft). Amine absorption is the most widely used method today for the removal of COfrom CHstreams, but this technique is highly complex and therefore costly.","Adsorption processes using microporous and mesoporous (known together as nanoporous) materials are promising methods for the removal of CO, avoiding regeneration and corrosion problems resulting from traditional solvent absorption methods. A number of nanoporous materials have already shown potential for this specific gas separation due to their small pore sizes and their narrow pore-size distribution. Many studies have tried to address the COseparation problem by using microporous materials, such as 5A, 13X and Clinoptilolite zeolites, mesoporous silica material SBA-15, and carbon molecular sieves (CMS), respectively. For instance, 5A-type zeolites have been used for air purification applications, such as in adsorption devices to remove excess carbon dioxide from breathing air in aerospace vehicles cabins. At a concentration of ca. 900 ppm CO, the 5A-zeolite adsorbed approximately 1.5-wt % of the gas. It is important to point out that there have been also some efforts towards the development of membranes for COremoval. Tsapatsis and co-workers (incorporated herein by reference) developed a silicalite-1 membrane supported on porous alumina disks that displayed some selectivity towards CO. The highly oriented membranes considerably improved the otherwise low selectivity exhibited by silicalite powders. Recently, Falconer and co-workers (incorporated herein by reference) reported the preparation of Na-SAPO-34 membranes via in situ crystallization on \u03b1-alumina tubular and porous stainless steel supports. These membranes were used to separate COfrom CHand other gases, achieving also good selectivities. Among all of these adsorbent alternatives, SAPO-34 materials hold the most promise and therefore are the focus of this invention.","Silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs) are crystalline nanoporous (or microporous according to the IUPAC classification for pore diameters) materials formed by silicon, aluminum, phosphorous, and oxygen atoms in tetrahedral coordination. The atoms are arranged in an orderly fashion and form frameworks with a variety of geometries. SAPO-34 has the framework characteristics of natural zeolite Chabazite (CHA) as shown in . This molecular sieve includes 8-ring apertures (\u02dc4 \u212b) that permit access to a 3-D channel and barrel-shaped cage system. Such geometry allows molecules with small kinetic diameters to easily diffuse through the crystal structure. SAPOs also have a framework with a net charge that varies depending upon how the silicon substitution into an aluminophosphate group is achieved. That is, if silicon is substituted for aluminum, phosphorous, or both, the resulting net charge will be +1, \u22121 or 0, respectively. Studies have shown that usually the second and third substitution mechanisms are present during the crystallization process. Therefore, the SAPOs framework requires the presence of counterbalance species, such as cations and\/or anions. These ions affect the pore size and geometry, causing potential blockage of certain molecules and limiting the diffusion of some species through the structure. In addition, these extraframework species provide effective functionalization of the sorbent surface since they can induce specific sorbate-to-sorbent energy interactions. Several cation sites in Chabazite-like materials have been identified as seen on . The principal cation positions are in the center of a hexagonal prism (Site I), in the center of the six-ring window (Site II), in the cavity displaced from the six-ring window (Site II\u2032), and near the center of the eight-ring window (Site III). Given the influence of cation sites in adsorption processes, the specification will occasionally refer to these positions.","The nature of extra framework cationic species in SAPO-34 considerably affects the sorbent performance, particularly the interaction with Nand CHgases. For instance, isosteric heat of adsorption data showed that nitrogen molecule interaction with the sorbent increases according to the extra framework species as follows: Mg<Ti<Ce<Ca<Ag<Na<Sr.","Hence, it is necessary to find alternative methods that could achieve COseparation in a selective and effective way at ambient conditions.","The present invention focuses on the ion-exchanged M-SAPO-34 materials for the adsorption of COat temperatures and pressures that approach ambient conditions.","According to an aspect of the invention, a Mn-SAPO-34 material was prepared by ion-exchanging Na-SAPO-34 with Ag+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ce3+ and Ti3+ cations.","Na-SAPO-34 according to the invention was prepared by hydrothermal crystallization of saturated gels containing a molecular structure-directing agent (SDA). Reactants used were aluminum isopropoxide (Aldrich), o-phosphoric acid (85 wt %, Sigma-Aldrich), colloidal silica (30 wt % SiO2 LUDOX AM-30, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (Sigma), tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, Fluka), and distilled\/deionized water. Several batches were prepared using saturated gels each with the following oxide molar composition formula: 0.5(TEA)20:0.3Na2O3:1.3Al2O3:0.6SiO2:P2O5:60H2O. The mixture was heated to 473 K inside a sealed Teflon lined autoclave under autogenous pressure for approximately 8 days. The final product was then filtered and washed with copious amounts of deionized\/distilled water. The resulting solid was dried at 373 K for 24 hours in a forced convection oven. The TEAOH was removed from the porous material framework by calcination methods using flowing air in a computer-controlled muffle furnace. Using a ramp procedure at a heating rate of 10 K\/min, the sample was heated to three consecutive temperature set points: 1 hour at 373 K, 1 hour at 473 K, and finally 15 hours at 773 K. It should be mentioned that better porosity and crystal quality were obtained when the samples were pretreated in vacuum for 24 hours at 673 K.","Preparation of Ion-Exchanged Materials.","Mn-SAPO-34 samples were prepared by ion-exchanging Na-SAPO-34 with Ag+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ce3+ and Ti3+ cations, respectively.","Adsorption Equilibrium Isotherms and Uptake Rates.","Equilibrium isotherm and diffusion adsorption data were obtained using two static low-pressure volumetric adsorption systems (Micromeritics ASAP 2020) outfitted with turbo molecular drag pumps. Adsorbate gases used were H2 (Ultra High Purity Grade, Linde), O2 (Ultra High Purity Grade, Linde), CO2 (Ultra High Purity Grade, Praxair) and He (High Purity Grade, Linde). The latter was used as a backfill gas after the sorbent activation. The inert gas was removed via ultra-high vacuum prior to adsorption tests. All SAPO samples were pre-treated in vacuum at 648 K to remove water molecules strongly bound inside the structure. The temperature ramp, evacuation rate, and vacuum set used were 10 K\/min, 50 mmHg\/s and 20 \u03bcmHg, respectively. Carbon dioxide equilibrium and uptake tests were performed at temperatures ranging from 273 to 348 K and pressures up to 1 atm. Tests for H2 and O2 were performed only at 298 K. During the experiments, the temperature was kept constant by means of either a water bath or a heating blanket. It should be mentioned that the kinetic data were corrected to compensate for the equipment effective dead time (\u02dc0.3 seconds) and for any instability caused by the system. The equipment collection data step was set to 0.1 seconds.","Equilibrium adsorption data for the Mn-SAPO-34 sorbents were fitted using the Sips Equation (Langmuir-Freundlich):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"q","mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"q","mrow":{"mi":["sat","i"],"mo":","}},"mo":"\u2062","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["K","LF"]},{"mi":["P","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mn":"1","mo":"\/","msub":{"mi":["n","h"]}}]},"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","msup":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["K","LF"]},{"mi":["P","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mn":"1","mo":"\/","msub":{"mi":["n","h"]}}]}}}}}}}},"In this equation, nis the system heterogeneity parameter, which is usually greater than unity.

Test were performed until achieving desired product purity (e.g., 99.9999% CH4). The pressurization step assumed no mass transfer between the gas and solid phases, which is also known as the \u201cfrozen column\u201d state. Inter-crystalline diffusion resistance was also assumed to be negligible when compared to the resistance offered by the micropores of the sorbent. The equilibrium data for multicomponent adsorption was estimated using the extended Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model, also known as the loading ratio correlation (LRC). The linear driving force (LDF) model was used to describe the mass transfer involved in the various steps of the cycle. Diffusion time constants at zero coverage were estimated by fitting experimental data with the solution of the fractional uptake phenomenological model for spherical particles. The diffusion time constant were corrected for concentration dependence using the Cheng and Yang's model, which is used for diffusion in zeolites where the molecules dimensions come close to that of the channel opening. Based on all of the above assumptions, the model equations for the VPSA processes are summarized in Table 1. The resulting differential equations were solved using a variable order solver based on the numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) or by the implicit finite difference using an explicit Runge-Kutta method. t,?","Results and Discussion","Carbon Dioxide Pure Component Equilibrium Adsorption in Mn+-SAPO-34 Sorbents.","A combination of textural properties, such as pore volume and pore blocking, and the interactions energies will have considerable influence in the uptake of the sorbates depending on the cationic species. A complete description of the cation species, surface area, pore volume and unit cell composition of all the studied sorbents after the ion-exchanged was previously described by Rivera-Ramos and Hernandez-Maldonado (incorporated herein by reference).  shows data for carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption for all the SAPO-34 sorbent materials at different temperatures (273, 298, 323 and 348 K). All the sorbents displayed the classic physisorption profile, where an increase in temperature results in a decrease in uptake amounts at any given pressure. However, some of the COadsorption isotherms exhibited a considerable non-linear behavior and, therefore, did not follow the traditional pore-filling mechanism. Different models were evaluated to fit the data (i.e., Sips and Toth). The Sips equation showed better data adjustment and was therefore used for all sorbents cases for consistency.","Affinity constants for COisotherms were calculated using a qsat value obtained at 273 K. The advantage of using lower temperatures to estimate this value is appropriate since sorbate-sorbate interactions become negligible. The qsat estimated from the Na-SAPO-34 COisotherm data is 5.26 mmol\/g. It is important to point out that this value matches well with the one obtained by Falconer and co-workers (5.0 mmol\/g) using a similar approach (incorporated herein by reference).","Table 2 summarizes the heterogeneity factor results for all the sorbents at different temperatures. In general, the heterogeneity of the system with respect to carbon dioxide uptake changed as a function of temperature. This should be expected in nanoporous materials frameworks that usually have more sites (i.e., coordination states) available for the charge-balancing cations to occupy as seen on . The distribution of cationic species on the sites depends on the temperature of heat-treatment, the nature of the species, and the degree of hydration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Na-","Ag-","Mg-","Ca-","Sr-","Ti-","Ce-"]},{"entry":["Temp.","SAPO-","SAPO-","SAPO-","SAPO-","SAPO-","SAPO-","SAPO-"]},{"entry":["(K)","34","34","34","34","34","34","34"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["273","1.94","1.65","1.64","1.65","2.24","1.44","1.76"]},{"entry":["298","1.82","1.38","1.66","1.67","2.84","1.26","1.79"]},{"entry":["323","1.76","1.35","1.51","1.59","2.78","1.24","1.73"]},{"entry":["348","1.59","1.30","1.42","1.55","3.05","1.12","1.59"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"It is important to note that all the sorbents exhibited fully reversible adsorption-desorption paths. This is critical for regeneration cycles, since all the working sorption capacity could be regained by simple engineering means.","Ag-SAPO-34","Usually, an increase in cation size of monovalent species results in a decrease of the adsorption capacity in some zeolites. In terms of sorption characteristics, at 273 and 298 K the COadsorption amounts in the Ag(I) exchanged materials are comparable to those obtained for Na-SAPO-34. However, as the process temperature is increased, a decrease in the adsorbed amount was observed when compared also to the Na-sorbent at the same conditions as shown in . Sorbents with certain transition metal cations are known to form \u03c0-complexation bonds with some sorbates (e.g. N, CO). But the carbon dioxide monodentate adsorption mechanism will probably avoid this kind of complexation, resulting in a decrease in interaction with the sorbate at low pressure ranges when compared with other sorbent that exhibit the same adsorption capacity at higher pressures.","Mg-SAPO-34","With the exception of the 273 K test results, this material adsorbed less carbon dioxide at 1 atm when compared to the unmodified material. Based on the observed behavior, it is plausible to state that Mg cations offer partial blocking of the pore window, affecting the entrance of the sorbate molecules into the crystal framework. It should be mentioned that at 273 K, this material produced an adsorbed amount at 1 atm comparable to that of the Sr-SAPO-34 sorbent. The COadsorption in strontium-exchanged materials will be discussed shortly.","Ca-SAPO-34","At 273 K, this sorbent adsorbed more carbon dioxide than Na- and Ag-SAPO-34 materials, respectively. At 298 and 323 K, the adsorbed amounts (\u02dc1 atm) are only comparable to those obtained with Sr-SAPO-34 as shown in . The Ca-SAPO-34 material also showed heterogeneity factors comparable to those obtained for Mg-SAPO-34. With this behavior trend, it could be stated that Mg and Ca cations occupied similar sites (SII\u2032) as seen on  within the Chabazite framework.","Sr-SAPO-34","The shape of the adsorption isotherms in this material is sound evidence of stronger sorbent-sorbate interactions. Particularly when compared to the other M-SAPO-34 formulations at the low-pressure range as shown in . For this sorbent, the results suggest that Sr cations are sitting near window sites (site II\u2032), producing strong interactions with the sorbates located within the relevant perimeter. With the exception of the 273 K test results, this material adsorbed less carbon dioxide at 1 atm when compared to Na-SAPO-34. It could be stated that at 273 K, divalent cations are more exposed to interactions with the sorbate. As seen in , at 298 K and a partial pressure of ca. 10atm (or 900 ppm), the Sr-SAPO-34 sorbent adsorbs approximately 0.65 mmoles of COper gram of material. This translates to a sorption capacity of about 2.8-wt %, which is almost twice the observed capacity in 5A-type zeolites at similar conditions. The strong interactions presented by this material towards COare without a doubt ideal for adsorption applications where traces of carbon dioxide are needed to be removed from a gas mixture (i.e., ultra purification). The Sr-SAPO-34 sorption performance will be discussed later.","Ce-SAPO-34 and Ti-SAPO-34","For these sorbents, the COadsorption capacities were much lower than those obtained with the other M-SAPO-34 as seen on . It could be stated that both Ce and Ti species occupy sites near the center of the cages (SIII), where they can balance three Al tetrahedra negative charges on the framework at the same time. This coordination condition, together with the considerable relative large size of the trivalent cations, should result in some level of pore blocking.","Fractional Uptake and Diffusion Time Constant",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":["n+","+","+","2+","2+","2+","2+"],"sub":["2 ","2","4","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"D(1\/s)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sorbent","CO","CH"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Na-SAPO-34","0.0065","0.0214"]},{"entry":["Ag-SAPO-34","0.0078","0.0274"]},{"entry":["Sr-SAPO-34","0.0056","0.0216"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{},"sub":"ads","sup":"n+"},"Estimates of isosteric heat of adsorption for all M-SAPO-34 materials correlated to physical and reversible adsorption as shown in . The values varied according to the type of cation exchanged into the SAPO-34 framework and the average was around 30 kJ\/mol. It should be mentioned that heats observed for Na-SAPO-34 sorbents are in good agreement with calorimetric data previously reported by Gorte and co-workers (incorporated herein by reference) for the adsorption of COin NaX zeolite. In addition, many of the adsorbents displayed little degree of heterogeneity, which correlates well with the results shown in Table 2. The only exception was the Sr(II) exchanged material.","It can be seen from  that the Sr-SAPO-34 sorbents have higher interactions with COwhen compared to the other M-SAPO-34 materials. The variation of the isosteric heats as a function of adsorption loading was also very notable for this sorbent as shown in . This is in good agreement with the heterogeneity factors (largest nfactor) estimated for this material as shown in Table 2 above. Noting that the maximum heat of adsorption occurs at 0.65 mmol\/g as seen on  and taking into consideration that the sorbent unit cell composition is given by |NaSrH| [SiAlPO] as previously reported by the inventors, then there are one COmolecule adsorbed per Sr cation at this point. The adsorption heat maximum observed for the Srsorbent should be a result of the quadrupole moment interaction between the sorbate and the electric field generated by the cations on the SAPO-34 surface. Thus, it can be said that once the carbon dioxide molecules have interacted with all the available Sr cations, the sorbate continues to interact with the Na cations that are still present in the material. This corresponds to the subsequent energy decrease at higher loadings as seen on . The average isosteric heat of adsorption in the 1-2 mmol\/g loading region matches well with those observed for Nat SAPO-34. Additional deviations in the heat of adsorption are probably due to sorbate-sorbate interactions within the cages of the structure.","The Sr-SAPO-34 sorption capacity could be further improved if additional extraframework Sr cations are introduced. As previously mentioned, the observed unit cell composition shows that Nacations are still present in the structure.","CH, CO, H, Nand OPure Component Equilibrium Adsorption in Na-SAPO-34, Ag-SAPO-34 and Sr-SAPO-34","Although typical natural gas mixtures consist mainly of CH, these also include significant quantities of CO, Nand traces of Oand H.

The sorbents exhibiting lower COinteractions at low pressures (i.e., Na-SAPO-34 and Ag-SAPO-34) required additional VPSA step to achieve the required product purity. Based on these results, all the materials are certainly capable sorbents for this kind of separation. However, Sr-SAPO-34 showed the strongest COsorbate-sorbent interactions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"q(mmol\/g)","K(1\/atm)","n"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sorbent","CO","CH","CO","CH","CO","CH"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Na-SAPO-34","5.264","2.127","2.989","0.412","1.817","1.000"]},{"entry":["Ag-SAPO-34","4.879","1.654","2.951","0.660","1.384","1.104"]},{"entry":["Sr-SAPO-34","6.707","2.003","0.498","1.893","2.839","1.893"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 5"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Parameters","Values"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Feed Pressure","1 atm"]},{"entry":[{},"Temperature (T)","298 K"]},{"entry":[{},"Particle Density (\u03c1)","1.06 \u00d7 10kg\/m"]},{"entry":[{},"Bed Void (\u03b5)","0.348"]},{"entry":[{},"Diffusion Volume (D)","26.7 (CO);

In terms of overall adsorption performance, the exchanged materials exhibited the following trend: Ce<Ti<Mg<Ca<Ag<Na<Sr. Strontium(II) exchanged SAPO-34 was by far the best sorbent in the low-pressure region. The isosteric heat of adsorption data suggested that all the exchanged Sr species were exposed to the Chabazite cages, but did not provide transport resistance or pore blocking. Uptake data indicated that the adsorption kinetics for COin the Ag, Na, and Sr exchanged materials were fast, evidencing again the absence of transport resistance within the pore channels. Binary component adsorption (CO\/CH) simulation data corroborated that, among the sorbents studied, the strontium(II) exchanged ones were by far superior. It should be pointed out that all the sorbents studied can be fully regenerated by simple engineering means since the adsorption interactions were in the physisorption range.","Sorbent Synthesis Optimization","In order to maximize the SAPO framework surface area, the hydrothermal synthesis was performed under vigorous mixing. In addition, longer aging times were employed prior to final mixing of the source materials.","Preparation of Ion-Exchanged Materials: Single Step Liquid Phase Ion Exchange Procedure","The exchange procedure was optimized to increase the metal cation concentration gradient and, therefore, an increase in diffusion flux towards the solid phase. This strategy was aimed at achieving the highest exchange possible. The process temperature was fixed at 60\u00b0 C. and the solid was recovered via mild vacuum filtration after 24 hours.","Exchange of Na present in the asynthesized porous framework with Sr. The solubility of the salt (SrCl.6HO) in water is ca. 1062 g\/L HO at 20\u00b0 C. An undersaturated solution was obtained using a following salt-to-water weight ratio of 2.4 g\/50 g, which corresponds to a 4 fold excess amount (5.2<pH<5.6). About 1 gram of the SAPO porous framework was added to the aforementioned salt\/water solution and the temperature was adjusted to 60\u00b0 C. The exchange was performed for 24 hours under vigorous mixing. The resulting solid particle were recovered via filtration and washed with ca. 3 liters of distilled\/deionized water. The resulting cake was dried at 90\u00b0 C. for 24 hours.","Exchange of Na present in the asynthesized porous framework with Ba. The solubility of the salt (BaCl) in water is ca. 375 g\/L HO at RT. An undersaturated solution was obtained using a following salt-to-water weight ratio of 4 g\/500 g (5.3<pH<5.7). About 1 gram of the SAPO porous framework was added to the aforementioned salt\/water solution and the temperature was adjusted to 60\u00b0 C. The exchange was performed for 24 hours under vigorous mixing. The resulting solid particle were recovered via filtration and washed with ca. 3 liters of distilled\/deionized water. The resulting cake was dried at 90\u00b0 C. for 24 hours.","Preparation of Ion-Exchanged Materials: Multiple Step Liquid Phase Ion Exchange Procedure","Consecutive exchanges (up to 3) were employed to approach the 100% cation replacement mark. All the steps were performed at 60\u00b0 C. and for 24 hours. Recovery of the solids between exchanges was achieved through mid vacuum filtration and drying at 90\u00b0 C. in a forced convection oven for 24 hours.","Carbon Dioxide Pure Component Equilibrium Adsorption in Ba-SAPO-34 Sorbents","Tests for carbon dioxide equilibrium adsorption in barium exchanged SAPO-34 powder indicate that it is possible to reach the low pressure sorption capacities exhibited by the strontium-based material counterpart by means of a multiple stage ion exchange strategy as shown in . Sorbents that are sequentially exchanged with barium cations show an increase in COsorption capacity at partial pressures below 0.1 atm. Such behavior evidences incorporation of barium cations in exposed adsorption sites. At higher pressures, however, all the barium based sorbents exhibit a considerable decrease in adsorption capacity perhaps due to the large cation size. The latter should produce an effective reduction in pore volume and hence sorption capacity at pressures near 1 atm.","Sorbent Regeneration","The sorbents were tested for adsorption reversibility by means of volumetric techniques. After in situ activation of the sorbents, CO2 was allowed to adsorb in the porous materials at the different pressure increments at equilibrium. After achieving the instrument maximum pressure (i.e., 1 atm), the system pressure was reduced in small intervals and the CO2 desorption amounts registered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},"Because many varying and differing embodiments maybe made within the scope of the inventive concept herein taught and because many modifications may be made in the embodiment herein detailed in accordance with the descriptive requirement of the law, it is to be understood that the details herein are to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sup":"n+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5","sub":"2 ","sup":"n+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6","sub":["2","4","2","2 ","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7","sub":["2","4","2","2 ","2 "],"sup":"+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8","sub":["2","4","2","2 ","2 "],"sup":"2+"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
