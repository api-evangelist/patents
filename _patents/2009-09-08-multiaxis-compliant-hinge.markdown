title: Multi-axis compliant hinge
abstract: Multi-axis compliant hinges used in conjunction with strut elements to form a collapsible structure. The hinges behaves similar to a pin-clevis hinges but have increased compliance during the deployment sequence allowing connected struts to translate and rotate finite amounts relative to each other. Once deployed, the hinges lock out to form strong and stiff joints. The hinge uses two opposing resilient tape spring surfaces for each axis. The opposing tape spring surfaces of each axis are joined together by rigid inserts at their ends opposite the common connection point and to which structural members or struts are connected.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The conditions under which this invention was made are such as to entitle the Government of the United States under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, as represented by the Secretary of the Air Force, to the entire right, title and interest therein, including foreign rights.","The present invention relates generally to compliant hinges used in deployable or reconfigurable mechanisms, and in particular to hinges that connects three or more struts, allows struts to translate and rotate finite amounts relative to each other, has increased compliance during deployment, and is locked out in a strong and stiff manner in its deployed configuration. A four strut version of the compliant hinge disclosed herein is the type of hinge required in a pending patent application Ser. No. 12\/555,034, \u201cDeployable Structures with Quadrilateral Reticulations.\u201d","In deployable or reconfigurable mechanisms, structural members must move relative to each other to accommodate folding. In many situations, the kinematics of the mechanism are such that pin-clevis joints provide sufficient relative motion. A good example of this is the SquareRigger structure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,722. In this structure, articulation of the hinges is sufficient to deploy the structure without deformation of any members. In other words, the structure could be composed of rigid elements connected by pin-clevis joints and no internal stresses are generated during deployment. This class of mechanism is said to be compatible throughout its deployment, i.e., the member lengths and hinge locations are \u201ccompatible\u201d with a stress free structural configuration. A problem associated with this class of structure is binding. Any strut or hinge length or alignment error generates internal loads in the mechanism, resulting in increased friction in the pin-clevis joints. Joint friction can cause these structures to bind and prevent deployment.","Structures that are not compatible throughout deployment generate internal loads and some compliance is required to prevent excessive loads from building up. These structures also need to be strong and stiff in the deployed configuration so that reducing the stiffness (adding compliance) to the struts results in a reduced stiffness deployed structure. What is needed is a hinge mechanism to render non-compatible structures deployable that behaves similar to a pin-clevis hinge, but has increased compliance during deployment and is locked out in a strong and stiff manner in the deployed configuration. A recognized hinge design demonstrating these characteristics is known as strain energy or tape measure hinge. The hinge bends about a single axis allowing the hinge to fold such that the once opposing ends are adjacent. Hinges of this type have been used on existing deployable structures. In applications requiring folding in multiple axes at a single location, such as in umbrella-type structures described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,009,578, multiple single-axis tape measure joints are connected to a central hub structure. The disadvantages of this type of joint include the increased mass and packaging dimensions due to the central hub.","A multi-axis compliant hinge is disclosed that is used in conjunction with strut elements to form a collapsible structure capable of supporting solar arrays, communication, radar, and electromagnetic energy concentration systems. The hinge uses a resilient material to provide flexibility to allow the desired level of articulation as well as the necessary stiffness when in the deployed or locked configuration. It allows struts to translate and rotate finite amounts relative to each other during deployment. The hinge is compatible with two- or three-dimensional collapsible structures and provides flexibility to prevent binding during the deployment process.","This invention provides a multi-axis compliant hinge that does not require a separate central hub structure. Therefore the design is lighter and more compact than the prior art. The hinge uses two opposing resilient tape spring monolithic surfaces, a top surface and a bottom surface. The opposing tape spring surfaces of each axis are joined together by rigid inserts at their ends opposite the common connection point. The rigid inserts serve as the mechanism for connecting the hinge to the respective structural members or struts. The hinge may also be fabricated in a single piece design, where the opposing surfaces are generated by removal of material from the mid-section. Both options are simple to manufacture and operate in a similar manner.","Embodiments of a two-axis symmetric, two-axis non-symmetric and three-axis hinge are described although the concept can be expanded to an increased number of axes limited by size and practical considerations only.","The generation of deployable curved surface support structures requires a hinge that allows the struts being joined together to translate and rotate as well as form a strong and stiff connection in its deployed state. The compliant hinge of the present invention that encompasses these characteristics is realized with tape-spring-like shell elements. Tape-spring hinges are often used in deployable structures to serve as simple and reliable hinge mechanisms with strain energy capacity, which when released, can motivate the reconfiguration of the structural system from a packaged to a deployed state. A carpenter's measurement tape is an example of a tape spring. It has geometric stiffness when extended. Tape springs used in deployable structures are typically thin shells of a elastic material, such as spring steel, copper-beryllium alloys, or carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) that are curved about their primary structural axis. They can be buckled and folded about an arc. When released they spring back to their strain free shape and have a tendency to lock into this lower energy state.","In the two-axis, four-strut example seen in  and , the hinge uses two opposing resilient tape spring surfaces, a top surface  and a bottom surface  for each axis. For the two-piece design shown in  and , the opposing tape spring surfaces of each axis are joined together by rigid inserts  at their ends opposite the common connection point. The rigid inserts  serve as the mechanism for connecting the hinge to the respective structural members  (struts). The intersection of the two tape spring axes  shown in  is a deployed view of a hinge that would connect four members;  is a packaged view of the hinge. Hinge, node, or joint are here used interchangeably. The hinge is intended to connect three or more structural members  in a compliant hinge-table like manner, which allows relative translations and rotations of all members (struts) in the packaged state and during deployment. The members are locked out in a strong and stiff manner once deployed. The hinge's compliance allows it to be used in structures that are not fully compatible throughout deployment. A further feature of this compliant hinge is that it synchronizes the motion of all connected struts. In other words, rotation of one element tends to rotate all other elements attached to the node. This is a compliant synchronization in that the strut elements are only loosely coupled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 8","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 10"]}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["7","7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["8","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
