No. 60\/327,419, entitled \u201cNoninvasive Electrocardiographic Imaging (ECCI\u201d: filed on Oct. 4, 2001, and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser.

No. 60\/054,342 with a filing date of Jul. 31, 1997, where the contents of all aforementioned provisional and non-provisional U.S. and PCT applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The contents of this disclosure were supported by NIH-NHLBI Grant R37-HL-33343.","(1) Field","The disclosed methods and systems relate generally to electrocardiographic imaging, and more particularly to methods and systems for noninvasive reconstruction of cardiac potentials, electrograms, and isochrones (activation patterns) in electrocardiographic imaging.","(2) Description of Relevant Art","Imaging and diagnosing cardiac electrical activity can be problematic because the electrical activity is time dependent and spatially distributed throughout the myocardium. Electrocardiographic techniques that include, for example, electrocardiograms (ECG) and vectorcardiography (VCG) can be limited in their ability to provide information and\/or data on regional electrocardiac activity. These methods can also fail to localize bioelectric events in the heart.","Simultaneous recordings of potentials at tens or hundreds of locations on the torso, for example, can provide body surface potential maps (BSPMs) over the torso surface. Although the BSPMs can indicate regional cardiac electrical activity in a manner that may be different from conventional ECG techniques, these BSPM techniques generally provide a comparatively low resolution, smoothed projection of cardiac electrical activity that does not facilitate visual detection or identification of cardiac event locations (e.g., sites of initiation of cardiac arrhythmias) and details of regional activity (e.g., number and location of arrythmogenic foci in the heart).","In comparison, potential distributions measured on and over the epicardial surface of the heart can provide comparatively more accurate and higher resolution data that reflects electrical events within the myocardium. Accordingly, the study of cardiac excitation and arrhythmogenesis, for example, often rely upon the mapping of potentials directly from the epicardium.","With an increasing use of nonpharmacological anti-arrhythmic interventions (e.g., ablation), comparatively rapid and accurate localization of electrocardiac events can be beneficial. Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is a noninvasive imaging modality for cardiac electrophysiology (EP) and arrhythmias that can be used to reconstruct epicardial potentials and to provide electrograms and isochrones from, for example, BSPMs and\/or other electrocardiographic body surface potentials.","The disclosed methods and systems include a method for computing epicardial surface electric potentials based on measured body surface electric potentials, the method also including representing at least one geometric relationship between at least one body surface electric potential measuring system and the epicardial surface as a multidimensional matrix, using a Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRes) method to estimate an inverse of the multidimensional matrix, and, based on the inverse matrix and the measured body surface potentials, determining the epicardial surface electric potentials. Representing the geometric relationship can include measuring the position of the at least one body surface electric potential measuring system and\/or measuring the position of at least one electrode, which can also include providing at least one of a CT scan, a MRI, an X-ray, and an X-ray. Representing the geometric relationship can also include determining an epicardial envelope and\/or employing a boundary element method.","Usine a GMRes method can include determining a number of iterations for the GMRes method, which can include providing a maximum number of iterations for the GMRes method, collecting data from the maximum number of iterations, and based on the data from the maximum number of iterations, determining a number of iterations for the GMRes method. In one embodiment, determining a number of iterations includes comparing residual error to a Hessenberg matrix condition, and computing at least one of a corner of a condition L curve and a maximum curvature of a condition L curve. In some embodiments, determining a number of iterations includes determining a number of iterations based on at least one of: a corner of a condition L curve, a corner of an L curve, an increase in spatial frequency of a reconstructed potential map, and an increase in amplitude of a solution norm.","Using a GMRes method can include providing an initial condition of zero, and\/or providing an initial condition based on a Tikhonov regularization of the multidimensional matrix.","Also disclosed is a method for computing electric potentials on an epicardial surface of a patient, where the method includes measuring electric potentials on the patient's body surface, expressing a geometrical relationship between the patient's body surface and the epicardial surface as a multi-dimensional matrix, determining an approximation of the two-dimensional matrix based on a Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRes) method, and, computing the electric potentials on the epicardial surface based on the approximated inverse and the measured electric potentials. Measuring electric potentials includes measuring electric potentials using a torso vest, where the torso vest includes electrodes. Other techniques for measuring electric potentials can be used, where such techniques can include at least one electrode.","In expressing a geometric relationship, the method can include measuring a location of at least one electrode, where the at least one electrode provides electric potential measurements of the patient's body surface. Such expression of a geometric relationship can also include measuring a location of the patient's epicardial envelope, and\/or employing a boundary element method. The data upon which a geometric relationship can be expressed can include data associated with the patient, where the data can be obtained from at least one of CT scan data, MRI data, and X-ray data. Determining an approximation includes providing an initial condition based on at least one of a zero value and a Tikhonov regularization of the multi-dimensional matrix. Determining an approximation includes determining a number of iterations based on a residual error and a Hessenberg matrix condition.","Other objects and advantages will become apparent hereinafter in view of the specification and drawings.","To provide an overall understanding, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described; however, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the systems and methods described herein can be adapted and modified to provide systems and methods for other suitable applications and that other additions and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the systems and methods described herein.","Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated embodiments can be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of certain embodiments, and therefore, unless otherwise specified, features, components, modules, and\/or aspects of the illustrations can be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and\/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed systems or methods. Additionally, the shapes and sizes of components are also exemplary and unless otherwise specified, can be altered without affecting the disclosed systems or methods.","The disclosed methods and systems employ a generalized minimal residual (GMRes) method and system to utilize electrocardiographic image (ECGI) data derived from body surface potential maps (BSPMs) to reconstruct epicardial potentials, which may be used to provide electrograms and isochrones. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, however, that the methods and systems are not limited to BSPMs, and\/or can employ electrocardiographic data, vectorcardiogram data, or combinations thereof, and although the disclosed methods and systems present electrograms and isochrones, other and\/or additional data representations can be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","12","12","12","14","16","12","14","16","18","20","22","16","12","16","24","24","26","24","12","26","28","28","24"]},"In an embodiment, the  system  can be an online and\/or integrated channel system that can be a stand-alone and portable unit with data acquisition and data processing capabilities. Further, in one embodiment, the illustrated vest  can include approximately two-hundred forty silver\/silver chloride (Ag\/AgCl) electrodes for acquiring electrocardiograph (ECG) signals from a body surface such as a torso. Those of ordinary skill will recognize that the vest  can include other numbers of electrodes, including for example, in the range from approximately one-hundred twenty to two-hundred fifty, although fewer or more electrodes can be used depending upon the application. Further, although the use of silver\/silver chloride electrodes allows the electrodes to be used without gel and thus may decrease the number of electrodes that may short circuit and may allow for rapid application of the electrodes to the patient, other systems that utilize gel and\/or other non-gel systems can be used.","The illustrated vest  may also provide two-dimensional stability to the electrode array so that electrode spacing can be maintained substantially constant and electrode positions can be determined as provided herein. The vest , connector , and\/or device  can further include comparatively high-input resistance amplifiers (e.g., on the order of 10ohm) and driven shield electrode cables to provide increased common mode rejection. For example, in one embodiment, driven shield cables can be coaxial cables that can be optically coupled to avoid shock to the patient, while other types of electrode arrangements and\/or methods and systems to obtain body surface potentials may be used. Those of ordinary skill will thus understand the vest , connector , and device  to more generally be a body surface potential measurement system and\/or device that provides or otherwise communicates (e.g., via wired or wireless network, direct communications, etc.) body surface potential data to the processor , where such data can be in a format that is compatible for receipt by the processor . In an embodiment, the illustrated body surface potential measurement system , ,  can be employed for body surface mapping, epicardial mapping (e.g., using epicardial electrodes), endocardial mapping, and\/or intracavitary mapping using a multi-electrode probe.","Referring again to , the geometry determining device  can be a system and\/or device for providing geometric data for an anatomical part(s) such as the heart, and accordingly, the device  can include a system that provides x-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and\/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. For example, as shown in , the geometry determining device  may be a CT scanner or MRI device . In an embodiment according to , the illustrated CT scanner\/MRI device  can generate data, which can be image data, to determine torso geometry and, consequently, body surface electrode positions. The device  can also provide data associated with an epicardial envelope surrounding the heart, where those of ordinary skill understand that the epicardial envelope can provide an estimate of the epicardial surface. Further, locating the epicardial envelope or surface can include determining or otherwise providing data to be associated with the location of the heart. In an exemplary system that utilizes a CT scanner , the scanner  can provide slice thickness between one and eight millimeters and can have adjustable kVp and mAs settings to perform different types of CT scans of different parts of a patient's body.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["26","32","34","34"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5(","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":"a","b":["24","26","24","141","142"]},"Referring again to electric potentials measured on the torso surface can be input to or otherwise provided to the processor  from the vest  or other device that provides electrical potentials, where in the embodiment, the processor can store  such electrical potentials. The processor  can then cause epicardial potentials to be determined  based on the aforementioned electrical potentials and matrix of coefficients, A. As provided previously herein, based on the epicardial potentials, electrograms and isochrone maps can be generated for display and evaluation .","Those of ordinary skill will recognize that the modules and\/or components of are merely illustrative for explanatory purposes, and such modules can be otherwise combined and\/or dispersed amongst one or more processors.

As indicates, the input data and other data can be conditionally processed and provided to a boundary element module . Forward computations , or computing torso potentials from known epicardial potentials, and\/or inverse  computations, or computing epicardial surface potentials based on measured torso potentials, as provided herein, can employ data from the boundary element module . Those of ordinary skill will recognize that in clinical applications, inverse computations  are computed. Once the forward and\/or reverse computations are performed , , output and\/or post-processing  can be performed, and optionally, output files can be generated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","12","602","604","606","26","608","610"]},"Accordingly, epicardial (surface) potentials, or the electrical potentials on the surface of the heart, can be determined based on the stored body surface potentials and the matrix of coefficients  that relates the potentials from the body surface to the epicardial surface. Electrograms and isochrones, for example, and other data representations can be generated ,  based on the epicardial surface potentials, and optionally output  to a device .","Those of ordinary skill will recognize that computing torso potentials based on measured epicardial potentials (the \u201cForward Problem\u201d) includes solving Laplace's equation which entails the discretization of Laplace's equation (using Green's second theorem as described in, far example, Jackson J D, Classical electrodynamics, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1975)) in the volume between the epicardial surface and the body surface. A known boundary element method (BEM) (e.g., Brebbia C A, Telles J C F, Wrobel L C, Boundary, element techniques. Theory and applications in engineering, Springer Verlag, Berlin (1984) or Brebbia et al., Boundary Elements: An Introductory Course, McGraw-Hill, New York (1989)) can be employed.","Accordingly, a relationship between the epicardial (surface) potentials and the torso potentials can be expressed as the following linear matrix relationship:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","where Vis the vector of epicardial potentials, Vis the vector of torso potentials, and A is the N\u00d7Nof transfer matrix of influence coefficients between the heart (or epicardial envelope) and the torso (or electrode positions). The A matrix is thus based on the geometry and the conductivities of the media in the volume between the heart and torso. Although the torso can be understood to be homogeneous (i.e., uniform conductivity between the epicardial surface and the body surface), the A matrix can be modified to account for torso inhomogeneities (e.g., lungs, etc.). Accordingly, Equation (1) represents the forward problem of electrocardiography for computing body surface potentials from epicardial potentials.","One of ordinary skill can thus recognize that the A matrix is based on the geometrical relationship between the epicardial surface or envelope and the torso, and accordingly, the A matrix is based on node positions (corresponding to electrode positions) on the torso and node positions on the epicardium.","Equation (1) can thus also be rearranged to express the epicardial potentials in terms of the body surface potentials and the inverse of the A matrix:\n\n\u2003\u2003(2)\n","The problem of determining the inverse of the A matrix is ill-posed as small perturbations in the data (e.g., measurement noise or geometrical errors) can cause large unbounded errors, which accordingly can require regularization of the solution to Equation (2). In one embodiment, Tikhonov regularization (See, Tikhonov A N, Arsenin V Y, \u201cSolutions of ill-posed problems,\u201d (trans from Russian) Wiley, N.Y. (1977), or Tikhonov et al., \u201cSolutions of ill posed problems,\u201d 27\u201394, V H Winston & Sons, Washington D.C. (1977) which are hereby incorporated herein by reference) can be used to stabilize the solution to Equation (2) by imposing constraints on the magnitudes or derivatives of the computed epicardial potentials, which includes determining an epicardial solution, V, that minimizes the following objective function:\n\nMinimize over (\u2225\u2225\u2225)\u2003\u2003(3)\n","The first term in Equation (3) represents the least-square solution of equation (2), while the second term in Equation (3) is a regularization term that imposes bounds on the amplitude of the solution to Equation (2). Those of ordinary skill recognize that the regularization parameter, t, controls the degree of the imposed constraint and provides a balance between the accuracy and stability of the solution, while L is a regularization operator (e.g., unity, gradient, or Laplacian). In one example, the regularization parameter, t, can be determined using the CRESO (Composite Residual and Smoothing Operator) method. (See, for example, Colli Franzone P, Guerri L, Tentoni S, Viganotti C, Baruffi S, Spaggiari S, Taccardi B, \u201cMathematical procedure for solving the inverse problem of electrocardiography,\u201d Math Biosci, 77:353\u201396 (1985), and Colli-Franzone et al., \u201cFinite element approximation of regularized solutions of the inverse problem of electrocardiography and applications to experimental data\u201d Calcolo, 1985, 22:91\u2013186, which are incorporated herein by reference) and has been found to perform comparably to the \u201coptimal\u201d t that provides the minimum RMS error between the computed Vand the measured V(e.g., experimental studies). See, Messinger Rapport B J, Rudy Y, \u201cComputational issues of importance to the inverse recovery of epicardial potentials in a realistic heart-torso geometry\u201d (published erratum appears in Match Biosci April 1990;99(1):141], Math Biosci, 97:85\u2013120 (1989), which is incorporated herein by reference. The CRESO regularization parameter, t, depends on the vector Vand the matrix A. Accordingly, computing the epicardial potentials, V, is based on non-invasively obtained data that includes the torso surface electric potentials, V, (e.g., torso vest electrode data) and geometry data (e.g., CT, bi-plane X-ray, etc., to develop the A matrix).","As provided herein, Tikhonov regularization imposes constraints on the magnitudes or derivatives of the computed epicardial potentials to provide a solution. Applying these constraints requires some a-priori knowledge of the solutions' properties, which, in the illustrated embodiments, can cause a spatial smoothing of epicardial potentials that may reduce spatial resolution and diagnostically meaningful data or information. The Tikhonov regularization also requires an accurate determination of the aforementioned regularization parameter, t, which determines the constraint level. The aforementioned methods to determine the regularization parameter (e.g., Composite Residual and Smoothing operator (CRESO), L-curve, and Zero crossing) may not perform consistently and can be sensitive to the noise-level of the data. In some cases, a-priori information and manual adjustment may be required to choose an optimal regularization parameter. For example, a-priori knowledge of the number of ectopic foci (sites from which excitation is initiated) may influence the level of regularization applied.","A complementary approach to solving Equation (2) includes the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRes) method which, unlike the Tikhonov regularization, is not based on imposing constraints and therefore does not include a-priori data or information about the solution or determination of a regularization parameter. Referring again to Equation (2), GMRes is thus an iterative method of computing Vfrom Vwithout imposing constraints on the solution.","As in known in the art, the GMRes method belongs to the class of Krylov subspace iterative methods. Generally, for the linear problem Ax=b, where A is a matrix and x is a vector (see, e.g., Equation (1)), the Krylov space of A is the subspace spanned by x, Ax, Ax, etc. Accordingly, if M is a preconditioner, such that MA\u2248I (identity matrix), then for M(Ax\u2212b)\u2248e, as e approaches zero, Mapproaches an approximation of A. Hence, an iteration can be constructed as x=x+M(Ax\u2212b), where the error at an iteration k can be expressed as M(Ax\u2212b). Those of ordinary skill will recognize that GMRes is one approach for reducing the error to provide an approximation for M(i.e., A) which uses an orthogonal Arnoldi decomposition of the A matrix.","Accordingly, with specific reference to Equations (1) and (2), given a vector Vand the matrix A, an n-dimensional Krylov subspace K(n) can be based on a set of linear combinations of the vectors V, AV, AV, . . . , AV. At the nGMRes iteration, the A matrix inverse can be approximated by a projection of A, p(A), onto K(n). Accordingly, based on Equation (2), epicardial potentials, V, can be approximated by p(A)V.","The GMRes method proceeds by constructing, at the nth iteration, an orthonormal basis for the Krylov sub space, K(n). Because the A matrix is generally non-square (e.g., number of torso electrodes is generally not equal to number of reconstruction points on the epicardium), the disclosed methods and systems can be understood to include multiplying both sides of Equation (1) by Vand applying a GMRes method to the solution of AAV=AV(AA is a square matrix). Since the Krylov subspaces form a nested sequence, the norm of the residual error, \u2225AV\u2212V\u2225, decreases as n increases. A solution with reduced contamination from noise components can be achieved by stopping the iterations of the GMRes method.","As provided herein, at the nGMRes iteration, the matrix Acan be approximated by the projection of A, p(A), onto the Krylov subspace, K(n). It is understood in the art that such projection subspace, K(n), can be represented as an upper triangular Hessenberg matrix, H(n). Further, the number of iterations (e.g., the value of n) can be based on the observation that, as n increases, the condition number of H(n) increases (i.e., H(n) can become ill-conditioned) while the norm of the residual error, \u2225AV\u2212V\u2225, decreases. A plot of the condition number of H(n) versus the norm of the nth residual error illustrates the effect of GMRes iterations on these two quantities, and is shown as .","As  indicates, for a method and system that utilize GMRes to compute a solution to Equation (2) and hence can be based on a number of iterations, as the iteration number increases, the condition of an associated Hessenberg matrix can be accompanied by a decrease in the norm of the residual error, \u2225AV\u2212V\u2225. As  indicates, this decrease can be comparatively significant during the first iterations when compared to subsequent iterations. Accordingly, one of skill in the art will recognize that the incremental decrease in residual error, \u2225AV\u2212V\u2225, for additional iterations, may be insignificant after a given number of iterations, while the condition number of the Hessenberg matrix continues to increase.","Based on , one compromise between number of iterations, decreased residual error, and Hessenberg matrix condition can include selecting a number of iterations for the GMRes method that is associated with or otherwise based upon a representation of residual error versus condition number, and where such number of iterations can be a compromise between residual error decrease and condition number increase. For the  embodiment, for example, a selected or chosen number of iterations can be associated with the \u201celbow\u201d of a curve that represents residual error (norm) based on condition number of the Hessenberg matrix. Those of ordinary skill will recognize  to represent a \u201ccondition L curve,\u201d which has a corner that can otherwise be understood to be an elbow. In one embodiment, a corner of a condition L curve can be selected by a curvature detection module that computes curvature along a condition L curve. In one example, a selected number of iterations can be a number of iterations associated with a comparative maximum curvature of a condition L curve. In an embodiment, a selected number of iterations can be determined from a corner of a \u201cL curve\u201d (compare to \u201ccondition L curve\u201d) that can plot or otherwise represent residual error (norm) and (e.g., versus) solution norm. Accordingly, in such an embodiment, a number of iterations can be based on the corner of a L curve, which can be based on a comparative maximum curvature, although other methods can be used.","In some embodiments, a selected number of GMRes iterations can be determined based on an increase in spatial frequency of a reconstructed potential map, where such evaluation can be performed after an iteration of the GMRes technique, and can be based on a Fourier transform or other frequency representation of a potential map. Further, a selected number of GMRes iterations can be based on comparative amplitudes of a solution norm that is computed at an iteration, where a comparatively increased amplitude in a solution norm at a selected iteration can be a basis for selecting an iteration number. The aforementioned four techniques for selecting a GMRes iteration number are shown in  , and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other techniques can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["802","12","804","24","806","808","810","811","812","812","814","812","814","814","816"],"sub":["T","T ","E"]},"Based on a system and method according to , if a manual computation of a number of iterations for approximating the A matrix inverse is selected , data from the GMRes module  corresponding to the number of iterations can be employed to compute an approximation of the A matrix inverse, whereupon epicardial surface potentials, V, can also be computed based on the approximation and the body surface electric potentials, V. Also, if an automatic number of iterations is selected or otherwise designated , an iteration module  can be employed to determine a number of iterations upon which an approximation of the A matrix inverse can be computed (i.e., based on corresponding data from the GMRes module ), and epicardial surface potentials, V, can be computed based on the approximation and the body surface electric potentials, V.","As indicated by the illustrative iteration module , one or more techniques can be used to determine a number of iterations from which to base the approximation of the A matrix inverse, where such techniques were previously described herein. Such \u201cautomatic\u201d determination can be based on the GMRes module data, where, as provided herein, a plot or other comparison of residual error and Hessenberg matrix condition can be computed to determine a corner of a condition L curve. One or more of the illustrated techniques  and other methods can be used and compared, for example, to provide an iteration number. Data associated with the iteration number (e.g., Hessenberg matrix, etc.) can be retrieved from the GMRes module  or other location to compute an approximation to the A matrix inverse. Several experiments were conducted using isolated canine hearts in a human-shaped torso tank, where a Langendorff perfused dog heart was suspended in an approximate anatomic position in a human-shaped torso tank to facilitate simultaneous recording of body surface and epicardial potentials for single and dual pacing from various sites.","For the single pacing embodiment, body surface and epicardial potentials were simultaneously recorded during pacing from a single anterior epicardial site to provide a data set for simulating an arrhythmogenic ectopic focus and providing data for evaluating the aforementioned GMRes systems and methods for localizing initiation sites of arrhythmic activity and other comparatively highly localized electrophysiological events.","For the dual pacing embodiment, epicardial potentials were recorded for simultaneous pacing from pacing sites distanced by 2.5 centimeters. The recorded potentials were used to compute body-surface potentials in a computer model of the human torso that included the thoracic inhomogeneities of lungs, muscle, bone, and fluid layers. The computed body surface potentials were used to reconstruct epicardial potentials in a homogeneous torso of the same geometry. The dual pacing data set allowed an evaluation of the reconstruction accuracy of GMRes while assuming a homogeneous torso (an approximation that greatly simplifies the clinical application of ECGI), and an evaluation of the accuracy and spatial resolution of GMRes in localizing two closely-spaced pacing sites.","Additionally, open chest canine experiments were performed by measuring epicardial potentials from hearts of open chest dogs (i.e., exposed by sternotomy) using a multi-electrode epicardial sock. The open chest data was used to compute body surface potentials in a homogeneous or inhomogeneous computer model of the human torso. Measurement noise (e.g., 50 \u03bcV peak-to-peak, Gaussian) and geometrical errors (e.g., 1 mm, Gaussian) were added to the body surface potentials and electrode positions, respectively, to simulate experimental or clinical measurements. These \u201ccontaminated\u201d body surface potentials were then used to reconstruct epicardial potentials using the ECGI methodology.","Epicardial potentials during right atrial pacing (i.e., simulating normal sinus rhythm) were recorded from a 490-electrode sock. A region of infarcted tissue was created by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and ethanol injection. This data set allowed an evaluation of the GMRes methods and systems to reconstruct abnormal electrophysiological properties of an infarct substrate.","Infarction was produced in a canine heart through ligation of the LAD. After four days of infarct formation in a closed chest, the chest was opened again and a 490-electrode sock pulled over the heart to record potentials. Monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) due to double-loop epicardial reentry was induced through programmed stimulation and recorded. This data set was used to evaluate the GMRes methods and systems for reconstructing the reentry pathway and its various electrophysiological components.","Abnormal and heterogeneous repolarization is understood to be an underlying mechanism of many arrhythmias. Localized epicardial cooling was applied to prolong action potential duration in a region of the LV and consequently increase dispersion of repolarization. Epicardial potentials were recorded during RA pacing and QRST integral maps were computed to reflect local repolarization properties.","For the data sets presented herein, epicardial potentials were reconstructed using the GMRes method and the results were validated by direct comparison to measured epicardial potentials, which served as the gold standard. A zero initial value was used as a starting point for the GMRes iterations. The GMRes results were also compared with corresponding Tikhonov reconstructions. A hybrid method (Tik-GMRes method) was also developed and evaluated. In the hybrid method, GMRes solutions were computed with the Tikhonov solution (rather than zero) as the starting point for the iterative scheme.","Epicardial potential maps were reconstructed which depict the spatial distributions of potentials on an epicardial envelope of the heart. Although an epicardial potential map depicts one instant of time, epicardial potential maps were computed at intervals of one millisecond during an entire cardiac cycle. Electrograms were also reconstructed depicting the variation of potential with respect to time at a single point on the epicardium. The reconstructed electrograms were generally computed at approximately two-hundred to five-hundred sites or points around the epicardial envelope. Further, isochrone maps were reconstructed which depict the sequence of epicardial activation based on local activation time taken as the point of maximum negative derivative (\u2212dV\/dtmax) of each electrogram.","Results were based on visual comparison and, when possible, included statistical measures in the form of relative errors and correlation coefficients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIGS. 9","FIG. 9D","FIGS. 9","FIG. 9"],"i":["a ","b ","c, ","b ","c","a, "],"b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a ","a","a","a","a"],"b":["1","2","3","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["b ","b","b","b"],"b":["1","3","4"]},"Based on , in certain embodiments, a method and system that employs GMRes can resolve multiple electrophysiological events (e.g., initial activation sites) with higher spatial resolution than a constraint-based Tikhonov approach.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIGS. 11"],"i":["a ","b ","c "],"b":"11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIGS. 12","FIGS. 12","FIGS. 12"],"i":["a ","b ","c, ","d ","e, ","f "],"b":["12","12","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 10","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a ","b ","b "]},"The sensitivity of the GMRes method to potential noise and geometry errors was also evaluated using the data set of . Various combinations of potential noise (either 50 microvolt or 100 microvolt, Gaussian) and geometrical errors in torso-electrode positions (either one, two, or three millimeter, Gaussian) were added to the input data. The quality of the GMRes solution was comparable to the solution obtained with original data without the added noise.","Further, the hybrid method, which included starting with the Tikhonov solution rather than an initial value of \u201czero\u201d for GMRes, improved the patterns and localization accuracy of the reconstruction of two pacing sites (). For other data sets, some improvement in accuracy was observed when using the hybrid method.","What has thus been described are methods and systems for computing epicardial surface electric potentials based on measured body surface electric potentials, where the methods and systems include representing at least one geometric relationship between at least one body surface electric potential measuring system and the epicardial surface as a multidimensional matrix, estimating an inverse of the multidimensional matrix based on a Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRes) method, and, based on the inverse matrix and the measured body surface potentials, determining the epicardial surface electric potentials.","The methods and systems described herein are not limited to a particular hardware or software configuration, and may find applicability in many computing or processing environments.
