title: Ingesting heterogeneous video content to provide a unified video provisioning service
abstract: A system may receive a video asset from a content provider. The system may process the video asset to allow a video provisioning system to distribute the video asset to a set top box and another device that is a different type of device than the set top box. Processing the video asset may include verifying that the video asset conforms to one or more predetermined formats, decrypting the video asset, verifying that the video asset complies with a particular standard of quality, or transcoding the video asset in a manner that is supported by the set top box and the other device. The system may store the transcoded video asset.

The users may use video client devices (e.g., a set top box, etc.) to obtain free broadcast television video content (e.g., from Fox, ABC, CBS, etc.), on-demand video content (e.g., Video On-Demand (VOD), pay-per-view (PPV), etc.), and\/or pay television video content (e.g., from HBO, Cinemax, etc.) from cable television operators (e.g., Comcast, Time Warner, etc.) and\/or satellite television operators (e.g., DirectTV, Dish Network, etc.). The users may use computer devices, wireless mobile handset devices, etc. to obtain other video content from on-line content providers, such as television operators (e.g., ABC, Fox, CBS, etc.), over-the-top (OTT) content providers (e.g., Hulu, Veoh, Jaman, YouTube, etc.), and\/or other commercial content providers (e.g., Apple Computer's iTunes, Netflix, Blockbuster, etc.).","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.","Systems and\/or methods, described herein, may enable video content, of different formats, to be acquired by a video content management system (VCMS).

In another example, ingestion server  may monitor another memory that is accessible by content provider  and\/or that temporarily stores video content that is downloaded, to the other memory, by content provider . Ingestion server  may detect video content, within the other memory, and may store a copy of the video content in the ingest memory. In yet another example, ingestion server  may acquire video content by reading video content from a portable storage device, such as a video tape, a digital versatile disc (DVD), a memory card, etc., and may temporarily store the acquired video content in the ingest memory. In still another example, ingestion server  may acquire the video content via a media stream (e.g., a video stream that includes on-air video content and\/or other video content) received from content provider  and may temporarily store the acquired video content in the ingest memory. Ingestion server  may also acquire video content from content provider  via a remote server device (e.g., a web server), associated with network , and may store the acquired video content in the ingest memory.","Ingestion server  may verify the content, of the acquired video content, to ensure that the video content is in a particular format and\/or is complete when acquired from content provider . Ingestion server  may retrieve, from another memory associated with VCM system , policy information associated with content provider  and may use the policy information to determine whether the acquired video content is complete and\/or is in the particular format.","Ingestion server  may obtain high quality video assets, from the acquired video content, and may initiate an operation to ingest the video assets into VPS . The high quality video assets may be associated with a level of resolution that is greater than a threshold or a bit rate that is greater than another threshold. In another example, ingestion server  may, based on the policy information, decrypt the video assets to allow further processing to be performed on the video assets and\/or to temporarily store the decrypted video assets in the ingest memory.","Ingestion server  may obtain metadata, associated with the video assets, from the acquired video content and\/or may decrypt the metadata.

Content processor  may process video assets received from ingestion server .","Content processor  may, for example, perform a quality control and\/or quality analysis operation on decrypted video assets received from ingest server  and\/or retrieved from the ingest memory. For example, content processor  may analyze each of the video assets to identify a condition (e.g., a gap within a video signal, a distorted video signal, etc.) within the video asset. The condition may, for example, correspond to a portion and\/or gap, within the video asset, where there is no video signal and\/or that renders a blank screen when displayed via user device . Content processor  may reduce a size and\/or time period associated with the gap. In another example, content processor  may check each of the video assets to determine whether the video assets comply with video and\/or audio standards (e.g., Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)-2, MPEG-4, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) H.264, Video Coding (VC)-1, etc.), formats (e.g., quarter common intermediate format (QCIF), CIF, standard definition (SD), high definition (HD), etc.), and\/or specifications that are utilized by VPS  and\/or specified by an operator associated with VPS .","Content processor  may perform an operation to repair and\/or reformat a video asset that does not comply with the video and\/or audio standards, formats, and\/or specifications. Content processor  may, in another example, receive instructions from an operator of VCM system  and may execute the instructions to repair and\/or reformat the video asset. Content processor  may send a request to content provider  to reacquire video content, with which the video asset is associated, based on a determination that the video asset that content processor  is not able to repair and\/or reformat the video asset.","Content processor  may store the video asset in a memory associated with VCM system  (sometimes referred to as a \u201cmezzanine memory\u201d). The video asset, stored in the mezzanine memory, may be used as a source video asset from which copies may be generated for other processing and\/or formatting, as part of a recovery process (e.g., to restore video assets that may have been lost, etc.), and\/or for other purposes. In one example, content processor  may use the source video asset to generate copies of the video asset.","Content processor  may process and\/or transcode the copies of the video assets into formats that can be supported (e.g., received, processed, played, etc.) by different types of user devices  (e.g., set top boxes, computer devices, wireless mobile handsets, gaming devices, etc.). For example, each copy may correspond to respective different formats associated with unique bit rates, levels of resolution (e.g., standard definition, high definition, etc.), frame refresh rates, screen sizes (e.g., aspect ratios, dimensions, etc.), compression\/decompression (CODEC) ratios, etc. that can be supported by wireless handset devices, computer devices, set top boxes, gaming devices, etc. Content processor  may store the transcoded copies of the video assets in another memory associated with VCM system  (sometimes referred to as a \u201cpublish memory\u201d).
