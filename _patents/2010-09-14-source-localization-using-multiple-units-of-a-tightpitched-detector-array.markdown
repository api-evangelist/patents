More particularly, the invention is directed to obtaining a probabilistic estimate of a location of an illicit radiation source within an environment.","This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is, inter alia, recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Illicit radioactive material can potentially appear in a wide range of public venues. Large national public events are routinely monitored for such radioactive sources. One element in a plan for managing such threats involves searching for sources in venues at risk and tracking the sources in real time when they are detected. A radiation source that can be tracked unobtrusively potentially yields useful information such as the purveyor's identity and, for future threat reduction, the means by which the source was deployed. In addition, real-time incident-specific information is of use to on-site security personnel.","Two examples of environments that can benefit from monitoring include the confined-venue (e.g. a stadium or a convention center) and the wide-area venue. In the confined-venue problem pedestrian traffic enters through a limited number of entrances or what are effectively choke points. Screening for radiation sources can generally be achieved with a few radiation detectors located proximate the choke points. For example, because the distances are relatively short, allowing coverage by a few well placed fixed detectors, thereby eliminating the manpower requirements of mobile detectors, integrated fixed isotropic detectors may be used. On the other hand, in the wide-area problem access to the venue is less controlled both in time and space. For example, a ship boarding party inspecting a vessel and its cargo whose disposition is not well characterized is unable to take advantage of choke points to locate a radiation source. Further examples of wide-area problems include large open-air events, such as an inauguration, having many pedestrian approaches, some of which are large spaces with no choke point. The differences between the confined-venue problem and the wide-area problem have implications for the types of detectors most suited for monitoring of radiation sources within those environments.","A directional-detector array is generally known within the nuclear threat-reduction community. Such a radiation detector array may process measured count data by taking simple ratios of counts without treatment of various uncertainties and ambient conditions within the environment. Significantly, existing radiation detection systems are not capable of estimating an (x,y) position for a radiation source. Although existing directional detectors can estimate a direction, they cannot provide a probability of locating a source as a function of direction. Current directional-detector technology is further limited as such systems generally operate as a standalone unit without the capability for sharing data among several units to improve the accuracy of the source position estimate. Existing directional detection methods also do not provide an estimate for direction uncertainty. Other directional detectors, including the Compton-scattering camera, the coded-aperture imager, and positron emission backscatter imaging, suffer from similar deficiencies.","Accordingly, there is a need to improve current radiation detection, search and tracking capabilities while reducing the cost of the detection equipment and deployment of the equipment. To date, emphasis has largely been placed on developing and engineering advanced detector materials to provide greater measurement sensitivity. More recently, the use of various algorithms to tease more information out of detector signals has received interest. One such area involves combining the signals from multiple detectors to improve sensitivity and the position estimate. However, many existing systems provide only a simple alarming capability on a detector-by-detector basis and leave it to the operator to infer source position. Additionally, a fundamental problem that generally underlies radiation source tracking is an inability to achieve acceptable position estimate accuracy in an environment where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, which may preclude obtaining an estimate of the source position.","Various embodiments of the present systems and methods incorporate radiation detection and processing, of statistical and deterministic phenomena, to generate a statistically qualified best estimate for source direction employing a single directional detector. In other embodiments, multiple detector units operating in an integrated fashion yield information describing source location and location uncertainty. While conventional detectors that use a single detector element to seek out a source lack directional capability, the present directional detectors are configured to provide the operator with an indication of the direction to the source. Additionally, various embodiments of the present systems and methods address a fundamental problem that underlies source tracking: achieving acceptable position estimate accuracy in an environment where the signal-to-noise ratio is so low that it may often preclude being able to estimate the source position using conventional methods. This problem may be solved by using directional-detector arrays with advanced signal analysis algorithms and integration of multiple detectors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.","Signals from multiple and different types of detectors\u2014fixed versus mobile and isotropic versus directional as dictated by the unique requirements of the environment and circumstance\u2014can be integrated to increase overall sensitivity per unit equipment and manpower cost. For example, the wide-area problem may be economically approached using a combination of fixed-isotropic and mobile and\/or fixed directional detectors. Using only the former type, the large area, compared to the range of a detector, necessitates many detectors with the added problem that they interfere with the normal use of the venue space. A more practical solution involves a combination of a number of fixed-isotropic detectors to cover heavily trafficked paths and fixed and\/or mobile directional detectors that provide a search capability to home in on a source. Source tracking using multiple directional detectors in a probabilistic framework may also be used. Such an arrangement can subsume isotropic non-directional detectors. Although it is assumed that the position and orientation of the various directional detectors is known, it does not matter whether the detectors are mobile or fixed.","Various embodiments include a standalone directional detector that present a probability of locating a source as a function of direction. Other embodiments include multiple integrated directional detectors that provide a probability of finding a source as a function of position. The present embodiments offer several advantages, including, in the case of a standalone unit, a precise statement of direction including an estimate of direction uncertainty, and, in the case of a networked system of multiple directional-detector arrays, a more accurate position estimate and a more precise statement of position including an estimate of position uncertainty.","In an embodiment, a radiation detection system for obtaining a location of a radiation source within an environment comprises at least one directional detector positionable within an environment and angularly orientatable in relation to the environment. The at least one directional detector is configured to detect gamma-ray radiation emitted from a source at an unknown location within the environment and distal from the position of the at least one directional detector. A processing unit in communication with the at least one directional detector is configured to receive radiation count data from the at least one directional detector. The processing unit is adapted to determine a probability of a direction to the source relative to the at least one directional detector based on the radiation count data obtained at a plurality of angles of the directional detector. The system further includes an output unit in communication with the processing unit. The output unit is adapted to report information indicative of the probability of the direction to the source relative to the position of the at least one directional detector.","In another embodiment, a method for determining the location of a radiation source within an environment comprises positioning within an environment at least one directional detector array. The directional detector array includes a plurality of detector elements configured to detect radiation emitted by a source disposed at an unknown location within the environment. The method further comprises operating the at least one directional detector array at its position to partially occlude source radiation from at least one of the plurality of detector elements. Radiation counts are acquired for each of the detector elements of the at least one directional detector array. The method further includes processing the radiation counts from each of the detector elements with a processing unit to determine a probability density function for a direction to the source in relation to the position of the at least one directional detector array. The method may further comprise outputting information indicative of the direction to the source relative to position of the at least one directional detector array via an output unit.","In yet another embodiment, a computer readable product for determining a location of a radiation source within an environment comprises machine readable program code for causing, when executed, a method that comprises receiving radiation count data from at least one directional detector configured to detect radiation count data emitted by a source having a unknown location and unknown energy and receiving detector information, the detector information including a position and an angular orientation of the at least one directional detector with respect to the environment. The method further comprises generating a probability density function of a direction to the source in relation to the position of the at least one directional detector based on the radiation count data and the detector information and outputting information representative of the direction to the source from the at least one directional detector based on the probability density function.","These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention, together with the organization and manner of operation therefore, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.","According to an embodiment, a directional radiation detector obtains source directionality by either placing an absorbing medium between detector elements, which are arranged in an array, or by positioning the individual detector elements such that the view of the source by each detector is partially occluded. The degree of occlusion is a function of the orientation of the array with respect to the source. Processing of count rate data associated with the detector unit relates relative count rates in individual detector elements with the direction of the incoming radiation. Processing of count rate data may be accomplished in near real-time to achieve efficient detection and tracking of a radiation source within an environment. The relationship between count rate and array orientation needed to infer source direction may be established a priori, for example, in the laboratory or through simulations.","Various embodiments of the present systems and methods incorporate an occluded detector array that comprises a matrix of tightly packed individual detectors. Such a tight-pitched directional array arranges a plurality of radiation sensors that are closely spaced together, for example, within one foot of each other when configured in a substantially square orientation. In light of the detector orientation, each detector in the tight-pitched directional array obtains a slightly different radiation signal. Processing may be performed on the detector signals to assign an uncertainty or probability that the source is within the detector's field-of-view. Taken collectively, count rates from the matrix of detectors exhibit unique angular dependence, thereby providing the basis for determining directionality of the radiation source relative to the directional detector. Thus a directional detector array can include a plurality of tightly-packed individual detector elements and the principle of occlusion may be applied to infer the direction of a radioactive source. Various embodiments may use gamma ray or neutron detectors.","Signal processing of count data for a single standalone directional detector provide a precise statement of angle to the source, including an estimate for position angle uncertainty. Extending the signal processing capability within an integrated system comprising multiple units provides a more accurate position estimate than is achievable using the same number of standalone units operating independent of each other. By operating in an integrated fashion, count data from multiple detector units provide an estimate for the coordinates, i.e., location within an environment, of a radiation source detected in the surveilled space.","A number of attributes may be taken into consideration in arriving at the estimate for source location. These include representation of the positions of the directional detector units with respect to each other and the constraints this places on physically possible source location; the dependence of individual detector element count rates on source position and array orientation and the constraints this places on physically possible source locations; the measurable variation in background radiation with detector position and its subsequent removal from the total count rate providing a better estimate for the source activity; and the known uncertainties in measurements. The predicted spatial region that contains the radiation source may be defined with given confidence upon propagating these various uncertainties. Although the approach and signal processing has been described for a tight-pitched occluded array detector, the approach is generally applicable to other detector types. These include the Compton-scattering camera, the coded-aperture camera, and positron emission backscatter imaging.","The primary principle for determining the direction to a gamma-ray source is based on self-occlusion of the detector elements. To occlude is to prevent the passage of something. In terms of the present systems and methods, occlusion is the attenuation of gamma-rays by various detector elements. A model for the emission of gamma rays from a radioactive source is derived from a few basic assumptions. One assumption is that the probability of a single emission per unit time is \u03bb This differs from the traditional use of \u03bb to denote activity. It is assumed that the number of gamma rays, n, emitted in the time interval \u0394t by a source is a random variable characterized by a Poisson distribution:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bb\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mo":"\u2758","mi":"n"}}},{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03bb\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mi":"n"},"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"!"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"\u03bb\u0394"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"t"}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"The parameter \u03bb exclusive to the radioactive decay process and has no dependence on detector location or detection efficiency.

In a particular embodiment, an array of four detector elements are arranged in a substantially square configuration, however, other configurations may be implemented. A set of detector elements arranged in a tight-pitched array is a special case of the general configuration of detectors treated above. The same model is therefore applicable for describing the tight-pitched array. However, in view of the properties of the tight-pitched array, a reduced form of the model is obtainable; and the shape of the probability density function is altered. The shape of the tight-pitched array reflects the fact that the probability density function will have its maximum value along the radius pointing out from the center of the detector array in the direction of the source.","To derive the probability density function for the case of a detector element that is a member of a tight-pitched array, Equation (5), which gives the probability of finding the source at a distance rfrom an isotropic detector i with counts n, is re-written.

The degree of occlusion will depend on the location of the source relative to the detector unit and the unit's orientation. The dependence of count rate on these two effects is captured by the term \u03b7( )\/\u03b7( ). This term can be conveniently measured in the laboratory or other setting.","An estimate for the source position is obtained in a manner analogous to that for the non-occluded array. The likelihood that for a given value of that the model reproduces the measured counts is given by Equation (23). For a grid that overlays an environment, e.g., a venue, equation (23) defines a three-dimensional surface that is the probability of finding the source at any position within the environment. This surface will have a maximum along the radius that extends from the center of the detector unit out through the source. That is the probability will be maximized for the value of that corresponds to the direction to the source. The main features of such a surface displayed as probability contours are shown in . Although directionality is described for a two dimensional system, it can be extended to three dimensions by including an azimuthal angle, \u03a8.","The above development neglects the dependence of average path length through a detector on the distance of the source from the detector element. That is, as the source distance from the detector element is varied, the distribution of paths through the detector of the incident radiation changes. This is a consequence of the detector element having a finite size. Strictly then, absolute detector efficiency will depend on distance. It is also noted that absolute efficiency depends on incident photon energy. Thus, in equation (23) the efficiency more properly becomes\n\n\u03b7( )\u2192\u03b7( ),\u2003\u2003(24)\n\nwhere r is the source-detector distance and E is the photon energy. The dependence on r may be used to estimate source distance from the detector array. The accuracy of the estimate will depend on how strong a function this is.\n","As demonstrated above, a single detector array can provide the direction to the source but as a practical matter the signal cannot reliably provide the distance to the source and hence not the source position within the venue. Two or more such detector units, however, can provide source position through the intersection of their respective directional radii. For multiple and widely-separated detector arrays a probability surface for the source position overlays the venue grid. Thus, for an element i in array j denoted by A, Equation (21)

The angle to the source with respect to the array's reference direction is \u03b8; and the angle to the source with respect to the line parallel to the x axis that passes through the array center  is \u03b8.
