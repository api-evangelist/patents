{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application includes as part of its disclosure a biological sequence listing which is being concurrently submitted through EFS-Web. Said biological sequence listing is contained in a file named \u201c67858o980000.txt\u201d which was created on Mar. 14, 2013 and has a size of 645,639 bytes, and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention pertains to antibodies and fragments thereof, preferably high affinity or avidity antibodies having binding specificity to Hepatocyte Growth Factor (hereinafter \u201cHGF\u201d). More specifically, the invention also pertains to methods of screening for diseases and disorders associated with HGF, and methods of preventing or treating diseases and disorders associated with HGF by administering said antibodies or fragments thereof.","2. Description of Related Art","Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) (also known as scatter factor (SF) is produced as a single-chain inactive precursor that is cleaved by serine proteases into two chains that are linked by a disulfide bond. (Abounader, R., et al., Neuro-Oncology, 7:436-451 (2005)). The gene encoding HGF is located on chromosome 7q21.1. The biologically active form of HGF is a heterodimer composed of a 69-kDa \u03b1-chain and a 34-kDa \u03b2-chain. The \u03b1-chain contains an N-terminal hairpin domain and 4 kringle domains, while the \u03b2-chain contains a serine protease-like domain having no enzymatic activity. Id.","Human Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) is a multifunctional heterodimeric polypeptide produced by mesenchymal cells. HGF has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis, morphogenesis and motogenesis, as well as the growth and scattering of various cell types (Bussolino et al., J. Cell. Biol. 119: 629, 1992; Zarnegar and Michalopoulos, J. Cell. Biol. 129:1177, 1995; Matsumoto et al, Ciba. Found. Symp. 212:198, 1997; Birchmeier and Gherardi, Trends Cell. Biol. 8:404, 1998; Xin et al., Am. J. pathol. 158:1111, 2001). The pleiotropic activities of HGF are mediated through its receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the proto-oncogene c-met. In addition to regulating a variety of normal cellular functions, HGF and its receptor c-met have been shown to be involved in the initiation, invasion and metastasis of tumors (Jeffers et al., J. Mol. Med. 74:505, 1996; Comoglio and Trusolino, J. Clin. Invest. 109:857, 2002). HGF\/c-met are coexpressed, often over-expressed, on various human solid tumors including tumors derived from lung, colon, rectum, stomach, kidney, ovary, skin, multiple myeloma and thyroid tissue (Prat et al., Int. J. Cancer 49:323, 1991; Chan et al., Oncogene 2:593, 1988; Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol, 8:229, 1993; Derksen et al., Blood 99:1405, 2002). HGF acts as an autocrine (Rong et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:4731, 1994; Koochekpour et al., Cancer Res. 57:5391, 1997) and paracrine growth factor (Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993) and anti-apoptotic regulator (Gao et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:47257, 2001) for these tumors.","HGF is a 102 kDa protein with sequence and structural similarity to plasminogen and other enzymes of blood coagulation (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989; Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993, each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Human HGF is synthesized as a 728 amino acid precursor (preproHGF), which undergoes intracellular cleavage to an inactive, single chain form (proHGF) (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989: Rosen et al., J. Cell. Biol. 127:1783, 1994). Upon extracellular secretion, proHGF is cleaved to yield the biologically active disulfide-linked heterodimeric molecule composed of an alpha.subunit and beta-subunit (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989; Naldini et al., EMBO J. 11:4825, 1992). The alpha-subunit contains 440 residues (69 kDa with glycosylation), consisting of the N-terminal hairpin domain and four kringle domains. The beta-subunit contains 234 residues (34 kDa) and has a serine protease-like domain, which lacks proteolytic activity. Cleavage of HGF is required for receptor activation, but not for receptor binding (Hartmann et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11574, 1992; Lokker et al., J. Biol. Chem. 288:17145, 1992). HGF contains 4 putative N-glycosylation sites, 1 in the alpha-subunit and 3 in the beta-subunit. HGF has 2 unique cell specific binding sites: a high affinity (Kd=2\u00d710M) binding site for the c-met receptor and a low affinity (Kd=10.sup.-9 M) binding site for heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which are present on the cell surface and extracellular matrix (Naldinl et al., Oncogene 6:501, 1991; Bardelii et al., J. Biotechnol. 37:109, 1994; Sakata et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272:9457, 1997).","c-met is a member of the class IV protein tyrosine kinase receptor family. The full length c-met gene was cloned and identified as the c-met proto-oncogene (Cooper et al., Nature 311:29, 1984; Park et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:6379, 1987). The c-met receptor is initially synthesized as a single chain, partially glycosylated precursor, p170(Park et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:6379, 1987; Giordano et al., Nature 339:155, 1989; Giordano et al., Oncogene 4:1383, 1989; Bardelli et al., J. Biotechnol. 37:109, 1994). Upon further glycosylation, the protein is proteolytically cleaved into a heterodimeric 190 kDa mature protein (1385 amino acids), consisting of the 50 kDa alpha-subunit (residues 1-307) and the 145 kDa beta-subunit. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the beta-subunit is involved in signal transduction.","Several different approaches have been investigated to obtain HGF inhibitors or HGF antagonists. Such inhibitors include truncated HGF proteins such as NK1 (N terminal domain plus kringle domain 1: Lokker et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:17145, 1993); NK2 (N terminal domain plus kringle domains 1 and 2: Chan et al., Science 254:1382, 1991); and NK4 (N-terminal domain plus four kringle domains), which was shown to partially inhibit the primary growth and metastasis of murine lung tumor LLC in a nude mouse model (Kuba et al., Cancer Res. 60:6737, 2000).","As another approach, Dodge (Master's Thesis, San Francisco State University, 1998) generated antagonist anti-c-met monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). One mAb, 5D5, exhibited strong antagonistic activity in ELISA, but induced a proliferative response of c-met-expressing BAF-3 cells, presumably due to dimerization of the membrane receptors. For this reason, a single domain form of the anti-c-met mAb 5D5 has been developed as an antagonist (Nguyen et al., Cancer Gene Ther, 10:840, 2003).","Cao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:7443, 2001, reported that the administration of a cocktail of three anti-HGF mAbs, which were selected based upon their ability to inhibit the scattering activity of HGF in vitro, were able to inhibit the growth of human tumors in the xenograft nude mouse model.","More recently, neutralizing (inhibitory) anti-HGF mAbs have been reported including L2G7 (Kim et al., Clin Cancer Res 12:1292, 2006, WO 2005\/107800, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,410 HuL2G7 (WO 2007\/115049, the human mAbs described in WO 2005\/17107, and the HGF binding proteins described in WO 2007\/143090 or WO 2007\/143098. It has also been reported that the anti-HGF mAb L2G7, when administered systemically, can strongly inhibit growth or even induce regression of orthotopic (intracranial) glioma xenografts and prolong animal survival (Kim et al., op. cit and WO 2006\/130773).","As disclosed herein, HGF promotes the growth and\/or scattering of various cell types, and has been shown to be involved in the promotion of angiogenesis, the inhibition of cell growth, and the conversion from a mesenchymal to an epithelial phenotype. Also, both HGF and c-met are expressed in a wide variety of human tumors, and their expression levels is sometimes correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover HGF is believed to play a role in the development of a multitude of diseases and disorders, including but not limited to the development and metastasis of numerous cancers, and the development of macular degeneration. Due to the perceived involvement of HGF in a wide range of diseases and disorders, there remains a need in the art for HGF antagonists and compositions containing and methods useful for preventing or treating diseases associated with HGF, as well as methods of screening to identify patients having diseases or disorders associated with HGF. Particularly preferred are anti-HGF antagonists and compositions containing which effectively inhibit at least one HGF associated biological activity and which elicit minimal or no adverse reactions when administered to a patient. The present invention achieves this objective.","The present invention is directed to specific antibodies and fragments thereof having binding specificity for HGF, in particular antibodies having desired epitopic specificity, high affinity or avidity and\/or functional properties and the use thereof in therapy and diagnostics. Specifically, the invention provides chimeric or humanized antibodies and fragments thereof capable of binding to HGF and\/or the HGF-HGFR (c-met) complex.

Human Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) is a multifunctional heterodimeric polypeptide produced by mesenchymal cells. HGF has been shown to stimulate angiogenesis, morphogenesis and motogenesis, as well as the growth and scattering of various cell types (Bussolino et al., J. Cell. Biol. 119: 629, 1992; Zarnegar and Michalopoulos, J. Cell. Biol. 129:1177, 1995; Matsumoto et al., Ciba. Found. Symp. 212:198, 1997; Birchmeier and Gherardi, Trends Cell. Biol. 8:404, 1998; Xin et al. Am. J. Pathol. 158:1111, 2001). The pleiotropic activities of HGF are mediated through its receptor, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by the proto-oncogene c-met. In addition to regulating a variety of normal cellular functions, HGF and its receptor c-met have been shown to be involved in the initiation, invasion and metastasis of tumors (Jeffers et al., J. Mol. Med. 74:505, 1996; Comoglio and Trusolino, J. Clin. Invest. 109:857, 2002). HGF\/c-met are coexpressed, often over-expressed, on various human solid tumors including tumors derived from lung, colon, rectum, stomach, kidney, ovary, skin, multiple myeloma and thyroid tissue (Prat et al., Int. J. Cancer 49:323, 1991; Chan et al., Oncogene 2:593, 1988; Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993; Derksen et al., Blood 99:1405, 2002). HGF acts as an autocrine (Rong et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:4731, 1994; Koochekpour et al., Cancer Res. 57:5391, 1997) and paracrine growth factor (Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993) and anti-apoptotic regulator (Gao et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:47257, 2001) for these tumors. HGF is a 102 kDa protein with sequence and structural similarity to plasminogen and other enzymes of blood coagulation (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989; Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993). Human HGF is synthesized as a 728 amino acid precursor (preproHGF), which undergoes intracellular cleavage to an inactive, single chain form (proHGF) (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989; Rosen et al., J.

Upon extracellular secretion, proHGF is cleaved to yield the biologically active disulfide-linked heterodimeric molecule composed of an a-subunit and n-subunit (Nakamura et al., Nature 342:440, 1989; Naldini et al., EMBO J. 11:4825, 1992). The alpha-subunit contains 440 residues (69 kDa with glycosylation), consisting of the N-terminal hairpin domain and four kringle domains. The beta-subunit contains 234 residues (34 kDa) and has a serine protease-like domain, which lacks proteolytic activity. HGF has two unique cell specific binding sites: a high affinity (Kd=2\u00d710\u00b0 M) binding site for the c-met receptor and a low affinity (Kd=10M) binding site for heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which are present on the cell surface and extracellular matrix (Naldini et al., Oncogene 6:501, 1991; Bardelli et al., J. Biotechnol. 37:109, 1994; Sakata et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272:9457, 1997).","\u201cc-met\u201d or \u201cHGF-R\u201d is a member of the class IV protein tyrosine kinase receptor family. The full length c-met gene was cloned and identified as the c-met proto-oncogene (Cooper et al., Nature 311:29, 1984; Park et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:6379, 1987). NK2 (a protein encompassing the N-terminus and first two kringle domains of the alpha-subunit) is sufficient for binding to c-met and activation of the signal cascade for motility, however the full length protein is required for the mitogenic response (Weidner et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 8:229, 1993). HSPG binds to HGF by interacting with the N terminus of HGF. HGF\/c-met have been reported to play important roles in several aspects of cancer development such as tumor initiation, invasion, metastasis, regulation of apoptosis and angiogenesis. Several different approaches have been investigated to obtain an effective antagonistic molecule: truncated HGF proteins such as NK1 (N terminal domain plus kringle domain 1; Lokker et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:17145, 1993), NK2 (N terminal domain plus kringle domains 1 and 2; Chan et al., Science 254:1382, 1991) and NK4 (N-terminal domain plus four kringle domains; Kuba et al., Cancer Res. 60:6737, 2000), anti-c-met mAbs (Dodge, Master's Thesis, San Francisco State University, 1998) and anti-HGF mAbs (Cao et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:7443, 2001).","The term \u201cNeutralizing or Antagonizing Anti-HGF antibody or antibody fragment\u201d or \u201cHGF Antibody Antagonist\u201d herein refers to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds HGF (i.e., an anti-HGF mAb), wherein the binding partially or completely inhibits one or more biological activities of HGF (i.e., when the mAb is used as a single agent). Among the biological properties of HGF that a neutralizing antibody may inhibit are the ability of HGF to bind to its c-met receptor, to cause the scattering of certain cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells; to stimulate proliferation of (i.e., be mitogenic for) certain cells including hepatocytes, Mv 1 Lu mink lung epithelial cells, and various human tumor cells; to cause scattering of specific cells, to stimulate angiogenesis, for example as measured by stimulation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation or tube formation or by induction of blood vessels when applied to the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), to promote cell invasion or metastasis, and to promote fibrosis. A \u201cblocking\u201d antibody or an \u201cantagonist\u201d antibody preferably is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds (for e.g., activated HGF beta chain or site\/epitope on c-met to which activated HGF beta binds).

Desirable effects of treatment include preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, preventing metastasis, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or disorder.","An \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of a substance\/molecule of the invention, agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the substance\/molecule, agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual.

Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al., J. Gen Virol., 36:59 (1977)); Chinese hamster ovary cells\/\u2212DHFR(CHO, Urlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:4216 (1980)); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather, Biol.

The selection of the appropriate host cell is deemed to be within the skill in the art. Preferred mammalian cells for antibody expression include CHO cells and COS cells. In an exemplary embodiment the recombinant host cells are haploidal or polyploidal yeast cells of the genus ","Mating competent yeast species: In the present invention this is intended to broadly encompass any diploid or tetraploid yeast which can be grown in culture. Such species of yeast may exist in a haploid, diploid, or other polyploid form. The cells of a given ploidy may, under appropriate conditions, proliferate for an indefinite number of generations in that form. Diploid cells can also sporulate to form haploid cells. Sequential mating can result in tetraploid strains through further mating or fusion of diploid strains. The present invention contemplates the use of haploid yeast, as well as diploid or other polyploid yeast cells produced, for example, by mating or spheroplast fusion.","Mating competent yeast include yeast which are a member of the Saccharomycetaceae family, which includes the genera ; and . Other types of yeast potentially useful in the invention include and ","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mating competent yeast is a member of the genus . In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the mating competent yeast of the genus is one of the following species: , and (). In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the mating competent yeast of the genus is the species ","Haploid Yeast Cell: A cell having a single copy of each gene of its normal genomic (chromosomal) complement.","Polyploid Yeast Cell: A cell having more than one copy of its normal genomic (chromosomal) complement.","Diploid Yeast Cell: A cell having two copies (alleles) of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement, typically formed by the process of fusion (mating) of two haploid cells.","Tetraploid Yeast Cell: A cell having four copies (alleles) of essentially every gene of its normal genomic complement, typically formed by the process of fusion (mating) of two haploid cells. Tetraploids may carry two, three, four or more different expression cassettes. Such tetraploids might be obtained in by selective mating homozygotic heterothallic a\/a and alpha\/alpha diploids and in by sequential mating of haploids to obtain auxotrophic diploids. For example, a [met his] haploid can be mated with [ade his] haploid to obtain diploid [his]; and a [met arg] haploid can be mated with [ade arg] haploid to obtain diploid [arg]; then the diploid [his] x diploid [arg] to obtain a tetraploid prototroph. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that reference to the benefits and uses of diploid cells may also apply to tetraploid cells.","Yeast Mating: The process by which two haploid yeast cells naturally fuse to form one diploid yeast cell.","Meiosis: The process by which a diploid yeast cell undergoes reductive division to form four haploid spore products. Each spore may then germinate and form a haploid vegetatively growing cell line.","Selectable Marker: A selectable marker is a gene or gene fragment that confers a growth phenotype (physical growth characteristic) on a cell receiving that gene as, for example through a transformation event. The selectable marker allows that cell to survive and grow in a selective growth medium under conditions in which cells that do not receive that selectable marker gene cannot grow. Selectable marker genes generally fall into several types, including positive selectable marker genes such as a gene that confers on a cell resistance to an antibiotic or other drug, temperature when two temperature sensitive (\u201cts\u201d) mutants are crossed or a is mutant is transformed; negative selectable marker genes such as a biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell the ability to grow in a medium without a specific nutrient needed by all cells that do not have that biosynthetic gene, or a mutagenized biosynthetic gene that confers on a cell inability to grow by cells that do not have the wild type gene; and the like. Suitable markers include but are not limited to: ZEO; G418; LYS3; MET1; MET3a; ADE1; ADE3; URA3; and the like.","Expression Vector: These DNA vectors contain elements that facilitate manipulation for the expression of a foreign protein within the target host cell. Conveniently, manipulation of sequences and production of DNA for transformation is first performed in a bacterial host, e.g. , and usually vectors will include sequences to facilitate such manipulations, including a bacterial origin of replication and appropriate bacterial selection marker. Selection markers encode proteins necessary for the survival or growth of transformed host cells grown in a selective culture medium. Host cells not transformed with the vector containing the selection gene will not survive in the culture medium. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media. Exemplary vectors and methods for transformation of yeast are described, for example, in Burke, D., Dawson, D., & Stearns, T. (2000). Methods in yeast genetics: a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course manual. Plainview, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","Expression vectors for use in the methods of the invention will further include a selectable auxotrophic or drug marker for identifying transformed cells such as yeast strains. A drug marker may further be used to amplify copy number of the vector in a host cell.","The polypeptide coding sequence of interest is operably linked to transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences that provide for expression of the polypeptide in yeast cells. These vector components may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. Sequences for the secretion of the polypeptide may also be included, e.g. a signal sequence, and the like. An origin of replication is optional, as expression vectors are often integrated into the host, e.g., yeast genome. In one embodiment of the invention, the polypeptide of interest is operably linked, or fused, to sequences providing for optimized secretion of the polypeptide from yeast diploid cells.","Nucleic acids are \u201coperably linked\u201d when placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a signal sequence is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites or alternatively via a PCR\/recombination method familiar to those skilled in the art (Gateway\u00ae Technology; Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.). If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adapters or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.","Promoters are untranslated sequences located upstream (5\u2032) to the start codon of a structural gene (generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control the transcription and translation of particular nucleic acid sequences to which they are operably linked. Such promoters fall into several classes: inducible, constitutive, and repressible promoters (that increase levels of transcription in response to absence of a repressor). Inducible promoters may initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, e.g., the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.","The promoter fragment may also serve as the site for homologous recombination and integration of the expression vector into the same site in the host genome; alternatively a selectable marker is used as the site for homologous recombination.","Examples of suitable promoters useful in include the AOX1 and promoter (Cregg et al. (1989) 9:1316-1323); ICL1 promoter (Menendez et al. (2003) 20(13): 1097-108); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GAP) (Waterham et al. (1997) 186(1):37-44); and FLD1 promoter (Shen et al. (1998) 216(1):93-102). The GAP promoter is a strong constitutive promoter and the AOX and FLD1 promoters are inducible.","Other yeast promoters include ADH1, alcohol dehydrogenase II, GAL4, PHO3, PHO5, Pyk, and chimeric promoters derived therefrom. Additionally, non-yeast promoters may be used in the invention such as mammalian, insect, plant, reptile, amphibian, bacterial, fungal, viral, and avian promoters. Most typically the promoter will comprise a mammalian promoter (potentially endogenous to the expressed genes) or will comprise a yeast or viral promoter that provides for efficient transcription in yeast systems.","The polypeptides of interest may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, e.g. a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general, the signal sequence may be a component of the vector, or it may be a part of the polypeptide coding sequence that is inserted into the vector. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed through one of the standard pathways available within the host cell. The alpha factor pre-pro signal has proven effective in the secretion of a variety of recombinant proteins from . Other yeast signal sequences include the alpha mating factor signal sequence, the invertase signal sequence, and signal sequences derived from other secreted yeast polypeptides. Additionally, these signal peptide sequences may be engineered to provide for enhanced secretion in diploid yeast expression systems. Other secretion signals of interest also include mammalian signal sequences, which may be heterologous to the protein being secreted, or may be a native sequence for the protein being secreted. Signal sequences include pre-peptide sequences, and in some instances may include propeptide sequences. Many such signal sequences are known in the art, including the signal sequences found on immunoglobulin chains, e.g., K28 preprotoxin sequence, PHA-E, FACE, human MCP-1, human serum albumin signal sequences, human Ig heavy chain, human Ig light chain, and the like. For example, see Hashimoto et. al. Protein Eng 11(2) 75 (1998); and Kobayashi et. al. Therapeutic Apheresis 2(4) 257 (1998).","Transcription may be increased by inserting a transcriptional activator sequence into the vector. These activators are cis-acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, which act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Transcriptional enhancers are relatively orientation and position independent, having been found 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to the transcription unit, within an intron, as well as within the coding sequence itself. The enhancer may be spliced into the expression vector at a position 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 to the coding sequence, but is preferably located at a site 5\u2032 from the promoter.","Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells may also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from 3\u2032 to the translation termination codon, in untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA.","Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of the above-listed components employs standard ligation techniques or PCR\/recombination methods. Isolated plasmids or DNA fragments are cleaved, tailored, and re-ligated in the form desired to generate the plasmids required or via recombination methods. For analysis to confirm correct sequences in plasmids constructed, the ligation mixtures are used to transform host cells, and successful transformants selected by antibiotic resistance (e.g. ampicillin or Zeocin) where appropriate. Plasmids from the transformants are prepared, analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and\/or sequenced.","As an alternative to restriction and ligation of fragments, recombination methods based on att sites and recombination enzymes may be used to insert DNA sequences into a vector. Such methods are described, for example, by Landy (1989) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58:913-949; and are known to those of skill in the art. Such methods utilize intermolecular DNA recombination that is mediated by a mixture of lambda and -encoded recombination proteins. Recombination occurs between specific attachment (att) sites on the interacting DNA molecules. For a description of att sites see Weisberg and Landy (1983) Site-Specific Recombination in Phage Lambda, in Lambda II, Weisberg, ed. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.:Cold Spring Harbor Press), pp. 211-250. The DNA segments flanking the recombination sites are switched, such that after recombination, the att sites are hybrid sequences comprised of sequences donated by each parental vector. The recombination can occur between DNAs of any topology.","Att sites may be introduced into a sequence of interest by ligating the sequence of interest into an appropriate vector; generating a PCR product containing att B sites through the use of specific primers; generating a cDNA library cloned into an appropriate vector containing att sites; and the like.","Folding, as used herein, refers to the three-dimensional structure of polypeptides and proteins, where interactions between amino acid residues act to stabilize the structure. While non-covalent interactions are important in determining structure, usually the proteins of interest will have intra- and\/or intermolecular covalent disulfide bonds formed by two cysteine residues. For naturally occurring proteins and polypeptides or derivatives and variants thereof, the proper folding is typically the arrangement that results in optimal biological activity, and can conveniently be monitored by assays for activity, e.g. ligand binding, enzymatic activity, etc.","In some instances, for example where the desired product is of synthetic origin, assays based on biological activity will be less meaningful. The proper folding of such molecules may be determined on the basis of physical properties, energetic considerations, modeling studies, and the like.","The expression host may be further modified by the introduction of sequences encoding one or more enzymes that enhance folding and disulfide bond formation, i.e. foldases, chaperonins, etc. Such sequences may be constitutively or inducibly expressed in the yeast host cell, using vectors, markers, etc. as known in the art. Preferably the sequences, including transcriptional regulatory elements sufficient for the desired pattern of expression, are stably integrated in the yeast genome through a targeted methodology.","For example, the eukaryotic PDI is not only an efficient catalyst of protein cysteine oxidation and disulfide bond isomerization, but also exhibits chaperone activity. Co-expression of PDI can facilitate the production of active proteins having multiple disulfide bonds. Also of interest is the expression of BIP (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein); cyclophilin; and the like. In one embodiment of the invention, each of the haploid parental strains expresses a distinct folding enzyme, e.g. one strain may express BIP, and the other strain may express PDI or combinations thereof.","The terms \u201cdesired protein\u201d or \u201cdesired antibody\u201d are used interchangeably and refer generally to a parent antibody or fragment specific to a target, i.e., HGF or a chimeric or humanized antibody or a binding portion thereof derived therefrom or one containing the same CDRs or epitopic specificity as any of the anti-HGF antibodies or fragments described herein. The term \u201cantibody\u201d is intended to include any polypeptide chain-containing molecular structure with a specific shape that fits to and recognizes an epitope, where one or more non-covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. The archetypal antibody molecule is the immunoglobulin, and all types of immunoglobulins, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, IgD, etc., from all sources, e.g. human, rodent, rabbit, cow, sheep, pig, dog, other mammals, chicken, other avians, etc., are considered to be \u201cantibodies.\u201d A preferred source for producing antibodies useful as starting material according to the invention is rabbits. Numerous antibody coding sequences have been described; and others may be raised by methods well-known in the art. Examples thereof include chimeric antibodies, human antibodies and other non-human mammalian antibodies, humanized antibodies, single chain antibodies (such as scFvs), camelbodies, nanobodies, IgNAR (single-chain antibodies derived from sharks), small-modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and antibody fragments such as Fabs, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), monovalent antibody fragments such as MetMab like molecules, IgNars and the like.

Epub 2006 Oct. 19.","The present invention includes in particular includes monovalent antibody molecules that bind HGF, which are analogous to MetMab molecules. MetMab is a monovalent antibody specific to Met. (Met is a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence set forth in Park et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84, 7479-(1987), or fragments thereof, as well as related polypeptides, which include, but are not limited to, allelic variants, splice variants, derivative variants, substitution variants, deletion variants, and\/or insertion variants, fusion polypeptides, and interspecies homologs). The MetMab antibody, is a monovalent antibody known by different names including OA-5d5 (Genentech) and is also called One Armed 5d5, 5d5, MetMab, PRO143966, among others). Antibody OA-5d5, including its structure and properties, and methods for making and using it, are described in U.S. Publication No. 2007\/0092520. In one embodiment, an anti-HGF antibody according to the invention may comprise a single Fab region linked to an Fc region. In such embodiment, an antibody of the invention may comprise light and heavy chain variable domains as described herein. In such an embodiment, the antibody is monovalent and may comprise an intact Fc region. In another such embodiment, the Fc region may comprise at least one protuberance (knob) and at least one cavity (hole), wherein the presence of the protuberance and cavity enhances formation of a complex between an Fc polypeptide comprising the protuberance and an Fc polypeptide comprising the cavity, for example as described in WO 2005\/063816. In one embodiment, the Fc region of an antibody of the invention may comprise a first and a second Fc polypeptide, wherein the first and second polypeptide each comprises one or more mutations with respect to wild type human Fc. In one embodiment, a cavity mutation is T366S, L368A and\/or Y407V. In another embodiment, a protuberance mutation is T366W. In a specific embodiment, a monovalent antibody according to the subject invention may comprise a one-armed antibody synthesized as described in WO2005\/063816. In such embodiment, the one-armed antibody may comprise Fc mutations constituting \u201cknobs\u201d and \u201choles\u201d as described in WO2005\/063816. For example, a hole mutation can be one or more of T366A, L368A and\/or Y407V in an Fc polypeptide, and a cavity mutation can be T366W. The invention is also directed to an anti-human HGF monovalent agent that binds with the same HGF epitope and\/or competes with an anti-HGF antibody for binding to HGF as an antibody or antibody fragment disclosed herein.","For example, antibodies or antigen binding fragments may be produced by genetic engineering. In this technique, as with other methods, antibody-producing cells are sensitized to the desired antigen or immunogen. The messenger RNA isolated from antibody producing cells is used as a template to make cDNA using PCR amplification. A library of vectors, each containing one heavy chain gene and one light chain gene retaining the initial antigen specificity, is produced by insertion of appropriate sections of the amplified immunoglobulin cDNA into the expression vectors. A combinatorial library is constructed by combining the heavy chain gene library with the light chain gene library. This results in a library of clones which co-express a heavy and light chain (resembling the Fab fragment or antigen binding fragment of an antibody molecule). The vectors that carry these genes are co-transfected into a host cell. When antibody gene synthesis is induced in the transfected host, the heavy and light chain proteins self-assemble to produce active antibodies that can be detected by screening with the antigen or immunogen.","Antibody coding sequences of interest include those encoded by native sequences, as well as nucleic acids that, by virtue of the degeneracy of the genetic code, are not identical in sequence to the disclosed nucleic acids, and variants thereof. Variant polypeptides can include amino acid (aa) substitutions, additions or deletions. The amino acid substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions to eliminate non-essential amino acids, such as to alter a glycosylation site, or to minimize misfolding by substitution or deletion of one or more cysteine residues that are not necessary for function. Variants can be designed so as to retain or have enhanced biological activity of a particular region of the protein (e.g., a functional domain, catalytic amino acid residues, etc). Variants also include fragments of the polypeptides disclosed herein, particularly biologically active fragments and\/or fragments corresponding to functional domains. Techniques for in vitro mutagenesis of cloned genes are known. Also included in the subject invention are polypeptides that have been modified using ordinary molecular biological techniques so as to improve their resistance to proteolytic degradation or to optimize solubility properties or to render them more suitable as a therapeutic agent.","Chimeric antibodies may be made by recombinant means by combining the variable light and heavy chain regions (Vand V), obtained from antibody producing cells of one species with the constant light and heavy chain regions from another. Typically chimeric antibodies utilize rodent or rabbit variable regions and human constant regions, in order to produce an antibody with predominantly human domains. The production of such chimeric antibodies is well known in the art, and may be achieved by standard means (as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,659, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). It is further contemplated that the human constant regions of chimeric antibodies of the invention may be selected from IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 constant regions.","Humanized antibodies are engineered to contain even more human-like immunoglobulin domains, and incorporate only the complementarity-determining regions of the animal-derived antibody. This is accomplished by carefully examining the sequence of the hyper-variable loops of the variable regions of the monoclonal antibody, and fitting them to the structure of the human antibody chains. Although facially complex, the process is straightforward in practice. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,287, incorporated fully herein by reference.","In addition to entire immunoglobulins (or their recombinant counterparts), immunoglobulin fragments comprising the epitope binding site (e.g., Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), Fab, or other fragments) may be synthesized. \u201cFragment\u201d or minimal immunoglobulins may be designed utilizing recombinant immunoglobulin techniques. For instance \u201cFv\u201d immunoglobulins for use in the present invention may be produced by synthesizing a fused variable light chain region and a variable heavy chain region. Combinations of antibodies are also of interest, e.g. diabodies, which comprise two distinct Fv specificities. In another embodiment of the invention, SMIPs (small molecule immunopharmaceuticals), camelbodies, nanobodies, and IgNAR are encompassed by immunoglobulin fragments.","Immunoglobulins and fragments thereof may be modified post-translationally, e.g. To add effector moieties such as chemical linkers, detectable moieties, such as fluorescent dyes, enzymes, toxins, substrates, bioluminescent materials, radioactive materials, chemiluminescent moieties and the like, or specific binding moieties, such as streptavidin, avidin, or biotin, and the like may be utilized in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Examples of additional effector molecules are provided infra.","A polynucleotide sequence \u201ccorresponds\u201d to a polypeptide sequence if translation of the polynucleotide sequence in accordance with the genetic code yields the polypeptide sequence (i.e., the polynucleotide sequence \u201cencodes\u201d the polypeptide sequence), one polynucleotide sequence \u201ccorresponds\u201d to another polynucleotide sequence if the two sequences encode the same polypeptide sequence.","A \u201cheterologous\u201d region or domain of a DNA construct is an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus, when the heterologous region encodes a mammalian gene, the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the mammalian genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. Another example of a heterologous region is a construct where the coding sequence itself is not found in nature (e.g., a cDNA where the genomic coding sequence contains introns, or synthetic sequences having codons different than the native gene). Allelic variations or naturally-occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein.","A \u201ccoding sequence\u201d is an in-frame sequence of codons that (in view of the genetic code) correspond to or encode a protein or peptide sequence. Two coding sequences correspond to each other if the sequences or their complementary sequences encode the same amino acid sequences. A coding sequence in association with appropriate regulatory sequences may be transcribed and translated into a polypeptide. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence will usually be located 3\u2032 to the coding sequence. A \u201cpromoter sequence\u201d is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) coding sequence. Promoter sequences typically contain additional sites for binding of regulatory molecules (e.g., transcription factors) which affect the transcription of the coding sequence. A coding sequence is \u201cunder the control\u201d of the promoter sequence or \u201coperatively linked\u201d to the promoter when RNA polymerase binds the promoter sequence in a cell and transcribes the coding sequence into mRNA, which is then in turn translated into the protein encoded by the coding sequence.","Vectors are used to introduce a foreign substance, such as DNA, RNA or protein, into an organism or host cell. Typical vectors include recombinant viruses (for polynucleotides) and liposomes (for polypeptides). A \u201cDNA vector\u201d is a replicon, such as plasmid, phage or cosmid, to which another polynucleotide segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. An \u201cexpression vector\u201d is a DNA vector which contains regulatory sequences which will direct polypeptide synthesis by an appropriate host cell. This usually means a promoter to bind RNA polymerase and initiate transcription of mRNA, as well as ribosome binding sites and initiation signals to direct translation of the mRNA into a polypeptide(s). Incorporation of a polynucleotide sequence into an expression vector at the proper site and in correct reading frame, followed by transformation of an appropriate host cell by the vector, enables the production of a polypeptide encoded by said polynucleotide sequence.","\u201cAmplification\u201d of polynucleotide sequences is the in vitro production of multiple copies of a particular nucleic acid sequence. The amplified sequence is usually in the form of DNA. A variety of techniques for carrying out such amplification are described in a review article by Van Brunt (1990, Bio\/Technol., 8(4):291-294). Polymerase chain reaction or PCR is a prototype of nucleic acid amplification, and use of PCR herein should be considered exemplary of other suitable amplification techniques.","The general structure of antibodies in vertebrates now is well understood (Edelman, G. M., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 190: 5 (1971)). Antibodies consist of two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23,000 Daltons (the \u201clight chain\u201d), and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53,000-70,000 (the \u201cheavy chain\u201d). The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a \u201cY\u201d configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the \u201cY\u201d configuration. The \u201cbranch\u201d portion of the \u201cY\u201d configuration is designated the Fregion; the stem portion of the \u201cY\u201d configuration is designated the Fregion. The amino acid sequence orientation runs from the N-terminal end at the top of the \u201cY\u201d configuration to the C-terminal end at the bottom of each chain. The N-terminal end possesses the variable region having specificity for the antigen that elicited it, and is approximately 100 amino acids in length, there being slight variations between light and heavy chain and from antibody to antibody.","The variable region is linked in each chain to a constant region that extends the remaining length of the chain and that within a particular class of antibody does not vary with the specificity of the antibody (i.e., the antigen eliciting it). There are five known major classes of constant regions that determine the class of the immunoglobulin molecule (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE corresponding to \u03b3, \u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03b5 (gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon) heavy chain constant regions). The constant region or class determines subsequent effector function of the antibody, including activation of complement (Kabat, E. A., Structural Concepts in Immunology and Immunochemistry, 2nd Ed., p. 413-436, Holt, Rinehart, Winston (1976)), and other cellular responses (Andrews, D. W., et al., Clinical Immunobiology, pp 1-18, W. B. Sanders (1980); Kohl, S., et al., Immunology, 48: 187 (1983)); while the variable region determines the antigen with which it will react. Light chains are classified as either \u03ba (kappa) or \u03bb (lambda). Each heavy chain class can be prepared with either kappa or lambda light chain. The light and heavy chains are covalently bonded to each other, and the \u201ctail\u201d portions of the two heavy chains are bonded to each other by covalent disulfide linkages when the immunoglobulins are generated either by hybridomas or by B cells.","The expression \u201cvariable region\u201d or \u201cVR\u201d refers to the domains within each pair of light and heavy chains in an antibody that are involved directly in binding the antibody to the antigen. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain (V) at one end and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.","The expressions \u201ccomplementarity determining region,\u201d \u201chypervariable region,\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d refer to one or more of the hyper-variable or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) found in the variable regions of light or heavy chains of an antibody (See Kabat, E. A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., (1987)). These expressions include the hypervariable regions as defined by Kabat et al. (\u201cSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest,\u201d Kabat E., et al., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1983) or the hypervariable loops in 3-dimensional structures of antibodies (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196 901-917 (1987)). The CDRs in each chain are held in close proximity by framework regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site. Within the CDRs there are select amino acids that have been described as the selectivity determining regions (SDRs) which represent the critical contact residues used by the CDR in the antibody-antigen interaction (Kashmiri, S., Methods, 36:25-34 (2005)).","An \u201cepitope\u201d or \u201cbinding site\u201d is an area or region on an antigen to which an antigen-binding peptide (such as an antibody) specifically binds. A protein epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the binding (also called immunodominant component of the epitope) and other amino acid residues, which are not directly involved in the binding, such as amino acid residues which are effectively blocked by the specifically antigen binding peptide (in other words, the amino acid residue is within the \u201cfootprint\u201d of the specifically antigen binding peptide). The term epitope herein includes both types of amino acid binding sites in any particular region of HGF that specifically binds to an anti-HGF antibody. HGF may comprise a number of different epitopes, which may include, without limitation, (1) linear peptide antigenic determinants, (2) conformational antigenic determinants which consist of one or more non-contiguous amino acids located near each other in a mature HGF conformation; and (3) post-translational antigenic determinants which consist, either in whole or part, of molecular structures covalently attached to a HGF protein such as carbohydrate groups.","The phrase that a first antibody binds \u201csubstantially\u201d or \u201cat least partially\u201d the same epitope as a second antibody means that the epitope binding site for the first antibody comprises at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more of the amino acid residues on the antigen that constitutes the epitope binding site of the second antibody. Also, that a first antibody binds substantially or partially the same or overlapping epitope as a second antibody means that the first and second antibodies compete in binding to the antigen, as described above. Thus, the term \u201cbinds to substantially the same epitope or determinant as\u201d a monoclonal antibody means that an antibody \u201ccompetes\u201d with the antibody.","The phrase \u201cbinds to the same or overlapping epitope or determinant as\u201d an antibody of interest means that an antibody \u201ccompetes\u201d with said antibody of interest for at least one, or all residues on HGF to which said antibody of interest specifically binds. The identification of one or more antibodies that bind(s) to substantially or essentially the same epitope as the monoclonal antibodies described herein can be readily determined using any one of variety of immunological screening assays in which antibody competition can be assessed. A number of such assays are routinely practiced and well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,660,827, issued Aug. 26, 1997, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference). It will be understood that actually determining the epitope to which an antibody described herein binds is not in any way required to identify an antibody that binds to the same or substantially the same or overlapping epitope as the monoclonal antibody described herein.","For example, where the test antibodies to be examined are obtained from different source animals, or are even of a different Ig isotype, a simple competition assay may be employed in which the control antibody is mixed with the test antibody and then applied to a sample containing HGF. Protocols based upon ELISAs, radioimmunoassays, Western blotting, and the use of surface plasmon resonance (using an instrument such as the \u201cBIACORE\u201d) or light interferomentry (using an instrument such as the \u201cOctet\u201d) are suitable for use in such simple competition studies.","In certain embodiments, one would pre-mix the control anti-HGF antibody with varying amounts of the test antibody (e.g., in ratios of about 1:1, 1:2, 1:10 or about 1:100) for a period of time prior to applying to the HGF antigen sample. In other embodiments, the control and varying amounts of test antibody can simply be added separately and admixed during exposure to the HGF antigen sample. As long as one can distinguish bound from free antibodies (e.g., by using separation or washing techniques to eliminate unbound antibodies) and control antibody from the test antibody (e.g., by using species specific or isotype specific secondary antibodies or by specifically labeling the control antibody with a detectable label) one will be able to determine if the test antibody reduces the binding of the control antibody to the HGF antigens, indicating that the test antibody recognizes substantially the same epitope as the control ant-HGF antibody. The binding of the (labeled) control antibody in the presence of a completely irrelevant antibody (that does not bind HGF) can serve as the control high value. The control low value can be obtained by incubating the labeled control antibody with the same but unlabeled control antibody, where competition would occur and reduce binding of the labeled antibody. In a test assay, a significant reduction in labeled antibody reactivity in the presence of a test antibody is indicative of a test antibody that recognizes substantially the same epitope, i.e., one that competes with the labeled control antibody. For example, any test antibody that reduces the binding of the control antibody to HGF s by at least about 50%, such as at least about 60%, or more preferably at least about 70% (e.g., about 65-100%), at any ratio of: test antibody between about 1:1 or 1:10 and about 1:100 is considered to be an antibody that binds to substantially the same or overlapping epitope or determinant as the control antibody.","Preferably, such test antibody will reduce the binding of the control antibody to HGF antigen preferably at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 80% or at least about 90% (e.g., about 95%) of the binding of 1 the control antibody observed in the absence of the test antibody.","Competition can also or alternatively be assessed by, for example, a flow cytometry test. In such a test, cells bearing HGF can be incubated first with a control antibody that binds HGF, and then with the test antibody labeled with a fluorochrome or biotin. The antibody is said to compete with control antibody if the binding obtained upon preincubation with saturating amount of control antibody is about 80%, preferably about 50%, about 40% or less (e.g., about 30%) of the binding (as measured by mean of fluorescence) obtained by the test antibody without preincubation with control antibody. Alternatively, an antibody is said to compete with the control antibody if the binding obtained with a labeled control antibody (by a fluorochrome or biotin) on cells preincubated with saturating amount of test antibody is about 80%, preferably about 50%, about 40%, or less (e.g., about 30%) of the binding obtained without preincubation with the test antibody.","A simple competition assay in which a test antibody is pre-adsorbed and applied at saturating concentration to a surface onto which HGF is immobilized also may be advantageously employed. The surface in the simple competition assay is preferably a BIACORE chip (or other media suitable for surface plasmon resonance analysis). The binding of a control antibody that binds HGF to the HGF-coated surface is measured. This binding to the HGF-containing surface of the control antibody alone is compared with the binding of the control antibody in the presence of a test antibody. A significant reduction in binding to the HGF-containing surface by the control antibody in the presence of a test antibody indicates that the test antibody recognizes substantially the same epitope as the control antibody such that the test antibody \u201ccompetes\u201d with the control antibody. Any test antibody that reduces the binding of control antibody by at least about 20% or more, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 70%, or more, can be considered to be an antibody that binds to substantially the same epitope or determinant as the control antibody. Preferably, such test antibody will reduce the binding of the control antibody to HGF by at least about 50% (e.g., at least about 60%, at least about 70%, or more). It will be appreciated that the order of control and test antibodies can be reversed; i.e. The control antibody can be first bound to the surface and then the test antibody is brought into contact with the surface thereafter in a competition assay. Preferably, the antibody having higher affinity for HGF antigen is bound to the HGF-containing surface first, as it will be expected that the decrease in binding seen for the second antibody (assuming the antibodies are competing) will be of greater magnitude. Further examples of such assays are provided in e.g., Saunal and Regenmortel, (1995) J. Immunol. Methods 183: 33-41, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","In addition, whether an antibody binds the same or overlapping epitope(s) on HGF as another antibody or the epitope bound by a test antibody may in particular be determined using a western-blot based assay. In this assay a library of peptides corresponding to the antigen bound by the antibody, herein HGF is made, which correspond to overlapping portions of the protein, typically 10-25, 10-20 or 10-15 amino acids long. These different overlapping amino acid peptides encompassing the HGF sequence are synthesized and covalently bound to a PepSpots nitrocellulose membrane (JPT Peptide technologies, Berlin, Germany). Blots are then prepared and probed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.","Essentially, the immunoblot assay then detects by fluorimetric means what peptides in the library bind to the test antibody and thereby can identify what residues on the antigen, i.e., HGF, interact with the test antibody. (See an embodiment of this technique in U.S. Pat. No. 7,935,340, incorporated by reference herein).","The expressions \u201cframework region\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d refer to one or more of the framework regions within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody (See Kabat, E. A. et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., (1987)). These expressions include those amino acid sequence regions interposed between the CDRs within the variable regions of the light and heavy chains of an antibody.","Anti-HGF Antibodies and Binding

Such an agent may bind to the one or more of the HH ligands\u2014Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and Desert Hedgehog (DHH)\u2014or to their Patched 1 (PTCH1) or Patched 2 (PTCH2) receptors or to a downstream mediator such as Smoothened (SMOH) or SuFu or Iguana (also known as DZIP1), or to one or more of the transcription factors GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 activated by the pathway. All of these hedgehog pathway proteins are well known human proteins for which sequences are available from UniProtKB\/Swiss-Prot and similar databases. Insofar as a protein has more than one known form in a species due to natural allelic variation between individuals, an inhibitor can bind to and inhibit any, or all, of such known allelic forms, and preferably binds to and inhibits the wildtype, most common or first published allelic faun. Exemplary sequences for human SHH, IHH and DHH are assigned UniProtKB\/Swiss-Prot accession numbers Q15465, Q14623, O43323 and respectively. Exemplary sequences for other human hedgehog pathway proteins are: PTCH1 (Q13635), PTCH2 (Q9Y6C5), SMOH (Q99835), DZIP1 (Q86YF9), SuFu (Q9UMX1), Gli1 (P08151), Gli2 (P10070), Gli3 (P10071). The agent may be a protein such as a mAb, preferably a chimeric, humanized or human mAb, which binds to one or more of the HH proteins or to PTCH1 (or PTCH2), or may be a small molecule (i.e., a compound having relatively low molecular weight, most often less than 500 or 600 or 1000 kDa). Exemplary small molecule second agents are cyclopamine, KAAD-cyclopamine (3-Keto-N-(aminoethyl-aminocaproyl-dihydrocinnamoyl)cyclopamine), SANT1-4 (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2002, 99: 14071-14076,), CUR61414 (Williams et al., PNAS 2003 100: 8 4616-4621) and HhAntag-691 (Romer et al., Cancer Cell. 2004; 6:229-240); JK814 Lee, ChemBioChem 2007, 8: 1916-1919). Other examples of HH antagonists are described by WO\/2004\/020599 and Katoh, Cancer Biol Ther. 2005 4:1050-4, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,929.","Also, the subject anti-HGF antibodies and fragments may be used in combination with an agonist of PTEN, preferably human PTEN. As used herein, an \u201cagonist of PTEN\u201d or \u201cPTEN agonist\u201d means an agent that stimulates the expression of PTEN in a cell, or stimulates the activity of PTEN, or which can provide one or more of the functions of PTEN, e.g., in regulating the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR pathway. For example, PTEN is able to indirectly reduce the activity of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) by downregulating the activity of Akt An inhibitor of mTOR directly reproduces this particular role of PTEN\u2014reduction of mTOR activity\u2014so such an inhibitor is considered herein to be a PTEN agonist. This type of PTEN agonist will replace some but not necessarily all the functions of the tumor suppressor PTEN in a cancer cell with mutated or deleted PTEN, and may therefore cause the cell to revert to a more normal, less malignant phenotype. Preferred PTEN agonists\/mTOR inhibitors for use in the invention include rapamycin (Rapamune\u2122, sirolimus, ATC code L04AA10 commercially available from Wyeth) and its chemical analogues such as CCI-779 (temsirolimus, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code L01XE09, commercially available from Wyeth), RAD-001 (everolimus, ATC code L04AA18. commercially available from Novartis) and AP-2357 (Granville et al., op. cit.). Many PTEN agonists are small molecules (i.e., a compound having relatively low molecular weight, most often less than 500 or 600 kDa, or about 1000 kDa in the case of a macrolide such as rapamycin). Other agonists include mAbs, and zinc finger proteins or nucleic acids encoding the same, engineered to bind to and activate transcription of PTEN (see, e.g., WO 00\/00388). Other PTEN agonists are described in US20070280918. Whereas proteins are typically administered parenterally, e.g. intravenously, small molecules may be administered parenterally or orally. PTEN and mTOR (also known as FRAP1) are well known human proteins for which sequences are available from UniProtKB\/Swiss-Prot and similar databases. Insofar as a protein has more than one known form in a species due to natural allelic variation between individuals, an inhibitor can bind to and inhibit any, or all, of such known allelic forms, and preferably binds to and inhibits the wildtype, most common or first published allelic form. Exemplary sequences for human PTEN and mTOR(FRAP1) are assigned UniProtKB\/Swiss-Prot accession numbers P60484 and P42345. This is intended to be exemplary and not exhaustive of potential combination therapies involving the subject anti-HGF antibodies and fragments and another active agent.","The invention further contemplates a method of in vivo imaging which detects the presence of cells which express HGF comprising administering a diagnostically effective amount of at least one anti-human HGF antibody according to the invention, preferably of Ab1, Ab2, Ab7, Ab8, Ab9, Ab10, Ab12, Ab14, Ab19, Ab21, Ab23, Ab24, Ab25, or Ab28.
