{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/071,852 filed on May 21, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to pathology laboratory workflow and, more particularly, to systems for analyzing economic and performance-related workflow data and making workflow modifications in a pathology laboratory.","Advances in analytical science have made it possible to extract a wide variety of information from a biological specimen. For example, it may be possible to assess the health, identify possible future health issues, and provide information related to the genetic makeup of an individual from which the specimen was obtained.","Many of these biological specimens may be processed in laboratories. The laboratory may receive such specimens from institutions, including, for example, hospitals, clinics, and\/or the police, and also, to a lesser extent, from individuals themselves. These specimens may include, for example, tissue removed during a surgical procedure, tissue from crime scenes, and test materials from a home testing kit (e.g., an HIV test), among other things.","In a laboratory, many resources, including labor and consumable items, may be utilized to process, prepare, and test a specimen. Each specimen may also pass through many lab stations and may be handled by many operators, each working at his\/her own pace, resulting in difficulty determining costs and error rates associated with each station of the lab. For example, a laboratory may use an accessionist at an accessioning station to receive and prep the specimen (e.g., by labeling the specimen, listing the requested tests, etc.) before further analysis. After accessioning, a technician may carry a specimen to a grossing station to measure, cut, and record a description of the specimen. The specimen may then be manually altered by a histotech (e.g., by embedding, sectioning, staining, imaging, etc.) at subsequent stations where process and utilization data may be tracked. Then, a pathologist may review primary specimen output pieces (e.g., slides) for a diagnosis. Because pathology lab workflows vary greatly from lab to lab, obtaining an accurate accounting of the costs associated with a lab may be difficult, if not impossible, without analyzing each employee at each station over a period of time.","Some laboratories have utilized processes for tracking performance and economics by exclusively measuring use of consumables (e.g., knives, specimen stains, reagents, etc.). However, such processes fail to accurately assess variables such as employee labor cost, machine use, service, depreciation, and error rates.","According to some aspects of the invention, the present disclosure may provide a computer system for analyzing a specimen processing workflow in a pathology laboratory. The computer system may include a display and a processor. The processor may be configured to provide a first interface, a second interface, and a third interface to the display to receive, via the first interface, a first set of parameters associated with an existing specimen processing workflow in a pathology laboratory, the first set of parameters including a workflow process and a workflow scale, and determine, based on the first set of parameters, current performance data associated the existing specimen processing workflow having an associated current cost information and current time utilization. The processor may further be configured to receive, via the second interface, a second set of parameters associated with a proposed modification to the existing specimen processing workflow, the second set of parameters including parameters associated with at least one laboratory device, determine, based on the first and second sets of parameters, revised performance data having an associated revised cost information and revised time utilization, and provide an output comprising a comparison between revised performance data and current performance data.","According to another aspect of the invention, the present disclosure may provide a method for analyzing a workflow in a pathology laboratory. The method may include executing with a processor a software analysis tool configured to provide a first interface, a second interface, and a third interface, wherein the first and second interfaces each include at least one data entry form. The method may also include generating on a display the first interface, the second interface, and the third interface and providing, via the first interface, a set of parameters related to a workflow in a pathology laboratory, the first set of parameters including a workflow process and a workflow scale, and selecting, via the second interface, a proposed modification to the set of parameters, wherein the proposed modification reflects at least one laboratory device. The method may further include initiating an analysis of the workflow in the pathology laboratory based on the set of parameters and the proposed modification, and reviewing, within the third interface, a set of results generated by the analysis, wherein the set of results reflects an estimated effect of the proposed modifications.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, the present disclosure may provide an analysis tool for validating forecasted performance data of a pathology lab workflow. The analysis tool may include a display and a processor. The processor may be configured to retrieve data reflecting a machine time, a number of specimen output pieces, and timestamp information associated with a laboratory device in a pathology lab, determine, based on the retrieved data, actual performance data associated with the pathology lab, and provide an output representing the actual performance data associated with the pathology lab to the display.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, the present disclosure may provide a computer implemented method for optimizing a pathology lab workflow based on one or more user parameters. The method may include receiving one or more user parameters related to a desired outcome for a pathology lab, retrieving captured data related to a current pathology lab workflow, and executing with a processor a performance analysis tool to produce a criteria set based on the one or more user parameters and the captured data. The method may further include determining a revision to the current pathology lab workflow based on the criteria set, wherein the revised workflow reflects a laboratory device and achieves the desired outcome. The method may also include providing on a display an output related to the revision.","Reference will now be made in detail to the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The implementations set forth in the following description do not represent all implementations consistent with the claimed invention. Instead, they are merely some examples consistent with certain aspects related to the invention. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","Systems and methods consistent with the invention may determine performance data associated with one or more aspects of a pathology laboratory handling one or more specimens. As used herein, the term \u201cspecimen\u201d broadly refers to any material or piece of material obtained for the purpose of performing an operation in a laboratory. For example, the laboratory may receive a specimen removed from a living being and prepare the specimen for analysis, testing, and\/or storage. Exemplary types of specimens include tissue or other biologic samples taken from an animal or human. Further, as used herein, the term \u201cworkflow\u201d broadly refers to a path or order of operations that a specimen may follow in a laboratory and laboratory devices included for purposes of carrying out operations on a specimen. For example, the term workflow may reflect the order in which a series of laboratory stations may process the specimen and\/or a series of laboratory devices (e.g., microtomes, stainers, etc.) that may be included within the workflow. The term \u201claboratory device\u201d as used herein shall mean any tool or implement used in a pathology laboratory including, but not limited to, autostainer devices, microtomes, specimen identifying devices (e.g., bar code scanner\/reader), specimen marking devices (e.g., barcode printer), image scanning and sharing devices, image analysis devices, cover slipping devices, slide pretreatment devices, tissue processing devices (e.g., an autoprocessor), information display devices (e.g., computers) and any software associated therewith. The term \u201cworkflow information\u201d may broadly refer to any information and\/or data related to a specimen's workflow and\/or data received from one or more laboratory devices present in the workflow. The term \u201cperformance data,\u201d as used herein shall mean any data related to laboratory performance and performance metrics including, but not limited to, cost information, error information, time utilization information, and device utilization information, among others.","In one exemplary implementation, systems and methods consistent with the invention may provide computer-implemented interfaces and analysis tools for providing, analyzing, validating, and optimizing performance data associated with a pathology laboratory. For example, a performance analysis tool may be accessed from a virtual laboratory interface, which represents an actual or physical laboratory or laboratories for processing a specimen. Through the performance analysis tool, a user may provide data associated with a current laboratory workflow as well as one or more proposed revisions to that workflow (e.g., addition of a new staining device), and be provided a performance forecast based on the revisions. A performance analysis system may function as a Pathology Economic Modeling system, hereinafter PEM, that provides performance forecasts about the operational characteristics (e.g., economics) of a current or projected pathology workflow. As described in more detail below, exemplary embodiments further include tools for validating a previously forecast performance and optimizing an existing workflow to meet one or more desires of a user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":"100"},"As shown in , laboratory environment  may include a network , a receiving station , an accessioning station , a grossing station , a tissue processing and embedding station , a sectioning station , staining stations  (e.g., an H&E staining station , an IHC staining station , and a special staining station ), an imaging station , and an archiving station . Each of these stations may include one or more process specific laboratory devices. For example, a microtome may be present at sectioning station , microscopes and automated microscopes at imaging station , an automated tissue processor and a paraffin embedder at tissue processing and embedding station , and one or more stainers at staining stations . In addition, each station may include specimen identification devices such as, for example, a barcode reader, identification software, and a barcode\/label printer for providing identification services related to each specimen and\/or output piece (e.g., the specimen output piece may be a specimen bag or specimen jar at the accessioning station, a tissue cassette at the grossing station, a specimen slide at the sectioning station, etc.).","In addition to the stations associated with the laboratory, a management terminal , a workflow server , and a workflow database  also may be included. Management terminal , workflow server , and workflow database  may each be implemented on any computing device , such as, for example, a personal computer (PC), personal digital assistant (PDA), mainframe, mainframe terminal, or other computer-implemented device suitable for interfacing with a user. In one example, management terminal , workflow server , and workflow database  may all be implemented on a single computing device . Therefore, the following description of server  may apply to any other computing devices  associated with laboratory environment .","In one implementation (as seen in ), a computing device , such as workflow server , may include a central processing unit , as well as other components, such as, for example, a display , an input device  and a network controller (). Workflow server  may display information on a display or at other remote locations, such as, for example, a remote computing device  connected via a network.","In the following discussion, it is important to note that each of receiving station , accessioning station , grossing station , tissue processing station , sectioning station , staining stations , imaging station , and archiving station , and any other lab station present may include one or more computing devices  for purposes of interfacing with a user, (e.g., displaying information related to a specimen, receiving input from a bar code reader, and providing output to a bar code printer). The implementation of such computing devices  at stations in a lab may on an as-desired basis and may be determined by a user, lab manager, or any suitable decision maker.","Further, stations  to  and associated devices (e.g., automated microtome, auto stainer, etc.), workflow server , and management terminal , may each communicate with one another via network . By enabling communication among the many laboratory devices associated with the laboratory stations, data regarding a specimen as well as operation of the devices (e.g., hours in use, timestamp information, operator ID, materials consumed, etc.) may be provided to workflow server  for storage in workflow database  and desired processing (e.g., validation of previously forecast performance data). As used herein, the term \u201ctimestamp information\u201d shall mean any information related to date and\/or time and associated with a process and\/or specimen. For example, timestamp information may include a time into a station (e.g., 11:00 AM), a time out of a station (e.g., 11:30 AM), and a time in a machine (e.g., 30 minutes), among others.","Laboratory environment  may include more or fewer stations than those shown in the exemplary diagram of . For example, exemplary arrangements may use only accessioning station , tissue processing station , H&E staining station , and imaging station . In addition, the order in which the various stations are shown in , and described throughout the present disclosure, is not intended to be limiting. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that such stations may be organized in any desirable order without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Network  may enable communicative connections between devices within a physical laboratory and may be any suitable network enabling information transfer among electronic devices. For example, network  may include an Ethernet LAN, a wide-area network (WAN), and\/or the Internet, among other things. Each station or server associated with laboratory environment , and each device within a station, may include a communicative connection with network , and therefore may be communicatively connected to other laboratory devices present within a physical laboratory. This may allow each laboratory device to request and share data with workflow server , among other things.","Workflow database  may include relational database management software (e.g., MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySql, etc.), flat file storage, and\/or any suitable systems for enabling data persistence. For example, workflow server  may include software associated with a relational database management system, allowing persistent storage of workflow data associated with a current workflow in a pathology laboratory. Alternatively, such data may be persisted through storage methods implemented via spreadsheet software, word processing software, or any other suitable package enabling storage (e.g., basic file system i\/o commands).","Receiving station  and\/or accessioning station  may be configured to receive specimens from various sources, including, for example, hospital staff, couriers, and commercial shippers, among others. Receiving station  and\/or accessioning station  may include numerous laboratory devices configured for accomplishing tasks related to receiving and initial preparation of specimens. For example, stations may include a barcode scanner, a printer (e.g., configured for barcode and label printing), and\/or a computing device  configured to receive input from an operator and provide identification services, among others. The term True Positive ID, hereinafter TPID, refers to a True Positive Identification system that may track specimen input pieces and specimen output pieces through the pathology workflow. A TPID system may also display or automatically execute station-specific instructions at the stations.","As noted above, some or all of the devices of receiving station  and\/or accessioning station  may communicate with workflow server  via network . Stations  and\/or  may then provide specimen data (e.g., patient name, specimen weight, etc.) and operational data (e.g., timestamped time in\/time out information, operator id, etc.) to workflow server . Further, one or more of the laboratory devices associated with receiving station  and\/or accessioning station  may include automated features, and\/or may involve some manual interaction from an operator.","Because functionality associated with receiving station  and\/or accessioning station  may be similar, stations  and  may be combined as one station.

The term \u201csectioning\u201d is therefore not intended to be limiting. Sectioning station  may include one or more laboratory devices, for example, a microtome (i.e., a sectioning device), an oven or other heating device, a barcode reader, and a printer (e.g., a slide label printer), among other things. The laboratory devices associated with sectioning station  may communicate with workflow server  via network  or other suitable connection and provide specimen data and operational data (e.g., timestamp information, operator id, etc.), among other things. Further, one or more of the laboratory devices associated with sectioning station  may include automated features, and\/or may involve some manual interaction from an operator.","H&E staining station , ISH staining station , IHC staining station , and special staining station  may be configured for staining primary specimen output pieces (e.g., slides) in accordance with well known practices to those skilled in the art.

Such indication may be accomplished by applying various visual techniques to specimen indicator  and may allow a user to visualize a workflow. For example, in , a specimen is depicted as having arrived at sectioning station . Therefore, specimen indicator  is shown as a slide, representing that a specimen may be sectioned and placed onto a slide for imaging\/viewing at sectioning station . One of ordinary skill will recognize that such depictions or appearances are exemplary only and other appearances may be applied to specimen indicator  to demonstrate a specimen's state, among other things.","In some embodiments, upon selection of a virtual representation of a lab station (e.g., sectioning station ), a supplemental view of the selected laboratory station may be provided as shown in . This supplemental view may be a more detailed representation of a station, such as sectioning station . In , such a representation of sectioning station  is shown following, for example, a user mouse-clicking the virtual representation of sectioning station  within the virtual lab . Supplemental views may show one or more virtual representations of laboratory devices  present in the related physical laboratory (e.g., label printer, barcode reader, microtome, etc.). Further, the supplemental views may include one or more additional active components , a text component , and return component , among other things. While supplemental component views may be discussed in the context of \u201czoomed-in\u201d and \u201cdetailed,\u201d additional visual effects may be utilized for providing such components.","Return component  may allow a user selection indicating a return to a view level above the currently selected view. For example, where a user has selected an active component indicating a drilldown view of a virtual laboratory station from virtual laboratory , return component  may cause a return to a view of virtual laboratory  within the interface.","Additional active components  may include an arrow component and two numbered components (e.g., 1 and 2). Where a user desires to see a step-by-step of the workflow associated with the current laboratory station and obtain related information to each step, the user may select the arrow component as desired, and each process in the current laboratory station may be displayed within the interface and described in text component . Alternatively, if a user wishes to review an individual process associated with the currently selected virtual laboratory station, the user may click one of the available numbered components (e.g., 1 and\/or 2) to be taken directly to a data and description associated with the selected step.","Additionally, a user may access performance data associated with a particular station from the supplemental view. For example, where a user desires to review an average cost per slide at sectioning station , the user may access a performance reporting module from within the supplemental view (not shown). Note that the description related to sectioning station  is exemplary only, and such functionality may be provided for any station associated with a laboratory. For example, any of receiving station , grossing station , staining stations , imaging station , and archiving station , among others, may be accessed and workflow information retrieved. In addition, performance data associated with any of the stations may be analyzed and\/or workflow elements modified from within the interface. This may allow a forecasted performance for the station and\/or the lab as a whole to be provided and compared to existing performance data.","A user may access an analysis tool  configured to analyze a work flow and proposed modifications to a workflow via PEM selector .  shows a schematic representation of an exemplary relationship between workflow processes and an exemplary workflow upon which an exemplary analysis tool may be based. Workflow processes, as described above may include accessioning, grossing, sectioning, staining, sorting, imaging, and archiving. Process diagram  provides an exemplary representation of a collection of such workflow processes. In addition, administration and quality assurance may be carried out as a function of each of these workflow processes, and is therefore shown as such. One exemplary workflow configuration can be seen at workflow . Case record creation may occur during the accessioning process. Complex and small tissue sample examination may take place during the grossing process. A sectioning process may include tissue processing and embedding as well as tissue sectioning (cutting). Note that other workflows may separate or combine one or more of these processes into a single process and\/or lab station.","Workflow  highlights a workflow on which an analysis tool for a pathology laboratory may be based. It has been determined that in some embodiments, a work product of a pathology lab can be determined based on primary specimen output pieces (e.g., slides) from the staining stations . The term \u201cspecimen output piece,\u201d as used herein, shall include the deliverable of any particular lab station and\/or process. For example, a specimen output piece from grossing station  may be a specimen cassette, while a specimen output piece from tissue processing station  may be a tissue block (e.g., specimen from cassette cut and encased in paraffin). The term \u201cprimary specimen output piece,\u201d as used herein, shall mean the specimen output piece that may be considered the product goal of a particular laboratory. For example, in a pathology laboratory, staining stations  may produce stained specimen slides for subsequent review by a pathologist. Such specimen slides may be considered the primary specimen output pieces of the pathology lab. Each of pre-stain processes  and post-stain processes , although producing specimen output pieces of their own, operate for the purpose of preparing and\/or evaluating primary specimen output pieces of existing staining processes . Therefore, by allocating workflow costs associated with each of pre-stain processes  and post-stain processes  across a total number of primary specimen output pieces from staining stations  (e.g., slides), while allocating only those costs incurred for a particular primary specimen output piece in each of the staining processes  through which it passed, creation of a highly accurate model of a pathology lab workflow may be enabled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","155","155","305","360","355","320"]},"The following includes a brief overview of the modules described at , and is intended to be exemplary only.

For example, GUI module  may generate a graphical user interface (GUI) displaying a first interface presenting a data entry form allowing a user to configure a workflow associated with a physical laboratory. Upon receipt of workflow data, GUI module  may provide the user data to control module  for storage through database module , PEM interface module , or other suitable module. In addition, GUI module  may provide various charts, tables, and graphs generated by presentation generator module , charting module , or other suitable module, and related to output associated with current performance and\/or outlook data, among other things. Graphical input and output related to GUI module  will be discussed in greater detail below with regard to .","GUI module  may utilize numerous formats and programming languages for providing an interface. For example, in some embodiments, a graphics\/animation tool (e.g., iLOG JViews, Adobe Flash, etc.), HTML, spreadsheet tools, and\/or XML may be utilized for implementing a particular GUI through GUI module . One of skill in the art will recognize that various combinations may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Control module  may be configured to receive and interpret user inputs, manage data flow through analysis tool , and manipulate GUI module  to render graphical output, as desired. For example, GUI module  may provide user input to controller module  for provision to data module  and storage by database module  at workflow database . In another example, data resulting from calculations described below may be provided by PEM calculation module  to control module , whereby controller module  may provide such data to charting module , presentation generator module  and\/or GUI module  for providing output of the results in a desired format. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that controller module  may perform more or fewer operations, as desired.","PEM interface module  may be configured to enable interaction between functional modules of analysis tool  and for generating data related to an interface currently displayed via GUI module . For example, PEM interface  may include code for rendering a first, second, and third interface related to analysis tool  and providing input received via the first and second interfaces to analysis tool . In such an exemplary embodiment, PEM interface module  may provide a first interface having one or more data sections related to configuring an existing workflow associated with a pathology lab. These data sections may include one or more controls (e.g., textbox controls, button controls, dropdown controls, etc.) used for inputting data related to a current workflow. Therefore, PEM interface module  may generate a definition of the first interface for provision to control module  and GUI module . In addition, PEM interface module  may provide a second interface having one or more data sections enabling a user to provide a proposed modification to the existing workflow. Therefore, PEM interface module  may provide definition of controls related to entry of these modifications (e.g., textbox controls, button controls, etc.) to control module  for provision to GUI module  or other suitable module. Further, PEM interface module also may provide a third interface for viewing results of one or more calculations performed by analysis tool . For example, one or more charts, graphs, tables, etc. may be displayed showing data related to a performance position of a lab and\/or forecasted performance data of a lab, among other things. PEM interface module  may therefore include code for generating such displays for provision to control module  and GUI module . It is contemplated that PEM interface module  may also be configured to generate additional interfaces. The additional interfaces may provide, for example, other data associated with the laboratory, laboratory devices, laboratory workflow, etc.","PEM calculation module  may be configured to perform various calculations associated with generating result sets associated with current performance data, forecasted performance, performance validation, and workflow optimization. For example, PEM calculation module  may include computer code and data structures directed to determining a performance condition based on one or more parameters of a current workflow, determining a performance outlook based on one or more proposed workflow modifications, validating a previously forecast performance, and optimizing a workflow based on one or more user parameters, among others.

Calculations and determinations will be discussed in greater detail below with regard to .","Product definition module  may include functionality for providing, editing, and deleting a data representation of one or more laboratory devices that may be used for proposed workflow modifications, among other things. For example, numerous lab devices (e.g., autostainer devices, microtome devices, specimen identifying devices, specimen marking devices, image sharing devices, image analysis devices, cover slipping devices, slide pretreatment devices, tissue processing devices, etc.) may be stored in workflow database  with various parameters defining functionality and benefits associated with each device. Product definition module  may provide access to the various products allowing display of associated parameters, editing of such parameters, and\/or adding\/deleting of a laboratory device from the collection. In such an example, a user may wish to propose a modification to an existing workflow via a second interface provided by PEM interface module . Therefore, product definition module  may provide data associated with one or more laboratory devices available for adding to a configured workflow to PEM interface module  for providing to control module . Further, control module  may provide, through PEM interface module , modifications to various parameters that should be stored with a particular device provided by product definition module . One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that more or fewer functions may be provided by product definition module  without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","Data module  may be configured to parse requests related to data associated with the analysis tool . For example, data module  may receive a request from control module  and\/or PEM calculation module  to assemble a data set including parameters associated with a current workflow associated with a laboratory.

Therefore, analysis tool  may first determine an average number of batches processed per day through each staining station within staining stations  based on the currently modeled workflow (step ). Calculation of the average number of batches per stainer per day may be based on the workflow scale defined in workflow scale controls  and workflow devices defined in equipment cost controls  (e.g., stainers). For example, the average number of batches per day for IHC staining station  may calculated based on the number of primary specimen output pieces processed at H&E staining station  per year, the number of days the lab was in operation for the year, and the capacity of stainers available at IHC staining station . The number of batches per staining station per day can be approximated based on the known stainer capacity and the number of slides per staining station per day. For example, the number of slides processed per day at IHC staining station  may be 30 based on exemplary data in Table 1. Two stainers may be present at IHC staining station , each with a capacity of 28 slides. Therefore, because neither stainer is configured to run 30 slides, the average number of slide batches processed per day may equal 2.","Analysis tool  may then calculate an average batch size associated with each stainer (step ). A \u201cload factor\u201d may be utilized for determining the average batch size and average loading of each stainer. Calculations may be based on the capacity of each stainer within a staining station and the number of slides processed per day. For example, based on the data in Table 1, an average of 30 slides per day (7,200 slides\/240 lab days) may be processed by IHC staining station , which, for example, may include two or more stainers. As discussed, the exemplary stainers may each have a 28 slide capacity and therefore would process  slides each per day (i.e., to make 30 slides). Therefore, where both stainers are in operation, a load factor of approximately 53.5 percent may be assumed for each of the available stainers, resulting in an average batch size of 15 slides. In other words, each stainer can be assumed to run 1 batch at 53.5 percent of full capacity. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various average batch sizes and load factors may be utilized depending on a particular workflow configuration and operator habits, among others, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, different load factors may be assigned to each of one or more stainers assigned to a staining station to more closely approximate the actual use of a particular stainer.","Once batch information has been determined, analysis tool  may determine average weighted time and cost per primary and other specimen output pieces within the lab process (steps  and ). The weighted average costs may be determined for each of the lab stations individually, or, alternatively, one or more of the lab stations may be grouped together depending on the workflow configuration. Determinations may be made based on the information provided during workflow configuration, such as the workflow costs and process specification sections.","Returning to Table 1 for exemplary data, during process specification, a user may indicate that one full time equivalent of a histotech operates at tissue processing and embedding station , and spends 6.5 hours per day embedding specimens. A salary of $55,000\/year may also have been provided for the full time equivalent histotech during workflow configuration and labor cost controls . Therefore, the labor costs associated with the embedding process may be allocated by determining the fraction of the full time equivalent histotech's daily salary allocated to the 6.5 hours spent embedding. For example, where 6.5 hours associated with a full time equivalent histotech are allocated to embedding tissue  full time days per year, and at a full time equivalent salary of $55,000\/year, a daily labor cost of approximately $187 for embedding results. Therefore, a total daily average specimen output piece (e.g., slides) from staining stations  is based on the output pieces in table 1 above (i.e., 118,700) equals the yearly total divided by days in operation, or approximately 494 slides\/day. Dividing the $187 daily embedding cost by the number of daily slides yields a daily embedding cost per staining process output piece of 38 cents. Additionally, it may be desired to calculate the cost per tissue processing process output piece (e.g., blocks). Therefore, the number of yearly blocks (e.g., 79,000) divided by the number of lab days (e.g., 240) results in 329 blocks per day. Thus, an average daily labor cost per block at tissue processing and embedding station  is approximately equal to 57 cents. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that similar calculations and allocations may be made for any of the pre-staining and post-staining processes  and .","Additionally, consumable costs for consumables utilized (e.g., knives, formaldehyde, etc.) at pre- and post-stain lab stations  and  may be allocated to a staining station output piece based on similar calculations to those described with regard to labor determinations. Consumable costs for pre- and post-stain lab stations  and  may be determined and allocated on a station-by-station basis (i.e., only consumables used in a particular pre- or post-stain lab station are allocated to that lab station) and\/or may be determined and allocated on a laboratory basis (i.e., all consumables except for staining consumables rolled up and allocated across all staining output pieces). One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that each station may have its associated labor allocated in a similar fashion to that describe above.","Average cost per specimen output piece associated with staining processes  at staining stations , may be determined similarly to the methods described above; however, for purposes of providing a weighted average cost and time per primary specimen output piece, the costs (e.g., labor costs, consumable costs, machine costs, service costs, etc.) may be allocated only to those slides processed in a particular staining station . This may improve accuracy of a performance analysis and mitigate the need to track detailed activities at each station, because costs vary primarily depending on which staining process is applied to any given primary specimen output piece. For example, variations in cost per primary specimen output piece between H&E staining  and IHC staining station  can vary by 400 percent or more. However, in many pathology labs, the number of primary specimen output pieces processed via IHC staining station  is less than the number of slides processed by H&E staining station , thereby resulting in significant disparity if a straight average based on a number of primary output pieces were to be used. Therefore, for purposes of obtaining accurate cost information, proper allocation of costs is desirable.","As noted above, during configuration of a workflow, the number of primary specimen output pieces from each staining process within staining stations  (e.g., H&E staining station , ISH staining station , IHC staining station , and special staining station ) may be entered by a user via workflow scale controls . Based on the average batch size and number of batches calculated above for each of staining stations , actual costs for each of the staining stations (e.g., H&E staining station , ISH staining station , IHC staining station , and special staining station ) may be allocated only to those primary specimen output pieces that were processed through a particular staining station, thereby allowing an accurate determination of weighted total cost and time per specimen output piece.","For example, based on exemplary data in Table 1 above, the 101,000 primary specimen output pieces resulting from H&E staining station  may be allocated costs associated with H&E staining station  calculated in a similar manner to the methods described above. Likewise, 7,200 primary specimen output pieces may be allocated costs associated with ISH staining station , 10,000 primary specimen output pieces may be allocated costs associated with special staining station , and  primary specimen output pieces allocated costs from ISH staining station . A fully weighted total cost per primary specimen output piece for the entire lab may then be determined accordingly based on the pre- and post-stain costs and the costs allocated to the output pieces from each of staining stations .","Once time allocation and average weighted cost per primary specimen output piece has been calculated, it may be possible to calculate numerous other secondary values based on the weighted cost. For example, error costs may be calculated based on a percentage of failed specimen output pieces and error time calculated based on a number of failed output pieces and the time allocated to creation of such output pieces. Further, values may be broken down into their component parts based on the determined weighted cost per specimen output piece and machine times and service intervals may be determined, among other things. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that numerous values may be determined based on the average weighted cost determined by methods described herein, and may be used to represent value and performance data to a user.","The results of the determinations described above, as may then be stored, for example at workflow database  (step ).","It is important to note that the calculations described herein are exemplary and one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, based on this information, additional determinations may be made. For example, based on the calculations described above it may be possible to determine and provide instrument costs, overhead costs, error costs, error rates, labor costs, consumables costs, waste costs, and service costs, among other things, all on a per lab station, per lab device, per specimen output piece (i.e., from any station), per batch (for primary specimen output pieces), etc.","Returning to , once the current performance data for the current workflow has been calculated and stored, a user may wish to view output related to current performance of the pathology lab (step ).  provide exemplary representations of such output related to the performance data of a pathology lab based on a current workflow.

Edit modification dialog may enable a user to review parameters stored in workflow database  and provided via product definition module  associated with the available laboratory devices. For example, a user may modify labor time, machine time, and error rate, etc. It is important to note that often, a user will have empirically determined parameters related to one or more laboratory devices stored in workflow database . However, the ability to modify and\/or create a new device enables a user to compare potentially competing devices where, for example, only a white paper is available for the competing device.","Once a user has proposed modifications to a workflow, analysis tool  may execute a second analysis resulting in calculation of revised and forecasted performance data based on the workflow and proposed modifications (step ) and compare the forecasted performance data with the results related to the current performance data determined above (step ).  is a block diagram showing an exemplary method for determining revised performance data based on one or more modifications to an existing workflow, and providing output based on a comparison.

For example, each workflow station may be compared based on, for example, instrument costs, revised overhead costs, error costs, labor costs, consumables costs, waste costs, and service costs, among other things. Further, the results may be combined for the lab as a whole and\/or broken out into various categories for analysis as described below (e.g., costs per specimen output piece, costs per stainer, etc.).","Returning to , once a performance analysis has been run with the one or more proposed workflow modifications and the results compared, a user may review an output of the comparison in a third interface (step ).  show exemplary representations of a third interface  providing output of the results of a comparison between current performance data and revised performance data.

For example, in addition to viewing the comparison results from within analysis tool , analysis tool  may provide functionality through utility module  enabling a user to export the output to one or more formats, such as, for example, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Impress, etc., among other things.","In some embodiments, analysis tool  may provide functionality related to validation of previous performance forecasts based on automatically stored data.  is a block diagram showing an exemplary method for validating a forecasted workflow based on data obtained from laboratory equipment, for example, via TPID module . As described above, laboratory devices present in a current or revised workflow may be configured to provide information related to their operation to workflow server  or other suitable device for storage. Such information may include station timestamp information (e.g., a specimen arrival timestamp and a specimen departure timestamp), machine time (e.g., the amount of time a device took to execute a process), and a number of output pieces from the station, among other things. This data may be automatically captured by TPID module  and\/or workflow server  and stored in workflow database  and\/or other suitable location.","The stored information may be retrieved from workflow database  for purposes of validating previously forecasted performance data and\/or other purposes (step ). For example, data module  may retrieve data related to the operation of the one or more laboratory devices over a particular time period, for example, a previous month. In such an example, the retrieved data may include the number of cases during the month, the number of specimen output pieces from H&E staining station  during the month, the number of specimen output pieces from IHC staining station  during the month, the number of specimen output pieces from special staining station , the number of specimen output pieces from ISH staining station  during the month, and a number of blocks processed during the month. In addition, machine times for each of the laboratory devices, timestamps related to specimens, operator IDs related to operators, and various other data may be retrieved.","Based on the retrieved data, analysis tool  may calculate, via PEM calculation module , or other suitable module, the actual performance data of the pathology laboratory for the month for which data was retrieved (step ). The calculations may be similar to those discussed in relation to  above, resulting in data such as cost information including instrument costs, overhead costs, error costs, labor costs, consumables costs, waste costs, and service costs. Further, a success rate and error rate may also be calculated, among others. However, because data is actual stored data, averaging calculations may be used as actual labor times may be derived at each station by utilizing work hours associated with the lab, actual recorded machine times, and recorded timestamp data. For example, timestamp information may indicate that a specimen spent 3 hours in IHC staining station , with 2 hours of that time indicated by machine time. Therefore, a simple inference may be drawn that labor time within IHC staining was approximately 1 hour for set up and initiation of the IHC staining process. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that timestamp information may be compensated for work hours, for example, when a timestamp indicates a specimen arrived at a lab station 8:00 PM, and did not leave until 10:00 AM the following day, labor time may be compensated knowing that the lab closed at 8:30 PM the previous night and reopened at 7:00 AM. Further one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that more or fewer data may be stored and analyzed based on the complexity of analysis tool  desired.","Once actual performance data has been calculated based on the captured data, output may be provided related to the current actual performance data (step ). Presentation of the data may be provided similarly to the techniques described above with reference to step  and . One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that variations in labeling and presentation are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Following a review of the actual performance data of the lab based on the actual stored data from one or more laboratory devices, a user may wish to compare the actual performance data with a performance forecast previously made using analysis tool  as described above with reference to steps  and  and . In such a case, analysis tool  may retrieve the stored data related to the previously calculated performance forecast (step ). Retrieved data may include revised cost information including a revised instrument cost, a revised overhead cost, a revised error cost, a revised labor cost, a revised consumables cost, a revised waste cost, and a revised service cost. Further, such data may include a revised success rate, a revised labor time, and a revised device time, among others.","Once the forecasted performance data has been retrieved, the data may be compared with the actual data calculated at step  (step ). Such a comparison may be a direct comparison of like values between the actual values and the previously forecast values to determine a delta, if any, between the actual and forecast values. For example, an actual cost per specimen output piece (e.g., slide costs of $1.37) and an actual success rate (e.g., 99.92%) may be compared to a previously forecasted cost per specimen output piece and forecasted success rate, and deltas between the values determined. A predetermined margin value (e.g., 2 cents, 0.05%, etc.) may be stored with analysis tool for comparison with the deltas. If, for example, the delta between the actual cost per output piece and the forecasted cost per output piece is greater than the predetermined margin value, then the forecast may be considered not validated (step :no). Upon determining that the forecast has not been validated, analysis tool  may attempt to determine a source of the inconsistency (step ). For example, analysis tool  may iteratively examine data points associated with the one or more proposed modifications to a workflow to determine where, based on the actual data retrieved from workflow database , the previous forecast was off. Once the source of the inconsistency has been identified, analysis tool  may revise the identified parameter and may store the identified information for future modification to analysis tool , the workflow, and\/or parameters associated with the forecasted outlook. For example, if analysis tool  determines that a calculation error led to the inconsistency, analysis tool  may store the calculation error in workflow database  (step ). In addition, analysis tool  may be enabled to report the error via network , and\/or, for example, the internet. Analysis tool  may then repeat the comparison with corrected information to determine if future forecasts are more likely to be correct (return to step ).","Where the comparison indicates that the forecast and the actual performance data are validated (step :yes), output of the comparison may be displayed via GUI module  similarly to that described above with reference to  (step ). In such a case, the actual data may be substituted in place of the calculated current performance data of the pathology laboratory.","In some other embodiments, analysis tool  may enable optimization of a workflow based on current workflow data and one or more desires of a user (e.g., a lab manager).  is a block diagram showing an exemplary method for optimizing a laboratory workflow based on a user desired outcome (e.g., a specimen review schedule, a desired processing time, a desired specimen receipt time, a desired cost savings, a desired success rate, etc.). In such embodiments, actual data associated with a pathology lab may be retrieved, for example, from workflow server  and\/or workflow database  (step ). Such information may include station timestamp information (e.g., a specimen arrival timestamp and a specimen departure timestamp), machine time (e.g., the amount of time a device took to execute a process), and a number of output pieces from the station, among other things.","A user may then provide data related to a desired outcome in the pathology lab (step ). For example, a user may desire that specimens be ready for review upon arrival of the pathologist at 3:00 PM. Therefore, the user may input such information into analysis tool . Some other examples of user desired outcomes may include a desire that total processing time for a specimen be less than 8 hours, a desire for a specific cost savings throughout the lab of $10,000, and\/or a desired success rate of 99.97%. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that analysis tool  may be configured to receive any user desired outcome for purposes of attempting to meet that outcome.","After parameters related to a user outcome have been provided to analysis tool , analysis tool  may execute one or more performance analyses utilizing the actual data (step ). Once a first performance analysis has been performed, analysis tool  may determine whether the user's desired outcome has been met by the existing workflow (step ). For example, where a user desires an increased success rate of 99.97 percent, analysis tool  may determine that a current success rate of 99.8 percent is insufficient (step :no) and may then utilize logic to determine one or more proposed revisions to the current workflow to meet the user's desired outcome (step ). For example, based on data stored within analysis tool  (e.g., product parameters), analysis tool  may determine that a success rate can be increased through implementation of an automated microtome at sectioning station  within the current workflow. Analysis tool  may then modify the workflow and run another performance analysis to determine if a forecast success rate meets the user's desired increase in success rate (step ). If the automatically proposed modification to the workflow results in user's desired outcome being met (e.g., 99.97 percent success rate) (step :yes), then output related to the proposed modifications and the optimized workflow may be provided to the user (step ). If the user's desired outcome has not been met by the automatically proposed modifications to the workflow (step :no), then analysis tool  may iteratively propose additional modifications until the user's desired outcome is met, or it is determined that the outcome cannot be achieved.","Upon review of the output related to the proposed workflow modifications and optimized workflow, a user may determine whether the proposed changes are acceptable (step ). For example, if the addition of a microtome is proposed, but the user believes this proposal to be undesired (e.g., too expensive), the user may elect to run the optimization again (step :no). Otherwise, the user may print or otherwise export results (step :yes).","Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein.
