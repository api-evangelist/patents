{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/154,572, filed Feb. 23, 2009, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Certain portions of this invention were made under U.S. Department of the Air Force Contact No. FA8103-07-C-0008. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates in general to x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and analyzers. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved x-ray diffraction technique and analyzer for analyzing grain orientation in multiple grain materials, e.g., directionally solidified alloys used in turbine blades.","Directionally solidified (DS) nickel superalloys are commonly used in turbine blades for high temperature aircraft and space propulsion engines and land-based, high-efficiency power generating plants. Casting of these parts does not always result in perfect crystal grain orientation, which is critical for performance under high temperature conditions. Engine failures, including aircraft mishaps, have heightened the emphasis on efficient and direct measurement of grain orientation in turbine blades.","Conventional chemical etching, visual inspection, and\/or laboratory based x-ray analysis techniques based on Laue Diffraction are unsuitable and\/or cost prohibitive for quality control of an entire turbine blade. As one example, conventional X-ray Laue Diffraction (XRD) can be used to determine single crystal grain orientation. The conventional approach uses an X-ray area detector to collect an XRD Laue pattern produced by an X-ray beam incident on a sample, and determining the grain orientation by processing this collected Laue pattern. However, certain problems exist when using the Laue method to determine grain orientation for DS blades. DS blades may consist of several, single-crystal grains. Therefore, the diffraction pattern is usually generated from multiple grains and the images become complex and difficult to analyze.","What is required, therefore, are improved techniques for measurement of grain orientation of multiple grain samples.","The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and additional advantages are provided the present invention which in one aspect is an x-ray diffraction apparatus for measuring crystal orientation of a multiple grain sample. An x-ray excitation path is provided having a focusing optic for collecting x-rays from an x-ray source and redirecting the collected x-rays into an x-ray beam converging on a single grain of the multiple grain sample. A point detector and the sample are rotated relative to each other; and the grain orientation is obtained based upon diffraction patterns collected from first and second grain crystal planes within the apparatus.","A second point detector may also be provided, wherein the first point detector collects a diffraction pattern from the first crystal plane, and the second point detector collects a diffraction pattern from the second crystal plane.","The sample may be placed upon a rotation stage to facilitate collection of diffraction patterns from the first and second crystal planes by the first point detector, and\/or the detector(s) may be mounted on rotation stage(s), to facilitate collection of diffraction patterns from the first and second crystal planes by the detector(s).","In one embodiment, the focusing optic comprises a polycapillary optic, having an output focused beam spot size of about 300 \u03bcm or smaller, which can effectively excite a single grain of multiple grain turbine blade sample.","Further, additional features and advantages are realized through the techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention.","Disclosed herein is a compact, low-power, focusing beam x-ray diffraction technique, and associated analyzer, that can directly and nondestructively measure each individual grain orientation in a sample having multiple grains, in e.g., a DS turbine blade. The analyzer is especially suitable for use in factory production lines, or in the field. The technique is enabled by proprietary focusing x-ray optics, and a highly stable and reliable low power X-Beam system, coupled with a novel approach to determine grain orientation by diffraction beam directions from selected crystal planes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","50","10","20","22","50","50","30","40","50"]},"This exemplary analyzer includes, for example, a focusing optic for excitation and a point detector to rapidly determine grain orientation and, e.g., whether the grain orientation is acceptable or not. The focusing optic's output focused beam spot size can be, e.g., \u02dc300 \u03bcm or smaller, e.g., small enough to scan individual grains. The range of spot sizes contemplated by this invention is several mm to as small as 200 \u03bcm. Such optics include, for example, curved crystal monochromating optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,285,506; 6,317,483; and 7,035,374; and\/or multilayer optics; and\/or polycapillary optics such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,869; 5,175,755; 5,497,008; 5,745,547; 5,570,408; and 5,604,353. Optic\/source combinations such as those disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,110,506; 7,209,545; and 7,257,193 are also useable, which disclose lower cost, electron bombardment tubes coupled to an optic. Each of the above-noted patents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This new approach enables measurement of one single grain at a time on DS blades. Therefore, the problems that plague the Laue technique, when used for multiple grain samples, do not occur.","In accordance with the present invention, and with reference to the polyhedron schematic of an exemplary sample crystal structure in , if, for example, both (002) and (022) plane orientations are determined, then the grain growth orientation (100) can also be determined in accordance with the present invention. To effect these measurements, a sample is rotated so that each grain can be measured in a way to meet the Bragg diffraction condition. For example, the (002) plane and the (022) plane diffraction beam direction for the grain orientation determination can be measured. The angular alignment position for (002) plane and (022) plane diffraction, combined with the diffraction beam direction, comprise inputs for the grain orientation calculation.","In one exemplary system design, the point detectors are mounted at the 2\u03b8 angles of 81\u00b0 and 133\u00b0. These are the angular 2\u03b8 positions for (002) plane and (022) plane diffraction. A sample is mounted on a rotational scanning base for the diffraction peak search, and the data collected, for each individual grain.","Obtaining turbine grain orientation using one or more point detectors is discussed below, using a NaI point detector. This detector has large capture area, up to 2 inches in diameter, high sensitivity, high counting rate, low energy-resolution and low cost. Two diffraction spots for each of four blades were chosen and tested. -show typical diffraction peak search rotation scan (X) and peak vertical position scan (Y) intensity curves. Table 1 shows the calculated values for mis-oriented grains of four selected turbine blades. The spot is a location on the turbine blade near the physical transition from the exposed blade to the exposed platform surface. Blade  is shown in the photograph of -with a mis-oriented crystal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Mis-orientation calculations for Blades 1-4"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Mis-orientation"]},{"entry":["Blade","Spot","(degrees)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"112pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","1","9.5"]},{"entry":["1","2","3"]},{"entry":["2","1","5.1"]},{"entry":["2","2","1.8"]},{"entry":["3","1","##"]},{"entry":["3","2","3.3"]},{"entry":["4","1","16"]},{"entry":["4","2","4.1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 1 shows that blade , spot , and blade , spot  have the largest mis-orientation angles. This was also confirmed from a visual inspection, i.e., both turbine blade number  spot  and turbine blade number  spot  had visible signs of mis-orientation.","In practice, DS turbine blades can have complicated crystal structure and grain orientation distributions. These blades may not have a high crystal quality, the grain size is limited, and there may be a large mosaic spread. Taken together, these characteristics confirm what is described herein, that turbine blade diffraction patterns are not similar to silicon wafer diffraction spots. As an example, -compare diffraction spots obtained from a turbine blade (a) and a silicon wafer (b).","The XRD measurements disclosed herein can provide important crystal structure information about turbine blade samples. Two important conclusions were made. First, it was concluded that the DS blades have Ni based cubic FCC structure, instead of NiAl. Second, it was concluded that the diffraction spots may originate only from 002, 111 and 022 crystal planes, using Cr K x-ray excitation.","Simulation results can be compared to results obtained using the analyzer disclosed herein, to validate this technique of measuring grain mis-orientation in turbine blades. For example, -show two diffraction images: shows a diffraction pattern obtained using the XRD system disclosed herein; and shows a diffraction pattern obtained from simulation.","This simulation pattern was generated based on the following conditions:","1. Crystal plane was [0 \u22122 0]","2. Crystal angular position was \u03b1=40.6\u00b0","3. Crystal mosaicity was 2.5\u00b0","4. Crystal angular position was for \u03b1=40.6\u00b0, \u03b2=0\u00b0","5. Crystal grain size was 1 mm","6. Incident beam divergence was 3.7\u00b0","7. Incident beam was Cr K","8. Detector active area was 62 mm\u00d762 mm, with resolution 62\/512 mm","9. Detector distance from sample was 92 mm,","10. Detector angular position was 80\u00b0","11. Detector height offset was 5 mm.","The residual difference between the real experimental data and the simulation pattern arises from the poor crystal quality of the DS turbine blade grain and the irregular grain shape. However, because the primary objective is to determine the grain orientation, this simulation pattern can provide enough information for this purpose.","Further analysis using such simulations are possible, to validate the corresponding analyzer configurations, all of which fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, and with reference to , a detector may be rotated along a perpendicular axis through the sample measurement point. Its height can also be adjusted. It was assumed the incident focusing spot hit right on the turbine blade measurement position.","The system can be defined by orthogonal X, Y and Z axes, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 rotation axes, for angular alignment of the turbine blade crystal, as shown in . The initial angular position for the crystal is \u03b1=0, \u03b2=0.","A systematic simulation measurement validated XRD patterns for directionally solidified (DS) turbine blades according to the techniques disclosed herein. First, a series of simulation patterns can be generated with sample crystal angular misalignments. Both the diffraction intensity and the diffraction spot angular position changes according to the crystal misalignment. However, it is not a simple issue to directly use these changes to locate the crystal orientation. In this case, \u03b1 was directly correspondent to the incident \u03b8 angle, and \u03b2 was kept equal to 0, so the diffraction spot intensity and angular position would change to meet the Bragg conditions whenever the crystal angular position is changed. The \u03b1 angular offsets were 0, \u22122\u00b0, \u22123\u00b0, \u22124\u00b0, and \u22125\u00b0 for the following simulation patterns, and  shows these simulation images.","Another important analysis involves analyzing diffraction angular position changes with the \u03b2 angle, which can be used as an indicator of turbine blade grain mis-orientation. From geometrical analysis, it can be assumed that \u03b2 changes do not vary position on the detector for the 002 diffraction spot, however, it should have impact on both 022 and 111 diffraction spots. In , simulation images are shown for the 002 plane with different \u03b2 angles.","As can be seen from , there is no visible change in diffraction from the 002 diffraction plane by varying the \u03b2 angle.","In , simulation patterns are shown for the 022 plane with different angles. The diffraction spot for the 022 plane changes its height by increasing the angle offset.","A new data collection and processing procedure is also disclosed in accordance with the present invention. One significant aspect of this approach is that only \u03b1 angular scans are performed for the turbine blade sample diffraction alignment, as shown in . This is based on the analysis of a series of XRD diffraction patterns, which show that for most turbine blade samples, \u03b2 angular scans for searching diffraction spots can be avoided. Based on the analysis, a new procedure has been developed for the orientation measurements:\n\n","As shown above, 8 parameters are required for the orientation calculation.
