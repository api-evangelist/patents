No. 61\/070,588, filed Mar. 24, 2008 and entitled \u201cNANOPARTICLE-ENHANCED PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS (NEPCM) WITH GREAT POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVED THERMAL ENERGY STORAGE\u201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The present invention relates to the field of phase change materials. More specifically, the present invention relates to nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials.","Early work on thermal control and energy storage using phase change materials (PCM) is able to be directly linked to the fast-paced developments in aeronautics and electronics in the middle of the twentieth century that was followed by the Space Program. A NASA document entitled \u201cA Design Handbook for Phase Change Thermal Control and Energy Storage Devices\u201d and authored by Humphries and Griggs, NASA Technical Paper 1074, (1977) provides a good overview of the state-of-the-art at that time and is widely referenced in a number of papers on thermal storage and PCM. Humphries and Griggs (1977) discuss a number of earlier works on utilization of metallic \u201cfillers\u201d to enhance the thermal conductivity of PCM. Understandably so, stationary inserts were widely adopted. These filler materials included metallic wool, foam and honeycomb that were introduced into a variety of fusible materials. The stationary inserts are limited in their uses due to size, lack of flexibility and other reasons.","Improved functionality of phase change materials (PCM) through dispersion of nanoparticles is described. The resulting nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCM) exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity in comparison to the base material. Starting with steady state natural convection within a differentially-heated square cavity that contains a nanofluid (water plus copper nanoparticles), the nanofluid is allowed to undergo solidification. Partly due to increase of thermal conductivity and also lowering of the latent heat of fusion, higher heat release rate of the NEPCM in relation to the conventional PCM is observed. The predicted increase of the heat release rate of the NEPCM is a clear indicator of its great potential for diverse thermal energy storage applications.","In one aspect, a free-form composition for improving thermal energy storage comprises nanoparticles and a phase change material. The nanoparticles are selected from the group consisting of copper, aluminum, copper oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. The phase change material is selected from the group consisting of water, cyclohexane, dodecane and gel oil.","In another aspect, a system for improving thermal energy storage comprises a solution comprising nanoparticles and a phase change material and a storage mechanism for storing the solution. The nanoparticles are selected from the group consisting of copper, aluminum, copper oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. The phase change material is selected from the group consisting of water, cyclohexane, dodecane and gel oil. The solution is free-form. The storage mechanism is selected from the group consisting of a bead, a flat enclosure, a square enclosure and a tube enclosure. A material of the storage mechanism is selected from the group consisting of plastic, rubber, metal and glass.","In another aspect, a method of utilizing a nanoparticle-enhanced phase change material (NEPCM), the method comprises combining nanoparticles and a phase change material to form the NEPCM and inserting the NEPCM into an enclosure. The method further comprises inserting the enclosure into an object. The object is selected from the group consisting of construction material, clothing, automobile components, furniture, appliances, electronics and containers. The nanoparticles are selected from the group consisting of copper, aluminum, copper oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. The phase change material is selected from the group consisting of water, cyclohexane, dodecane and gel oil. The NEPCM is free-form. The enclosure is selected from the group consisting of a bead, a flat enclosure, a square enclosure and a tube enclosure. A material of the enclosure is selected from the group consisting of plastic, rubber, metal and glass.","In another aspect, a system including improved thermal energy storage comprises a solution comprising nanoparticles and a phase change material, a storage mechanism configured for storing the solution and an object containing the storage mechanism. The nanoparticles are selected from the group consisting of copper, aluminum, copper oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide. The phase change material is selected from the group consisting of water, cyclohexane, dodecane and gel oil. The solution is free-form.

A material of the storage mechanism is selected from the group consisting of plastic, rubber, metal and glass. The object is selected from the group consisting of construction material, clothing, automobile components, furniture, appliances and electronics and containers.","Utilization of naturally-occurring or fabricated nanoparticles (diameters less than 50 nm) is able to be used for new technological innovations in many fields. Although others have investigated using ultra-fine particles in liquids and nanofluids, the exploitation of the thermal properties of nanomaterials in preparation, tailoring and development of

The qualitative trends among the approaches are agreeable, whereas the present computations suggest a greater role for natural convection indicated by the uneven melting in the top half of the cavity compared to the bottom half.","The results of others were used to benchmark the present computations for the case of natural convection of nanofluids within a differentially-heated square cavity. The predicted horizontal velocity component on the vertical mid-plane of the square cavity with an 81\u00d781 grid system and that of Khanafer et al. are compared in  for Gr=10and 10. Regardless of the volume fraction of the nanoparticles, the well-established trends of the horizontal fluid velocity exhibiting accelerated flow near the horizontal walls and weak flow in the center of the cavity point to the observation that nanofluids behave more like a fluid as opposed to the flow of mm- or micron-size suspensions. The comparison for the cases of buoyancy-driven convection of a pure fluid (zero volume fraction) for the two Grashof numbers is excellent. According to Khanafer et al., the dimensionless velocity was related to the inverse of the temperature difference between the two active walls. Consequently, the dimensionless velocity for Gr=10is lower compared to the corresponding Gr=10case. For a fixed Grashof number, as the loading of the nanoparticles is increased, \u201cirregular and random\u201d (Khanafer et al.) motion of the nanoparticles promote greater momentum and energy transport throughout the cavity. Consequently, the extra thermal conductivity due to dispersion is enhanced.","Freezing of NEPCM","Improved functionality of nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCM) compared to the base fluid is crucial. Starting with steady natural convection within a water-copper nanofluid that is inside a differentially-heated square cavity, freezing of the NEPCM was investigated. The temperatures of the left and right walls were lowered by 10\u00b0 C. In effect, the cold right wall was held 10\u00b0 C. lower than the freezing temperature of the base fluid (273.15K). Consequently, the nanofluid will start freezing on the right wall and the solid travels to the left. The other boundary conditions remained unchanged. Three solid particle volume fractions of 0, 0.1 and 0.2 were considered for two initial Grashof numbers of 10and 10. The pertinent properties are given in Table 1, and the corresponding Stefan numbers for the three solid particle volume fractions of 0, 0.1 and 0.2 were 0.125, 0.136 and 0.150, respectively. Colorized contours of the volume fraction of the nanofluid, e.g. \u03bb (0 and 1 for solid and liquid phases, respectively) during freezing of the NEPCM at various time instants are shown in  for an initial Grashof number of 10. The time instants in  are 100, 500, 1000 and 1500 s. The color red is used to identify the liquid phase, whereas the color blue is indicative of the frozen solid phase. In general, the sharp liquid-solid interface is nearly vertical with a mild misalignment toward the colder wall early on, thus favoring a longer wetted length on the top insulated wall. This is able to be attributed to the buoyancy-driven convection in the cavity that was already at full strength at t=0 in the form of a clockwise (CW) rotating vortex which is generated next to the left wall (discussed below). Observations on the instantaneous volume of the frozen solid phase and the shape of the interface for the case of freezing of pure water (\u03c6=0) are in general agreement with findings of others. For this Grashof number (Gr=10), it is observed that as the solid particle volume fraction is raised, the NEPCM will freeze more rapidly. This is due to the enhanced thermal conductivity of the nanofluid and smaller value of the latent heat, to be further discussed below.","The instantaneous streamlines within the nanofluid for the initial 10 s during the freezing of NEPCM for an initial Gr=10, Ste=0.150 and a solid particle volume fraction of 0.2 are shown in . The streamlines at t=0 correspond to a similar case studied by Khanafer et al. and a clockwise (CW) rotating vortex is clearly observed. As a result of the sudden lowering of the temperatures of the two active walls at t=0, the CW rotating vortex diminishes in strength and spatial coverage due to formation of a counter-clockwise (CCW) rotating vortex next to the left wall. The generation of the dual-vortex flow pattern was examined in greater detail by lowering the time step to 0.1 s for this case. Note that the formation, growth and equilibration of the CCW vortex during the initial 10 s involves a dynamic interaction with the initially strong CW vortex. At the t=10 s instant, two vortices rotating in opposite directions and nearly equal in size are observed squeezed between the left wall and a thin frozen layer next to the right wall. For the remainder of the freezing process, the dual-vortex structure will persist however due to the leftward movement of the freezing front, the vortices will shrink in coverage space and their strength will decay. The actual Grashof number for this unsteady freezing problem decreases with time due to the continuous shrinking of the distance between the left wall and the liquid-solid interface.","The instantaneous dimensionless volume of the nanofluid within the square cavity, e.g.:\n\nLiquid Volume ()=\u222b\u222b\u03bb(),\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nis presented in  for all of the cases that were investigated. The liquid volume that continuously decreases from the start of the freezing exhibits little sensitivity to the value of the initial Grashof number except near the conclusion of the freezing process. On the other hand, the volume of the nanofluid is strongly dependent on the solid particle volume fraction of the dispersed nanoparticles. The freezing times for pure water and copper-water nanofluids for initial Grashof numbers 10and 10are summarized in Table 1. For a given initial Grashof number, as the solid particle volume fraction is raised the freezing time is lowered. This is due to the enhanced thermal conductivity of the nanofluid in comparison to that of the base liquid. At the same time, due to lowering of the latent heat of fusion, less energy per unit mass of the nanofluid is needed for freezing this specific NEPCM. The observed higher heat release rate of the NEPCM is a clear indicator of its great potential for thermal energy storage applications.\n","Given proper suspension of nanoparticles within conventional phase change materials such as water, it is shown that NEPCMs have great potential for demanding thermal energy storage applications. Specifically, the high heat release rate of the NEPCM in relation to the conventional PCM and its higher thermal conductivity point to its promise for greater utilization in diverse energy sectors.","In the following, results of an analytic\/integral formulation of a 1-D freezing problem of any PCM in a finite slab are illustrated.","Thermophysical Property of Composites","The properties of the resulting PCM\/nanoparticle composites in both liquid and solid phase depend on the properties of the constituents.

The Stefan numbers for water-based composites ranged between 0.12 and 0.14, where for cyclohexane-based composites, the range was between 1.11 and 1.44. The subcooling numbers for the water and cyclohexane composites were 0.425 and 0.494, respectively. These corresponded to an initial temperature of 300 K, while keeping the cold side of the slab 20 degrees centigrade below the melting temperature of the PCM. In the following, the effects of the thermal conductivity ratio of the liquid to solid phases and thermal diffusivity ratio of the liquid to solid phases on the freezing times of the composites are presented.","Effect of the Thermal Conductivity Ratio","The dimensionless freezing times of PCM\/nanoparticle composites as a function of the thermal conductivity ratio of the liquid to solid phases for water and cyclohexane as the base PCM are presented in , respectively. An open symbol is used for the case of a particle-free PCM, whereas solid symbols are used for volume fractions of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1. For a given filler material (alumina, copper, copper oxide and titanium oxide), dashed lines are drawn through the appropriate computed quantities to identify the specific PCM\/nanoparticle composite. Regardless of the base PCM (water or cyclohexane) and for a fixed volume fraction, the smallest and greatest variations of the thermal conductivity ratio are realized by the high (copper) and low (titanium oxide) thermal conductivity suspensions, respectively. As the volume fraction of a filler material that is suspended in a base PCM is raised, the thermal conductivity ratio of the liquid to solid increases. The most interesting finding is that for a given base PCM (water in  and cyclohexane in ) and constant value of the volume fraction, the dimensionless freezing time is nearly constant and independent of the nature of the suspended material. The average values of the dimensionless freezing times for a given value of the volume fraction of the particles suspended in water and cyclohexane are summarized in Table 3. In addition, percentage of change in freezing time in comparison to the case of a particle-free PCM is provided. It is shown that regardless of the type of suspended particles, 10% by particle volume composites of water and cyclohexane will exhibit expedited freezing times by 11.36 and 6.5 percent, respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Base PCM","\u03c6 = 0","\u03c6 = 0.01","\u03c6 = 0.02","\u03c6 = 0.05","\u03c6 = 0.1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Water","6.9619","6.8859","6.8083","6.5706","6.1711"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(1.092%)","(2.206%)","(5.620%)","(11.359%)"]},{"entry":["Cyclohexane","1.6107","1.5975","1.5849","1.5507","1.4995"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(0.821%)","(1.600%)","(3.728%)","(6.907%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The dimensionless freezing times of PCM\/nanoparticle composites as a function of the thermal diffusivity ratio of the liquid to solid phases for water and cyclohexane as the base PCM are presented in , respectively. In both figures, symbols similar to those in  are used to identify the volume fraction of the suspended particles, whereas dashed lines are drawn to identify the specific PCM\/nanoparticle composite. With water as the base PCM (), the observed trends for the variation of the dimensionless freezing time in relation to the thermal diffusivity ratio are analogous to what was discussed earlier in relation to effect of the thermal conductivity ratio. However, for cyclohexane composites the increasing trends of the thermal diffusivity ratio with greater loading of the particles is reversed. This is attributed to the opposite trends of both density and constant pressure specific heat when the PCM transforms from the liquid state to the solid phase. For water, both its density and specific pressure decrease upon freezing, whereas for cyclohexane these properties increase upon phase change. It is also noted that various curves for different types of suspended particles collapse onto each other. Regardless of the opposite trends exhibited by cyclohexane, expedited freezing that is afforded to the suspension of particles and its direct relation to the volume fraction of the particles are maintained.","Expedited Energy Discharge","Time histories of energy discharge from the thermal storage system that was studied are given in . The fraction of the liquid composite as a function of the elapsed time is plotted as a function of the volume fraction of the suspended alumina particle in water. The expedited nature of the energy discharge exhibited by this representative NEPCM system points to its potential as a superior thermal energy storage system.","Conclusions","Based on results on an analytic\/integral formulation of a 1-D freezing problem of water and cyclohexane\/nanoparticle composites systems in a finite slab, the following conclusions are drawn. As the volume fraction of the suspended nanoparticles is raised, the thermal conductivity ratio of the liquid to solid for the composites increases. Water and cyclohexane exhibited opposite trends for dependence of the thermal diffusivity ratio of the liquid to solid in relation to introduction of more suspended particles. This is linked to the opposite trends of both density and specific heat when the PCM undergoes phase transition. For a given base PCM and constant value of the volume fraction, the dimensionless freezing time is nearly constant and independent of the suspended material. Introduction of suspended particles in water and cyclohexane gave rise to expedited freezing times as high as 11.36 percent.","Dodecane and Gel Oil","A dodecane nanofluid was prepared and it contains 1% wt CuO nanoparticles. A gel oil was prepared by the same way as that of the dodecane nanofluid. The weight percentage of CuO nanoparticles was also 1% wt. Both experienced 30 cycles of melting and freezing.","The freezing process was conducted in a home refrigerator. The freezing time was 1 hour, and it was the same for the two samples.","It has been observed that as the number of the freezing and melting cycle's increases there was an increase in the rate of the sedimentation for the dodecane nanofluid. As for the gel oil, it at least visually seems to be stable. Thus, the same procedure is able to be implemented to produce NEPCMS.","Applications","Metal nanoparticles such as copper, aluminum, copper oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide and others are able to be added to a phase change material such as water or cyclohexane to form nanoparticle-enhanced phase change materials (NEPCM). In some embodiments, non-metal nanoparticles are used. The nanoparticles and phase change material form a stable suspension. Further, the NEPCM is able to be used in many cycles such as frozen, thawed, frozen, thawed and repeated. As described above, the NEPCM has a higher thermal conductivity than the PCM itself since the particles enhance the exchange of heat. Other chemicals are able to be added to further enhance a feature or provide an added feature.","The NEPCM is able to remain a free-form such that it is able to be shaped in any form or acquire the shape of its container. This is in contrast to solid slabs which are unable to be shaped. In some embodiments, the NEPCM is able to be frozen and shaped such as by freezing it in a mold. In some embodiments, the NEPCM is placed in an enclosure such as a plastic bead, a thin sheet enclosure or other types of enclosures.","An application includes the NEPCM enclosed within very thin sheets of a material such as plastic to be able to place the NEPCM on\/within a dashboard of a vehicle or on\/within the seat to provide thermal comfort. For example, within the dashboard, the NEPCM is able to provide insulation to keep the vehicle cooler when the ambient temperature outside is hot and warmer in when the ambient temperature outside is cold.","Another application includes packaging the NEPCM in an encapsulated form such as small plastic balls (e.g. 2-3 mm or 2-3 \u03bcm). The plastic balls are able to be added to building materials such as sheet rock or walls, floor tiles, ceiling tiles, roof tiles or any other material.","Another application includes textile, by incorporating the NEPCM in textiles such as in clothing. For example, the NEPCM is able to be contained in footwear, handwear, jackets, headwear, blankets or other similar items. The NEPCM will help keep a user warmer in colder weather by retaining more heat and keeping cold out. Similarly, the NEPCM is able to be used in hot weather by retaining a cool temperature and keeping heat out.","Yet another application is related to batteries and other vehicle component thermal management.","Appliances such as refrigerators are able to contain a form of the NEPCM inside the insulation. Cellular phones, computers and other electronic devices are also able to contain a form of the NEPCM to help regulate heat.","The NEPCM is also able to be used as a cover for cans and bottles such as a cover for soda cans to keep the soda cold on a hot day.
