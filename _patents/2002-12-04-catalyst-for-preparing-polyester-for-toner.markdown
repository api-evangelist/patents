Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a catalyst for preparing a polyester for a toner which is used for developing electrostatic latent images formed in electrophotography, electrostatic recording method, electrostatic printing method, and the like, a polyester resin composition comprising the catalyst, and a toner comprising the polyester resin composition.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Recently, improvement in the initial rise in triboelectric charges of the toner has been mainly desired from the viewpoint of speeding up the copy machines in a two-component toner, and from the viewpoint of miniaturization of the copy machines in a nonmagnetic monocomponent toner. Therefore, improvements in various charge control agents have been studied. For instance, organotin(IV) compounds have been numerously reported in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Sho 63-101856, Sho 61-272758, Sho 62-287260 and the like. However, satisfactory initial rise in the triboelectric charges cannot be obtained with these organotin compounds, and generation of background fogging is observed. Therefore, further improvements have been desired.","On the other hand, as a catalyst in the preparation of the polyester used as a resin binder for a toner, there has been used an organotin(IV) compound such as dibutyltin oxide, a titanium compound such as tetra-n-butyl titanate, a germanium compound such as germanium oxide, a manganese compound such as manganese oxide, or the like. However, the influences of these catalysts on the chargeability of the toner have not been satisfactorily studied.","An object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst for preparing a polyester for a toner which has excellent initial rise in triboelectric charges and is less likely to cause background fogging, a polyester resin composition comprising the catalyst, and a toner comprising the polyester resin composition.","These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.","The present inventors have considered that the catalyst used during the preparation of the polyester for a toner influences on the initial rise in the triboelectric charges of the polyester, and have pursued the hypothesis. The present invention has been achieved thereby.","According to the present invention, there is provided:\n\n","The feature of the present invention resides in a completely novel finding that an inorganic tin(II) compound having a function as a catalyst for preparing a polyester is very effective for improving initial rise in the triboelectric charges required for a polyester for a toner. In the present invention, the term \u201cinorganic tin compound\u201d refers to a tin compound which does not have an Sn\u2014C bond.","Although the mechanism for exhibiting such outstanding effects by the inorganic tin(II) compound is yet well unknown, it is deduced that the bias of the electron density between Sn atom and O atom, a halogen atom, or the like owned by the inorganic tin(II) compound greatly influences the mechanism, and that uniform dispersion of the inorganic tin(II) compound due to the improvement in compatibility with the polyester brings about further improvement in the initial rise in the triboelectric charges.","The inorganic tin(II) compound is preferably a compound having an Sn\u2014O bond, and a compound having an Sn\u2014X bond, wherein X is a halogen atom, and the compound having an Sn\u2014O bond is more preferable.","The compound having an Sn\u2014O bond includes tin(II) carboxylates of which carboxylic acid radical has 2 to 28 carbon atoms, such as tin(II) oxalate, tin(II) diacetate, tin(II) dioctanoate, tin(II) dilaurate, tin(II) distearate and tin(II) dioleate; a dialkoxytin(II) of which alkoxy group has 2 to 28 carbon atoms, such as dioctyloxytin(II), dilauroxytin(II), distearoxytin(II) and dioleyloxytin(II); tin(II) oxide; tin(II) sulfate; and the like. The compound having an Sn\u2014X bond, wherein X is a halogen atom, includes tin(II) halides such as tin(II) chloride and tin(II) bromide, and the like. Among them, from the viewpoints of the initial rise in the triboelectric charges and the catalytic ability, a preference is given to a tin(II) compound of a fatty acid, represented by the formula (RCOO)Sn, wherein Ris an alkyl group or alkenyl group having 5 to 19 carbon atoms, a dialkoxytin(II) represented by the formula (RO)Sn, wherein Ris an alkyl group or alkenyl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, and tin(II) oxide represented by SnO and the tin(II) compound of a fatty acid, represented by the formula (RCOO)Sn, and tin(II) oxide are more preferable, and tin(II) dioctanoate, tin(II) distearate and tin(II) oxide are especially preferable.","The catalyst for preparing a polyester of the present invention may properly used together with a conventionally known organotin compound, such as dibutyltin oxide, or the like within the range so that the effects of the present invention would not be inhibited.","The polyester resin composition comprising the catalyst for preparing a polyester of the present invention and the polyester can be used as a resin binder for a toner, and the polyester is prepared in the presence of the catalyst.","In the preparation of the polyester, an alcohol component comprising a dihydric or higher polyhydric alcohol and a carboxylic acid component comprising a dicarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid compound are used mainly as raw material monomers. Also, a monohydric alcohol and a monocarboxylic acid compound can be contained in small amounts from the viewpoints of molecular weight adjustments and improvement in offset resistance.","The dihydric alcohol includes an alkylene(2 to 4 carbon atoms) oxide(average number of moles: 1.5 to 6) adduct of bisphenol A such as polyoxypropylene(2.2)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and polyoxyethylene(2.2)-2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and the like.","The trihydric or higher polyhydric alcohol includes, for instance, sorbitol, pentaerythritol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, and the like.","The dicarboxylic acid compound includes aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and isophthalic acid; aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as sebacic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, dodecenylsuccinic acid and dodecylsuccinic acid; alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid; derivatives such as acid anhydrides thereof, Calkyl esters of these acids, and the like.","The tricarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic acid compound includes, for instance, aromatic carboxylic acids such as 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic acid (trimellitic acid), 2,5,7-naphthalenetricarboxylic acid, pyromellitic acid, derivatives such as acid anhydrides thereof, lower Calkyl esters of these acids, and the like.","In the present invention, among the raw material monomers mentioned above, a dihydric or higher polyhydric, secondary alcohol and\/or a dicarboxylic or higher polycarboxylic aromatic carboxylic acid compound is preferable.

It is preferable to use either one of the secondary alcohol and the aromatic carboxylic acid compound, and it is more preferable to use both the secondary alcohol and the aromatic carboxylic acid compound. In the present invention, the term \u201cthe dihydric or higher polyhydric, secondary alcohol\u201d refers to a dihydric or higher polyhydric alcohol in which at least one hydroxyl group is bonded to a secondary carbon.","Especially when the propylene oxide adduct of bisphenol A is used together with terephthalic acid, it is preferable because the electric charges can stably exist due to the resonance effects of the benzene rings contained in both the compounds. However, the effects by combined use of both the compounds can be exhibited by mixing two kinds of resins obtained by using either of the compounds as the raw materials.","The polyester can be prepared by the polycondensation of the alcohol component with the carboxylic acid component at a temperature of from 180\u00b0 to 250\u00b0 C. in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of the catalyst of the present invention, under a reduced pressure as occasion demands.","The amount of the inorganic tin(II) compound used during the preparation of the polyester is preferably from 0.001 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.05 to 2 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the raw material monomers of the polyester.
