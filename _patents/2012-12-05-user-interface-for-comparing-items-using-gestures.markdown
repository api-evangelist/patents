title: User interface for comparing items using gestures
abstract: In an example embodiment, a method of presenting marketplace listings is provided. Search parameters are received from a user interface on an electronic device. A search on marketplace listings is then performed using the search parameters, returning marketplace results. The marketplace results are then organized into a plurality of web pages, each web page corresponding to a different marketplace result, with each page organized so that a row on any one of the web pages corresponds to the same type of product attribute as that row on any of the other of the plurality of web pages. Then one of the plurality of web pages is displayed on the electronic device. When a swipe left or swipe right gesture is received, another of the plurality of web pages is displayed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to data processing techniques. More specifically, the present disclosure describes a technique for presenting two (or more) search results for product listings in a manner that facilitates a simple, and meaningful, comparison of the product listings using gestures.","The Internet and the World Wide Web have given rise to a wide variety of on-line retailers that operate virtual stores from which consumers can purchase products (i.e., merchandise or goods) as well as services. Although the popularity of these on-line retail sites is clearly evidenced by their increasing sales, for a variety of reasons, some consumers still would rather purchase products and services in a more conventional manner\u2014i.e., via a brick-and-mortar store. Even when purchasing products and services from a brick-and-mortar store, various web-based applications and tools may be used to perform preliminary research about products and services.","The present disclosure describes data processing techniques presenting two or more marketplace listings, selected from a set of search results, such that comparison of the listings is simple and intuitive. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present embodiments may be practiced without all of the specific details.","Consistent with some embodiments of the invention, a network-based publication system processes a search query and returns a set of search results, e.g., in the form of a search results page or similar user interface, where each result is a marketplace listing for an item, good, product or service being offered for sale. Upon detecting selection of two or more listings and invocation of a comparison request, the two or more selected listings are presented in a comparison user interface (UI) such that the various attributes of each item\/product\/service are presented arranged vertically, and the individual search results are positioned next to one another horizontally. With some embodiments, the presentation of the comparison UI is on a mobile device with a touch-sensitive display having limited size. As such, the UI is presented in such a way that the user can navigate between the two listings by performing a simple gesture to flick or drag the listings to the left or right revealing the other listing. For instance, if a first listing is being presented, the user may simply \u201cdrag\u201d or \u201cpush\u201d (with a gesture) that listing to the left (or right) to reveal the second listing. Because the listings are presented with the attributes arranged horizontally, comparison on a feature-by-feature (or attribute-by-attribute) basis is easy.","With some embodiments, various costs for owning a product that are not readily apparent may be displayed. For example, with some embodiments, the cost of returning the product, the cost of maintaining the product, and\/or the cost of disposing of the product may be displayed. Similarly, these costs may be aggregated for each individual listing and then presented as a total cost of ownership for the product.","With some embodiments, a user can select to view all attributes or features of two or more products that are the same. Accordingly, only those attributes that are the same will be presented. Similarly, the user may select to view only those attributes that are different between the two listings.","Other benefits of the embodiments of the present invention will be readily apparent from the description of the figures that follows.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","110","120","115","105","120","115"]},"In an example, the merchant  can operate computer systems, such as an inventory system  or a POS system . The network-based publication system  can interact with any of the systems used by merchant  for operation of the merchant's retail or service business. In an example, the network-based publication system  can work with both POS system  and inventory system  to obtain access to inventory available at individual retail locations run by the merchant. This inventory information can be used in both generating product or service listings, and selecting and ordering search results served by the network-based publication system .","Example Mobile Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["115","115","210","210","220","210","220","230","240","210","250","260","210","270","290","270","290","115","105","280","290"]},"Example Platform Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","300","302","304","310","312","306","308","310","312","310","312","115"]},"An Application Programming Interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more publication modules  (in certain examples, these can also include search engine modules, commerce modules, advertising modules, and marketplace modules, to name a few), payment modules , and dynamic offer modules . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases . In some examples, the application server  can access the databases  directly without the need for a database server .","The publication modules  may provide a number of publication and search functions and services to users that access the networked system . The payment modules  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment modules  may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints\u201d) in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are advertised or made available via the various publication modules , within retail locations, or within external online retail venues. The payment modules  may also be configured to present or facilitate a redemption of offers, generated by the dynamic offer modules , to a user during checkout (or prior to checkout, while the user is still actively shopping). The offer modules  may provide dynamic context sensitive offers (e.g., coupons or immediate discount deals on targeted products or services) to users of the networked system . The offer modules  can be configured to use all of the various communication mechanisms provided by the networked system  to present offer options to users. The offer options can be personalized based on current location, time of day, user profile data, past purchase history, or recent physical or online behaviors recorded by the network-based system , among other things (e.g., context information). While the publication modules , payment modules , and offer modules  are shown in  to all form part of the networked system , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the payment modules  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system . Additionally, in some examples, the offer modules  may be part of the payment service or may form an offer generation service separate and distinct from the networked system .","Further, while the system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, the embodiments of the present invention are of course not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various publication modules , payment modules , and offer modules  could also be implemented as standalone systems or software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The web client  accesses the various publication modules , payment modules , and offer modules  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the publication modules , payment modules , and offer modules  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a smartphone application that enables users to communicate search queries to the system  while leveraging user profile data and current location information provided by the smartphone or accessed over the network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["328","340","302","314","328","302","302","332","314","320","322","332"]},"Example User Interfaces","Various example user interfaces will now be described illustrating various example embodiments. Some of these example embodiments are depicted as user interfaces running on a desktop or laptop computing device, such as a desktop or laptop computer. Other example embodiments are depicted as user interfaces running on mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablet computers.

While users are typically presented information on the distance of items to their location, many users will be interested in more specific factors that are influenced by distance, but not necessarily by distance itself. For example, a user may not care that an item is 60 miles away, but rather may be more interested in how long it will take to drive (or walk, or take public transit) to travel to purchase the item. This is because many users are concerned with the amount of time it takes to purchase items locally versus online. Alternatively, a user who has plenty of time may not care as much about time or distance as such, but may be more interested in the fuel cost of traveling to purchase the item. As such, the slider  may present results that fall within the scope of a factor other than distance, but that distance affects, such as travel time or fuel costs. Here, time is depicted. If the user slides the slider  to the right, the number of minutes will increase, and potentially more marketplace results  will be displayed for local listings . Alternatively, if the user slides the slider  to the left, the number of minutes will decrease, and potentially fewer marketplace results  will be displayed for the local listings .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","502","504","506","502","506","506","506","506","504","506"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["600","702","602"]},"Pinning two or more results allows for a comparison view to provide a better understanding of true pricing and tradeoffs.
