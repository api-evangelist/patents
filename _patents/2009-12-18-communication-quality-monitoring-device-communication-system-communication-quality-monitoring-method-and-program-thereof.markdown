The problem could occur not only in communication using a packet but also in communication using data such as a cell or a frame.","The reason is that they are the determination methods premised on that communication quality deterioration is caused by generation of a packet loss. Even when no packet loss occurs, communication quality might be deteriorated due to a narrow link bandwidth with respect to a data input rate or due to a decrease in a speed-up rate in a session congestion control system under a large delay circumstance.","An object of the present invention is to provide a communication quality monitoring device, a communication quality monitoring method and a program thereof which enable deterioration in communication quality in a session layer to be determined irrespectively of occurrence of a data loss.","According to a first exemplary aspect of the invention, a communication quality monitoring device which detects deterioration in communication quality based on a buffer length of a session control protocol, includes a threshold value calculating unit which calculates a threshold value for the determination of deterioration in communication quality according to a parameter related to congestion detection of the session control protocol, and a deterioration determining unit which determines deterioration in communication quality by comparing the threshold value and the buffer length.","According to a second exemplary aspect of the invention, a communication system including a communication device which executes communication by a session control protocol and a communication quality monitoring device which is connected to the communication device through a communication network to detect deterioration in communication quality based on a buffer length of the session control protocol, wherein the communication quality monitoring device includes a threshold value calculating unit which calculates a threshold value for the determination of deterioration in communication quality according to a parameter related to congestion detection of the session control protocol, and a deterioration determining unit which determines deterioration in communication quality by comparing the threshold value and the buffer length.","According to a third exemplary aspect of the invention, a communication quality monitoring method of detecting deterioration in communication quality based on a buffer length of a session control protocol, includes a threshold value calculating step of calculating a threshold value for the determination of deterioration in communication quality according to a parameter related to congestion detection of the session control protocol, and a deterioration determining step of determining deterioration in communication quality by comparing the threshold value and the buffer length.","According to a fourth exemplary aspect of the invention, a communication quality monitoring program to be executed on a computer device which detects deterioration in communication quality based on a buffer length of a session control protocol, which causes the computer device to execute a threshold value calculating processing of calculating a threshold value for the determination of deterioration in communication quality according to a parameter related to congestion detection of the session control protocol, and a deterioration determining processing of determining deterioration in communication quality by comparing the threshold value and the buffer length.","The present invention enables communication quality deterioration to be determined irrespectively of generation of a data loss by calculating a threshold value of a buffer length for the determination of deterioration according to a congestion state.","Next, modes of implementation of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"With reference to , a packet transmission and quality deterioration monitoring device - as a communication device is connected to a packet reception device - through a communication network -.

The session control includes congestion control.","The packet transmission unit - is a part having a function of transmitting a generated packet to the packet reception device -.","The buffer state monitoring unit - is a part having a function of monitoring a buffer length of the buffer unit -.","The session state monitoring unit - is a part having a function of monitoring a session control parameter. Here, the session control parameter includes a parameter related to congestion detection and a parameter related to speed control. Parameter related to congestion detection represents the number of retransmissions or the number of packet loss detections or a packet loss rate. Parameter related to speed control represents a communication rate, or a window and a reciprocation delay time. Window indicates the volume of transfer per one reciprocation delay time. Communication rate can be obtained by dividing a window by a reciprocation delay time.","The state storage unit - is a part having a function of storing a buffer length monitored by the buffer state monitoring unit - and a session control parameter monitored by the session state monitoring unit -.","The threshold value calculating unit - is a part having a function of determining existence\/non-existence of a congestion state based on a session control parameter older than an arbitrary time point t stored in the state storage unit - and obtaining a threshold value of a buffer length for use in determining deterioration of communication quality by the deterioration determining unit - based on existence\/non-existence of the congestion state. Arbitrary time point t here is desirably a latest time point stored in the state storage unit -.","The deterioration determining unit - is a part having a function of comparing a buffer length at an arbitrary time point t stored in the state storage unit - with a threshold value obtained by the threshold value calculating unit - to determine deterioration of communication quality. The deterioration determining unit - determines that quality is deteriorated when a buffer length is not less than a threshold value or overs the threshold value. As a buffer length to be compared, an average value of buffer lengths in proximity to the time point t may be used among buffer lengths stored in the state storage unit -.","Structure of the threshold value calculating unit - will be described with reference to .","With reference to , the threshold value calculating unit - includes a congestion state determination processing unit --, a congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- and a non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit --.","The congestion state determination processing unit -- executes processing of determining whether it is in a congestion state or not based on a parameter whose number is increased along congestion detection which is stored in the state storage unit -. Determination of a congestion state is made based on whether the number of session control parameters is increased in an arbitrary time period from t-d to t stored in the state storage unit -.","Session control protocol, whose control is dependent on a packet reciprocation delay time, uses an arbitrary value larger enough than a packet reciprocation delay time as the time d in order to detect congestion at an interval larger than a control interval. When a measurement interval is larger enough than a packet reciprocation delay time of a session in question, a value proportional to the measurement interval may be used as the time d. Among session control parameters which will be increased in number as congestion is detected are the number of packet losses recognized in a congestion control protocol and the number of retransmissions when the congestion control protocol has a retransmission mechanism.","The congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- executes processing of calculating a threshold value of a buffer length for the determination of deterioration (hereinafter referred to as a deterioration determination threshold value) by the deterioration determining unit - when the congestion state determination processing unit -- determines the congestion state.","In the congestion state, a throughput largely varies because control is executed to avoid congestion in session control. Even when the volume of input data is constant, a variation range of a buffer length of the buffer unit - will be large. Accordingly, the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- obtains a deterioration determination threshold value according to a variation of the buffer length of the buffer unit -.","Among methods of calculating a deterioration determination value for the time of congestion are a method based on a statistical value and a method based on a congestion control model expression in session control.","The method based on a statistical value is a method of obtaining a deterioration determination value from statistical values of past variation of the buffer length stored in the state storage unit -. Specific manner of obtaining a value will be described with reference to . In this manner, a plurality of maximal values of buffer length variation are calculated to obtain a deterioration determination threshold value from an average of these maximal values. A deterioration determination threshold value is preferably an average of maximal values+constant x deflection. Deflection may be a standard deflection or an average deflection. Constant is preferably a value not less than \u201c1\u201d.","The method based on a congestion control model expression in session control is a method of deriving an increase model expression of a communication rate parameter in advance, obtaining a maximum value of a buffer length when a communication rate is decreased due to N times of congestion prevention between time t\u2212d and t based on the increase model expression and using the obtained maximum value to calculate a deterioration determination value.","The maximum value of a buffer length can be obtained by the following procedure. First, assume that an input data rate and a communication rate are coincident to have no variation in the buffer length and obtain, by a model expression f, a period from r1 to r2, which is from a time point where a decrease in the communication rate occurs due to N times of congestion prevention in succession until when the communication rate as of before the rate decrease occurs is restored. Next, add a buffer length as of before congestion prevention to a value obtained by integrating the model expression f by the period from r1 to r2. In this method, since a maximum value of the buffer length can be obtained only when r2\u2212r1<d, t and d are set to have r2\u2212r1<d.","Deterioration determination threshold value is preferably a maximum value of the obtained buffer length\u00d7(a constant not less than 1.0) or a maximum value of the obtained buffer length+(a constant not less than 0).","The present calculation method has a lower possibility of error detection than a method based on a statistical value because a threshold value is obtained based on behavior in session control at the time of congestion.","As to the method based on a statistical value and the method based on a congestion control model expression in session control, either one of them or both of them may be used. When both are used, it is preferable to use a maximum value among deterioration determination threshold values obtained by both the methods.","The non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- executes the processing of calculating, when the congestion state determination processing unit -- determines that it is not in the congestion state, a threshold value of the buffer length for the determination of deterioration (hereinafter referred to as a deterioration determination threshold value) by the deterioration determining unit -.","Not in the congestion state, the buffer length of the buffer unit - will be increased when a link rate is lower than an input data rate or when a communication rate calculated by congestion control at the time of non-congestion is lower than the input data rate. The latter case will happen when time-out occurs after a burst loss such as a path change to result in making the communication rate be higher than an initial value or when a method by which an increase of the communication rate becomes smaller as a reciprocation delay time becomes longer is used as a congestion control system under a condition where a reciprocation delay time is long, or other cases.","In any case, if the volume of input data is monotonously increased or fixed, a buffer length shows a tendency of monotonous increase when the buffer length change is observed in as wide a time span as allows fluctuation of the buffer length due to burst in packet transmission processing or packet reception processing to be ignored. Deterioration determination threshold value at the time of non-congestion is calculated by using the monotonous increase tendency.","As a first method of calculating a deterioration determination threshold value at the time of non-congestion, provided is a method of considering a value calculated from a buffer length at an arbitrary time point t\u2032 stored in the state storage unit - as a deterioration determination threshold value. It is desirable to consider a buffer length+(a constant not less than 0) at the time point t\u2032 as a deterioration determination threshold value. Here, the time point t\u2032 is a time point stored by the state storage unit - prior to the latest time stored in the state storage unit - by more than a time interval in which buffer length fluctuation is ignorable. The time point t\u2032 is desirably a time point at which the congestion state determination processing unit -- determines that it is not in congestion. Furthermore, as the time point t\u2032, the last deterioration determination time point may be used.","As a second method of calculating a deterioration determination threshold value at the time of non-congestion, provided is a method of obtaining a deterioration determination threshold value from a buffer length at a plurality of time points stored in the state storage unit -. More specifically, the method includes extrapolating buffer lengths at a plurality of time points, estimating a buffer length as of a time point where the buffer length to be compared by the deterioration determining unit - is measured and making a deterioration determination threshold value be a value based on the estimated buffer length. It is preferable to make the deterioration determination threshold value be a deterioration estimated value+(a constant not less than 0). It is preferable to select a plurality of time points determined to have non-congestion in succession by the congestion state determination processing unit --. As an extrapolation method, it is preferable to use linear approximation because of its simplicity. Since as compared with the first calculation method, the present calculation method has a narrower range in which determination of deterioration is made, an error detection possibility will be lower.","As to the first and second calculation methods, either one of them or both of them may be used. When both are used, it is desirable to use a maximum value among deterioration determination threshold values calculated by both the methods. It is also possible to add, to a result of the deterioration determining unit -, a higher layer deterioration determining unit which determines deterioration in a higher layer such as an application based on a history of deterioration determination. The higher layer deterioration determining unit determines deterioration in the higher layer deterioration determining unit when the deterioration determining unit makes determination of deterioration n times (n is an arbitrary value not less 1) in succession. Threshold value n may be a constant or a value inversely proportional to an increase in the buffer length.","Next, detailed description will be made of operation of the buffer input unit -, the buffer unit - and the session control unit - of the packet transmission and quality deterioration monitoring device - according to the present mode of implementation with reference to the structural diagram in  and the flow charts in  through .","The buffer input unit - stores data in the buffer unit - (Step A in FIG. ). The session control unit - takes out the data from the buffer unit - according to session control (Step A) to generate a packet (Step A). The packet transmission unit - transmits the packet generated by the session control unit - to the packet reception device - (Step A).","The buffer state monitoring unit - of the packet transmission and quality deterioration monitoring device - obtains a buffer state of the buffer unit - (Step A in ). Store the obtained buffer state in the state storage unit - (Step A). Thereafter, temporarily stop and obtain another buffer state (Step A).","The session state monitoring unit - obtains a session state of the session control unit - (Step A in ). Store the obtained session state in the state storage unit - (Step A). Thereafter, temporarily stop and obtain another session state (Step A).","Next, detailed description will be made of operation of the threshold value calculating unit - and the deterioration determining unit - of the present mode of implementation with reference to the structural diagrams in  and  and the flow chart in .","The congestion state determination processing unit -- of the threshold value calculating unit - obtains a session state from the state storage unit - to determine whether congestion occurs (Step A in ).","When congestion occurs, the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- calculates a deterioration determination threshold value for the time of congestion (Step A). When no congestion occurs, the non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- calculates a deterioration determination threshold value for the time of non-congestion (Step A).","The deterioration determining unit - determines whether a buffer length stored in the state storage unit - is not less than a deterioration determination threshold value or larger than that (Step A). When the condition is satisfied, determine that the communication quality is deteriorated (Step A) and it is not satisfied, determine that the quality is not deteriorated (Step S).","Thus structured and operating first mode of implementation enables detection of deterioration in communication quality in a session control protocol at a node which terminates and relays the session control protocol and a node which receives data from an application to communicate by the session control protocol irrespectively of generation\/non-generation of a packet loss.","More specifically, according to the first mode of implementation, the threshold value calculating unit - comprises the congestion state determination processing unit -- which determines whether it is in the congestion state from a parameter related to congestion detection, the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- which calculates a threshold value of a buffer length when determining that it is in the congestion state, and the non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- which calculates a threshold value of a buffer length when determining that it is not in the congestion state, so that calculation of a threshold value of a buffer length for the determination of deterioration according to a congestion state enables determination of communication quality deterioration irrespectively of generation\/non-generation of a packet loss. The reason is that the congestion state determination processing determines whether it is in the congestion state or not to calculate a threshold value for the determination of deterioration according the congestion state.","In addition, the methods disclosed in Patent Literature 3 through 5 have a problem that because of difficulty in setting an appropriate threshold value, when a threshold value is small, a buffer increase will be detected due to fluctuation in packet arrival or temporary congestion to invite error detection of quality deterioration and when the threshold value is large, quality deterioration detection might be delayed depending on a buffer increase rate. The reason is that the threshold value is determined in advance without taking variation in an actual buffer length into consideration.","According to the present mode of implementation, since the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- and the non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- calculate a deterioration determination threshold value according to a variation range of a buffer length, erroneous detection of quality deterioration or delay of quality deterioration detection can be prevented.","The methods disclosed in Patent Literature 1 and 2 have a problem that even if deterioration of a TCP session is detected, it is impossible to determine whether the deterioration of the TCP session level is related to deterioration of an application level. The reason is that because no relationship is seized between the volume of data input from an application and the volume of transferable data of TCP, it is impossible to determine whether a decrease in the volume of transferable data caused by the deterioration of the TCP session level affects transfer of input data.","Since according to the present mode of implementation, a buffer length of a buffer which temporarily preserves data to be transmitted by session control and a session control parameter are monitored and a buffer length deterioration determination threshold value is obtained for the determination of deterioration in communication quality according to existence\/non-existence of a congestion state to determine whether the communication quality is deteriorated or not, it is possible to determine whether TCP session level deterioration is related to application level deterioration.","While the present mode of implementation has been described with respect to a case of one packet transmission and quality monitoring device - and one packet reception device -, it can be realized also in a case where the packet transmission and quality monitoring device - and the packet reception device - are provided one to N or N to one or N to N in number without receiving constraints on number.

In this case, since TCP has a retransmission mechanism, the number of packet losses or the number of packet retransmissions is used as a parameter whose number is increased along congestion detection.","As a TCP congestion control system, a congestion control system called TCP-Reno is widely used. In a congestion avoiding phase as a normal state except an initial state, a parameter for adjusting the volume of transmission data per one RTT (Round Trip Time) called a congestion window (hereinafter, referred to as a CWND: congestion window) is increased by 1\/1RTT packet per 1ACK (ACKnowledgement), that is, one packet per 1RTT. Accordingly, a communication rate parameter increase model expression f will be expressed as f(t)=1\/RTT [packet\/unit time]. When a packet loss is detected, after completely retransmitting the lost packet, CWND is halved to again enter the congestion avoiding phase. As a result, even when a plurality of packets are lost per one RTT, packet loss detection is counted as one. As a buffer unit monitored by the buffer state monitoring unit, it may be a buffer of a TCP stack or a buffer on an application side provided when calling up a transmission function in SOCKT as an API (Application Programming Interface) of TCP. Both a TCP stack buffer and an application side buffer may be included.","With reference to , description will be made of variation of CWND and a TCP transmission buffer in a case where, when assuming that the volume of input data and the volume of output data by TCP are balanced immediately before a packet loss, no packet loss occurs thereafter for a while. With a CWND value as of immediately before a packet loss (time a in ) as x packet, CWND will be 1\/2x due to a packet loss and when CWND continues increasing to return to x (time b), the TCP transmission buffer length will be the largest and when CWND attains 3\/2x (time c), the buffer length will return to a value as of before the packet loss.","In the present exemplary embodiment, a deterioration determination threshold value at the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- for the time of congestion is calculated by a method based on a congestion control model expression in session control. Logically obtain a buffer length at the time point of time b in  and obtain a deterioration determination threshold value from the buffer length.","When packet loss detection is once, with a time 1RTT as r, the time period from a to b will have r*x\/2. Since the amount of increased of a buffer length in this period will be a discrete integral of a communication rate parameter increase model expression f in the time period from a to b, it can be calculated by:\n\n*ceil(2)+*(ceil(2)\u22121)+ . . . +3+2+*(2\u2212floor(2))=2*(ceil(2)*(ceil(2)+1)\u22121)+*(2\u2212floor(2))\u2003\u2003Expression (1)\n\n(in which ceil(x) is a minimum integer value not less than x and floor(x) is a maximum integer value not more than x).\n","When packet loss detection occurs N times in succession (when halving the CWND due to packet loss detection, retransmission and congestion prevention repeats N times in succession), after successive packet losses, CWND of the congestion window goes 1\/2x, so that the time period from a to b will have r x(1\u22121\/2). The amount of increased of a buffer length in this period can be calculated by:\n\n*(\u2212floor(1\/2))+*(\u2212floor(1\/2)\u22121+ . . . +3+2+*(1\/2\u2212floor(1\/2))=2*((\u2212floor(1\/2))(\u2212floor(1\/2)+1)\u22121)+*(1\/2\u2212floor(1\/2))\u2003\u2003Expression (2).\n","When a delay ACK option is valid, since the number of ACK will be 1\/2 in general, a range of an increase of CWND will be 1\/2 per unit time to take the double time for reaching the CWND, resulting in doubling the amount of an increase d in a buffer length.","Furthermore, taking a retransmission time into consideration, add the following expression to the amount of an increase d in a buffer length:\n\n*(\u2212floor(1\/2))+*(\u2212floor(1\/2\u22121))+*(\u2212floor(1\/2))+*(\u2212floor(1\/2))\u2003\u2003Expression (3).\n","The buffer length at the time point of time b will be a value obtained by adding the amount of increase d in buffer length to a buffer length q as of immediately before packet loss (time a).","Next, description will be made of a relationship between a deterioration determination threshold value and a packet loss with reference to . Set a deterioration determination threshold value as a buffer length at a time point of the time b obtained with N as 1. While in a case of one packet loss as in a section ac, the buffer length fails to exceed the deterioration determination threshold value, in a case of two packet losses as in a section a\u2032c\u2032, the buffer length exceeds the deterioration determination threshold value to determine that communication quality is deteriorated.","On the current operating system (OS), mounted is a TCP having a congestion control system whose rate is higher than TCP-Reno particularly under a large delay and wide band environment and which has fairness with TCP-Reno at the time of congestion. More specifically, on the Windows Server 2008, the Compound TCP is mounted and on Linux, the CUBIC-TCP is mounted, which are used as an OS standard. A deterioration determination threshold value may be obtained based on a communication rate parameter increase model expression of these high-speed TCP. Although when a deterioration determination threshold value is used on the premise of TCP-Reno, the value will be larger than a deterioration determination threshold value on the premise of a high-speed TCP to invite a delay in determination, it will cause no big problem because no erroneous determination will be made.","In the present exemplary embodiment, a deterioration determination threshold value for the time of non-congestion in the non-congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit is obtained from buffer lengths at a plurality of time points. More specifically, linearly extrapolate a buffer length as of t-time prior to a latest time recorded and a buffer length as of 2t-time prior to the same to estimate a buffer length at the latest time and take the value as a deterioration determination threshold value.","Also executable is in SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) having the same congestion control as TCP-Reno.","In the first and second modes of implementation, DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) can be executed as a session control system on the IP network. Since DCCP has no retransmission mechanism, the number of packet losses or a packet loss rate is used as a parameter whose number is increased as congestion detection.","DCCP has its congestion control algorithm changeable by a CCID (Congestion Control ID) parameter. As the CCID, a mode  and a mode  are defined at the current time point.","In the mode , transmission control is executed using a congestion window whose variation is the same as that of TCP-Reno. Accordingly, the present invention can be implemented by the same manner as that of TCP-Reno.","In the mode , transmission control is executed using a transmission rate which is set to be a value of a logical throughput of TCP-Reno obtained from a delay or a packet loss rate. The rate is set not to vary more than double 1RTT. Since a rate variation is small as compared with that in the mode , calculation of a deterioration determination threshold value for the time of congestion at the congestion time threshold value calculation processing unit -- employs a method based on a statistical value.","Also executable is in a system in which the same congestion control mechanism as that of DCCP is mounted on a UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Further executable is in a system in which a congestion control mechanism of either one of the modes  and  of CCID of DCCP is mounted on UDP.","The present exemplary embodiment has been described with respect to an example of execution on IP network. The present invention can be embodied on other network than the IP network as long as it uses a session control protocol for congestion control.","While the above-described first mode of implementation shows an example in which both of the packet transmission function and the quality deterioration monitoring function are mounted on the packet transmission and quality deterioration monitoring device - as a single device, the packet transmission device may comprise a communication quality monitoring device having the quality deterioration monitoring function. Structuring the packet transmission device to include other components than the threshold value calculating unit - and the deterioration determining unit - enable the communication quality monitoring device to be realized only by comprising the threshold value calculating unit - and the deterioration determining unit - as a minimum component.","Also in this case, it is possible to determine whether communication quality is deteriorated irrespectively of data loss generation\/non-generation by calculating a deterioration determination threshold value of a buffer length for the determination of deterioration according to a congestion state.","While the second mode of implementation has been described with respect to a structure in which the quality deterioration monitoring device - comprises the state information reception unit -, the state storage unit -, the calculation value calculating unit - and the deterioration determining unit -, it can be realized only by comprising the threshold value calculating unit - and the deterioration determining unit - as a minimum component.","In this case, communication quality deterioration can be determined irrespectively of data loss generation\/non-generation by obtaining a buffer state and a session state stored in the packet transmission device - side and calculating a deterioration determination threshold value of a buffer length for the determination of deterioration according to a congestion state.","Although the present invention has been described with respect to the preferred modes of implementation and exemplary embodiment in the foregoing, the present invention is not necessarily limited to the above-described modes of implementation and exemplary embodiment and can be implemented in various modifications within the scope of its technical idea."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 17"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
