title: System and method for searching a database of television schedule information
abstract: Compressed codes of as few as 1 to 8 digits, which are decoded by a decoder to convert the compressed code into channel, date, time and length information, identify single TV programs or a category of programs and are stored at a central location accessible over telephone lines through pay-per-use, toll free or regular toll numbers from remote locations. The channel, date, time and length information is used to select channels, start recording, and stop recording at the appropriate time or to control viewing on a TV.

No. 08\/031,246, filed Mar. 12, 1993, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/027,202, filed Mar. 5, 1993, now abandoned. Each of the referenced applications is incorporated herein by this reference as though set forth in full.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to video cassette recorder systems and particularly to an apparatus and method for using encoded information to shorten the time required to perform timer preprogramming and for remotely controlling various home electronic devices and for easily performing an initial setup routine of such an apparatus.","2. Prior Art","The video cassette recorder (VCR) has a number of uses, including playing back of tapes filmed by a video camera, playing back of pre-recorded tapes, and recording and playing back of broadcast and cable television programs.","To record a television program in advance of viewing it, a two-step process is often used: (1) obtain the correct channel, date, time and length (CDTL) information from a television program guide, and (2) program this CDTL information into the VCR. Depending on the model, year and type of the VCR, the CDTL information can be programmed in various ways including: (i) pushing an appropriate sequence of keys in the console according to instructions contained in the user's manual, (ii) pushing an appropriate sequence of keys in a remote hand-held control unit according to instructions contained in the user's manual (remote programming), and (iii) executing a series of keystrokes in the remote hand-held control unit in response to a menu displayed on the television screen (on-screen programming). Other techniques for timer preprogramming have been suggested including: (iv) reading in certain bar-code information using a light pen (light pen programming), and (v) entering instructions through a computer or telephone modem. These various methods differ only in the physical means of specifying the information while the contents, being CDTL and certain power\/clock\/timer on-off commands are generally common although the detailed protocol can vary with different model VCRs. Methods (i) and (ii) described above can require up to 100 keystrokes, which has inhibited the free use of the timer preprogramming feature of VCRs. To alleviate this, new VCR models have included an \u201cOn-Screen Programming\u201d feature, which permits remote input of CDTL information in response to a menu displayed on the television screen. Generally on screen programming of CDTL information requires an average of about 18 keystrokes, which is less than some of the prior methods but still rather substantial. Some of the other techniques such as (iv) above, require the use of special equipment such as a bar code reader.","In general the present state of the art suffers from a number of drawbacks. First, the procedure for setting the VCR to record in advance can be quite complex and confusing and difficult to learn; in fact, because of this many VCR owners shun using the timer preprogramming record feature. Second, the transcription of the CDTL information to the VCR is hardly ever error-free; in fact, many users of VCR's timer preprogramming features express concern over the high incidence of programming errors. Third, even for experienced users, the process of entering a lengthy sequence of information on the channel, date, time and length of desired program can become tedious. Fourth, techniques such as reading in bar-code information or using a computer require special equipment. These drawbacks have created a serious impedance in the use of a VCR as a recording device for television programs. The effect is that time shifting of programs has not become as popular as it once was thought it would be. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a simpler system for effecting VCR timer preprogramming which will enable a user to take advantage of the recording feature of a VCR more fully and freely.","A principal feature of the invention is providing an improved system for the selection and entering of channel, date, time and length (CDTL) information required for timer preprogramming of a VCR which is substantially simpler, faster and less error-prone than present techniques. Another principal feature of the invention is providing televisions having an embedded capability for timer programming control.","In accordance with the invention, to program the timer preprogramming feature of a video system, there is an apparatus and method for using encoded video recorder\/player timer preprogramming information. The purpose is to significantly reduce the number of keystrokes required to set up the timer preprogramming feature on a VCR. In accordance with this invention it is only necessary for the user to enter a code with 1 to 8 digits or more into the VCR. This can be done either remotely or locally at the VCR. Built into either the remote controller or the VCR is a decoding means which automatically converts the code into the proper CDTL programming information and activates the VCR to record a given television program with the corresponding channel, date, time and length. Generally multiple codes can be entered at one time for multiple program selections. The code can be printed in a television program guide in advance and selected for use with a VCR or remote controller with the decoding means.","A product embodying these features is now commercially available and has enjoyed great commercial success. This instant programmer, sold under the VCRPlus+\u00ae trademark, consists of a handheld unit into which compressed codes (each 1 to 8 digits long) for television programs to be recorded are entered. The compressed codes are most commonly found in printed television listings. The instant programmer decodes the compressed codes into channel, date, time-of-day and length commands which are then stored in the programmer's memory. When date and time of the program in the memory that is scheduled the nearest to the current time coincides with the current time, as determined by an internal clock, the instant programmer, using an infrared transmitter and universal remote technology, sends infrared remote control signals to a cable box or a video recorder to change the channel to the correct channel and infrared remote control signals to a video recorder to turn the recorder on and begin recording. After the length for the program, stored in memory, has elapsed, an infrared remote control signal to stop recording is sent to the video recorder.","Before the VCRPlus+ programmer can be used, the user must perform an initial setup procedure. This procedure includes entering the brands and models of the user's video recorder and cable box into the programmer, setting the clock in the programmer, and entering a local channel map which maps \u201cnational\u201d channel numbers for certain networks and cable channels into the actual channel numbers used for these channel by the user's cable system. The instant programmer is manufactured with the infrared codes necessary to remotely control a wide variety of cable boxes and video recorders stored in ROM. The model and brands of the cable box and video recorder must be entered so that the instant programmer will use the correct ones of the infrared codes stored in ROM for the user's particular video recorder and cable box","In a parent application to the present application, an alternate embodiment is disclosed in which the decoder, memory and infrared transmitter of the instant programmer are embedded in a video recorder. The 1 to 8 digit compressed codes are entered directly into the video recorder, either through keys on the video recorder or through a remote for the video recorder. The compressed codes are decoded by the video recorder into channel, date, time-of-day and length commands and stored into the video recorder's memory. When the time and date of a program in memory coincides with the real time as supplied by the clock in the video recorder, the video recorder transmits, using its infrared transmitter and universal remote technology, infrared remote control signals to a cable box that change the channel tuned by the cable box to the desired channel. The video recorder then internally signals itself to begin recording the television signal received from the now correctly tuned cable box. When the length, stored in memory, has elapsed, the video recorder turns itself off.","Like with the VCRPlus+ instant programmer, before the video recorder with a built in instant programmer and remote control transmitter can be used, an initial setup procedure must be performed. The brand and model of cable box and the local channel map must be manually entered into the video recorder.","The present invention includes an improvement to the video recorder with a built in instant programmer and remote control transmitter. The invention involves downloading data over telephone lines from a remote site to the video recorder. In several embodiments the information downloaded is initial setup data that otherwise would have to be manually keyed in by the user. Instead, the user can call a customer service representative on the telephone and orally give the representative the information necessary to perform the initial setup. The representative then enters the necessary information into a computer which, in turn, downloads the data over the telephone line to the video recorder which has been connected to the telephone line. In various embodiments, the video recorder is connected to the telephone line by a modular phone jack in the video recorder or through the telephone's earpiece which is held in the proximity a microphone connected to the video recorder. In other embodiments, data is downloaded first over a telephone line into a VCR remote control, instead of into the video recorder directly, in any of the ways that the data can be transmitted to the video recorder. Thereafter, the data is retransmitted from the VCR remote control to the video recorder through infrared remote control signals transmitted by the VCR remote and received by the video recorder.","In any of these embodiments, the initial setup data is transferred and stored into the video recorder without the user having to key the information manually.","Another principal object of the invention is to embed the decoding means into a television. The television would then at the appropriate time distribute the proper commands to a VCR and a cable box to record the desired program. The user would use the television remote or controls on the television to enter the code that signifies the program to be recorded. The same television remote and controls on the television would also be used to perform normal television control functions, such as channel selection. When the codes are entered they are transmitted to the television and the decoder in the television, which decodes the codes into CDTL information and then the codes themselves and the CDTL information could be displayed \u201con screen\u201d so that the user can verify that the proper codes have been entered. Then at the appropriate time the television would transmit the proper commands to a VCR and a cable box, if necessary, to command the recording of the selected program. This control function can be carried out by using an infrared link by placing infrared transmitters on the television cabinet, preferably at the corners. The television circuitry would include the capability of storing or learning the infrared code protocols for the VCR and the cable box.","Another principal object of the invention is to embed the decoding means into various equipments associated with television, such as a video cassette recorder, cable box or satellite receiver. In any system the decoding means would only have to be present in one of the equipments, such as the cable box, which would then at the appropriate time distribute the proper commands to the other equipments such as a VCR and a satellite receiver to record the desired program. The user would use the television remote or controls on the equipment with the decoder to enter the code that signifies the program to be recorded. The same television remote would also be used to perform normal television control functions, such as channel selection. When the codes are entered they are transmitted to the equipment with the decoder, which decodes the codes into CDTL information. Then at the appropriate time the equipment with the decoder would transmit the proper commands to a the other equipment such as a VCR, satellite receiver and a cable box to command the recording of the selected program. This control function can be carried out by using an infrared link by coupling infrared transmitters on the equipment with the decoder. The infrared transmitter can be placed in a infrared dome on the equipment, mounted behind the front panel, attached to a mouse coupled via a cable to the equipment with the decoder with the mouse placed near the receiver, or attached to a stick on miniature mouse coupled via a cable to the equipment with the decoder with the miniature mouse attached to the device with the receiver. The equipment with the decoder would include the capability of storing or learning the infrared code protocols for the other equipment, such as a VCR, satellite receiver and a cable box.","Another embodiment of the invention includes a full function universal remote control capable of controlling various home electronic devices. The functions of the buttons of the remote control and the infrared codes needed to perform the functions are programmed remotely, such as by transmissions over telephone lines received by a microphone in the remote control.","Other objects and many of the attendant features of this invention will be more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed descriptions and considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which like reference symbols designate like parts throughout the figures.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly, to , there is shown an apparatus for using encoded video recorder\/player timer preprogramming information  according to this invention. The primary components include a remote controller  and a video cassette recorder\/player with G-code decoder , which can be controlled by remote controller  via a command signal . The remote controller  can have a number of keys, which include numerical keys , G-code switch , function keys , program key  and power key . There are means in the remote controller  that interprets each key as it is pressed and sends the proper command signal  to the VCR via an infra-red light emitting diode . Except for the G-code switch  on the remote controller  in , the remote controller  is essentially the same as any other remote controller in function. The G-code switch  is provided just to allow the user to lock the remote controller  in the G-code mode while using a G-code, which is the name given to the compressed code which is the encoded CDTL information, to perform timer preprogramming.","A G-code consists of 1 to 7 digits, although more could be used, and is associated with a particular program. A user would look up the G-code in a program guide and just enter the G-code on the remote controller , instead of the present state of the art, which requires that the user enter the actual channel, date, time and length (CDTL) commands.","In order to understand the advantages of using a G-code, it is helpful to describe the best of the current state of the art, which is \u201con screen programming\u201d with direct numerical entry. This technique involves about 18 keystrokes and the user has to keep switching his view back and forth between the TV screen and the remote controller while entering the CDTL information. This situation may be akin to a user having to dial an 18 digit telephone number while reading it from a phone book. The number of keys involved and the switching back and forth of the eye tend to induce errors. A typical keying sequence for timer recording using on-screen CDTL programming is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"12"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["PROG","2","1","15","07","30","2","08","00","2","04","PROG"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"12","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["26","20"]},"By contrast, this command could have been \u201ccoded\u201d and entered in a typical G-code sequence as follows: PROG 1138 PROG. To distinguish that the command is a coded G-code, the G-code switch  should be turned to the \u201cON\u201d position. Instead of having a switch, a separate key \u201cG\u201d can be used. The G-code programming keystroke sequence would then be: G 1138 PROG.","The use of a G-code does not preclude \u201con-screen\u201d confirmation of the program information that has been entered. When the keystrokes \u201cPROG 1138 PROG\u201d are entered with the G-code switch in the \u201cON\u201d position, the G-code would be decoded and the television could display the following message:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["PROGRAM","DATE","START TIME","STOP TIME","CHANNEL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1138","15","7:30 PM","8:00 PM","4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In order for the G-code to be useful it must be decoded and apparatus for that purpose must be provided. Referring to , a video cassette recorder\/player with G-code decoder  is provided to be used in conjunction with remote controller . The command signal  sent from the remote controller  is sensed by the photodiode  and converted to electrical signals by command signal receiver . The electrical signals are sent to a command controller , which interprets the commands and determines how to respond to the commands. As shown in , it is also possible for the command controller  to receive commands from the manual controls  that are normally built into a VCR. If the command controller  determines that a G-code was received then the G-code will be sent to the G-code decoder  for decoding. The G-code decoder  converts the G-code into CDTL information, which is used by the command controller  to set the time\/channel programming . Built into the VCR is a clock . This is normally provided in a VCR and is used to keep track of the date and time. The clock  is used primarily by the time\/channel programming  and the G-code decoder  functions. The time\/channel programming  function is set up with CDTL information by the command controller . When the proper date and time is read from clock , then the time\/channel programming  function turns the record\/playback  function \u201cON\u201d to record. At the same time the tuner  is tuned to the proper channel in the television signal . Later the user can command the record\/playback  function to a playback mode to watch the program via the television monitor .","An alternate way to control the recorder is to have the command controller  keep all the CDTL information instead of sending it to the time\/channel programming . The command controller would also keep track of the time by periodically reading clock . The command controller would then send commands to the time\/channel programming  to turn on and off the recorder and to tuner  to cause it to tune to the right channel at the right time according to the CDTL information.","The clock  is also an input to G-code decoder , which allows the G-code decoding to be a function of the clock, which lends a measure of security to the decoding technique and makes it harder to copy. Of course this requires that the encoding technique must also be a function of the clock.","A possible realization of the command controller  and the G-code decoder  is shown in . The command controller  function can be realized with a microprocessor , a random access memory  and a read only memory , which is used for program storage. The input\/output  function is adapted to receive commands from the command signal receiver , the manual controls  and the clock , and to output signals to a display , the clock , and the time\/channel programming  function. If the microprocessor  interprets that a G-code has been received, then the G-code is sent to microcontroller  for decoding. The microcontroller  has an embedded random access memory  and an embedded read only memory  for program and table storage. The clock  can be read by both microprocessor  and microcontroller .","An alternative to having microcontroller  perform the G-code decoding is to build the G-code decoding directly into the program stored in read only memory . This would eliminate the need for microcontroller . Of course, other hardware to perform the G-code decoding can also be used. The choice of which implementation to use is primarily an economic one.","The blocks in  are well known in the prior art and are present in the following patents: Fields, U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,412; Scholz, U.S. Pat. No. 4,519,003; and Brugliera, U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,601. For example, clock  is analogous to element  in Scholz and element  in Brugliera. Other analogous elements are: command signal receiver  and Scholz  and Brugliera ; tuner  and Scholz  and Brugliera ; time\/channel programming  and Scholz ,  and Brugliera ; record & playback  and Scholz , , ; command controller  and Scholz ,  and Brugliera ; microprocessor  and Fields ; RAM  and Fields ; ROM  and Fields ; manual controls  and Scholz , ; and remote controller  and Scholz  and Brugliera .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0118","num":"0117"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["80","80","12","82","84","80","70","70","14","38"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["82","80","60","84","85","88","28","85","80","82","85","85"]},"The remote controller with embedded G-code decoder as described above would send channel, date, time and length information to the video cassette recorder\/player , which would use the CDTL information for tuning into the correct channel and starting and stopping the recording function. The remote controller may have to be unique for each different video cassette recorder\/player, because each brand or model may have different infrared pulses for each type of information sent such as the channel number keys and start record and stop record keys. The particular infrared pulses used for each key type can be called the vocabulary of the particular remote controller. Each model may also have a different protocol or order of keys that need to be pushed to accomplish a function such as timer preprogramming. The protocol or order of keys to accomplish a function can be called sentence structure. If there is a unique remote controller built for each model type, then the proper vocabulary and sentence structure can be built directly into the remote controller.","An alternate to having the remote controller with embedded G-code decoder send channel, date, time and length information to the video cassette recorder\/player , is to have the remote controller with embedded G-code decoder perform more operations to simplify the interfacing problem with existing video cassette recorder\/players. In particular, if the remote controller not only performs the G-code decoding to CDTL, but also keeps track of time via clock , then it is possible for the remote controller to send just channel, start record and stop commands to the video cassette recorder\/player. The channel, start and stop are usually basic one or two key commands, which means there is no complicated protocol or sentence structure involved. Thus, to communicate with a diverse set of video cassette recorder\/player models it is only necessary to have memory within the remote controller, such as ROM  of , for storing the protocol for all the models or at least a large subset. The G-code would be entered on the remote controller as before and decoded into channel, date, time and length information, which would be stored in the remote controller. Via clock , the time would be checked and when the correct time arrives the remote controller would automatically send out commands to the VCR unit for tuning to the correct channel and for starting and stopping the recording. It is estimated that only two (2) bytes per key for about 15 keys need to be stored for the vocabulary for each video cassette recorder\/player model. Thus, to cover  models would only require about 30*50=1500 bytes of memory in the remote controller. It would be necessary to position the remote controller properly with respect to the VCR unit so that the infrared signals sent by the remote controller are received by the unit.","Another preferred embodiment is to provide a universal remote controller  with an embedded G-code decoder. Universal remote controllers provide the capability to mimic a number of different remote controllers. This reduces the number of remote controllers that a user needs to have. This is accomplished by having a learn function key  function on the universal remote controller, as shown in . If the learn function key  is pushed in conjunction with another key, the unit will enter into the learn mode. Incoming infra-red (IR) pulses from the remote controller to be learned are detected by the infra-red photodiode , filtered and wave-shaped into recognizable bit patterns before being recorded by a microcontroller into a battery-backed static RAM as the particular IR pulse pattern for that particular key. This is done for all the individual keys.","An example of more complex learning is the following. If the learn function key  in conjunction with the program key  are pushed when the G-code switch is \u201cON\u201d, the unit will recognize that it is about to record the keying sequence of a predetermined specific example of timer preprogramming of the particular VCR involved. The user will then enter the keying sequence from which the universal remote controller  can then deduce and record the protocol of the timer preprogramming sequence. This is necessary because different VCRs may have different timer preprogramming command formats.","If keys are pushed without the learn function key  involved, the microcontroller should recognize it is now in the execute mode. If the key is one of the direct command keys, the microcontroller will read back from its static RAM the stored pulse sequence and send out command words through the output parallel I\/O to pulse the output light emitting diode . If the key is the PROG key and the G-code switch is \u201cOFF\u201d, then the microcontroller should recognize the following keys up to the next PROG key as a timer preprogramming CDTL command and send it out through the light emitting diode . If the C-code switch  is set to \u201cON\u201d and the program key  is pushed, the microcontroller should recognize the following keys up to the next PROG key as a G-code command for timer preprogramming. It will decode the G-code into channel, date, start time and length (CDTL) and the microcontroller will then look up in it's static RAM \u201cdictionary\u201d the associated infra-red pulse patterns and concatenate them together before sending them off through the output parallel I\/O to pulse the light emitting diode  to send the whole message in one continuous stream to the VCR.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["92","90","60","96"]},"The universal remote controller can also be used in another manner to simplify the interfacing problem with existing video cassette recorder\/players. In particular, if the universal remote controller performs not only the G-code decoding to CDTL, but also keeps track of time via clock  in , then it is possible for the universal remote controller to send just channel, start record and stop commands to the video cassette recorder\/player, which as explained before, are usually basic one key commands, which means there is no complicated protocol or sentence structure involved. Thus, to communicate with a diverse set of video cassette recorder\/player models it is only necessary for the universal remote controller to \u201clearn\u201d each key of the remote controller it is replacing. The G-code would be entered on the universal remote controller as before and decoded into channel, date, time and length information, which would be stored in the universal remote controller. Via clock , the time would be checked and when the correct time arrives the universal remote controller would automatically send out commands to the VCR unit for tuning to the correct channel and for starting and stopping the recording. It would be necessary to position the universal remote controller properly with respect to the VCR unit so that the signals sent by the universal remote are received by the VCR unit.","There are a number of ways that the G-code decoding can be performed. The most obvious way is to just have a large look up table. The G-code would be the index. Unfortunately, this would be very inefficient and result in a very expensive decoder due to the memory involved. The total storage involved is a function of the number of total combinations. If we allow for 128 channels, 31 days in a month, 48 on the hour and on the half hour start times in a twenty four hour day, and 16 length selections in half hour increments, then the total number of combinations is 128\u00d731\u00d748\u00d716=3,047,424. This number of combinations can be represented by a 7 digit number. The address to the table would be the 7 digit number. In the worst case, this requires a look up table that has about 4,000,000 rows by 15 to 16 digital columns, depending on the particular protocol. These digital columns would correspond to the CDTL information required for \u201con screen programming\u201d. Each digit could be represented by a 4 bit binary number. Thus, the total storage number of bits required for the look up table would be about 4,000,000\u00d716\u00d74=256,000,000. The present state of the art has about 1 million bits per chip. Thus, G-code decoding using a straightforward table look up would require a prohibitively expensive number of chips.","Fortunately, there are much more clever ways of performing the G-code decoding.  is a flow diagram of a preferred G-code decoding technique. To understand G-code decoding, it is easiest to first explain the G-code encoding technique, for which  is the flow chart. Then the G-code decoding technique, which is the reverse of the G-code encoding will be explained.","The encoding of the G-codes can be done on any computer and is done prior to preparation of any program guide that would include G-codes. For each program that will be printed in the guide, a channel, date, time and length (CDTL) code  is entered in step . Step  separately reads the priority for the channel, date, time and length in the priority vector storage , which can be stored in read only memory .

associated with each channel, time and length, as illustrated above, are used to determine the proper ordering. Since the priority vector tables are already ordered by the most popular channel, time, and length, the order in which to select between the various binary bits for one table, for example selecting between the CCCCCCCbits, is already known. The Cbit would be selected first because as the lowest order binary bit it would select between the first two entries in the channel priority table. Then the Cbit would be selected and so on. Similarly, the Tand Lbits would be used before any of the other time and length bits. A combination of the C, T, Land DDDDDbits should be used first, so that all the information is available for a channel, date, time and length. The DDDDDbits are all used because the date bits all have equal priority and all are needed to specify a date even if some of the bits are binary zero.","At this point the bit hierarchy key could be:\n\n","The question at this point in the encoding process is what should the next most significant bit in the hierarchy key be: T, C, or L. This is again determined by the differential probabilities, which can be calculated from the above tables for each bit. Since we are dealing with binary bits, the Cin combination with Cselects between 2=4 channels or 2 more channels over Calone. The differential probability for Cis then the additional probabilities of these two additional channels and for the example this is: 4+3=7. In a similar manner Cin combination with Cand Cselects between 2=8 channels or 4=2more channels over the combination of Cand C. So the differential probability of Cis the additional probabilities of these four additional channels and for the example this is: 2.9+2.1+2+1.8=8.8. In a similar manner, the differential probabilities of Tand Lcan be calculated to be 6+5=11 and 15+5=20, respectively. Once all the differential probabilities are calculated, the next step is determining which combinations of bits are more probable.","Now for the above example, which combination is more probable: Twith CL, or Cwith TL, or Lwith TCThis will determine the next bit in the key. So, which is greater: 11\u00d79.3\u00d770=7161; 7\u00d715.8\u00d770=7742; or 20\u00d715.8\u00d79.3=2938.8? In this case the combination with the greatest probability is 7\u00d715.8\u00d770=7742, which corresponds to Cwith TL. So, Cis selected as the next bit in the bit hierarchy key.","The next bit is selected in the same way. Which combination is more probable: Cwith TL, or Twith Cor Cand L, or Lwith Cor Cand T. For the example shown, which has the greatest probability: 8.8\u00d715.8\u00d770=9732.8; 11\u00d7(9.3+7)\u00d770=12551; or 20\u00d7(9.3+7)\u00d715.8=5150.8? In this case the combination with the greatest probability is 11\u00d7(9.3+7)\u00d770=12551, which corresponds Twith Cor Cand L. So, Tis selected as the next bit in the bit hierarchy key. This procedure is repeated for all the differential probabilities until the entire key is found.","Alternately, the bit hierarchy key can be just some arbitrary sequence of the bits. It is also possible to make the priority vectors interdependent, such as making the length priority vector dependent on different groups of channels. Another technique is to make the bit hierarchy key  and the priority vector tables , a function of clock , as shown in . This makes it very difficult for the key and therefore the coding technique to be duplicated or copied.","For example it is possible to scramble the date bits in the bit hierarchy key  as a function of the clock. Changing the order of the bits as a function of the clock would not change the effectiveness of the bit hierarchy key in reducing the number of binary bits for the most popular programs, because the date bits all are of equal priority.

would only fail if those first two channels were being used. Other clock dependencies are also possible to provide security for the coding technique.","However it is derived, the bit hierarchy key  is determined and stored. In step  the binary bits of C, D, T, Lare rearranged according to the bit hierarchy key  to create one 22 bit binary number. Then the resulting 22 bit binary number is converted to decimal in the convert binary number to decimal G-code step . The result is G-code .","If the priority vector and the bit hierarchy key are well matched to the viewing habits of the general population, then it is expected that the more popular programs would require no more than 3 or 4 digits for the G-code.","Now that the encoding technique has been explained the decoding technique is just reversing the coding technique. This is done according to the flow chart of . This is the preferred G-code decoding that can be built into G-code decoder  in VCR  or the remote controller G-code decoders  and  in .","The first step  is to enter G-code . Next the G-code  is converted to a 22 bit binary number in step . Then the bits are reordered in step  according to the bit hierarchy key  to obtain the reordered bits . Then the bits are grouped together and converted to decimal form in step . As this point we obtain C, D, T, Ldata , which are the indices to the priority vector tables. For the above example, we would have at this step the vector 4 9 1 3. This C, D, T, Ldata  is then used in step  to look up channel, date, time, and length in priority vector storage . The CDTL  for the example above is 5 10 19.00 1.5, which means channel 5, 10th day of the month, 7:00 PM, and 1.5 hours in length.","If the coding technique is a function of the clock then it is also necessary to make the decoding technique a function of the clock. It is possible to make the bit hierarchy key  and the priority vector tables , a function of clock , as shown in . This again makes it very difficult for the key and therefore the coding technique to be duplicated or copied. It is also possible to have the decoding and encoding techniques dependent on any other predetermined or preprogrammable algorithm.","Although the above G-code encoding and decoding technique is a preferred embodiment, it should be understood that there are many ways to perform the intent of the invention which is to reduce the number of keystrokes required for timer preprogramming. To accomplish this goal there are many ways to perform the G-code encoding and decoding. There are also many ways to make the encoding and decoding technique more secure besides just making the encoding and decoding a function of the clock. This security can be the result of any predetermined or preprogrammed algorithm.","It is possible in the G-code coding and decoding techniques to use mixed radix number systems instead of binary numbers. For example, suppose that there are only 35 channels, which would require 6 binary bits to be represented; however, 6 binary bits can represent 64 channels, because 26=64. The result is that in a binary number system there are 29 unnecessary positions. This can have the effect of possibly making a particular G-code longer than it really needs to be. A mixed radix number system can avoid this result. For example, for the case of 35 channels, a mixed radix number system with the factors of 7and 5can represent 35 combinations without any empty space in the code. The allowed numbers for the 7factor are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The allowed numbers for the 5factor are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. For example, digital 0 is represented in the mixed radix number system as 00. The digital number 34 is represented in the mixed radix number system as 46, because 4*7+6*50=34. The major advantage of a mixed radix number system is in prioritizing the hierarchy key. If the first 5 channels have about equal priority and the next 30 are also about equal, then the mixed radix number system allows the two tiers to be accurately represented. This is not to say that a mixed radix number system is necessarily preferable. Binary numbers are easier to represent in a computer and use of a fixed radix number system such as binary numbers allows a pyramid of prioritization to be easily represented in the hierarchy key.","Another feature that is desirable in all of the embodiments is the capability to key in the G-code once for a program and then have the resulting CDTL information used daily or weekly. Ordinarily the CDTL information is discarded once it is used. In the case of daily or weekly recording of the same program, the CDTL information is stored and used until it is cancelled. The desire to repeat the program daily or weekly can be performed by having a \u201cWEEKLY\u201d or \u201cDAILY\u201d button on the remote controller or built into the VCR manual controls. Another way is to use one key, such as the PROG key and push it multiple times within a certain period of time such as twice to specify daily or thrice to specify weekly. For example, if the G-code switch is \u201cON\u201d and the G-code for the desired program is 99 then daily recording of the program can be selected by the following keystrokes:\n\n","Once a daily or weekly program is set up, then it can be used indefinitely. If it is desired to cancel a program and if there is a \u201cCANCEL\u201d button on the remote controller or manual control for the VCR, then one way to cancel a program (whether it is a normal CDTL, daily or weekly entry) is to key in the following:\n\n","If \u201con screen programming\u201d is available, then the programs that have been selected for timer preprogramming could be reviewed on the screen. The daily and weekly programs would have an indication of their type. Also the G-codes could be displayed along with the corresponding CDTL information. This would make it quite easy to review the current \u201cmenu\u201d and either add more programs or cancel programs as desired.","A television calendar  according to this invention is illustrated in . As shown, the television calendar has multiple day of year sections , multiple day sections , multiple time of day sections , channel identifiers , and descriptive program identifiers , including the name of the program, arranged in a manner that is common in television guide publications. Arranged in relation to each channel identifier is a compressed code indication  or G-code containing the channel, date, time and length information for that entry in the television calendar.  shows how easy it is to perform timer programming. All one needs to do is find the program one wants to watch and enter the compressed code shown in the compressed code indication. This is in contrast to having to deal with all the channel, date, time and length entries separately. At least the channel, date and time are explicitly stated in the television guide. The length is usually only available by searching the guide to find the time of day section  where a new program begins and then performing some arithmetic to find the length of the program. Using the compressed G-code avoids all these complications.","For cable television programs, there is an additional issue that needs to be addressed for the compressed G-code to be useful. In a normal television guide, CDTL information is available for all the normal broadcast channels in the form of numbers including the channel numbers, such as channel 4 or 7. However, for cable channels like HBO, ESPN etc., only the names of the channels are provided in most television listings. The reason for this is that in some metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles, there may be only one (1) edition of television guide, but there may be quite a few cable carriers, each of which may assign HBO or ESPN to different cable channel numbers. In order for a compressed code such as the G-code to be applicable to the cable channels as published by a wide area television guide publication, the following approach can be used.","First, all the cable channels would be permanently assigned a unique number, which would be valid across the nation. For example, we could assign ESPN to cable channel 1, HBO as cable channel 2, SHO as cable channel 3, etc. This assignment would be published by the television guide publications.","The video cassette recorder apparatus, such as the remote controller, the VCR unit or both, could then be provided with two (2) extra modes: \u201cset\u201d and \u201ccable channel\u201d. One way of providing the user interface to these modes would be to provide two (2) extra buttons: one called SET and one called CABLE CHANNEL. The buttons could be located on the video cassette recorder unit itself or located on a remote controller, as shown in ,  and , where SET is element  and CABLE CHANNEL is element . Of course, other user interfaces are possible.","Next, the television viewer would have to go through a one-time \u201csetting\u201d procedure of his VCR for all the cable channels that he would likely watch. This \u201csetting\u201d procedure would relate each of the assigned numbers for each cable channel to the channel number of the local cable carrier. For example, suppose that the local cable carrier uses channel 6 for ESPN, then cable channel number 1 could be assigned to ESPN, as shown in the following table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0173","num":"0177"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00014","num":"00014"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Cable Channel","Assigned","Channel Number in"]},{"entry":[{},"Name","Cable Chan.

The advantage of the new way is that the television guide will publish [C2] next to the program description, so the viewer will just look up the assigned channel number identifier instead of having to remember that HBO is local cable channel 24. When the CABLE CHANNEL button is pushed, command controller  knows that it will look up the local cable channel number in cable channel address table  to tune the VCR to the correct channel.","For timer preprogramming and for using the compressed G-code, a way to differentiate between broadcast and cable channels is to add an eighth channel bit, which would be set to 0 for normal broadcast channels and 1 for cable channels such as HBO.

For a cable channel, the 7 other bits can be decoded according to a separate cable channel priority vector table , which could be stored in ROM  of microcontroller .

PROG 4679 PROG. The G-code decoder unit will decode this G-code into \u201ccable channel 2\u201d and will also signal the command controller  with a cable channel signal , as shown in , because the extra channel bit will be \u201c1\u201d which distinguishes that the G-code is for a cable channel; then, since the association of \u201ccable channel 2\u201d with channel 24 has been established earlier in the \u201csetting\u201d procedure, the command controller, if it has received a cable channel signal, will immediately look up 2 in the cable channel address table  to translate it to cable channel 24, which will be used as the recording channel at the appropriate time. By associating the G-code with the assigned cable channel number rather than the local cable channel number, the G-code for that program will be valid in the whole local area, which may have many different cable carriers each of which may have different local cable channel numbers.","To include the cable channel compressed G-code feature, the decoding and encoding algorithms are as shown in , respectively. The encoding should be explained first before the decoding. The primary change in  from  is that a cable channel priority vector table  has been added and is used in look up priority step  if a cable channel is being encoded. Also if a cable channel is being encoded then the cable channel bit is added in the correct bit position in the convert CDTLto binary numbers step . This could be bit C, as discussed before. The bit hierarchy key could be determined as before to compress the number of bits in the most popular programs; however, it needs to be 23 bits long to accommodate the cable channel bit. The maximum compressed G-code length could still be 7 digits, because 2=8,388,608.","The decoding is shown in  and is just the reverse of the encoding process. After step , test cable channel bit  is added and effectively tests the cable channel bit to determine if it is a \u201c1\u201d. If so then the command controller  is signaled via cable channel signal  of  that the CDTL  that will be sent to it from G-code decoder  is for a cable channel. Then the command controller knows to look up the local cable carrier channel number based on the assigned cable channel number. In step  of , the priority vector tables including the cable channel priority vector table  are used to look up the CDTL  information.","An alternate to having the command controller receive a cable channel signal  is for the G-code decoder to perform all of the decoding including the conversion from assigned cable channel number to local cable carrier number. This would be the case for the remote controller implementation of .  shows the implementation of the entire decode algorithm if this step is included. All that needs to be added is convert assigned channel to local cable carrier channel step , which performs a look up in cable channel address table , if the cable channel bit indicates that a cable channel is involved. Step  effectively replaces step  in .","Another issue that needs addressing is the number of programs that can be preprogrammed. Since the G-code greatly simplifies the process of entering programs, it is likely that the user will quickly learn and want to enter a large number of programs; however, some existing VCRs can only store up to four (4) programs, while some can store as many as eight. Thus, the user may get easily frustrated by the programming limitations of the VCR.","One approach to this problem, is to perform the compressed G-code decoding in the remote controller and provide enough memory there to store a large number of programs, eg. 20 or 40. The remote controller would have the capability of transferring periodically several of these stored programs at a time to the VCR main unit. To provide this capability, extra memory called stack memory  is required inside the remote unit, as shown in , which other than that is identical to . Stack memory  can be implemented with a random access memory, which may in fact reside in the microcontroller itself, such as RAM .","The stack memory  is where new entry, insertion & deletion of timer preprogramming information is carried out. It is also where editing takes place. The top memory locations of the stack, for example the first 4 locations, correspond exactly to the available timer preprogramming memory in the VCR main unit. Whenever the top of the stack memory is changed, the new information will be sent over to the VCR main unit to update it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0188","num":"0196"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["230","60","234","236"]},"If this is the first program entered, it is placed at the top location of the stack memory. If there are already programs in the stack memory, the newly entered program will first be provisionally placed at the bottom of the stack memory. The stack memory will then be sorted into the correct temporal order in step , so that the earliest program in time will appear in the top location and the last program in time will be at the bottom. Notice that the nature of the temporally sorted stack memory is such that if stack memory location n is altered, then all the locations below it will be altered.","For example, suppose the stack memory has six (6) entries already temporally ordered, and a new entry is entered whose temporal ordering places it in location  (1 being the top location). If this entry is placed into location , information which was in location , , ,  will be shifted to locations , , , and . Locations  and  will remain unchanged.","The microcontroller , after doing the temporal ordering, checks in step  whether the first n entries have changed from before, where for the current example n equals 4. In this case, since a new program has been entered into location , what used to be in location  now moves to location . Since the VCR's main unit program menu of 4 entries should correspond exactly to location  through  of the stack memory, entries  and  on the VCR main unit must now be revised. The microcontroller therefore sends out the new entries  &  to the main unit, in step  of . If the newly entered program, after temporal ordering, gets entered into location , then entries  through  have not changed from before and the microcontroller will not send any message to the VCR main unit and the microcontroller will just resume monitoring the clock  and the keyboard  as per step . It is assumed that when the user enters the G-code in step , the remote controller is pointed at the VCR main unit. The other steps of  happen so fast that the changes are sent in step  while the remote controller is still being pointed at the VCR main unit.","If the user decides to delete a program in step , the deletion is first carried out in the stack memory. If the first 4 entries are affected, the microcontroller will send the revised information over to the VCR main unit. If the first 4 entries are not affected, then again the remote controller unit will not send anything. The deletion will only change the lower part of the stack (lower meaning location  to ). This new information will be sent over to the VCR main unit at the appropriate time.","In the meantime, the VCR main unit will be carrying out its timer programming function, completing its timing preprogramming entries one by one. By the time all 4 recording entries have been completed, the stack in the remote must send some new entries over to \u201creplenish\u201d the VCR main unit (if the stack has more than 4 entries).","The real time clock  in the remote controller unit is monitored by the microcontroller to determine when the programs in the main unit have been used up. Referring to the flow chart in , the microcontroller periodically checks the clock and the times for the programs at the top of the stack in step  (say the first 4 entries), which are identical to the VCR's main unit's menu. If on one of the periodic checks, it is determined that the recording of the main unit's menu is complete, then if there are more entries in the stack, which is tested in step , the display unit will be set to a blinking mode or display a blinking message in step  to alert the user to send more programs. Next time the user picks up the remote unit, the blinking will remind him that the VCR main unit's program menu has been completed and it is time to replenish the VCR main unit with program entries stored in the remote. The user simply picks up the remote and points it towards the VCR main unit and presses \u201cENTER\u201d. This will \u201cpop\u201d the top of the stack memory in step , i.e. pop all the entries in the stack up by four locations. The microcontroller will then send the new \u201ctop of the stack\u201d (i.e. top 4 entries) over to the VCR main unit in step . This process will repeat until the whole stack has been emptied.","Another preferred embodiment of an apparatus for using compressed codes for recorder preprogramming is the instant programmer  of .

If the VCR and\/or cable box functions are located within the television  itself, then the instant programmer  could be positioned to transmit to the television , either in the manner of  or by placing the mounting stand on top of the television in the manner of .","By using mounting stand , the user only need to align the mounting stand , and the instant programmer  once with the equipment to be programmed rather than having the user remember to keep the instant programmer  in the correct location to transmit via front infrared (IR) diode , as shown in . Current experience with various remote controllers shows that it is difficult at best to keep a remote controller in a fixed location, for example, on a coffee table. The mounting stand  solves this problem by locating the instant programmer  with the equipment to be controlled. The left IR diode , down IR diode , two back IR diodes  and right IR diode  are positioned to transmit to the left, downward, backward, and to the right. The downward transmitter assumes that mounting stand  will be placed on top of the unit to be programmed. The left and right transmission allows units to the left or right to be programmed. The backward transmission back IR diodes  are provided so that signals can bounce off walls and other objects in the room. The front IR diode , the left IR diode , the right IR diode  and the down IR diode  are implemented with 25 degree emitting angle diodes. Two back IR diodes are provided for greater energy in that direction and are implemented with 5 degree emitting angle diodes, which focus the energy and provide for greater reflection of the IR energy off of walls or objects in the room.","Most VCR's and cable boxes can be controlled by an infrared remote controller; however, different VCR's and cable boxes have different IR codes. Although there are literally hundreds of different models of VCR's and cable boxes, there are fortunately only tens of sets of IR codes. Each set may have a few tens of \u201cwords\u201d that represent the different keys required, e.g. \u201cpower\u201d, \u201crecord\u201d, \u201cchannel up\u201d, \u201cchannel down\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d etc. For the purpose of controlling the VCR and cable box to do recording, only the following \u201cwords\u201d are required: \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201c4\u201d, \u201c5\u201d, \u201c6\u201d, \u201c7\u201d, \u201c8\u201d, \u201c9\u201d, \u201cpower\u201d, \u201crecord\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d. The IR codes for these words for all the sets are stored in the memory of the instant programmer , which is located in microcomputer  of . During setup of the instant programmer , the user interactively inputs to the instant programmer  the type and model of his VCR and cable box. The correct set of IR codes will be recalled from memory during the actual control process. In the case where the user only has a VCR, the infrared (IR) codes for that particular VCR will be recalled to control the VCR. In the case where the user has a VCR and a cable box, the IR codes \u201cpower\u201d, \u201crecord\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d will be recalled from the set that corresponds to the VCR whereas the IR codes for \u201c0\u201d through \u201c9\u201d will be recalled from the set that corresponds to the cable box. The reason is that in this case, the cable box controls the channel switching. Hence the channel switching signals \u201c0\u201d through \u201c9\u201d must be sent to the cable box instead of the VCR.","Initially, the user performs a setup sequence. First, the user looks up the number corresponding to the model\/brand of VCR to be programmed in a table, which lists the VCR brand name and a two digit code. Then with the VCR tuned to Channel 3 or Channel 4, whichever is normally used, the user turns the VCR \u201cOFF\u201d. Then the user presses the VCR key . When the display shows VCR, the user presses the two-digit code looked up in the VCR model\/brand table (for example 01 for RCA). The user points the instant programmer  at the VCR and then presses ENTER key . The red warning light emitting diode  will flash while it is sending a test signal to the VCR. If the VCR turned \u201cON\u201d and changed to Channel 09, the user presses the SAVE key  and proceeds to the set clock step. If the VCR did not turn \u201cON\u201d or turned \u201cON\u201d but did not change to Channel 09 the user presses ENTER key  again and waits until red warning light emitting diode  stops flashing. The instant programmer  sends the next possible VCR code, while the red warning light emitting diode  is flashing. If the VCR turns \u201cON\u201d and changed to Channel 09 the user presses SAVE key , otherwise the user presses ENTER key  again until the VCR code is found that works for the VCR. The display shows \u201cEND\u201d if all possible VCR codes for that brand are tried. If so, the user presses VCR key  code 00 and then ENTER key  to try all possible codes, for all brands, one at a time.","Once the proper VCR code has been found and saved, the next setup step is to set the clock on instant programmer . First, the user presses the CLOCK key . When the display shows: \u201cYR:\u201d, the user presses the year (for example 90), then presses ENTER key . Then the display shows \u201cMO:\u201d, and the user presses the month (for example 07 is July), and then presses ENTER key . This is repeated for \u201cDA:\u201d date (for example 01 for the 1st), \u201cHr:\u201d hour (for example 02 for 2 o'clock), \u201cMn:\u201d minute (for example 05 for 5 minutes), and \u201cAM\/PM:\u201d 1 for AM or 2 for PM. After this sequence, the display will show \u201cSAVE\u201d for a few seconds and then the display will show the current time and date that have been entered. It is no longer necessary for the user to set the clock on his\/her VCR.","Next, if the instant programmer  is also to be used as a cable box controller, then the setup steps are as follows. First, the number corresponding to the model\/brand of cable box (converter) to be controlled is looked up in a cable box model brand table, that lists cable box brands and corresponding two digit codes. The VCR is tuned to Channel 03 or 04 and turned \u201cOFF\u201d. Then the cable box is tuned to Channel 02 or 03, whichever is normal, and left \u201cON\u201d. Then the CABLE key  is pressed. When the display shows: \u201cCA B-:\u201d the user enters the two digit code looked up in cable box model brand table, points the instant programmer  at the cable box (converter) and presses ENTER key . The red warning light emitting diode  will flash while it is sending a test signal to the cable box. If the cable box changed to Channel 09: then the user presses SAVE key ; however, if the cable box did not change to Channel 09 the user presses ENTER key  again and waits until red warning light emitting diode  stops flashing, while the next possible code is sent. This is repeated until the cable box changes to Channel 09 and when it does the user presses SAVE key . If the display shows \u201cEND\u201d then the user has tried all possible cable box codes for that brand. If so, the user presses cable code 00 and then ENTER key  to try all possible brand's codes, one at a time.","For some people (probably because they have cable or satellite), the channels listed in their television guide or calendar are different from the channels on their television or cable. If they are different, the user proceeds as follows. First, the user presses the CH key . The display will look like this: \u201cGuide CH TV CH\u201d. Then the user presses the channel printed in the television guide or calendar (for example, press 02 for channel 2), and then the user presses the channel number that the printed channel is received on through his\/her local cable company. Then the user presses ENTER key . This is repeated for each channel listing that is on a different channel than the printed channel. When this procedure is finished the user presses SAVE key .","Typically the television guide or calendar in the area will have a chart indicating the channel number that has been assigned to each Cable and broadcast channel, for example: HBO, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. This chart would correspond, for example, to the left two columns of FIG. . For example, suppose the television guide or calendar has assigned channel 14 to HBO but the user's cable company delivers HBO on channel 18. Since the channel numbers are different, the user needs to use the CH key . The user will press the CH button (the two blank spaces under the display \u201cGuide CH\u201d will flash). The user then presses 14. (now the two blank spaces under the display \u201cTV CH\u201d will flash). The user then presses 18 and then ENTER key . This is repeated for each channel that is different. When finished, the user presses SAVE key .","After the channel settings have been saved, the user may review the settings by pressing CH key  and then REVIEW key . By repeated pressing of the REVIEW key  each of the set channels will scroll onto the display, one at a time.","Then the user can test to make sure that the location of the instant programmer  is a good one. First, the user makes sure that the VCR is turned \u201cOFF\u201d but plugged in and makes sure that the cable box (if there is one) is left \u201cON\u201d. Then the user can press the TEST key . If there is only a VCR, then if the VCR turned \u201cON\u201d, changed to channel 09 and started recording, and then turned \u201cOFF\u201d, then the VCR controller is located in a good place.","If there is also a cable box, then if the VCR turned \u201cON\u201d, the cable box turned to channel 09 and the VCR started recording, and then the VCR stopped and turned \u201cOFF\u201d, then the instant programmer  is located in a good place.","To operate the instant programmer , the VCR should be left OFF and the cable box ON. The user looks up in the television guide the compressed code for the program, which he\/she wishes to record. The compressed code  is listed in the television guide, as shown in . The television guide\/calendar that would be used with this embodiment would have the same elements as shown on  except that element  of  is not required. The compressed code  for the program selected by the user is entered into the instant programmer  by using the number keys  and then the user selects how often to record the program. The user presses the ONCE key  to record the program once at the scheduled time, or the user presses the WEEKLY key  to record the program every week at the same scheduled time until cancelled or the user presses the DAILY (M-F) key  to record the program each day Monday through Friday at the same scheduled time until cancelled. This is most useful for programs such as soapbox operas that air daily, but not on the weekend. To confirm the entry, the instant programmer  will immediately decode the compressed code and display the date, channel and start time of the program entered by the user. The length of the entered program is also displayed by time bars  that run across the bottom of the display. Each bar represents one hour (or less) of program.","Then the user just needs to leave the instant programmer  near the VCR and cable box so that commands can be transmitted, and at the right time, the instant programmer  will turn \u201cON\u201d the VCR, change to the correct channel and record the program and then turn the VCR \u201cOFF\u201d. The user must just make sure to insert a blank tape.","The REVIEW key  allows the user to step through the entered programs. These are displayed in chronological order, by date and time. Each time the REVIEW key  is pressed, the next program is displayed, until \u201cEND\u201d is displayed, when all the entered programs have been displayed. If the REVIEW key  is pressed again the display will return to the current date and time.","If the user wishes to cancel a program, then the user presses REVIEW key  until the program to cancel is displayed, then the user presses CANCEL key . The display will say \u201cCANCELLED\u201d. Also, any time the user presses a wrong number, pressing the CANCEL key  will allow the user to start over.","Certain television programs, such as live sports, may run over the scheduled time slot. To ensure that the entire program is recorded, the user may press the ADD TIME key  to increase the recording length, even while the program is being recorded. The user presses the REVIEW key  to display the program, then presses ADD TIME key . Each time ADD TIME key  is pressed, 15 minutes is added to the recording length.","When the current time and date is displayed, the amount of blank tape needed for the next 24 hours is also displayed by the time bars  that run across the bottom of the display. Each bar represents one hour (or less) of tape. The user should check this before leaving the VCR unattended to ensure that there is enough blank tape.","Each time a program code is entered, the instant programmer  automatically checks through all the entries to ensure that there is no overlap in time between the program entries. If the user attempts to enter a program that overlaps in time with a program previously entered, then the message \u201cCLASH\u201d appears. Then, as summarized by step  of , the user has the following options: 1) if the user wishes to leave the program previously entered and forget about the new one, the user does nothing and after a short time delay, the display will return to show the current time and date; 2) if the user wishes the program which starts first to be recorded to its end, and then to record the remainder of the second program, then the user presses ONCE key , DAILY (M-F) key , or WEEKLY key  again (whichever one the user pushed to enter the code). If the programs have the same starting time, then the program most recently entered will be recorded first. If on being notified of the \u201cCLASH\u201d, the user decides the new program is more important than the previously entered program, then the user can cancel the previously entered program and then re-enter the new one.","In some locations, such as in some parts of Colorado, the cable system airs some channels three (3) hours later\/earlier than the times listed in the local television guide. This is due to time differences depending on whether the channel is received on a east or west satellite feed. For the user to record the program 3 hours later than the time listed in the television guide the procedure is as follows. First the user enters the code for the program and then presses SAVE key  (for +) and then presses ONCE key , DAILY (M-F) key , or WEEKLY key , as desired. For the user to record the program 3 hours earlier than the time listed in the television guide the procedure is as follows. First the user enters the code for the program and then presses ENTER key  (for \u2212) and then presses ONCE key , DAILY (M-F) key , or WEEKLY key , as desired. The instant programmer  will display the time that the program will be recorded, not the time shown in the television guide.","There are certain display messages to make the instant programmer  more user friendly. The display \u201cLO BATT\u201d indicates that the batteries need replacement. \u201cErr: ENTRY\u201d indicates an invalid entry during setup. \u201cErr: CODE\u201d indicates that the program code number entered is not a valid number. If this is displayed the user should check the television guide and reenter the number. \u201cErr: DATE\u201d indicates the user may have: tried to select a daily recording (Monday to Friday) for a Saturday or Sunday program; tried to select weekly or daily recording for a show more than 7 days ahead, because the instant programmer  only allows the weekly or daily recording option to be used for the current weeks' programs (+7 days); or tried to enter a program that has already ended. \u201cFULL\u201d indicates that the stack storage of the programs to be recorded, which is implemented in random access memory (RAM) inside the instant programmer  has been filled. The user could then cancel one or more programs before entering new programs. \u201cEMPTY\u201d indicates there are no programs entered to be recorded.

If the embodiment of  is used, the computer downloads, through microphone assembly  in either manner described above in connection with the custom programmer and shown in , all of the necessary IR codes into RAM  at the addresses associated with the buttons on the keyboard  according to the consumer's expressed wishes. If this method is used, no IR codes need be stored in the ROM of the custom controller when it is manufactured.","If the embodiment of  is used, the ROM  installed into the custom controller at manufacture is programmed with the IR codes of many different brands, models and types of home electronic devices. In this case, the computer downloads, through microphone assembly , the addresses of the ROM for all of the necessary IR codes into RAM  instead of downloading the IR codes themselves.","In an alternative embodiment the ROM  contains default associations between IR codes and buttons of the custom controller, so that these associations need not be downloaded unless the consumer has requested associations between buttons and IR codes that are different from the default associations. This method reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent over the telephone lines from the remote site to the custom controller, but can increase the size and cost of the ROM installed in the custom controller. In the rare case where the IR codes for the device that the consumer wants to control are not included in the ROM, the computer would just download the IR codes themselves for that device as in the first programming method described above with reference to .","It is noted above that in either of the embodiments shown in , the microphone and decoding assemblies from either  or  may be used. Preferably, the microphone and decoding assembly in  is used as it is less expensive than the assembly in  that uses a DTMF decoder . The system shown in  utilizes just two single frequency signals rather than many dual frequency signals as in a DTMF system. The first signal, a tone of approximately 3000 Hz, is used to signify a binary \u201cone\u201d and the second signal, a tone of approximately 500 Hz, is used to signify \u201czero.\u201d Since a 500 Hz signal is being used in this embodiment, the bandwidth of the 1000-5000 Hz high pass filter  from  will have to be broadened to include 500 Hz when included in the microphone and decoder assembly .","A series of these two tones are transmitted over the telephone line, representing a binary series. A short period of no signal is included between each tone in the series of tones so that two consecutive 500 Hz or two consecutive 3000 Hz signals are interpreted as two sequential signals and not one long signal. In an alternative embodiment, the series of signal tones are sent at a predetermined clock speed.","A decoder (not shown) is included between the microphone assembly  and the microprocessor  that converts the 3000 Hz signals to high electrical signals and converts the 500 Hz signals to low electrical signals that are sent to a serial input into the microprocessor. A clock signal is simultaneously sent to the microprocessor with each high or low signal.","Alternatively, the initial set-up programmer  could be used to perform the IR code programming of the custom controller  instead of using the microphone\/telephone interface.","The custom controller has several additional features. First, the rear surface  of the custom controller is large enough so that custom controller can be set on the rear surface as shown in  and resist tipping over. The advantage of being able to stand the custom controller in this upright position is that IR transmitters  are then at a substantial height above the surface on which the custom controller is set. This lessens the probability that pillows, newspapers, magazines or other debris will be inadvertently placed on top of the custom controller as it will be difficult for debris to balance on the top of the custom controller when while in the upright position. Further, stacks of pillows, magazines and other debris placed next to the custom controller must be rather high before they will block the IR transmissions of the custom controller. This feature is extremely important because, unlike the instant programmer which can have a permanent holder next to the cable box and VCR, away from magazines and pillows, the custom controller, having full universal remote capabilities, is designed to be used some distance away from the video equipment. Yet, to function properly as an automatic video recorder controller, the IR transmitters of the custom controller need to have a direct line of sight to the IR receivers of the video equipment to be controlled.","The degree of enlargement of the rear surface  needs to be enough so that the custom controller is stable and resistant to being tipped over when it is put in the upright position shown in . Determining an acceptable size of rear portion is based on several factors. First, it usually desirable for the length and the width of the rear surface to be approximately equal. If the length is significantly greater than the width (as is the case with traditional prior art universal remote controls), the controller can be easily tipped over along the axes that span the width of the rear surface. Next, the proportion of the height of the controller to the length and width of the rear surface cannot be too great. A ratio of the length of the rear face to the height of the controller and of the width of the rear face to the height of the controller of approximately 3 to 1 or less is usually sufficient. However, this ratio depends on the uniformity of the density of the custom controller and thus the center of gravity. If the upper portions of the custom controller (when it is in the upright position) are more dense than the lower portions, the center of gravity will be high and the ratio of the width and length of the rear surface will need to be reduced. On the other hand, if the lower portions are more dense, the center of gravity will be lower and the ratio can be safely increased. One way the center of gravity is lowered in the custom controller is by placing the batteries , which are comparatively very dense, very near the rear surface.","Another factor in the stability of the custom controller in the lateral location of the custom controller's center of gravity. The closer the center of gravity is to being directly above the center of the rear surface when the custom controller is in the upright position, the more stable the custom controller will be. It is noted that the upper portion of embodiment of the custom controller shown in  is off center. This moves the center of gravity away from the center of rear surface slightly, but adds to the aesthetic appearance of the custom controller.","The shape of the rear surface is not particularly relevant, but rather the shortest distance across the rear surface. On the other hand, the shape of the back surface of the custom controller is significant. Preferably, the back surface is semicircular or substantially semicircular. The closer the back surface is to a semicylindrical shape, the more comfortable the custom controller is for a consumer to hold, as the cylindrical shape fits better into human hands.","Another feature of the custom controller is its two control surfaces  and . Auxiliary control surface  is designed to include buttons that will be used most often when the custom controller is in its upright position, such as volume up and down controls. The angle between the rear surface and the auxiliary control surface is less than or equal to 450. Keeping the angle less than or equal to 450 directs at least half of the force needed to press button on the auxiliary control surface downwards into the table or other surface the custom controller is resting on instead of sideways, which would tend to topple the custom controller when it is in the upright position.","Two alternative embodiments of the custom controller  are shown in  and . These controllers include control faces that are at angles from the rear face of less than or equal to 450, substantially circular bottom faces and rear faces that are larger relative to prior art remote controls.","Yet another feature of the custom controller are one touch channel tuning buttons. These buttons would be assigned to a specific television or cable channel such as HBO, ESPN, CNN or MTV. For example, if a button is assigned to CNN, when the CNN button is pressed, the custom controller transmits IR codes to change the channel on a television, VCR, cable box or satellite receiver to the channel number on which CNN is broadcast. When the consumer sets up the custom controller, he or she tells the representative what channels he or she watches the most and the representative directs the computer to have selected keys on the custom controller be programmed to tune these channels. The consumer tells the representative which keys on the custom controller he or she wishes to tune which channels or the representative can select the keys. After the keys and channels have been selected, the consumer then writes the channel names next to the keys that tune them or labels with different channel names can be supplied which are then applied to the custom controller next to the appropriate buttons. These one touch tuning buttons are particularly well suited to being programmed as buttons on the auxiliary control surface, so that the consumer can operate these buttons without having to pick up the custom controller.","Another embodiment, shown in  is an alternative embodiment to the embodiment shown in . An initial setup routine must be performed on the VCR in the embodiment in  similar to that that must be performed on the instant programmer . This consists of entering, into the VCR, the local channel map, the current time and an identification of the cable box, television or satellite receiver that is to be controlled by the VCR. In the embodiment of , this initial setup is performed manually by the user in the same manner as for the instant programmer by pressing a series of keys on either the VCR itself or the television remote control  used to control VCR. In this embodiment shown in , the television remote control from  is replaced with an auto-programming VCR remote control  (\u201cVCR remote\u201d). The VCR remote includes a CPU , RAM , ROM , keyboard  and an IR transmitter  that are typical for IR remote control units. Further, the VCR remote includes a microphone  and an audio signal decoder . The microphone and decoder can be either of the embodiments  or - shown in . As with the custom controller described above, however, the decoders - in  in  are preferred as the more economical embodiment.","In the preferred embodiment, the alternative VCR remote  is a also a universal remote such as custom controller  with all of the structure and functions of the custom controller. Thus, the VCR remote is capable of controlling the cable box , VCR , television  and any other auxiliary home electronic equipment that is IR remote controllable .","A significant advantage of the VCR remote control is that the data required to be entered into the VCR  for the initial setup can initially be downloaded from a remote site by telephone to the VCR remote control. To do this, the consumer calls the remote site in the telephone, orally gives the information necessary to perform the initial setup to a person at the remote site. The person at the remote site then instructs the consumer to place the microphone of the VCR remote to the telephone earpiece and the initial setup is downloaded. Thereafter, the user easily causes the data to be downloaded by IR transmission, from the VCR remote control to the VCR itself by pressing a \u201csend\u201d key or a \u201csend\u201d sequence of keys. The VCR receives the initial setup data, stores it in its memory  and then is ready to be used as an instant programmer.","In an alternative embodiment, shown in , the structural elements of the custom programmer  shown in , including a microphone  and decoding assembly , are be embedded within a VCR  instead of embedding the structural elements of the instant programmer  into the VCR as shown in . In this embodiment, the user would hold the earpiece of their telephone  to the microphone embedded in the VCR to download the initial setup data directly from the remote site into the VCR. The difficulty with this embodiment is that often a user's VCR and telephone are not located close enough together to position the telephone earpiece near the VCR. Further, correction of this problem, which would involve adding an extension cord to the telephone or disconnecting and relocating the VCR nearer the telephone are not convenient.","In another embodiment, shown in , the microphone in the VCR with custom programmer embedded is replaced with a modular phone jack  that leads directly to the decoder assembly  in the VCR. A standard telephone line  would then connect the VCR to a modular T-connector  so that both the VCR and an independent telephone  are connected to the telephone line . The consumer then uses the telephone to call and talk to the remote site, but the data is transmitted directly to the VCR. The transfer of data by this method may be more accurate than transmission by audible tones. However, this embodiment suffers from the same problem of the proximity of the consumer's phone outlets to the VCR.","With the embodiment shown in , though, the proximity of the VCR to a consumer's telephone or telephone jack are not important. The consumer simply carries the remote to his or her phone and gets the initial setup data downloaded into the VCR remote. The consumer then carries the remote to a location near the VCR and downloads the initial setup data to the VCR.","Another embodiment, shown in , is to install a modular jack  into the VCR remote . In this embodiment, the VCR remote is connected to the telephone by a T-connector  and operates in the same way as the VCR with a built in modular jack described above and shown in  except that after the initial setup data is transferred to the VCR remote, the VCR remote is placed near the VCR and the initial setup data is downloaded by IR transmission to the VCR. One advantage that this embodiment has over the VCR with a built in modular jack is that the VCR remote can be taken to the telephone whereas the VCR may be located far from the telephone. It is also possible to add a DTMF generator to the VCR remote so that the keypad  of the VCR remote can be used to dial the telephone number of the remote site. Alternatively, telephone numbers for the remote site are stored in the memory of the VCR remote so that the consumer may dial the remote site by pressing a minimum number of keys.","The details of the operation of the VCR remote are as follows. In the first step, shown in block  of , the consumer places a telephone call on either an ,  or normal toll call line to a customer service representative. In block , the representative inquires from the consumer information necessary to perform the initial setup, such as the consumer's ZIP code or the name of the consumer's cable company, the television guide that consumer uses, the brand and model of the consumer's cable box (it is sometimes possible to deduce this data from the ZIP code or cable company name data) and the brand and model of the consumer's VCR. As with the initial setup of the custom programmer, the channel map and cable box IR codes can be determined from this data. If the VCR remote control is also a universal remote control, the representative inquires as to the brands and models of any other IR controllable home electronic equipment that the consumer may wish to control with the VCR remote control.","Once the channel map and IR code data to be downloaded have been identified in block , the initial setup data, including the channel map, IR code data and the current time, including the date, is downloaded over the telephone line to the VCR remote control. In the preferred embodiment, the initial setup data is generated by a computer at or connected to the representative's location, transmitted over telephone lines in the form of audio signals, received by the VCR remote control's microphone or modular phone jack and decoder, and stored into RAM  by CPU .","In block , the consumer presses a \u201csend\u201d key or a sequence of keys that triggers the transmission of the initial setup data through the IR transmitter to the VCR's IR receiver. If the VCR remote control is a universal remote, the IR codes for IR controllable devices other than the cable box are preferably not be transmitted to the VCR as they are used by the VCR remote control itself, not the VCR. The data is stored by the VCR's CPU into the VCR's RAM.","In an alternative embodiment, the VCR remote control's IR transmitter is not a multi-directional or wide angle IR transmitter. The more expensive multi-directional or wide angle IR transmitters are not necessary because the IR transmitter is not used to transmit IR signals when the VCR remote control is set on a table or on top of the cable box or VCR.","In any case, in the preferred embodiment, a multi-directional or wide angle IR transmitter is retained to increase the likelihood of the successful downloading of all of the initial setup data. Although the quantity of the initial setup data is not tremendous, it is substantial. Thus, an uninterrupted IR stream of a significant duration is required to reach the VCR from the VCR remote control. The more diverse the radiation of IR signals is, the more likely it is that all of a stream of IR signals will reach the IR receiver in the VCR, either directly or by reflection.","For preexisting VCRs with a built in instant programmer and IR transmitter that were made before the present VCR remote control, that can also have their initial setup performed through the use of a remote control, the VCR remote control can be programmed, either with a program stored in ROM at manufacture or by telephone into RAM, to use the preexisting VCRs own protocol for initial setup using a remote control. In other words, the VCR remote control is programmed to mimic a consumer using the VCR's original remote control to perform the initial setup.","In VCRs designed specifically for use with the VCR remote control, a special protocol, designed to reduce the length of the IR transmission sent to the VCR is used. In an alternative embodiment, part of this special protocol includes using a receipt confirmation signal combined with known error detection and\/or error correction schemes to assure the reception of the entire stream of initial setup data by the VCR. Known error detection schemes that can be used include a using parity check bit in every byte of data and embedding a code at some point in the data stream that indicates the length of the entire data stream. The use of these and other known error detection and correction schemes allows the VCR to verify whether the complete stream of error free initial setup data was received. If it is verified that the data received is correct and complete, the VCR can produce an indication, either audio or visual, that the initial setup data was successfully received. If it is not verified that the data received is correct and complete, the VCR either gives no indication or produces a second indication to indicate an unsuccessful transmission. Upon an unsuccessful transmission, the consumer adjusts the position of the VCR remote control relative to the VCR and retransmits the initial setup data.","Another alternative is to provide modular telephone jacks in both the VCR and the VCR remote control for downloading the initial setup data from the VCR remote control to the VCR. This embodiment provides for more error free transmission of the initial setup data, but forces the consumer to connect, disconnect and store the cable that links the VCR remote control and the VCR.","Yet another alternative is to include in the VCR a microphone and decoder assembly similar to the microphone and decoder assembly - in the VCR remote control. An encoder and speaker (not shown) are then added to the VCR remote control. With this alternative embodiment the initial setup data is transmitted from the VCR remote control to the VCR using the same type of audio signals as used to download the initial setup data over the telephone lines to the VCR remote control. When the consumer is ready to transmit the initial setup data from the VCR remote control to the VCR, he or she simply holds up the speaker of the VCR remote control to the microphone of the VCR and pressed the keys necessary to trigger transmission. In the preferred embodiment of this alternative, with current speaker and microphone technology, the speaker and microphone on the VCR remote control can be combined into a single microphone\/speaker component.","In the downloading process of blocks -, the channel map data and IR code data for the VCR is transmitted and stored into the RAM of the VCR remote control first. Thereafter the data is retransmitted to the VCR and stored into the RAM of the VCR. After transmission to the VCR of the channel map data and IR code data for the VCR is completed, the channel map and IR code data for the VCR is erased from the RAM in the VCR remote control. If IR code data for use by the VCR remote itself is initially downloaded with the channel map data and IR code data for the VCR, this data is, of course, not erased from the RAM in the VCR remote control.","As described above in reference to the custom controller , shown in  and particularly , the IR codes for control of the cable box and other remote controllable electronic equipment that are downloaded over a telephone line to the video recorder, either directly or via a VCR remote, are stored in different ways in different alternative embodiments. Thus, IR codes for numerous cable boxes and other devices can be stored in the ROMs of the video recorder and the VCR remote with the addresses of the IR codes for a particular cable box or other device being downloaded to the RAM of the video recorder or VCR remote. Alternatively, the IR codes themselves can be downloaded to the RAM of the video recorder or VCR remote.","The invention as shown in the various embodiments of the VCR remote  can be readily be used with televisions, cable boxes, satellite receivers or other audio-visual components that contain remote control transmitters. The only differences in operation in these alternate configurations are the IR codes and downloading. protocols that the VCR remote uses. However, the VCR remote as described above is capable of having these codes and protocols downloaded by telephone along with the initial setup data.","In all of the embodiments presented in  and the accompanying description, the example given of the type of data being downloaded to the custom programmer , initial setup programmer , custom controller , VCR with built in IR transmitter and direct telephone input () and VCR remote  (collectively, the \u201ctelephone downloadable programmers\u201d) is initial setup data. This initial setup data includes IR codes or IR code addresses for the remote control of other electronic equipment, local channel maps and the current time. In an alternative embodiment to all of the telephone downloadable programmers, shown in , in addition to initial setup data, data representing programs that are desired to be recorded or viewed may be downloaded to the various telephone downloadable programmers. For any of the telephone downloadable programmers, the downloaded data representing a program to be recorded is in the form of the actual values of the channel, date, time-of-day and length of the program. Alternatively, for those telephone downloadable programmers that also perform the functions of the instant programmer , the data downloaded, representing a program to be recorded or viewed, is in the form of a compressed code or G-code, which contains the channel, date, time-of-day and length of the program.","The physical configuration of this embodiment for downloading program information is shown in .  shows a flow diagram of the process of selecting and downloading program information according to this embodiment. In block , the user calls a customer service representative  located at a remote site on the telephone, either on a pay-per-minute or pay-per-call 900 number, toll-free 800 number or regular toll number. In block , the user orally tells the representative either specific shows that the user wants to record or a more general description of a type of show to be recorded or viewed. Such general descriptions include the type of show, such as situation comedies, dramas, action shows, mysteries, police or detective shows, real life rescue, emergency or police shows, game shows, news magazines, daily news programs, documentaries, sports events, movies, etc. The general descriptions further include more specific descriptions such as movies or shows starring a particular actor or actress or directed by a certain director (e.g. \u201call Humphrey Bogart movies\u201d), sporting events involving a particular team and\/or a particular sport (e.g. \u201call U.C.L.A. basketball games\u201d), a show that may be on multiple times a week on different channels (e.g., \u201call episodes of \u2018I Love Lucy\u2019 on this week\u201d).","In block , the representative enters the information given by the user in block  into a computer . The computer includes a large database of television programs to be broadcast in the future, stored in mass storage , such as a hard disk. The computer then searches the database for television programs that match the information entered by the representative and retrieves the channel, date, time-of-day and length data for each program matching the information entered. In block , the computer automatically checks the date, time-of-day and length data for all the programs retrieved in the database search for time conflicts between programs that overlap each other.","If there is a time conflict, the computer alerts the representative that there is a time conflict and the programs that are involved. In block , the representative informs the user of the time conflict and the programs that are conflicting. The user then decides which of the conflicting programs he or she wishes to record or view. Alternatively, the user chooses to have only the non-conflicting portion of a program that partially conflicts with another program recorded or viewed to avoid the conflict. For example, if two programs are selected that both begin at 8:00 pm on Sunday, but one lasts one hour and the other lasts two hours, the user can choose to record the one hour program and the second hour of the two hour program. The user tells the representative how to resolve the conflict and, in block , the representative enters this information into the computer, which adjusts the selected programs accordingly, in block .","In one embodiment, in block , the computer converts the channel, date, time-of-day and length of each of the programs remaining after the search of the database and after resolving time conflicts, if any, into G-codes for use by downloadable programmers that perform the functions of the instant programmer . Such a programmer is representatively shown by dotted line  with the programmer  having a CPU , a microphone and high pass filter  (similar to programmer  as shown in ), a random access memory (RAM) , which includes a stack memory for storing the CDTL information, and a ROM . In block , the computer downloads the G-codes over a telephone line to a telephone downloadable programmer  that performs the functions of the instant programmer .","In another embodiment, the blocks  and  are replaced by a block (not shown) in which the computer downloads data representing the channel, date, time-of-day and length of each of the programs selected by the search of the database and modified to resolve time conflicts, if any, over a telephone line to any telephone downloadable programmer, such as programmer .","After program data is downloaded to a telephone downloadable programmer, and decoded into channel, date, time-of-day and length if G-codes were downloaded, the CDTL data is stored into the memory of any of the telephone downloadable programmers, such as stack memory of RAM , in the same manner such program data is stored into the stack memory  of , of the instant programmer  after it is decoded from a G-code as described above. After the program data is stored in memory, the control of the recording of the programs according to this data is performed in same manner as performed by the various telephone downloadable programmers described above.","In an alternative embodiment, the program data is downloaded to the telephone downloadable programmers for control of a television or cable box only, rather than for control of a video recorder. With this embodiment, the user is able to use a telephone downloadable programmer to simply change the channel of his or her television or cable box to assure that an important show is not missed because the user forgets what time it is or becomes engrossed in another show or simply because the user does not want to bother having to change channels manually.","The format of the database file to store the great amount of information about the future television broadcasts of television programs and the database program used to manipulate and search the database file can be any well known database format and corresponding database engine. In the preferred embodiment, the database format used consists of a series of records, each consisting of a predetermined set of fields that is the same as the set of fields in every other record in the database. Each television program corresponds to one record of the database. Each record contains fields for the title, channel, date, starting time-of-day and the length of the program. Further, each record includes a series of boolean fields, each field representing a certain category of television program, such as situation comedy, romantic movie, sports program, etc. The advantage of this embodiment is that many different categories may be easily represented and searched, while taking up little space. This embodiment takes up little space because even though there may be over a hundred different category fields, a boolean field usually takes up only one bit or at most one byte of space for each record in most database file formats. The small size of each category field also facilitates rapid searching through the database for all the programs in a certain category. This embodiment also allows for multiple overlapping categories. For example, the database may have separate category fields for crime subject matter, comedy, and fiction. One television program may be a fictional comedy about crime, thus containing a \u201ctrue\u201d value in all three category fields. On the other hand, a program may be a real life drama about crime which only would contain a \u201ctrue\u201d value in one of these category fields, viz. the crime subject matter field.","In addition to the boolean category fields, each record includes several \u201cpeople\u201d fields. The contents of the \u201cpeople\u201d fields include characters in the program, actors and actresses, directors and writers involved with the creation of the program. Thus, if a user desires to program all programs involving certain people, be they characters, actors or creators of the program, the computer can search the \u201cpeople\u201d fields for this information. Alternatively, there can be separate fields for characters, actors and actresses, and creators of programs.","Each record also includes fields devoted to the violence and sexual content of the television program. In the case of motion pictures, a field for the rating by the Motion Picture Association is utilized. In every record, boolean fields for such descriptions as mild violence, explicit violence, brief nudity, nudity, profanity, adult situations, and sexual theme are included. Thus, programs can be selected or excluded from a search based on such general content information.","Each record of the database also includes an abstract that contains a brief description of the program. This allows a more detailed and extensive search, albeit more time consuming, of specific program content by searching all of the abstract fields for certain keywords or combinations of keywords.","It is thought that the system and method of telephone downloading television program data according to selection criteria provided by a user to a representative at a remote site of the present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of the parts thereof without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the form hereinbefore described being merely a preferred or exemplary embodiment thereof."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED
