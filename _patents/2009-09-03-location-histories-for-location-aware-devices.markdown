title: Location histories for location aware devices
abstract: A location aware mobile device can include a baseband processor for communicating with one or more communication networks, such as a cellular network or WiFi network. In some implementations, the baseband processor can collect network information (e.g., transmitter IDs) over time. Upon request by a user or application, the network information can be translated to estimated position coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude) of the location aware device for display on a map view or for other purposes. A user or application can query the location history database with a timestamp or other query to retrieve all or part of the location history for display in a map view.

For example, a mobile phone provides telephony services, a personal digital assistant (PDA) provides a way to organize addresses, contacts and notes, a media player plays content, email devices provide email communication, etc. Modern mobile devices can include two or more of these applications. Due to the size limitation of a typical mobile device, such mobile devices may need to rely on a network or other remote service to support these multiple applications. For example, a map service may provide maps to a mobile device over a network, which can be used with one or more applications running on the mobile device. The introduction of a positioning system integrated with, or coupled to, the mobile device provides additional opportunities for providing location-based services.","Modern positioning systems include satellite based positioning systems, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network positioning based on \u201ccell IDs\u201d and WiFi positioning technology based on a WiFi networks. The satellite based positioning systems tend to be the most accurate. These satellite systems, however, often consume more power than the other positioning systems, and rely on the visibility of multiple satellites to determine a position estimate.","A location aware mobile device can include a baseband processor for communicating with one or more communication networks, such as a cellular network or WiFi network. In some implementations, the baseband processor can collect network information over time. The network information can be converted to estimated position coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude) of the location aware device. The position coordinates can be stored in a location history database on the location aware device or made accessible on a network. A user or application can query the location history database with a timestamp or other query to retrieve all or part of the location history for display in a map view. In some implementations, the size and \u201cfreshness\u201d of the location history database can be managed by eliminating duplicate entries in the database and\/or removing older entries. The location history can be used to construct a travel timeline for the location aware device. The travel timeline can be displayed in a map view or used by location aware applications running on the location aware device or on a network. In some implementations, an Application Programming Interface (API) can be used by an application to query the location history database.","In some implementations, the location history can allow users to tag photos or other content taken by a device and to synchronize the content with the location history using timestamps. This can allow the user to augment a travel timeline with the content, for example.","In some implementations, the network information can include transmitter identifiers (IDs). For example, Cell IDs can be tracked and recorded. The Cell IDs can be mapped to corresponding cell tower locations which can be used to provide estimated position coordinates of the location aware device. When a location history is requested by a user or application (e.g., through an API), the transmitter IDs can be translated to position coordinates of the location aware device which can be reverse geocoded to map locations for display on a map view or for other purposes. In other implementations, the network information can include WiFi scan data (e.g., access point IDs) which can be used to determine position coordinates of the location aware device, which can be reverse geocoded for display on a map view. In some implementations, the network information can be sent to a network server, which can translate the network information into position coordinates, which can be returned to the location aware device for processing by a location aware application.","In some implementations, other information related to various events can be recorded by the location aware device and associated with the location history. The other information can be displayed or otherwise made accessible to a user in a map view or other application. The other information and location history can be part of a personal \u201cjournal\u201d for the user, which can be queried at a later time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","114","110","104","108","106","114","108"]},"Location aware device  can be any device capable of determining its current geographic location by communicating with a positioning system, such as GPS, cellular networks, WiFi networks, and any other technology that can be used to provide the actual or estimated location of a location aware device . Some examples of location aware devices include but are not limited to: a handheld computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, a network appliance, a camera, a smart phone, an enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS) mobile phone, a network base station, a media player, a navigation device, an email device, a game console, or a combination of any two or more of these data processing devices or other data processing devices. Location aware device  can include storage device  (e.g., flash memory, hard disk) for storing location history database (DB) .","Location server  can include one or more server computers operated by a location service provider. Location server  can deliver location information to location aware device .","In some implementations, location aware device  collects and stores network information associated with transmitter detection events. The network information can include a transmitter identifier (ID) of a detected transmitter and a timestamp marking a time of the transmitter detection event. Some examples of transmitter IDs include but are not limited to Cell IDs provided by cell tower transmitters in a cellular communications network (e.g., transmitters on GSM masts) and access point transmitter IDs (e.g., a Media Access Control (MAC) address). A wireless access point (AP) can be a hardware device or a computer's software that acts as a communication hub for users of a wireless device to connect to a wired LAN.","A sequence of transmitter IDs can be correlated with known geographic locations of corresponding transmitters. The geographic locations of the transmitters can be used to compute estimated position coordinates (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude) for location aware device  over a period of time, resulting in a location history for location aware device . For example, a sequence of transmitter IDs can be compared with a reference database (e.g., Cell ID database, WiFi reference database) that maps or correlates the transmitter IDs to position coordinates of corresponding transmitters, and computes estimated position coordinates for location aware device  based at least in part on the position coordinates of the corresponding transmitters. If a reference database is available on location aware device , then the mapping can be performed by a processor of location aware device . Alternatively, the transmitter IDs can be sent to location server  which can store transmitter position coordinates in a remote reference database in storage device . Location server  can map or correlate transmitter IDs to position coordinates of corresponding transmitters which can be sent back to location aware device  through network  and one or more wireless communication links. The position coordinates can be reverse geocoded to map locations (e.g., street locations). The map locations can be represented by markers (e.g., pushpin icons) on a map view displayed by location aware device , or used for other purposes by location aware applications.","The position coordinates and associated timestamps can be stored in location history database  and\/or storage device  for subsequent retrieval and processing by a user or application. The position coordinates and timestamps can be used to construct a timeline in a map view showing a history of locations for location aware device . In some implementations, timestamps associated with the position coordinates can be used to query database  or a remote database on storage device  for location history data responsive to query from a user or application, as described in reference to .","In some implementations, location history database  can be correlated or related to other recorded data (e.g., related using a relational database). A data recording event occurs when data associated with an event is stored in location aware device  or on a network storage device (e.g., storage device ). Some examples of recorded data include but are not limited to: data associated with a picture taking event, data associated with a financial transaction, sensor output data, data associated with a communication event (e.g., receipt of phone call or instant message), data associated with a network event (e.g., a wired or wireless connection or disconnection with a network), etc.","In some implementations, recorded data, together with location history data and corresponding timestamps can be used to create and store a personal \u201cjournal\u201d for a user of location aware device . In example system , the recorded data or \u201cjournal\u201d can be stored on location aware device  or stored on storage device  by location server .","In some implementations, the recorded data can be displayed with corresponding location markers on a map view, as described in reference to . The data can be displayed in the map view or other user interface, and\/or a link (e.g., hypertext link) or other reference can be displayed with the marker to allow access to the recorded data.","In some implementations, the transmitter detection event data (e.g., transmitter IDs) are received while location aware device  is operating in a low power mode. A lower power mode can occur, for example, when satellite positioning receiver (e.g., a GPS receiver) of location aware device  is turned off to conserve power. In low power mode, a power efficient processor (e.g., a 3G baseband processor) can accumulate and store transmitter IDs for computing location history data. Baseband processors are used in radio-frequency (RF) subsystems, such as the RF subsystem  shown in . Baseband processors are used to transmit and receive radio signals in, for example, GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and EGPRS (Enhanced General Packet Radio Service) telecommunication devices, such as cellular mobile phones.","During reception of radio signals, the RF subsystem receives radio signals, converts the radio signals into baseband signals and sends the baseband signals to the baseband processor. Thereafter the baseband processor processes the received baseband signals and decodes various data, including transmitter IDs (e.g., Cell IDs). In many location aware mobile devices, a GPS receiver consumes significantly more power than a baseband processor. Thus, the collecting and storing of transmitter IDs can be achieved by a baseband processor without the high consumption of power associated with, for example, a GPS receiver.","Location histories can be computed from transmitter IDs collected with a low power baseband processor. The transmitter IDs can be used to reconstruct a location history timeline for display in a map view. The location history can be correlated or related to data from other recording events, allowing the data to be displayed or otherwise made accessible to a user in a map view application or other application. A sequence of locations traveled by location aware device  in the past can be displayed in a map view as a timeline, the span of which can be specified by a user or application generated query, as described in reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","102"]},"In some implementations, if the location aware device is in a low power or sleep mode () for a period of time, the location aware device can be configured to receive transmitter IDs () that are within communication range of the location aware device. The transmitter IDs can be collected on a scheduled basis (e.g., collected every 10 minutes) and\/or in response to a trigger event (e.g., whenever the user or an application requests location data).","In low power or sleep mode, a satellite positioning receiver (e.g., GPS receiver) may be powered down to conserve power or because there is an insufficient number of satellites available to compute a navigation solution (e.g., GPS receiver is operated indoors). In low power mode, the transmitter IDs can be collected by, for example, a baseband processor that often consumes less power than, for example, a GPS receiver. In some implementations, transmitter IDs can be collected even if the location aware device is operating in a normal power mode. This scenario could occur with location aware devices that do not include satellite positioning systems.","In some cases, the same transmitter ID may be received multiple times by the location aware device in a short period of time, potentially resulting in duplicate entries in the location history database. This could occur, for example, if the device remains stationary while in the vicinity of a transmitter. In such cases, duplicate entries can be detected and removed from the location history database. Referring to process , if a new transmitter ID is received (), and the location history database is not full (), then the transmitter ID and corresponding timestamp can be stored in the location history database (). In some implementations, if the transmitter ID was received in the past () and stored in the location history database, process  can update the timestamp of the entry () and return to step ().","If a new transmitter ID is received (), and the location history database is full (), the entry from the location history database can be removed from the location history database to make room for the new entry (). In this manner, step () ensures that the size and \u201cfreshness\u201d of the location history database can be managed. Any suitable database management policy can be implemented to determine which location entry to remove from the database. For example, in one implementation an \u201caging\u201d algorithm can be used to remove the oldest entry based on a comparison of timestamps. In another implementation, all or a portion of the location history database can be purged whenever the location aware device is powered down for a period of time. In some implementations, a user interface can be provided to a user of the location aware device which allows the user to manually purge the location history database.","In some implementations, a single accurate location (e.g., a single transmitter ID) or a smaller number of transmitter IDs representing a defined time span can be stored in the location history database to reduce the size of the location history database. For example, a week's worth of working and commuting to and from home can be represented by a single or small number of transmitter IDs since the route from home to work may not change during the work week. This option can be specified by the user through a user interface which allows the user to specify the frequency of transmitter ID recording and\/or specify periods of time where recording will or will not occur.","Other implementations may employ other means for reduction of the size of the location history database, such as various data compression techniques. For example, repetitive patterns of locations may be encoded as a shorter symbol or set of symbols within the database, and a look up table may be used to map the symbols to a set of locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","102","102","102","302","300","303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["305","102","305","304","116","332","310","312","314","316","318","320","322","324","326","116","328","330"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","102","402","402","102","402","402","410","412","414","416","418","414","412","418","402","412","416","414","402","418","414","402","402","418","418","402","402","430"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b ","a ","b "]},"Devices and can also establish communications by other means.

In some implementations, navigation service  can provide an online facility (e.g., a Web site) for users to share location histories or network information. Navigation service  can use the transmitter IDs to update or improve the accuracy of the reference database.","Messaging service  can, for example, provide e-mail and\/or other messaging services. Media service  can, for example, provide access to media files, such as song files, audio books, movie files, video clips, and other media data.
