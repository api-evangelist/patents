{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Sellers may offer their inventory for sale via multiple marketplaces. In other words, sellers may create sales listings in various marketplaces for a single physical inventory of the seller. These marketplaces may often rely on the updating of inventory levels by the seller. Accordingly, inaccurate inventory level data regarding seller inventory levels can result in processing of an order on behalf of the seller that cannot be fulfilled because the seller inventory has been exhausted, which can degrade a customer experience.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to determining a merchant's inventory levels for which real time or perfect information about the seller's inventory may be unavailable. Merchants, or sellers, may offer products for sale via many electronic marketplaces provided by various electronic commerce sites. These various marketplaces employed by sellers to generate sales can, in some cases, be operated by unrelated entities that do not exchange real time information about sales and\/or inventory levels. In prior art systems, as the inventory levels associated with a particular product of a seller are depleted, a risk arises that a marketplace may process an order from a purchaser when there is no available inventory to provide to the purchaser. Therefore, embodiments of the present disclosure can determine likely inventory levels of a seller based at least upon order history, historical order rates, and\/or other data regarding sales listings across the various marketplaces in which a seller may offer its inventory for sale. This reduces the likelihood that a marketplace facilitated by an embodiment of this disclosure will process an order from a purchaser when there is no available inventory from the seller's inventory to provide to the purchaser.","With reference to , shown is a networked environment  according to various embodiments. The depicted networked environment  illustrates one example of an implementation of a system according to an embodiment of the disclosure. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the disclosure can be implemented in various ways. The networked environment  includes at least one computing device , a third party marketplace system , and one or more clients  in communication over a network . The network  includes, for example, the Internet, intranets, extranets, wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wired networks, wireless networks, or other suitable networks, etc., or any combination of two or more such networks.","The computing device  may comprise, for example, a server computer or any other system providing computing capability. Alternatively, a plurality of computing devices  may be employed that are arranged, for example, in one or more server banks or computer banks or other arrangements. For example, a plurality of computing devices  together may comprise a cloud computing resource, a grid computing resource, and\/or any other distributed computing arrangement. Such computing devices  may be located in a single installation or may be distributed among many different geographical locations. For purposes of convenience, the computing device  is referred to herein in the singular. Even though the computing device is referred to in the singular, it is understood that a plurality of computing devices  may be employed in the various arrangements as described above. Additionally, the third party marketplace system  can also be implemented in one or more computing devices.","Various applications and\/or other functionality may be executed in the computing device  according to various embodiments. Also, various data is stored in a data store  that is accessible to the computing device . The data store  may be representative of a plurality of data stores as can be appreciated. The data stored in the data store , for example, is associated with the operation of the various applications and\/or functional entities described below.","The components executed on the computing device , for example, include an electronic commerce application , an inventory calculation application , and other applications, services, processes, systems, engines, or functionality not discussed in detail herein. The electronic commerce application  can facilitate an electronic commerce site associated with one or more retailers through which customers can purchase, rent, and\/or download products. To this end, the electronic commerce application  can process orders on behalf of customers and transmit network pages or other user interface elements that can be rendered on a client . Similarly, the electronic commerce application  can receive data from a client  pertaining to product selections, payment information, and other data necessary to effectuate an electronic commerce site.","The electronic commerce application  can also provide a marketplace in which sellers can create sales listings in which products are offered to users. To this end, the electronic commerce application  can track sales listings, inventories, orders, and other data on behalf of sellers. Additionally, the electronic commerce application  can provide user interfaces in which sellers can manage the various aspects of sales listings, inventory, and other data. The specific functionality and various implementations of an electronic commerce site should be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is not discussed in detail herein.","The inventory calculation application  is executed to determine inventory levels of various products that are offered for sellers in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application . In some embodiments, the inventory calculation application  can update inventory data in a data store that is associated with sellers. In another embodiment, the inventory calculation application  can operate as a service from which the electronic commerce application  requests data regarding inventory levels. As noted above, many sellers are multi-channel sellers in that they offer their inventories for sale in various marketplaces, including third party marketplaces outside the control of an operator of the electronic commerce application . While information about orders processed via the electronic commerce application  may be available, true real time information about the inventory levels of a seller may be unavailable, as orders against a seller's inventory may be placed via a third party marketplace. Therefore, to facilitate a scenario that includes multi-channel sellers where real time information about the seller's inventory is unavailable, or where inventory levels for the various products in the seller's inventory is otherwise not trustworthy, the inventory calculation application  can determine when the quantity of products in a seller inventory are reaching critical levels. In this way, the inventory calculation application  can reduce the likelihood that the electronic commerce application  will process an order for which, in reality, inventory is unavailable due to the imperfect nature of the information about the inventory of a multi-channel seller.","The inventory calculation application  can also execute a site connector  that can facilitate communication with an application programming interface (API)  provided by the third party marketplace system . The site connector  can facilitate retrieval of information about sales listings, orders, and other available data about the listings and\/or inventory of a seller from a third party marketplace site. In some embodiments, a third party marketplace system  can provide an API through which the site connector  can retrieve information about sales listings, order history, inventory, or other information related to a seller's inventory and\/or listings in a marketplace facilitated by the third party marketplace system . In other embodiments, the site connector  can extract, or \u201cscrape\u201d, content from web pages, network pages, or other user interfaces generated by the third party marketplace system  in which information about inventory and\/or sales listings is provided. In some embodiments, the third party marketplace system  can push inventory and\/or sales listing data associated with a seller to the site connector .","In some embodiments, the functionality of the inventory calculation application  and\/or site connector  may be included in the electronic commerce application . In other embodiments, the inventory calculation application  and\/or site connector  may be executed as a sub-module of the electronic commerce application , or as a separate, standalone application, etc. It should be understood that the depicted embodiment of an electronic commerce application , inventory calculation application  and\/or site connector  is but one example.","Also stored within the computing device  or otherwise accessible to the computing device  is a data store . The data store  may comprise, for example, a database or other type of data storage system. Stored within the data store  is seller data  as well as other data that can facilitate the functionality of the electronic commerce application  and\/or inventory calculation application . The seller data  can include information about sellers participating in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application . To this end, the seller data  can include account information related to a seller account that is necessary to facilitate the creation of sales listings, processing of orders, inventory management, and other functions related to this purpose.","In the depicted example, the seller data  can include inventory data  that contains information about inventory levels of various products that may be offered for sale by a seller via the electronic commerce application . Inventory data  can include information about various products, such as product identifiers, keywords, model number, or any other similar information. Additionally, the inventory data  can include a quantity associated with each of the products in a seller inventory. Inventory levels can be specified by a seller via a user interface provided by the electronic commerce application  and\/or inventory calculation application . For example, a seller can specify inventory levels of products that are associated with a single physical inventory from which orders across various marketplaces are drawn. The data store  can also include sales listings  associated with a seller account. Sales listings  can include information that is associated with listings created by various sellers that offer a particular product for sale to users of the electronic commerce application . Sales listings  can include pricing data for a product, shipping costs, and other terms that can be associated with a sales listing in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application . Seller data  can also include data about orders  associated with the various sellers participating in the marketplace. In other words, the orders  can comprise an order history associated with the seller.","In some embodiments, the electronic commerce application  can provide a user interface to a seller on a client device with which the seller can create, update, and\/or modify the various information about inventory, sales listings, and\/or orders. Additionally, the electronic commerce application  can create and\/or modify various information about sellers stored in the seller data . For example, the electronic commerce application  can process an order from a purchaser that is related to a sales listing of the seller. Accordingly, the electronic commerce application  can generate an entry in an order history associated with the seller as well as update inventory data  and listing data . As is described below, the inventory calculation application  can determine inventory levels of a seller from the various information in the data store  as well as data retrieved from third party marketplaces about sales listings associated with the seller.","The third party marketplace system  can include one or more computing devices that represent third party marketplaces in which a seller may create sales listings from which users may submit orders. Third party marketplaces can include other electronic commerce sites, auction sites, liquidation sites, or any type of marketplace where the seller can sell various products. In one embodiment, fulfillment of orders via the various marketplaces in which a seller participates can be drawn against a single physical inventory of the seller. As noted above, a third party marketplace system  may provide an API  with which the site connector  can interact to retrieve information about orders, sales listings, and other data about a particular seller. It should be appreciated that not all third party marketplace systems  may provide such an API , and that the depicted example third party marketplace system  is but one example. In some examples, an operator of a third party marketplace system  may not provide any means with which data about a seller can be retrieved. In some cases, a third party marketplace may actively block access to data about sellers. In other embodiments, a third party marketplace system  and the site connector  can communicate via electronic data interchange messages or other methods to communicate seller data as can be appreciated.","The client  is representative of a plurality of client devices that may be coupled to the network . The client  may comprise, for example, a processor-based system such as a computer system and\/or mobile device. Such computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a cellular telephone, set-top box, music players, web pads, tablet computer systems, game consoles, or other devices with like capability. The client  may be configured to execute various applications such as a browser  and\/or other applications. The browser  may be executed in a client , for example, to access and render network pages, such as web pages, or other network content served up by the inventory calculation application , the electronic commerce application  and\/or other systems. In some embodiments, the client  can execute an e-mail client  with which a user (e.g., a seller) can send and\/or receive electronic mail. It should be appreciated that a user may also interact with electronic mail services via the browser  as well. A client can also be configured to execute a special purpose application, such as a mobile application, which may include client side code that renders a user interface that includes data provided by another system.","Next, a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment  is provided. As noted above, the inventory calculation application  can determine current inventory levels as well as an expected inventory level associated with a seller by analyzing data related to inventory and\/or orders processed by the electronic commerce application  as well as via third party marketplaces. The inventory calculation application  can reduce the likelihood that the electronic commerce application  processes an order for which the seller does not possess an adequate inventory. Such a scenario is a risk with multi-channel sellers that may participate in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application  as well as one or more third party marketplaces. In one embodiment, the inventory calculation application  can interact with the data in the data store  regarding a seller's listings in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application , from which the inventory calculation application  can deduce changes in a seller inventory on a substantially real time basis. In one example, the electronic commerce application  can update a seller inventory  when an order is processed.","However, the inventory calculation application  may not possess real time order and\/or inventory information that is related to transactions processed by third party marketplaces. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can track historical order rates as well as inventory levels associated with the seller to determine when the inventory level of a particular product associated with a sales listing of a seller reaches a level at which additional orders should not be processed by the electronic commerce application . Accordingly, to facilitate such a process for a multi-channel seller, the inventory calculation application  can gather additional information about the seller's orders and\/or sales listings in various third party marketplaces and, in combination with data known about the seller's listings in the data store , detect when an inventory level associated with the seller's inventory reaches critical levels.","To this end, the inventory calculation application  can, via the site connector , communicate with various third party marketplace systems  to determine information about the seller's listings in various third party marketplaces. In the event that a particular third party marketplace system  provides an API  with which the site connector  can interact and retrieve sales listing data as well as information about orders processed by the third party marketplace without API polling or frequency restrictions, the inventory calculation application  can so proceed and update inventory data  accordingly. In other words, the inventory calculation application  can monitor sales listings in a third party marketplace and update inventory data  when an order for a sales listing is processed by the third party marketplace system .","In some third party marketplaces, an API rate limit may restrict the frequency with which the inventory calculation application  can retrieve order data from a respective third party marketplace system . Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can poll the API  of the third party marketplace system  up to such a rate limit, and update the inventory data  with information about orders on a periodic basis. In other third party marketplaces, there may be no API with which the inventory calculation application  can interact to retrieve order information related to sales listings of a seller. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  may interact with a third party marketplace user interface as a seller would and extract, or \u201cscrape\u201d information about orders from the user interface provided by the third party marketplace system .","As one example, the inventory calculation application  can, on a periodic basis, utilize a seller's authentication credentials to retrieve an order management page(s) or other user interface from a third party marketplace system  and extract information about the orders processed by the third party marketplace on behalf of the seller during a given period of time (e.g., since the last point in time that the inventory calculation application  retrieved information from the third party marketplace system ). In some cases, the inventory calculation application  can receive inventory updates from a seller via a user interface provided by the electronic commerce application  via a client . In other cases, the inventory calculation application  can receive order confirmations related to orders for a particular product in a seller inventory by electronic mail. In other words, the inventory calculation application  can retrieve information about orders related to substantially all of a seller's orders through the various means permitted by the various third party marketplace systems  and\/or the seller. The inventory calculation application  can also monitor the order rate of a seller related to orders processed by the electronic commerce application .","The inventory calculation application  can then calculate an order rate associated with the various products in a seller inventory, from which an inventory depletion rate can be determined. Given an initial quantity level provided by the seller for a particular product, the inventory calculation application  can then determine when a quantity of a product in a seller inventory reaches a level at which the electronic commerce application  should cease processing orders for the product and\/or report the inventory as unavailable to reduce the risk of processing an order that the seller may be unable to fulfill because the inventory is exhausted. Accordingly, given a base quantity of a particular product in a seller inventory, to determine an inventory depletion rate associated with the product, the inventory calculation application  can calculate one or more order rates associated with the seller's sales listings across the various marketplaces in which the seller participates, including third party marketplaces as well as via the electronic commerce application .","It should be appreciated that the update interval for the various marketplaces can vary. In the case of an API  provided by third party marketplace systems , API rate limits can vary. In the case of inventory updates manually provided by the seller, these updates may be received at irregular intervals. In the case where the inventory calculation application  retrieves orders and\/or an order history associated with the seller's listings in various third party marketplaces by scraping network pages provided by the marketplaces, the frequency of these updates can vary based upon the network and\/or computational resources associated with the computing device . Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can calculate and\/or maintain multiple update intervals that are associated with the various marketplaces in which a seller participates. In one embodiment, the inventory calculation application  can calculate an average update interval associated with the various marketplaces. The update interval can be configured by an operator of the computing device  for other various reasons as can be appreciated.","Accordingly, upon calculation of one or more order rates associated with the product across various marketplaces, the inventory calculation application  can determine an aggregate order rate from which an inventory depletion rate associated with the seller's inventory of the product can be calculated. As one illustrative non-limiting example, assume that on a first day a seller designates a base quantity of a product at one hundred. Next, assume that the inventory calculation application , based on historical order updates related to the product across all marketplaces in which the seller participates, retrieved order data from the various marketplaces at an update interval of once per day. Assume also that the inventory calculation application  has determined that the order rate associated with the seller and with the product reveals an order rate of ten units per day. In one embodiment, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to analyze a configurable moving time window of any size of historical order data associated with the seller (e.g., the previous five days, six months, etc.). In the above example, if the inventory calculation application  can determine, from an order history across all marketplaces from the previous five days that the seller has sold ten units of the product per day, then the inventory depletion rate for the product can likewise be calculated as ten per day for the product for the seller. Therefore, after five days, the inventory calculation application  can appropriately update the inventory data  associated with the seller and product.","Continuing the above example, prior to the tenth day (e.g., on the second day), the inventory calculation application  can determine that there is little risk of processing an order that cannot be fulfilled by the seller because the inventory depletion rate, combined with the base quantity designated by the seller, does not reflect that inventory levels are dangerously low. However, on the tenth day, the inventory calculation application  can determine that inventory levels are reaching a level at which there is a risk that the electronic commerce application  may process an order that cannot be fulfilled by the seller. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can proactively make assumptions about inventory levels of the seller to reduce this risk.","In other words, the inventory calculation application  can extrapolate the inventory depletion rate for the product over a period of uncertain inventory availability. In some embodiments, the period of uncertain inventory availability can be based upon an average update interval associated with the order updates from which an inventory depletion rate is calculated. For example, in the context of the above example, assuming an average update interval of once per day, the period of uncertain inventory availability during which the inventory calculation application  can extrapolate can be a configurable unit of time that is based upon the update interval. As one illustration, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to define a period of uncertain inventory availability at twice the average update interval.","In the context of the above example, the inventory calculation application  can determine, after ten percent of the tenth day has passed, that ten percent of the remaining inventory of the product has been depleted. Similarly, the inventory calculation application  can determine, after eighty percent of the tenth day has passed, that eighty percent of the remaining inventory has been depleted. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can update the inventory data  associated with the seller during the period of uncertain inventory availability even though it cannot be definitively determined that the seller's inventory has been depleted during this period. In some embodiments, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to update the inventory data  so that that the electronic commerce application  does not process orders for the product when the assumed inventory level approaches within a configurable threshold of depletion.","In some embodiments, the inventory calculation application  can consider other external factors in addition to the inventory depletion rate and update intervals to determine whether a product in a seller inventory is at risk of being unavailable. For example, the inventory calculation application  can adjust the calculated inventory depletion rate based on the time of day. In one example, the inventory calculation application  can determine that a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application  processes fewer orders between certain off peak hours of the day. Therefore, the inventory calculation application  can reduce the calculated inventory depletion rate during off peak hours of the day, and increase the rate during peak hours of the day. As another example, the inventory calculation application  can adjust the inventory depletion rate when making a determination regarding whether inventory is available based upon seasonal shopping conditions. For example, the inventory calculation application  can increase the inventory depletion rate calculated based upon historical order rates during a holiday shopping season. The inventory calculation application  can make these adjustments based at least upon factors known about a historical or projected product, product category and\/or marketplace.","As some examples, the inventory calculation application  can adjust an inventory depletion rate based upon a historical order rate associated with an entire marketplace at a given time of day, season, etc. In this example, the inventory calculation application  can determine that a marketplace, as a whole, may be busier during certain times of a day and have a higher aggregate order rate during certain peak hours. As one non-limiting example, a marketplace may, as a whole, process 20% more orders during a given time window relative to a remainder of the day. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can adjust the inventory depletion rate by this percentage during this time window when determining whether inventory should be reported as unavailable. As another example, the inventory calculation application can adjust an inventory depletion rate based upon a historical order rate associated with a product category to which the product is assigned.","It should be appreciated that the update intervals associated with various third party marketplaces can vary because of API rate limits, the frequency with which a seller provides order updates related to sales via third party marketplaces, and other factors as can be appreciated. Additionally, the sales volume and\/or order rate for a particular product can also vary among various marketplaces. Therefore, the inventory calculation application  can take into account these varying update intervals and\/or order rates to determine an aggregate inventory depletion rate based upon an order rate in the various marketplaces, which can be associated with the seller's inventory of various products associated with its various sales listings.","For example, the inventory calculation application  may be able to determine that a seller's order rate for a product in a first marketplace is one unit per hour, and in a second marketplace, it may determine that the order rate is one unit per day, and so on. Accordingly, the inventory calculation application  can calculate an aggregate order rate across the various marketplaces in which the seller participates, from which an aggregate inventory depletion rate can be determined. Similarly, the inventory calculation application  can determine one or more update intervals associated with the various third party marketplaces from which a period of uncertain inventory availability can be determined.","It should be appreciated that a seller may add additional quantities to an inventory of a particular product, and the seller can accordingly update the seller inventory  stored in the data store  via a user interface provided by the electronic commerce application  and\/or inventory calculation application . Adding inventory to a seller inventory  may not affect an order rate across the various marketplaces in which a seller participates. However, the addition of inventory  may affect the overall inventory level and thus the determination of when a seller inventory of a product approaches a period of uncertain inventory availability as the inventory is replenished.","The behavior of the inventory calculation application  can be configured in various ways based upon many variables. In one embodiment, the inventory calculation application  can be configured with varying degrees of aggressiveness in making inventory depletion rate determinations during the period of uncertain inventory availability. For example, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to update the seller inventory  information in the data store , report an inventory quantity to the electronic commerce application  based upon a determined expected inventory level as described above, and\/or prevent the electronic commerce application  from processing orders against a seller inventory once the seller inventory  reaches the period of uncertain inventory availability. As another example, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to allow orders to be processed by the electronic commerce application  against the seller inventory until a configurable percentage of the period has passed.","The inventory calculation application  can be configured in this way based at least upon various factors about the seller. For example, for orders for sellers with a history of positive user feedback, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to allow the electronic commerce application  to process orders well into the period of uncertain inventory availability. For new sellers, sellers having negative user feedback, and\/or sellers for which little user feedback is known, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to cause order processing associated with a particular product inventory to be ceased earlier in the period of uncertain inventory availability.","In some embodiments, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to more aggressively decrement expected inventory levels during the period of uncertain inventory availability as the inventory is available in more marketplaces. In other embodiments, the inventory calculation application  can be configured to more aggressively decrement expected inventory levels during the period of uncertain inventory availability on a seasonal basis. For example, the inventory calculation application  can modify or adjust a calculated inventory depletion rate if a busy shopping season commences or any other event with which an affect on the inventory depletion rate can be associated.","Referring next to , shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of a portion of the inventory calculation application  according to various embodiments. It is understood that the flowchart of  provides merely an example of the many different types of functional arrangements that may be employed to implement the operation of the portion of the inventory calculation application  as described herein. As an alternative, the flowchart of  may be viewed as depicting an example of steps of a method implemented in the computing device  () according to one or more embodiments.","Beginning with box , the inventory calculation application  can identify sales listings in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application  () for a particular product associated with a seller inventory. Additionally, at least one sales listing in a third party marketplace that is also associated with the product and the seller inventory can be identified. In some embodiments, a seller can, via a user interface provided by the electronic commerce application  and\/or inventory calculation application , identify various marketplaces in which a seller inventory is available via sales listings for various products. Accordingly, in box , the inventory calculation application  determines an order rate associated with a third party marketplace sales listing. As noted above, the frequency with which the inventory calculation application  can obtain updates regarding order information to determine an order rate may vary based upon the varying ways in which order updates from various marketplaces are provided to the inventory calculation application . In box , the inventory calculation application  can determine whether there are additional third party marketplaces that are associated with the product as well as the seller inventory and calculate an order rate accordingly.","In box , the inventory calculation application  determines an order rate for the sales listing for the product in a marketplace facilitated by the electronic commerce application . As noted above, in such a scenario, the inventory calculation application  can obtain order information from the data store  () or any other mechanism provided by the marketplace from which the inventory calculation application  can obtain order data. In one example, an inventory depletion rate associated with the seller inventory and the product can be based at least upon average order rate over a given unit of time. In box , the inventory calculation application  can calculate one or more update intervals associated with the frequency with which the inventory calculation application  can obtain updates regarding order information from the various marketplaces in which the seller participates. In one example, the inventory calculation application  can calculate an average update interval associated with the various marketplaces. In box , the inventory calculation application  can determine a period of uncertain inventory availability based at least upon the update intervals. In some embodiments, this period can be a multiple of an average update interval.","In box , the inventory calculation application  determines, based at least upon the inventory depletion rate of a product and a quantity associated with the product, whether the inventory levels are within the period of uncertainty. If so, the inventory calculation application  can determine whether inventory levels are below a certain threshold that can be specified by an operator of the inventory calculation application . As described above, the inventory calculation application  can, in some embodiments, adjust a calculated inventory depletion rate based upon external factors such as time of day and other factors discussed above. For example, in box , the inventory calculation application  can be configured to determine whether expected inventory levels are below a user specified threshold, and if so, in box , the inventory calculation application  can report that inventory of the product is unavailable. If inventory levels are not below the threshold, the inventory calculation application  can continue to monitor the inventory depletion rate, order rates, and an expected quantity of the product.","With reference to , shown is a schematic block diagram of the computing device  according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The computing device  includes at least one processor circuit, for example, having a processor  and a memory , both of which are coupled to a local interface . To this end, the computing device  may comprise, for example, at least one server computer or like device. The local interface  may comprise, for example, a data bus with an accompanying address\/control bus or other bus structure as can be appreciated.","Stored in the memory  are both data and several components that are executable by the processor .

In this respect, the term \u201cexecutable\u201d means a program file that is in a form that can ultimately be run by the processor . Examples of executable programs may be, for example, a compiled program that can be translated into machine code in a format that can be loaded into a random access portion of the memory  and run by the processor , source code that may be expressed in proper format such as object code that is capable of being loaded into a random access portion of the memory  and executed by the processor , or source code that may be interpreted by another executable program to generate instructions in a random access portion of the memory  to be executed by the processor , etc. An executable program may be stored in any portion or component of the memory  including, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), hard drive, solid-state drive, USB flash drive, memory card, optical disc such as compact disc (CD) or digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, magnetic tape, or other memory components.","The memory  is defined herein as including both volatile and nonvolatile memory and data storage components. Volatile components are those that do not retain data values upon loss of power. Nonvolatile components are those that retain data upon a loss of power. Thus, the memory  may comprise, for example, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, memory cards accessed via a memory card reader, floppy disks accessed via an associated floppy disk drive, optical discs accessed via an optical disc drive, magnetic tapes accessed via an appropriate tape drive, and\/or other memory components, or a combination of any two or more of these memory components.
