Said ASCII copy, created on Nov. 5, 2014, is named 41977-711.201_SL.txt and is 255,804 bytes in size.","Array technologies have been widely used in biomedical studies for the detection of biomolecules and profiling of gene expression levels, etc. Arrays are typically comprised of immobilized probes which can bind to or hybridize with target molecules in a sample. Detection of binding or hybridization events is often achieved through the use of optical labels (e.g. fluorophores) and scanning or imaging techniques (e.g. fluorescence scanning or imaging). A feature on an array is a small region of immobilized probes that are specific for a given target molecule, e.g. probes that hybridize to specific DNA or RNA sequences. Identifying the pattern of labeled features on a hybridized array thus provides information about specific molecules, e.g. DNA or RNA molecules in the sample, which in turn can provide valuable data in biomedical studies. Two important engineering requirements for providing high quality, quantitative data for biomedical investigations are (i) to correctly image the hybridized arrays, and (ii) to correctly analyze the images to extract quantitative data. Existing optical imaging systems typically image one region of an array at a time, which can be a slow process if a number of different regions need to be imaged. In addition, current methods of image analysis typically determine a signal intensity level (i.e. an analog quantity) for each array feature. Intensity level measurements are often subject to a variety of instrumental drift and analysis errors, therefore improved methods for determining whether or not target molecules are bound to a given array feature, and improved methods for transforming that data into quantitative measures of the number of target molecules present in a sample, are of great importance to expanding the use of array technologies in biomedical applications.","The methods, systems, and platforms of the present disclosure provide means for digital counting of labeled features on arrays, and thereby enable quantitative determination of the number of target molecules present in a sample through the use of stochastic labeling techniques.","In some embodiments, an array reader system comprising an output unit for calculating an absolute number of target molecules in a sample is described, wherein the array reader system is configured to read an array comprising a plurality of labeled and non-labeled features.

No. 8,835,358 and PCT application US2011\/065291, which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.","Briefly, high-sensitivity single molecule digital counting may be achieved through the stochastic labeling of a collection of identical target molecules. Each copy of a target molecule is randomly labeled using a large, non-depleting reservoir of unique labels. The uniqueness of each labeled target molecule is determined by the statistics of random choice, and depends on the number of copies of identical target molecules in the collection compared to the diversity of labels. The size of the resulting set of labeled target molecules is determined by the stochastic nature of the labeling process, and analysis of the number of labels detected then allows calculation of the number of target molecules present in the original collection or sample. When the ratio of the number of copies of a target molecule present to the number of unique labels is low, the labeled target molecules are highly unique (i.e. there is a very low probability that more than one target molecule will have been labeled with a given label), and the digital counting efficiency is high. This stochastic metholodology transforms the problem of counting molecules from one of locating and identifying identical molecules to a series of yes\/no digital questions regarding detection of a set of predefined labels. In some embodiments, the labeled products are detected by means of DNA sequencing. In other embodiments, the labeled products for one or more target molecules of choice are detected with high specificity using the array readout systems described herein.","Arrays and Features","Disclosed herein are arrays designed for use in stochastic counting of one or more target molecules in a sample. Arrays provide a means of detecting the presence of labeled target molecules, wherein the labels comprise a large and diverse set of unique labels.","In many embodiments, arrays comprise a plurality of features (or spots) on the surface of a substrate, wherein each feature further comprises a plurality of attached probes. In some embodiments, the array may comprise one or more regions, each of which may comprise a plurality of features or sub-arrays. For example, an array may comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more regions, or alternatively, an array may comprise 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more regions. In some embodiments, an array may comprise 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or more regions. In other embodiments, an array may comprise hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of regions.","Non-limiting examples of arrays include microtiter plates, microwell plates, 16-well microscope slides, spotted microarrays, or microarrays fabricated by in situ solid-phase synthesis. A region of an array may comprise one well of a 16-well microscope slide, one well of a glass-bottomed 96-well plate, or one well of a glass-bottomed 384-well plate. Alternatively, a region of an array may comprise more than one well, for example, in some embodiments, a region may comprise 2 adjacent wells, 4 adjacent wells; or a larger number of wells positioned in close proximity to each other. In some embodiments, the arrays may comprise high-density oligonucleotide arrays with more than 1,000 features per square millimeter, and a region on the array may comprise a selected area of the array substrate surface, for example, an area of approximately 1 mm\u00d71 mm.","As indicated previously, in many embodiments, the set of probes attached to a set of features of an array are selected for detection of a specific set of unique labels designed for use in stochastic labeling studies. The attachment of the probes to the array substrate may be covalent or non-covalent, and permanent or temporary. A probe may be a sequence of monomers including, but not limited to, for example, deoxy-ribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, amino acids, or synthetic monomers, or they may be a sequence of oligomers, including, but not limited to, for example, oligonucleotides (e.g. DNA or RNA sequences) or peptide sequences. In some cases, a probe may be a macromolecule, including but not limited to, for example, antibodies or antibody fragments. Each feature on an array corresponds to a small area of the array substrate comprising immobilized probes having the same molecular sequence that bind to or hybridize with the same target molecule. Two or more features on the array may be identical, similar, or different. In many embodiments, arrays will include one or more fiducial marks used for alignment or orientation purposes, as well as positive and negative control features in addition to feature sets used for detection of a stochastic label set. Positive control features may comprise probes that bind to or hybridize with molecules known to be always present in a sample, or probes that bind to or hybridize with molecules spiked into a sample in a controlled fashion. Negative control features may comprise probes that are specific for molecules that are known to be absent from a sample, or they may comprise features having no probes attached to the substrate surface at all.","In many embodiments, the array substrate, also called a support, may be fabricated from a number of materials. The materials may be solid. The materials may be semi-solid. Examples of materials that may be used to fabricate array substrates include, but are not limited to, glass, fused silica, silicon, polymer, or paper.","In some embodiments, the present disclosure also describes arrays for use in stochastic labeling studies. In particular, arrays are described wherein the arrays comprise a plurality of features having immobilized probes thereon that are complementary to a set of labels designed for use in stochastic labeling experiments, and wherein there is at least one feature on the array for every label in the label set. Some embodiments include an array comprising: (a) a plurality of features, optionally organized into a plurality of sub-arrays, wherein the plurality of features comprise: (i) one or more fiducial features comprising oligonucleotide probes of a defined fiducial sequence; (ii) one or more positive control features comprising oligonucleotide probes of one or more defined positive control sequences; (iii) one or more negative control features having no oligonucleotide probes; and (iv) a plurality of label set features comprising oligonucleotide probes, wherein each individual feature comprises a unique sequence selected from a set of label sequences designed for stochastic labeling of one or more target molecules. In some embodiments, the arrays described in the present disclosure comprise oligonucleotide probe sequences comprising 25-mers, wherein the 5\u2032 terminus may optionally be labeled with a 6 carbon atom amino-modifier. In some embodiments, the arrays described in the present disclosure further comprise oligonucleotide probes comprising the set of 960 unique oligonucleotide sequences listed in Table 1. In some embodiments, the arrays described in the present disclosure comprise a set of olignucleotide probes that are 70% homologous, 80% homologous, 85% homologous, 90% homologous, or 95% homologous with the set of sequences listed in Table 1. In some embodiments, the array described in the present disclosure comprise a set of oligonucleotide probes that includes 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the sequences listed in Table 1.","Hybridization and Detection","In many embodiments of the disclosed methods, systems, and platforms, samples may be processed prior to placing them in contact with the immobilized probes on arrays. For example, target molecules in the samples may be labeled with fluorescent dye molecules and\/or stochastic labels during the sample preparation step. Prior to hybridization with oligonucleotide probes, for example, target DNA or RNA molecules may be covalently linked to fluorescent dye molecules including, but not limited to, fluorescein, Cy3, or Cy5. Alternatively, target molecules may be labeled after binding or hybridizing to probes on the array. For example, target molecules may be covalently linked to biotin prior to binding or hybridization with probes on the array. Following the binding or hybridization step, the immobilized target molecules may then be labeled with streptavidin conjugated to optical tags including, but not limited to, phycoerythrin, quantum dot nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, or blue latex beads. There are many methods for labeling target molecules, either before or after binding or hybridization to the array, and many possible choices for suitable optical labels or tags.","Once a sample has been contacted with an array, the array (or one or more regions of the array) may comprise one or more labeled features. Each region of an array that has been contacted with a sample comprising labeled target molecules (where the target molecules are labeled either before or after contact with the array) may, for example, comprise zero, one, two, or more labeled features. Alternatively, a region of an array that has been contacted with a sample may comprise 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more labeled features. In some embodiments, a region of an array that has been contacted with a sample may comprise 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more labeled features. In high-density arrays, a region of an array that has been contacted with a sample may comprise more than 100 labeled features, more than 1,000 labeled features, more than 10,000 labeled features, more 100,000 labeled features, or more than 1,000,000 labeled features.","Optical Instruments","The methods, systems, and platforms described herein may comprise an optical instrument used for finite-conjugate digital imaging of one or more regions of an array, wherein the instrument typically includes an illumination system, an imaging system, and a translation stage. In some embodiments, the instrument operates as a \u201cmacroscope\u201d having a magnification of less than one. In other embodiments, the instrument operates as a \u201cmicroscope\u201d having a magnification of greater than one. In still other embodiments, the instrument operates as a \u201ccontact imager\u201d having a magnification equal to one. The choice of magnification will typically depend on the field of view required to image the region of interest, and on the size of the image sensor.","By way of non-limiting example, if a region of an array comprises a single well of a 16-well microscope slide, or a single well of a glass-bottomed 96-well plate, the dimensions of the region to be imaged may be approximately 7 mm\u00d77 mm, and the pitch (center-to-center distance between two adjacent regions of the array may be approximately 9 mm. In some embodiments, the optical instrument may be used to take an image of one well at a time, or an image of 2 adjacent wells simultaneously, or an image of 4 (2\u00d72) adjacent wells simultaneously, and the required field of view, or region to be imaged, may be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, the optical instrument may form an image of 6 (3\u00d72 or 2\u00d73), 8 (4\u00d72 or 2\u00d74), 9 (3\u00d73), 10 (5\u00d72 or 5\u00d72), or 12 (6\u00d72, 4\u00d73, 3\u00d74, or 2\u00d76) adjacent wells simultaneously.","By way of another non-limiting example, if a region of an array is a single well of a glass-bottomed 384-well plate, the dimensions of the region to be imaged may be approximately 3 mm\u00d73 mm, and the pitch between two adjacent regions of the array may be approximately 4.5 mm. Again, in some embodiments, the optical instrument may be used to take an image of one well at a time, or an image of 2 adjacent wells simultaneously, or an image of 4 (2\u00d72), 6 (3\u00d72 or 2\u00d73), 8 (4\u00d72 or 2\u00d74), 12 (4\u00d73 or 3\u00d74), or 16 (4\u00d74) adjacent wells simultaneously.","In another non-limiting example, the optical instrument may be used to image high-density oligonucleotide arrays, for example arrays having more than 1,000 features per square millimeter, and a region on the array may be approximately 1 mm\u00d71 mm in area, for example.","Imaging System","One main component of the optical instrument is an imaging system. The imaging system may include one or more lenses in addition to a CCD or CMOS camera. Typically the CCD or CMOS camera will have a resolution between a few hundred thousand and a few million pixels. A high resolution camera may have tens of millions of pixels, or more.","The imaging system may be configured to magnify the image of the array. The required magnification of the imaging system can be determined by the required field of view and by the size of the CCD or CMOS sensor. By way of a non-limiting example, if the optical instrument is used to take an image of 2 adjacent wells of a 16-well microscope slide simultaneously, the required field of view is approximately 16 mm\u00d78 mm. If the light-sensitive area of the CCD or CMOS sensor is about 4.8 mm\u00d73.6 mm, the instrument is a macroscope and a magnification of about 0.3 is required. In this case, only data from the central 4.8 mm\u00d72.4 mm of the sensor would be used.","By way of non-limiting example, an appropriate imaging system with a magnification of 0.3 may be constructed using an achromatic cemented doublet lens with a focal length of 85 mm and an infinite-conjugate camera lens with a focal length of 25 mm. If a spectrally selective emission filter is used (for example, a single-band interference filter, multi-band interference filter, longpass interference filter, or longpass colored glass filter), and this filter is typically located between the achromatic cemented doublet lens and the camera lens. Additional configurations of an imaging system with a magnification of 0.3 are possible. For example, the achromatic cemented doublet lens can be omitted, and a finite-conjugate camera lens can be used instead of an infinite-conjugate camera lens. In this case, the spectrally selective emission filter is preferably located on the long-conjugate side of the camera lens.","A sensor with a light-sensitive area of 4.8 mm\u00d73.6 mm is known as a \u2153-inch format sensor. If a sensor of different size is used, the required magnification will be different. By way of a non-limiting example, if the required field of view is 16 mm\u00d78 mm and a sensor having a light-sensitive area of 6.4 mm\u00d74.8 mm (known as a \u00bd-inch format sensor) is used, then the required magnification is 0.4. An appropriate imaging system with a magnification of 0.4 can be constructed using, for example, an achromatic cemented doublet lens with a focal length of 85 mm and an infinite-conjugate camera lens with a focal length of 35 mm.","As another non-limiting example, if the dimensions of a region are about 0.66 mm\u00d70.66 mm and a sensor with a light-sensitive area of 8.8 mm\u00d76.6 mm (known as a \u2154-inch format sensor) is used, then the instrument is a microscope and the required magnification is about 10. In this case, only data from the central 6.6 mm\u00d76.6 mm of the sensor will be used. An appropriate imaging system with a magnification of 10 can be constructed using, for example, an infinite-conjugate microscope objective with a focal length of 20 mm and a microscope tube lens with a focal length of 200 mm, with a spectrally selective emission filter typically located between the microscope objective and the tube lens. Alternatively a finite-conjugate 10\u00d7 microscope objective can be used and the microscope tube lens can be omitted. In this case the spectrally selective emission filter can be located on the long-conjugate side of the microscope objective.","An imaging system of any required magnification can be constructed using a combination of off-the-shelf and custom optical elements that does not necessarily include either a camera lens or a microscope objective. The optical elements may have various combinations of spherical, flat, aspheric, or diffractive surfaces.","Illumination System","Another main component of the optical instrument is an illumination system. The purpose of the illumination system is to illuminate the array within the field of view of the CCD or CMOS camera. To reduce sensitivity to edge effects and to misalignment, it may be desirable for the illuminated area to be slightly larger than the camera's field of view. By way of a non-limiting example, if the field of view is about 16 mm\u00d78 mm, a reasonable illuminated area may be about 18 mm\u00d710 mm. The types of illumination may be Abbe, Kohler, or neither Abbe nor Kohler illumination. Abbe illumination and Kohler illumination are well known and are described in, for example, Chapter 14 of , Second Edition by Robert E. Fischer et al., SPIE Press, McGraw-Hill, N.Y., 2008.","In some embodiments, the illumination system may be used for off-axis illumination. In other embodiments, the illumination system may be used for trans-illumination or epi-illumination. If the illumination system is used for off-axis illumination or trans-illumination, then the illumination system and the imaging system are separate from each other, with no shared optical components. If the illumination system is used for epi-illumination, then the illumination system and the imaging system may share a beamsplitter and possibly one or more lenses. The beamsplitter may be a plate beamsplitter or a cube beamsplitter. If the optical instrument is used for fluorescence imaging, the beamsplitter is typically a single-edge or multi-edge longpass dichroic beamsplitter.","Often the illumination system may contain a square or rectangular aperture so that the illuminated area has the same shape as the region that is imaged by the CCD or CMOS camera. In embodiments where off-axis illumination is used, the aperture may be trapezoidal in shape instead of square or rectangular. An off-axis illumination system may or may not satisfy the Scheimpflug condition. The Scheimpflug condition is described in, for example, , Second Edition by Warren J. Smith, McGraw-Hill, N.Y., 1990.","In some embodiments, the illumination system may contain one or more of the following: spherical lenses, aspheric lenses, a solid homogenizing rod with a rectangular or trapezoidal cross section, a hollow homogenizing light tunnel with a rectangular or trapezoidal cross section, a microlens array or a pair of microlens arrays, a stationary or rotating diffuser, a compound parabolic concentrator, a non-imaging optical element other than a compound parabolic concentrator (e.g., a free-form catadioptric element), an optical fiber, a fiber bundle, or a liquid light guide.","The illumination system may contain one or more light sources, selected from the group including, but not limited to, one or more LEDs, one or more lasers, a xenon arc lamp, a metal halide lamp, or an incandescent lamp, or a combination thereof. The illumination system may also contain a spectrally selective excitation filter selected from the list including, but not limited to, a single-band interference filter, a multi-band interference filter, or a shortpass interference filter. If the illumination system contains two or more light sources, they may be the same (by way of non-limiting example, two or more LEDs with peak emission wavelengths of about 525 nm for excitation of Cy3 dye, mounted as close together as possible on a circuit board) or different (by way of non-limiting example, an LED with a peak excitation wavelength of about 525 nm for excitation of Cy3 dye, and an LED with a peak excitation wavelength of about 625 nm for excitation of Cy5 dye, mounted as close together as possible on a circuit board). Two-color or multicolor LED assemblies are available from, for example, LED Engin, Inc. (San Jose, Calif.) and Innovations in Optics, Inc. (Woburn, Mass.).","In some embodiments, a light source in the illumination system may be controlled electronically. By way of a non-limiting example, a light source may be synchronized with the CCD or CMOS camera so that the light source turns on when the CCD or CMOS camera begins an exposure and turns off when the camera finishes an exposure. If the illumination system contains two or more light sources, they may optionally be controlled together or independently of each other.","In some embodiments, a light source may be left on continuously. In this case, the illumination system may contain an electronically controlled shutter, and the shutter may be synchronized with the CCD or CMOS camera so that the shutter opens when the CCD or CMOS camera begins an exposure and closes when the camera finishes an exposure.","In some embodiments, the optical instrument may contain a single illumination system. In other embodiments, the instrument may contain two or more illumination systems that are identical. In yet other embodiments, the instrument may contain two or more illumination systems that are different. By way of non-limiting examples, an optical instrument for detecting fluorescence from Cy3 and Cy5 may contain one illumination system for Cy3 excitation and another illumination system for Cy5 excitation, or it may contain a single illumination system that is used for both Cy3 and Cy5 excitation.","Translation Stage","Yet another main component of the optical instrument may be one or more translation stages. One purpose of the translation stage may be to move sample holders in and out of the field view of the imaging system. Another purpose of the translation stage system may be to move the imaging system, components of the imaging system, the illumination system, or components of the illumination system relative to the sample or relative to one another, for obtaining the best possible image.","In many embodiments of the presently disclosed systems, the translation stage may further comprise a sample holder. By way of non-limiting examples, if the optical instrument is used to take images of 16-well microscope slides, the translation stage contains a slide holder. If the optical instrument is used to take images of 96-well plates or 384-well plates, and it contains a plate holder. The slide holder, plate holder, or other array support holder may be mounted on the translation stage system in any of a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art.","The translation stage may have one or more axes of motion. By way of a non-limiting example, if the support is a 16-well microscope slide and the instrument takes images of 2 adjacent wells simultaneously, a single axis of motion may be sufficient. By way of another non-limiting example, if the support is a 96-well plate and the instrument takes images of 2 adjacent wells simultaneously, then at least 2 axes of motion would be required. Additional axes of motion for adjustment of focus and tilt may also be added. If the instrument can take an image of all of the regions on the support in a single exposure, then the translation stage may be omitted in some embodiments of the optical instrument.","Housing","The systems and devices described herein can include features for insuring that the sensors of the device detect appropriate signal. For example the systems and devices can include light excluding features. The light excluding features generally reduce unintended signal from reaching light sensitive sensors. In many embodiments, one or more of the imaging system, illumination system, translation stage, and other components of the instrument are surrounded by a housing. The housing can be opaque. The housing can, in some instances, act as a faraday cage. In some instances a single housing is sufficient to exclude light from systems. The single housing can also provide external protection of the system. Alternatively, multiple housings may individually contain one or more components of the instrument. In some instances the housings are nested housings. In various embodiments, the housing can be gas and\/or liquid tight.","The housing may have an access point which can exclude light from the interior of the housing. The access point may comprise materials that absorb light in the spectrum relevant to the sensors within the housing, e.g. vantablack in the visible spectrum. The access point may comprise a closure device. The closure device may be opaque. The closure device may be, e.g., a door. The closure device may be substantially light-tight in a closed position. The closure may be light-tight in a closed position.","The closure device can be opened, e.g., for insertion and removal of a 16-well slide, 96-well plate, 384-well plate, or other array support. A sensor (for example, a photointerrupter) may be used to determine whether the closure device is open or closed. The instrument's software or electronic hardware may prevent the light source in the illumination system from turning on when the closure device is open, may prevent power from being applied to the image sensor, and\/or may prevent the translation stage from moving when the closure device is open.","In some embodiments, the housing may further comprise a mechanism for automated opening and closing of the closure device, as illustrated in . The closure device can provide access to the interior of the housing. The closure device can provide access for the array to be loaded in and out of the instrument. This operation can be performed automatically. In some instances, the closure device can exclude ambient light during imaging, while opening reliably to permit loading.","In some instances the closure device does not comprise pivoting parts. In some embodiments of the disclosed systems and platforms, the closure device is held by magnets to the housing. Magnets can hold the closure device to the housing in a closed position. Magnets can hold the closure device to a loading device, e.g. a tray, in an open position. During a transition from an open to closed position the closure device can transition from being primarily magnetically attached to a loading device to being primarily magnetically attached to the housing. During a transition from a closed to open position the closure device can transition from being primarily magnetically attached to the housing to being primarily magnetically attached to the loading device. In some instances the transition between the open and closed state is magnetically unstable, such instability causing the closure device to move from the transition state to either the more stable open or closed position.","The closure device can comprise a self-locating function provided by conical features on the door. The thicknesses of the parts which support the magnets on each side of a mating pair, and the depth of retaining pockets within those parts, defines the spacing between magnets in each mating pair, and thus the holding forces. The design geometry is matched to the power of the motors to provide enough retaining force, without requiring high motor torque. The system is further designed such that the motor current and speed (and hence torque) can be controlled to improve the performance, and avoid creating a safety hazard. Two of the four magnet pairs are used to temporarily hold the door to the front of the sample tray, when the tray moves outward for loading an array assembly, as depicted in . The other two magnet pairs are used to hold the door closed against the front panel, after the tray has moved inwards (and separated the other two magnet pairs in the process). The respective allocation of magnets is shown in . The mating magnets on the front of the stage are shown in . The locations of the mating magnets in the front panel are shown in . To provide for secure grip (and therefore reliable operation), rare earth magnets provide high strength (e.g. neodymium magnets). Some embodiments of the design call for disc magnets approximately 8 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick, with the magnetic field parallel to the axis. In some embodiments, it is sufficient to replace one magnet from each pair with a weaker magnet, or with a piece of magnetic material such as iron or mild steel.","In some embodiments of the systems and platforms disclosed herein, a mechanism for providing for automated door or lid closure on one or more instrument compartments is provided, wherein the mechanism comprises: (a) a closure; (b) a housing which magnetically holds the closure in a first position; and (c) a translation stage which magnetically holds the closure in a second position. In some embodiment, the mechanism further comprises a gasket positioned between the closure and the housing. In some embodiments of the mechanism, the gasket is attached to the closure. In other embodiments, the gasket is attached to the housing. In some embodiments, the closure and housing are substantially opaque, and the gasket creates a substantially light-tight seal between the closure and the housing in the first position. In some embodiments of the mechanism, one or more magnets are positioned to hold the closure onto the housing in the first position. In some embodiments of the mechanism, one or more magnets are positioned to hold the closure onto a first surface of the translation stage in the second position. In some embodiments, the mechanism further comprises two or more pairs of mating locating features to align the closure with the translation stage in the second position. In some embodiments, the mechanism further comprises two or more pairs of mating locating features to align the closure with the housing in the first position. In some embodiments of the mechanism, the pairs of mating locating features comprise conical pins and conical holes. In some embodiments, the housing comprises an optical instrument. In some embodiments, the translation stage includes a sample holder. In some embodiments, the sample holder is designed to hold a microscope slide, a microarray, or a microwell plate. In some embodiments, the closure is not hinged. In some embodiments, the closure is not attached to either the housing or the translation stage through the use of fasteners such as screws or clips. In some embodiments, the closure is not attached to either the housing or the translation stage through the use of an adhesive.","Image Data","The methods, systems, and platforms described herein for counting one or more labeled features on an array may comprise data input, or use of the same. The data input may comprise imaging information and\/or images of one or more regions of arrays. The images comprise pixel data, wherein each unit of pixel data may be encoded in, by way of non-limiting examples, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or more bits. An image may encompass one or more regions of an array. The spatial resolution of an image may be determined by the spatial resolution of the optical instrument, but in some embodiments of the disclosed methods and systems, spatial resolution may be enhanced by digital image processing schemes based on, by way of non-limiting examples, interpolations, extrapolations, modeling, and\/or transforms.","The methods, systems, and platforms described herein for counting one or more labeled features on an array may comprise acquisition and analysis of images of one, two, or more distinct regions on an array. In some embodiments, two or more regions to be imaged may overlap, partially overlap, or not overlap at all. Furthermore, two or more regions to be imaged may be adjacent, or non-adjacent.","The methods, software, systems, and platforms described herein for counting one or more labeled features on an array may comprise acquisition and analysis of images of all or a portion of an array. In some embodiments, the region of an array that is imaged may comprise at least about 1% of the total area of the array. In some embodiments, the region of the array that is imaged image may comprise at least about 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% or more of the total area of the array. In other embodiments, the region of the array to be imaged may comprise at least about 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25% or more of the total area of the array. In still other embodiments, the region of the array to be imaged may comprise at least about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70% or more of the total area of the array. In some embodiments, the region of the array to be imaged may comprise at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 95%, 97% or more of the total area of the array.","The methods, software, systems, and platforms described herein for counting one or more labeled features on an array may comprise acquisiton and analysis of images of all or a portion of the features of an array. In some embodiments, the image may encompass between 10% and 100% of the total number of features on the array. In some embodiments, the image may encompass at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% of the total number of features on the array. In some embodiments, the image may encompass at most 95%, at most 90%, at most, 80%, at most 70%, at most 60%, at most 50%, at most 40%, at most 30%, at most 20%, at more 10%, or at most 5% of the total number of features on the array. The number of features encompassed by the image may fall within any range bounded by any of these values (e.g. from about 15% to about 90% of the total number of features of the array).","Image Acquisition","The methods, systems, and platforms described herein comprise software for acquiring images from an optical instrument. In some embodiments, e.g. for optical instruments comprising two or more image sensors, the image acquisition may operate in a parallel mode, i.e. where two or more images are acquired simultaneously. Alternatively, the image acquisition may operate in a serial mode, where two or more images are acquired sequentially. In general, image acquisition may be performed in a continuous fashion (i.e., wherein the image is acquired within a single exposure time period) or intermittently (i.e., wherein the image is acquired in a discontinuous fashion, e.g. using two or more separate exposure time periods, wherein in some embodiments two more more images are combined for signal averaging purposes).","In a non-limiting example, an array may comprise 16 wells where an image is formed for each well. The image acquisition module may sequentially read the 16 images. Reading the 16 images can be completed in a continuous time period; or, the system may read a first image followed by analyzing the first image, and then the procedure of image reading and image analysis repeats till the 16th image is analyzed. Alternatively, the image acquisition module may read a pair of images at once, and repeat the reading till all the 16 images are acquired. The 16 images may be read sequentially in a single time period. In some applications, a pair of images may be read, followed by immediate image analyses.","Image Analysis","In general, one of the objectives in performing image processing and analysis is to improve signal-to-noise ratios and quantitation. In an ideal array experiment, labeled features comprising bound target molecules and\/or labels would produce a uniform, non-saturated signal level when imaged and non-labeled features would appear uniformly dark, with a signal level of close to zero. In reality, a variety of artifacts due to instrumental and\/or assay procedural issues including, but not limited to, stray light, background fluorescence (in the case of fluorescence-based imaging), particulate contaminants, and non-specific binding of assay components, can produce images that hinder one's ability to extract quantitative signal intensity data and make definitive calls as to which features of the array are labeled. Accordingly, the methods, systems, and platforms disclosed herein may comprise software for performing a variety of image processing tasks including, but not limited to, feature location, image orientation correction, background correction, intensity measurement, data scaling, data thresholding, and data analysis functions.","Image orientation and location of features. In some embodiments, fiducial features incorporated into the design of an array are used to orient the image and locate features in an automated fashion using custom image analysis software. By way of non-limiting example, the microarray pattern shown in  consists of a 32\u00d732 array of features, where fiducial features in the top and bottom rows permit location of the array in the digital images. The fiducial features are typically arranged in an asymmetric pattern whose orientation is readily identifiable, e.g. fiducial features located in the top row of features in an array such as that depicted in  may comprise a distinctive pattern for which the left and right ends of the row are asymmetric, while the pattern of fiducial features in the bottom row is typically different from that in the top row. This permits easy manual and automatic identification of incorrect placement of the array, and also facilitated detection of imaging problems. In some embodiments, the image may be transformed also transformed so that the apparent orientation of the images corresponds to the orientation as viewed by a user, often referred to as the viewing reference orientation, as shown in  for a specific embodiment of an array designed for use with the methods, systems, and platforms disclosed herein.","Refinement of feature locations. In some embodiments, the measured location of each feature is refined so as to account for array fabrication errors, which can produce offsets of several image pixels. The locations of features obtained during the initial image orientation and feature location step may be used to subdivide the array or array region into analysis windows, for example an array may be divided into 32\u00d732 analysis windows, wherein each analysis window comprises an image area of 12\u00d712 pixels centered on each feature, as shown in . The size of the analysis window used is dependent on the size of the features on the array, and may be any size that is necessary to correctly locate and distinguish between features and background regions on the array. By way of non-limiting examples, the analysis window may be defined as a 5\u00d75, 7\u00d77, 9\u00d79, 15\u00d715, 51\u00d751, or 101\u00d7101 pixel area that is centered on the array feature. The position of the feature within the window may be determined on the basis of the signal intensity distribution and clustering of the pixels within the analysis window. The refined location of the feature is calculated as an offset in coordinates X and Y from the site predicted by a perfect rectilinear grid. In some embodiments, distortion of the feature location results due to defects such as dust is avoided by making use of the correlation between printing artifacts between different arrays on the same substrate. Since the printing artifacts are typically consistent, the correction relative to a hypothetical rectilinear grid is also consistent. The feature location optimization results for a given feature are combined across all of the arrays being analyzed, and the median offset is used for subsequent analysis, which greatly decreases noise in the final experimental results.","Local background correction. Once the feature pixel set \u201cS\u201d and background pixel set \u201cB\u201d have been defined for each location in the array (for example, see ), the local background is removed via a calculation involving signal intensity and background intensity statistics. Examples of suitable signal and background intensity statistics for use in local background correction calculations include, but are not limited to, the mean, the median, or a ratio of signal-to-background. In some embodiments, following feature location refinement performed as described above, the pixels within the analysis window are assigned to be signal pixels, background pixels, or transitional pixels, i.e. pixels to be disregarded, in subsequent calculations of signal and background intensity statistics (see ). In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, local background correction is performed via subtraction in logarithm space, i.e. a calculation that is closely related to a signal-to-background ratio calculation, as illustrated in a non-limiting example below:","Given the 16-bit pixel data measurements for a defined feature and background area, on next calculates a single value  for the signal pixels and a value  for the background pixels respectively. One useful statistic is the median value for each set of pixels, i.e.\n\n","Determination of dynamic signal intensity thresholds. In many embodiments of the methods, systems, and platforms disclosed herein, a dynamic signal intensity threshold is determined for one or more regions of an array by performing one or more statistical analyses of the background corrected signal intensity data for the complete set of features. Any of a variety of statistical (or empirical) analysis techniques may be used, including but not limited to, k-means clustering, k-medoids clustering, mixture model statistical analysis, probe reference distribution methods, or empirical analysis based on sorting of background corrected signal intensity values, sorting of pairwise differences in background corrected signal intensity values, etc. In some embodiments, analyses may utilize spatial and\/or temporal information collected across multiple analysis windows, across multiple array regions, or over specified periods of time, or combinations thereof, to improve the quality of the analysis and thereby improve the quantitative aspects of the disclosed methods. In some embodiments, other sources of information, including, but not limited to, for example, locations of probes, frequently occurring artifact patterns, previously derived results, literature reports, array manufacturers' suggestions, human knowledge, and\/or human guidance may also be integrated into the analysis.","By way of a non-limiting example of threshold determination, in some embodiments of the disclosed methods, the background corrected signal intensity threshold may be determined using an empirical approach (e.g. the \u201cE-Derivative\u201d approach; see ) wherein the background corrected signal intensity data for the complete set of array features constitutes a set I={I}.

This approach additionally models the variability in the feature intensities generated by each distribution, which can be useful in cases where the negative feature intensities tend to be much less variable, while the positive feature intensities tends to be much more variable. The choice of the distributions is determined by the shape of the data curve in a background corrected feature intensity histogram. The parameters of the model, e.g. the estimated average intensities for \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d features and their corresponding variance, are estimated from the data using a method such as the Expectation Maximization algorithm.","By way of another non-limiting example of threshold determination, in some embodiments the background corrected signal intensity threshold may be determined by fitting the background corrected feature intensity data to a model function comprising three assumed distributions (i.e. a \u201c3-Component Model\u201d approach), wherein the assumed distributions comprise a log-normal distribution, Dist, for the \u201coff\u201d spots, a normal distribution, Dist, for the \u201con\u201d spots, and a flat offset FlatLevel. Adjustable parameters for the model include: (i) the number of bins in the starting histogram, (ii) Dist amplitude, (iii) Dist position, (iv) Dist standard deviation, (v) Dist amplitude, (vi) Dist position, (vii) Dist standard deviation, and (viii) FlatLevel. An example fit to histogram data is shown in . One non-limiting example of a method to determine the threshold after fitting feature intensity data to such a distribution is as follows: (i) fit the 3-component distribution to the histogram data, and (ii) set the threshold T by calculating the following values: (1) the intensity twhere the high-intensity side of the fitted log-normal distribution component drops below 1 (or a defined parameter for comparison), (2) the intensity twhere the high-intensity side of the fitted log-normal distribution component drops below the fitted FlatLevel result, (3) the intensity twhere the high-intensity side of the fitted log-normal distribution component drops below the value of the fitted normal distribution at that histogram bin, and (4) choosing T=min[t, t, t]. Alternative approaches for determining a threshold using a 3-component model approach will be apparent to those of skill in the art. It can be beneficial to calculate starting values of model parameters, to improve the speed and reliability of the modelling process, which can be achieved using methods such as a coarse search to identify the dominant peaks in the histogram, or based on assumptions derived from typical historical data sets.","By way of another non-limiting example of threshold determination, in some embodiments the background corrected signal intensity threshold may be determined using a \u201cPeak Split Fiducials\u201d approach. This approach, which copes well with low-quality data, is described as follows. An initial split of the feature intensity data into high and low intensity groups is made using the scale defined naturally by the spread between \u201con\u201d (label present) and \u201coff\u201d (label absent) features in the fiducial rows. Then, the histogram peak (after optionally smoothing the data using standard methods such as a moving average filter) is found for each group. The threshold is then determined by examining the spread in the intensity data around the low-intensity group peak. Define upper and lower bounds of fiducial intensity: (i) F=[median of OFF fiducials], F=[median of ON fiducials], and (iii) F=F\u2212F. Perform an initial split of the data based on the fiducial scale, at the level Splitvalue=F+PeakSplit\u00d7F, where the parameter PeakSplit is a percentage of F. Find  peaks: (i) Peak=the intensity peak for which the histogram is a maximum, for all features of intensity less than Splitvalue, (ii) Peak=the intensity peak for which the histogram is a maximum, for all features of intensity greater than Splitvalue. Calculate the standard deviation, Stdev, of all the features in the neighbourhood of Peak, defined as all index features from the lowest intensity up to Peak+PeakOffsetFraction\u00d7(Peak\u2212Peak), where PeakOffsetFraction is an adjustable parameter. Set the threshold to the lesser of Tand T, which are calculated as follows: (i) T=Peak+StdevMultiple\u00d7Stdev, where StdevMultiple is a parameter, OR T=the intensity corresponding to the minimum of a smoothed histogram curve between Peak and T. Similar approaches using different methods for determining the spread around either peak can also be used.","The methods and systems disclosed herein may comprise detecting one or more labeled features within one or more regions on an array. In some embodiments, detecting a labeled feature within a region may comprise comparing the background corrected signal intensity for a feature with a dynamic signal intensity threshold derived through statistical analysis of the background corrected signal intensities for the complete set of features. When the background corrected signal intensity for a given feature is above the threshold, the feature may be classified as a labeled feature. Alternatively, if the background corrected signal intensity for a given feature is below the threshold, the feature may be classified as non-labeled. Application of a background corrected signal intensity threshold to the corrected signal intensity data for the complete set of features thus constitutes a binary transformation of the data to a digital output wherein features are classified as either labeled (\u201con\u201d) or non-labeled (\u201coff\u201d). Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many possible variations in the type and order of analysis steps that may be applied to achieve this binary transformation.","Calculation of the absolute number of target molecules in a sample.

In some embodiments, it is beneficial to include a numerical measure of the quality of the data, to help to gauge the success of an experiment. In some embodiment, this quality measurement may be based on statistics from the feature-by-feature intensity data. One simple quality measurement Qis simply the difference between the means of the positive and negative features intensities, after background correction and scaling, i.e. Q=(mean intensity of features having an intensity above the signal intensity threshold)\u2212(mean intensity of features having an intensity below the threshold). In some embodiments, this metric may also incorporate the spread in the intensities of the feature distribution(s) by scaling the difference between means by the standard deviation of each distribution, e.g. Q=Q\/(standard deviation of intensities for feature having intensities below the threshold intensity). Other quality measurements can be constructed based on the separation and breadth of modelled distributions which are fitted to the experimental data. In some embodiments, deviance measurement may be used for a quality metric (); this is a calculation based on the degree of separation between two fitted normal distributions. In some embodiments, it is preferable to empirically determine a dynamic intensity threshold by setting the threshold to a value which maximizes a quality metric.","Confidence intervals.

The benefit of performing replicate experiments, and the proper calculation of associated uncertainties, is illustrated in . While results (blue points) from replicate experiments can simply be combined (blue error bars), calculating the uncertainty from Poisson statistics, wherein one considers the replicates as comprising a larger pool of labels, gives the smaller green error bars illustrated in the figure. The accuracy of this estimation will vary depending on the consistency between replicates, and there is a numerical simplification employed in considering the labels of replicate experiments to be a pool of diverse labels.

In the image analysis step, we considered a probe to have intensity above the set intensity threshold, then we referred to the probe as a positive probe, while if the probe intensity was below the set intensity threshold, we referred to the probe as a negative feature. Positive probes were assumed to measure whether there was a significant amount of corresponding complementary oligonucleotide in the sample, while negative features represented absent oligonucleotides. The positive probes were otherwise referred to as labels, meaning we can count up to 960 unique labels or barcodes, to measure 960 copies of oligonucleotides in the sample, which can then be further generalized to predict the actual amount of oligonucleotides in the original sample. Depending on the experiment, out of the M total labels, or 960 total labels, we could calculate the total number of copies, N, of the oligonucleotides in the sample, by predicting N from the actual observed unique barcodes or number of positive probes, k.","The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate one method to compute a threshold for discriminating between labeled and non-labeled features on an array.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0157"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","j"]},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["j","w"],"mo":"-"}},{"mi":["j","w"],"mo":"+"}]},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["d","i"]}},{"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"w"},"mo":"+","mn":"1"}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":["VI.

The sample containing the kan genes was hybridized to an array.  displays a region of the array acquired from the imaging system. The bright intensity at a spot was correlated with a higher probability of a gene being present at the spot. The image analysis software examined the statistics of the intensity distribution, such as deviance, skewness, kurtosis, and median. These statistics provided guidance for the software to automatically choose the best method to detect the presence of kan genes. In this example, a mixture model algorithm was used to determine the intensity threshold to be 6.6, which optimally divided the intensity distribution into \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d domains, as shown in .","The purpose of this experiment was to detect the presence of molecular hybridization in a titration experiment.
