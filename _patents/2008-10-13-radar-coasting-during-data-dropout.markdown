The ability to coast a target is dependent upon the last known state of the target. In the prior art arrangement of , the velocity, which is part of the Cartesian states produced by Kalman filter  of , is fundamentally limited in accuracy when measurements are sparse.","The prior art tracks a target in Cartesian-state as well as in range-state. Range-state is incomplete in describing the location of the target. However, the information that range-state provides is highly precise. The Cartesian-state is more complete, but measurement noise adversely affects its accuracy. In general, a method according to an aspect of the invention provides improved range-state coasting for ballistic targets using a limited set of radar observations or when the flow of radar observations is interrupted. In radar applications, range-state filtering converges very quickly because of the high precision of the range and Doppler data. Coasting in range-state models is or may be less satisfactory than desired because of the difficulty of predicting the effects of gravity in the direction of the range vector. Also, filtering in range-state is subject to the effects of centrifugal accelerations. The effect of gravity and centrifugal accelerations on a ballistic target in Cartesian coordinates is easy to model. The problem with the Cartesian model is that it converges much more slowly than the range-state filter because of the noisier measurements in cross-range (a direction transverse to the range direction). The method according to aspects of the invention takes advantage of the fast convergence of range filtering to \u201cjump start\u201d the Cartesian model. The improved state of the Cartesian model is used to predict gravity and centrifugal accelerations that influence the range states. Range-state coasting is improved with these effects taken into account.","Tracking processor  of  is generally similar to , but incorporates functions according to aspects of the invention.

The measurement data in Cartesian coordinates is Kalman filtered () to thereby produce filtered Cartesian states and covariance. The filtered Cartesian states and covariance are updated () with the instantaneous perpendicular speed to thereby produce improved Cartesian states and improved covariance with improved target velocity. The improved Cartesian states and improved covariance are coasted () at times when the measurement data is interrupted, or is of questionable quality, by the steps of:\n\n","In a particular mode of the method for determining the location and velocity of a target, the step of computing the centrifugal acceleration () is performed according to",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0069"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b1","mo":"=","mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"v","mo":"->"},"munder":{"mn":"1","mi":"_"}}},"mn":"2"},"mi":"r"}}}}},"where","\u03b1 is the centrifugal acceleration;","{right arrow over (v)}is the perpendicular Cartesian velocity vector; and","r is the range.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0075"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":[{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"r"}},{"mtd":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."}}}]}},{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mrow":{"mi":["\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"}]}]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"r"}},{"mtd":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."}}}]}}],"mo":"\u2061"},"mi":"k"}],"mo":"="}}}},"where \u0394t is the update interval\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00011","num":"00011"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"r"}},{"mtd":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."}}}]}},{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mi":"r"}},{"mtd":{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"."}}}]}},{"mi":"k","mo":"+","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":"0.5","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u03b1\u0394","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b1\u0394","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mn":"0.5","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mover":{"mi":"g","mo":"~"},"mi":"\u0394","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mi":"t","mn":"2"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"g","mo":"~"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u0394","t"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}}]}}]}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0026","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0026-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0027","list-style":"none"},"li":["where {tilde over (g)} is the projection of gravity into the line-of-sight extending between the locations of the radar and the target; and","the location of the target is computed by the Cartesian filter."]}}}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
