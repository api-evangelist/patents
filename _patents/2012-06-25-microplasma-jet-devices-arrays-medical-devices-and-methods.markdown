No. 61\/501,053, which was filed Jun. 24, 2011.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. FA9550-07-1-0003 awarded by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Fields of the invention include microplasma devices and arrays, particularly devices and arrays based upon microcavity plasma devices but configured to produce an output jet of plasma. Preferred devices produce low temperature plasma and preferred arrays are configured to produce multiple output jets of plasma. Preferred applications of the invention include medical treatment devices, such as an array configured for the treatment of human tissue (skin, muscle, etc.), and plasma processing of surfaces.","Microcavity plasma devices and arrays have been developed and advanced by researchers at the University of Illinois, including inventors of this application. Devices and arrays have been fabricated in different materials, such as ceramics and semiconductors. Arrays or microcavity devices have also been fabricated in thin metal and metal oxide sheets. Advantageously, microcavity plasma devices confine plasma in cavities having microscopic dimensions and require no ballast, reflector or heavy metal housing. Microcavities in such devices can have different cross-sectional shapes, but generally confine plasma in a cavity having a characteristic dimension in the range of about 5 \u03bcm-500 \u03bcm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","12","22","14"]},"Such previous plasma jet technologies have a number of limitations. First, tubing is often used with diameters that have been large for a single jet, typically on the order of millimeters (mm). Producing a jet in tubing of such a diameter requires very high voltages (many kV) and a high gas flow (typically, several standard liters per minute (SLM)). Another difficulty arises if one wishes to make a plasma source that covers an area as large as possible. \u201cBundling\u201d a number of tubes together, each of which is itself bulky and heavy, is difficult, and is inconvenient for many applications. For this reason, typical multiple jet assemblies developed in the past are not practical.","Burton et al., \u201cInitial Development of the Microcavity Discharge Thruster,\u201d 31September 20-24, (2009) & Chadenedes et al., \u201cAdvances in Microcavity Discharge Thruster Technology,\u201d American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (2010) disclose microjet devices formed in two thin foil layers of Al\/AlO. The layers defined a nozzle in a bowl shape that varied from linear to parabolic in cross-sectional geometry. Chadenedes et al. discloses in  a microjet device formed from two metal\/metal oxide electrodes. The electrodes in  form an aligned cylindrical surface (the surfaces are flush) and the micronozzle in  is a separate structure from the metal\/metal oxide electrodes. The ability to fabricate such a separate nozzle is not described, and the reliability and manufacturability of such a nozzle is not clear.  of Burton et al., describe a \u201cbell shaped\u201d nozzle microjet devices formed in the metal and metal oxide electrodes. The fabrication of a micronozzle is described as a chemical etching after the metal and metal\/oxide foils are combined. The papers, as indicated in Burton et. al are directed to simulations and \u201cproof-of-concept\u201d efforts to produce a thruster for spacecraft. In  of Burton et al, a boron nitride shroud was used at the nozzle and a polyimide coating was used with two electrodes that form an abrupt change in size with a smaller microcavity having a smaller cylindrical microcavity.  of Burton et al shows the bowl\/bell shaped nozzle. The \u201csupersonic nozzle\u201d of  or is shown as not being unitary with either of the electrodes. Moderate efficiencies are reported on page 7 for providing thrust by Burton et al., which proposes improvements might be achieved by \u201cby coupling to a micronozzle for which performance has been characterized\u201d and \u201cthe efficiency of the thruster can be further increased with improvements to the manufacturing process.\u201d No solution is proposed in Burton for coupling a nozzle with optimal contours that are discussed on page 7 as being desirable.","Preferred embodiments of the present invention include microplasma jet devices and arrays in various materials, and low temperature microplasma jet devices and arrays. These include preferred embodiment single microplasma jet devices and arrays of devices formed in monolithic polymer blocks with elongated microcavities. The arrays can be densely packed, for example having 100 jets in an area of a few square centimeters. Additional embodiments include metal\/metal oxide microplasma jet devices that have micronozzles defined in the metal oxide itself. Methods of fabrication of microplasma jet devices are also provided by the invention, and the methods have been demonstrated as being capable of producing tailored micronozzle contours that are unitary with the material insulating electrodes.","This invention provides for one or an array of low temperature microplasma jet devices. Low temperature plasma is emitted in a jet from a micro nozzle that provides the exit from a microcavity. The low temperature plasma jet is suitable for treating human or animal tissue. Other applications include disinfecting or producing a thin film on a temperature-sensitive surface. Preferred embodiment devices are formed in metal and metal oxide, or within a polymer. In the polymer an elongated microcavity provides part of the necessary conditions for producing a controlled plasma jet and in metal and metal oxide embodiments, a smooth contoured micronozzle is defined as a unitary part of the metal that encapsulates electrodes that drive microplasma jet device or devices. Shaped microcavities provide a unitary nozzle exit for the focused ejection of microplasma from a flowing gaseous stream directed through the microcavities while electrodes stimulate and maintain plasma generation. A gas supply provides a flow of one or more feedstock gases or vapors through the microcavities of a plasma device, and a microplasma jet is generated that extends for a substantial distance out of the micronozzle, up to several centimeters in room air.","Nozzles can be fabricated by methods of the invention to have precisely-controlled surfaces that allow for the plasma effluent to have particular properties with regard to temperature and velocity. A power supply provides power to the electrodes. Flexible arrays can be used to form the basis for medical devices that can be shaped in sleeves and collars, for example, to uniformly treat areas of tissue. Other shapes can be formed, including, for example, tubes (cylinders) and balls that emit microplasma jets from their outer portions. The control of cavity shape and use of multiple array layers in preferred fabrication methods also permits that formation of arrays that emit in patterns, such as divergent or convergent patterns. Arrays can be formed to expel microplasma jets along a wide variety of predetermined paths.","The invention also provides for microplasma jet arrays that are formed in a monolithic block of polymer. Electrodes are encapsulated in the monolithic block of polymer, and the polymer is preferably selected to be suitable for contact with human skin, which permits the microplasma jet arrays to be used for the treatment of human tissue. Medical applications include the disinfection of tissue, and wounds, including during surgery, and the promotion of wound and tissue healing. Arrays are also used, for example, for the surface treatment of various inanimate materials, including the curing of polymer films and the deposition of thin films on temperature-sensitive surfaces.","Embodiments of the invention provide practical arrays for important applications that were not contemplated or ill-served by prior devices discussed in the background. Microplasma jets of the invention are realized from microcavity plasma devices that expel plasma well outside of the microcavity in which the plasma is generated and can provide low temperature plasma. For example, plasma might be delivered to a surface well-removed from the cavity. Some applications would benefit from remote processing that can be provided by devices and arrays of the invention, where plasma is extracted and expelled into surrounding environments, including gaseous and liquid environments. Certain medical and surface processing applications can benefit from such efficient microplasma jet devices. Medical and surface processing applications can use constituents of a microplasma jet, namely ions, electrons, radicals and photons, to favorably affect a surface.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic representations that will be understood by artisans in view of the general knowledge in the art and the description that follows. Features may be exaggerated in the drawings for emphasis, and features may not be to scale. Artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention from the description of the preferred embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2D","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","32","30","36","36","12","18","20","36","38","36","40","38"],"sub":["2","2","2"]},"The electrodes  can be, for example, foils, rods, wires and deposited metal layers. The polymer  is formed from thermally curable or UV curable polymers. The diameters of the microcavities  can be from 1 \u03bcm to about 5 mm and the elongated microcavities  can be very long in polymer, being unlimited in practical terms relative to the diameter of the microcavities . The electrodes  are buried within and encapsulated by the polymer block  to isolate them from the elongated microcavities  and plasma generated therein, and are connected to the power supply  delivering the time-varying voltage V.","Both arrays of FIGS. A\/B and C\/D include a plurality the elongated microcavities  (in this instance, generally circular in cross-section) that are formed in the monolithic \u201cblock\u201d of a polymer . The microcavities can also have other cross-sections, e.g., rectangular. The polymer  is preferably a siloxane that is flexible, transparent, and is approved by the FDA for contact with human skin, which is important for applications of the invention that relate to the treatment of human skin.","With a device or an array of the invention, the shape of the microcavity  and micronozzle exit at the end of the microcavity  and the gas supplied by the gas supply  are preferably selected to ensure that a plasma jet emitted from the microcavities  is low temperature (preferably less than 500K and most preferably <100\u00b0 C. above room temperature, which is achieved with rare gases such as neon and argon), and therefore suitable, for example for contact with human tissue. In addition, the shape of the micronozzle exit  preferably provides a convergent jet by focusing the gas flow of an individual device. In addition, devices in arrays can be configured such that the plasma effluent from multiple devices converges, diverges or remains parallel.","The feedstock gas delivered by the gas supply  in preferred embodiments can be one or more of a variety of atomic and molecular gases, including the rare gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) and N. Production of a plasma in the elongated microcavities  generates electrons and ions, as well as exited atoms and molecules that can have internal energies as high as 10-20 eV. Particularly long-lived atomic or molecular states, such as metastable states of the rare gas atoms, are particularly effective in transferring energy to a second, \u201cacceptor\u201d species. The Renning ionization of Nby the He atom in its metastable state to produce the B state of N is an important example.","The different between the arrays of  and C-D concern the electrode arrangements. In both embodiments, the elongated microcavities  are arranged in rows, and the rows are interleaved with electrodes . The electrodes  can be formed from metal foil, a wire grid, mesh or a deposited metal layer. Methods of fabrication in the present invention provide for plasma elongated microcavities having diameters in the range of 1 \u03bcm to 5 mm to be fabricated. Both embodiments show a 5\u00d75 array of elongated microcavities with an electrode  disposed between each row.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIGS. 2C and 2D","FIGS. 2A-2D"],"b":["32","36"]},"The plasma produced in preferred microplasma jet devices of the invention are low temperature plasmas in which the electron temperature is much higher than the gas temperature. Experiments indicate that the electron temperature of plasma in microcavities of microplasma jet devices of the invention is higher than that of the plasma stream emerging from the exit of the device. Within the plasma effluent, energetic species (such as metastable atoms and molecules) are also propelled with the jet and radiation (including, for example, in the visible range and short wavelength ultraviolet range) is also generated. These species and the ultraviolet light that can be produced by the plasma are lethal to many (virtually all) bacteria and viruses and, hence, the interest of many researchers in disinfection.","Additional embodiments illustrated in  also show a 5\u00d75 microplasma jet array. These embodiments differ only in their electrode configuration. All are formed in polymer blocks as described above. The array in  has a similar electrode configuration to the embodiment of , in that electrodes  in the same vertical plane are electrically connected, with  showing 4 sets of electrodes  in vertical planes. In , the 3 sets of electrode columns are electrically connected as group and a time varying-voltage is applied between the group and the 4set that is nearest to the flow tube (elongated microcavities ). In , there are horizontal and vertical sets of electrodes in encapsulated in the polymer block . In , three columns of horizontally-oriented electrodes  are electrically connected and a ring electrode is installed \u201cupstream\u201d of the cylindrical microcavities . Note also that only one flow tube  is required to deliver gas to the entire array of plasma channels. Because the flow tube  can be flexible, the entire assembly can be lightweight and handheld, such as by a surgeon or technician. For a medical device, the array can be part of a wand or otherwise be configured to be held and manipulated by a user, such as by a medical professional treating the skin of a patient.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3G","FIG. 4","FIGS. 2A-2J","FIG. 4","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 4","FIG. 3B","FIGS. 2C and 2D"]},"A first step () entails the design and construction of a mold, which includes installation of an array of elongated microcavity forming pins, such as microscale needles, rods or similar structure, that will serve to form elongated microcavities in a polymer block. The outer diameter of the pins should be the desired diameter of the elongated microcavities to be formed. The pins can have different shapes to produce elongated microcavities having various cross sections, e.g., diamond, elliptical and circular. The mold can be made from any convenient material that will hold the pins. Experiments even showed that LEGO\u00ae toy blocks are suitable to use as a mold, as one example.","The mold in  also includes side shoulders that have a plurality of slots. The slots are offset between rows of the arrays. The top view of  shows slots on both sides of the mold and  show that the slots hold electrodes, such as planar electrodes. In , multiple electrodes are held in the slots and vertically separated from each other. This can be achieved in different ways with the shoulders, such as by constructing the shoulders in segments such that a first segment has a slot on its top, electrodes are placed, an additional shoulder is added with more slots, electrodes are placed, and so forth. Other options, such as cross pins and other standard techniques can support multiple levels of electrodes vertically in a slot. The assembly of such a structure can, of course, be automated.","In , the mold is placed within a container that can contain a volume of heat-curable polymer. In , the volume of the container is partially or completely filled with a heat-curable polymer. In , after removing air bubbles, the polymer is thermally cured at a suitable temperature and for a suitable time period that will depend upon the particular polymer. In experiments with siloxane polymers used to date, curing times up to about one hour with temperatures in the range of 80-100\u00b0 C. were demonstrated to be suitable. After the initial curing, the solidified block is removed from the enclosure (or, alternatively, the enclosure is dismantled), the electrode support structure\/mold base is removed, and the entire device is cured a second time at 80-100\u00b0 C. Subsequently, the channel-forming rods (or pins) are removed and the polymer block is trimmed to the desired size. When the polymer is cured properly, removal of the channel-forming rods is straightforward and the walls of the resulting microcavities are smooth having no pits or imperfections.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5G","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5C","FIG. 5D","FIG. 5E","FIG. 5F","FIG. 5G"],"b":["50","52","50"]},"Experimental devices formed in polymer have produced low temperature microplasma jets.  is photograph of a 5\u00d72 array of microplasma jets operated with a He flow rate of \u02dc4.6 SLM.
