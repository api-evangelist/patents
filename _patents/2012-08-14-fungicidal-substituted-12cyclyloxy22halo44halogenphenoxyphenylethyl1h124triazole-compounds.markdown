compounds I and VIII and the compositions according to the invention, respectively, are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides.

Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.","Plants that have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering, e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides, such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2,4-D; bleacher herbicides such as hydroxyl-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors or phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitors; acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones; enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) inhibitors, such as glyphosate; glutamine synthetase (GS) inhibitors such as glufosinate; protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors; lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors; or oxynil (i.e. bromoxynil or ioxynil) herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore, plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications, such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors, HPPD inhibitors, auxin herbicides, or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e.g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61, 2005, 246; 61, 2005, 258; 61, 2005, 277; 61, 2005, 269; 61, 2005, 286; 64, 2008, 326; 64, 2008, 332; Weed Sci. 57, 2009, 108; Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58, 2007, 708; Science 316, 2007, 1185; and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis), e.g. Clearfield\u00ae summer rape (Canola, BASF SE, Germany) being tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, or ExpressSun\u00ae sunflowers (DuPont, USA) being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas, e.g. tribenuron.
