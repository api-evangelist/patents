In many cases, these mobile computing devices may gain access and control over a user's various accounts, both business and personal, by provisioning communications between two or more networks, wireless or otherwise. In these cases, a user may exercise specific control over a given account such as changing account settings, adjusting service levels, and\/or modifying the user's personal information, and so on.","In today's electronic and mobile environment, it is common for a user of a mobile computing device to link one network to another network or to a hardware device through a defined protocol established by the mobile computing device network provider and any other network involved. However, often such a protocol may not be as user-friendly as desired by the user. For example, one protocol to link networks and\/or hardware devices may require accessing an account through a website via an Internet connection, entering a number or code provided by a hardware device or second network, all while communicating over a third party network. Another scenario may require a user to call technical support and request permission to establish communications between networks and\/or hardware, or to obtain permission to control a device. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, linking mobile computing devices and their respective networks to other networks or to hardware devices in a simplified manner may provide useful benefits for the user.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the present invention has been made.","The above and other problems are solved by allowing a user of a mobile computing device to link the mobile computing device and its associated network or system to a second network or system for permitting the mobile computing device to have functional operation within the second network or system.","According to one embodiment, a mobile computing device, for example, a wireless telephone operating over its designated wireless network may be linked to a piece of hardware operating via a second network or system. Once the mobile computing device is linked to the subject piece of hardware, operational control over the subject piece of hardware may be exercised from the mobile computing device. For example, a wireless telephone may be linked to a cable television services system set-top box to allow operational control of the set-top box (e.g., setting viewing channels, controlling recording devices, etc.) from the linked wireless telephone. In addition to operational control over the subject piece of hardware, the mobile computing device may be used to access and edit if desired account information associated with the subject piece of hardware.","The mobile computing device may be linked to the subject piece of hardware and its associated network or operating system by registering the mobile computing device with the associated network or operating system to allow the mobile computing device to obtain operational control over the subject piece of hardware. The mobile computing device may obtain identification information from the subject piece of hardware that may be passed to the network or operating system associated with the subject piece of hardware and that may be used to associate the mobile computing device with the subject piece of hardware. According to embodiments, identification information may be obtained by communication between the mobile computing device and the subject piece of hardware according to a variety of means. According to one aspect, a bar code label affixed to or associated with the subject piece of hardware may be photographically captured by the mobile computing device and identification information encoded on the bar code label may be used to register the mobile computing device with the network or operating system associated with the subject piece of hardware. According to another aspect, the subject piece of hardware may transmit identification information to the mobile computing device via infrared communication, Bluetooth communication, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) communication, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) communication, and the like.","The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and description below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that the following detailed description is explanatory only and is not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","As briefly described above, embodiments of the present invention are directed to allowing a user of a mobile computing device to link the mobile computing device and its associated network or system to a subject piece of hardware operating via a second network or system for permitting the mobile computing device to have functional operation within the second network or system with respect to the subject piece of hardware. For example, a wireless telephone may be linked to a cable television services system set-top box to allow operational control of the set-top box (e.g., setting viewing channels, controlling recording devices, etc.) from the linked wireless telephone. In addition to operational control over the subject piece of hardware, the mobile computing device may be used to access and edit, if desired, account information associated with the subject piece of hardware.","According to embodiments, the term \u201cmobile computing device\u201d will be used herein to describe a mobile wireless electronic communication device, such as a wireless telephone, handheld computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, and the like capable of sending and receiving electronic communications.

Additionally, the user may be able to utilize features that may be provisioned for the specified network (e.g., home network).","These embodiments may be combined, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several figures, embodiments of the present invention and an exemplary operating environment will be described.","As described above, the network\/system  under which the hardware device  operates may be any system under which any hardware device operates that may be associated with a mobile computing device to allow the mobile computing device to control the hardware device and\/or access information associated with the hardware device. For example the network\/system  may include, but not be limited to, a cable television services (CATV) system, a Satellite TV (SATV) services system, an Internet services system (ISP), and the like. For purposes of illustration,  is simplified block diagram illustrating a wireless communication network  and a CATV network\/system  that may serve as one exemplary operating environment for the present invention. As should be understood, the example network architectures illustrated in  are for purposes of example and are not limiting of a variety of communication configurations that may be utilized as described herein.","Referring now to , wireless communications services are provided by various service provider companies through a wireless network . As is known to those skilled in the art, wireless networks may consist of but not be limited to cellular towers , base stations, and a Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO) . As is known to those skilled in the art, a cellular tower  typically consists of a steel pole or lattice structure outfitted with antennae for transmitting and receiving signals to and from mobile computing devices, other cellular towers, and the MTSO. Each cellular tower  may have multiple sets of antenna mounted, depending upon how many different service providers use the tower . The base of each cellular tower  includes sets of transmitters and receivers from each service provider having antennae mounted to the tower . As a unit, the cellular tower  and the base form a system capable of transmitting, receiving, and managing data. This data may consist of, but not be limited to, voice, text, and\/or electronic media. As is understood by those skilled in the art, wireless systems typically operate at various frequencies (e.g., across a frequency range from 800 megahertz (MHz) to 1900 MHz), depending upon which wireless technology is utilized. According to the embodiments of the present invention, mobile computing device  to hardware device  linking may operate across this typical network of wireless systems, and therefore, in the same frequency ranges.","Referring still to , an MTSO  serves as a central control center for the base stations operating in a given wireless communications area. For example, an MTSO  may be configured for controlling wireless communications for a wireless service provider operating in a specified city or other suitable operating area or region. In addition to other operating functions of the MTSO, according to embodiments of the present invention, the MTSO  may serve as control point for determining, providing and controlling subscriber features.

According to embodiments of the present invention, the functionality of the HFC network  allows for efficient bidirectional data flow between the client-side set-top box  and the server-side application server  of the present invention.","On the client side of the CATV system , digital and analog video programming and digital and analog data are provided to the customer television set  via the set-top box (STB) . Interactive television services that allow a customer to input data to the CATV system  likewise are provided by the STB . As illustrated in , the STB  is a multipurpose computing device having a computer processor, memory and an input\/output mechanism. The input\/output mechanism of a STB  receives input from server-side processes via the HFC network  and from customers via input devices such as the remote control device  and the keyboard . The remote control device  and the keyboard  may communicate with the STB  via a suitable communication transport such as the infrared connection . The STB  also includes a video processor for processing and providing digital and analog video signaling to the television set  via a cable communication transport . A multi-channel tuner is provided for processing video and data to and from the STB  and the server-side head end system , described below.","The STB  also includes an operating system  for directing the functions of the STB  in conjunction with a variety of client applications . For example, if a client application  requires a news flash from a third-party news source to be displayed on the television , the operating system  may cause the graphics functionality and video processor of the STB , for example, to output the news flash to the television  at the direction of the client application  responsible for displaying news items.","Because a variety of different operating systems  may be utilized by a variety of different brands and types of set-top boxes, a middleware layer  is provided to allow a given software application to be executed by a variety of different operating systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the middleware layer  may include a set of application programming interfaces (API) that are exposed to client applications  and operating systems  that allow the client applications to communicate with the operating systems through common data calls understood via the API set. As described below, a corresponding middleware layer is included on the server side of the CATV system  for facilitating communication between the server-side application server and the client-side STB .","As is understood by those skilled in the art, the \u201cin band\u201d signaling space may operate across a variety of frequency ranges, for example, at a frequency between 54 and 1000 megahertz. The signaling space is generally divided into 6 megahertz channels in which may be transmitted a single analog signal or a greater number (e.g., up to ten) digital signals.","Referring still to , the head end  of the CATV system  is positioned on the server side of the CATV system and includes hardware and software systems responsible for originating and managing content for distributing through the HFC network  to client-side STBs  for presentation to customers via televisions . As described above, a number of services may be provided by the CATV system , including digital and analog video programming, interactive television services, telephone services, video-on-demand services, targeted advertising, and provision of information content.","The application server  is a general-purpose computing system operative to assemble and manage data sent to and received from the client-side set-top box  via the HFC network .","As illustrated in , the services provider data services  include a number of services operated by the services provider of the CATV system  which may include data on a given customer. For example, a billing system  may include information such as a customer's name, street address, business identification number, Social Security number, credit history, and information regarding services and products subscribed to by the customer. An electronic mail system  may contain information such as electronic mail addresses, high-speed Internet access subscription information and electronic mail usage data. A hardware linking system  may include information such as secure user names and passwords utilized by customers for access to network services and protocols for establishing a link.","The customer information database  may include general information about customers such as place of employment, business address, business telephone number and demographic information such as age, gender, educational level, and the like. The customer information database may also include information on products and services subscribed to by a customer from the cable services provider. For example, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the customer information database may contain data to allow a determination as to whether a particular product or service is already provisioned at a customer service address or whether a work order is pending for a particular product or service provisioning at the customer service address. The customer information database may also include information that allows for a determination as to whether prerequisites for provisioning a requested product of service are met by a requesting customer. For example, if a customer requests electronic mail services and high speed Internet access is a prerequisite for electronic mail services, the customer information database may be queried to determine whether the required Internet access is provisioned at the requesting customer location or address.","As should be understood by those skilled in the art, the disparate data services systems , , ,  are illustrated as a collection of data services for purposes of example only. The example data services systems comprising the data services  may operate as separate data services systems, which communicate with a web services system (described below) along a number of different communication paths and according to a number of different communication protocols.","Referring still to , a web services system  is illustrated between the application server  and the data services . According to embodiments of the present invention, the web services system  serves as a collection point for data requested from each of the disparate data services systems comprising the data services . When the application server  requires customer profile data from one or more of the data services  for preparation or update of a customer profile, the application server  passes a data query to the web services system . The web services system formulates a data query to each of the available data services systems for obtaining any available data for a given customer as identified by a set-top box identification associated with the customer. The web services system  serves as an abstraction layer between the various data services systems and the application server . That is, the application server  is not required to communicate with the disparate data services systems, nor is the application server  required to understand the data structures or data types utilized by the disparate data services systems. The web services system  is operative to communicate with each of the disparate data services systems for obtaining necessary customer profile data. The customer profile data obtained by the web services system is assembled and is returned to the application server  for ultimate processing via the middleware layer , as described above.","According to embodiments of the present invention, a mobile computing device  may access the CATV system  via the wireless network , illustrated in  in order to access and utilize one or more applications, features, or services available to the user via the CATV system . The mobile computing device  may gain access to the desired applications, features, or services in a variety of suitable methods. According to one method, the mobile computing device  may access the CATV  via the IP network  to the Web Services System  and Data Services platform .","Referring now to , a diagram of a mobile computing device  with which embodiments of the present invention may be practiced is illustrated. The mobile computing device  may operate via the wireless network  described above, or via other connectivity technologies, such as via WiFi, and is illustrative of any suitable device, such as a mobile telephone, personal digital assistant, smart phone, or handheld computer, operative to send, receive and process wireless communications according to embodiments of the present invention.
