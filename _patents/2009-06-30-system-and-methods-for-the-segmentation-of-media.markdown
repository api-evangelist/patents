Field of Invention","The present invention generally relates to the collection of media, and more particularly to a system and methods for the search, collection, saving, and segmentation of media for use in, among other things, a network-based multimedia presentation.","2. Related Art","Multimedia is media and content that utilizes a combination of different content forms. The term is used in contrast to media that only utilizes traditional forms of printed or hand-produced text and still graphics. In general, multimedia includes a combination of text, audio, still images, animation, video, and interactivity content forms. Multimedia is usually recorded and played, displayed, or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices. Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, social marketing, advertisement, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research and spatial temporal applications.","A variety of online websites are presently available to enable the creation and presentation including the publication of some form of multimedia. For example, MixerCast enables a user to build a social marketing application from scratch. Scrapblog enables a user to combine photos, videos, audio and text to create multimedia scrapbooks. Smilebox facilitates \u201ccreative messaging\u201d that draws elements from photo services, scrapbooking, and e-cards.","Each website will typically provide one or more online tools for the creation and customization of the multimedia. Such online tools and\/or desktop tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc., allow the user to collect, edit, create, and publish or distribute the multimedia. In this regard, various style presentations may be utilized, photos may be resized and text may be added, video may be inserted, and\/or links to other sites or presentations may be provided. Despite providing some level of customization, multimedia tools currently available are often cumbersome and difficult to use and thus limit the self-expression and creativity of the non-professional user when creating multimedia presentations. Accordingly, there exists a need for a relatively more robust multimedia creation tool including a system and methods for the search, collection, saving, and segmentation of media for use in, among other things, a network-based multimedia presentation.","For purposes of summarizing the disclosure, exemplary embodiments of systems and methods for automatic media population of a style presentation have been described herein.","In one embodiment, a computer implemented method for the collection and segmentation of media, the method comprises selecting a media search source via a user interface; providing a form-based interface that allow the entry of inputs to form a media search query; submitting the media search query to the media search source; receiving a media search result for viewing on the user interface based on the media search query, the media search result comprising media items; displaying the media search result in a collection depository on the user interface; and dividing at least one of the media items into a plurality of relatively smaller segments, wherein the method is performed by one or more processors adapted to execute instructions stored on one or more memory components of the computer.","In another embodiment, a computer system for the collection and segmentation of media, the system comprises a storage device; a processing element having a processing program and access to the storage device; and a process-readable medium having executable instructions thereon to direct the processing system when used by the processing element to: select a media search source via a user interface; provide a form-based interface that allow the entry of inputs to form a media search query; submit the media search query to the media search source; receive a media search result for viewing on the user interface based on the media search query, the media search result comprising media items; display the media search result in a collection depository on the user interface; and divide at least one of the media items into a plurality of relatively smaller segments.","In still another embodiment, a computer-readable medium having a computer executable instructions for performing a method comprises selecting a media search source via a user interface; providing a form-based interface that allow the entry of inputs to form a media search query; submitting the media search query to the media search source; receiving a media search result for viewing on the user interface based on the media search query, the media search result comprising media items; displaying the media search result in a collection depository on the user interface; and dividing at least one of the media items into a plurality of relatively smaller segments","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Exemplary embodiments and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating exemplary embodiments and not for purposes of limiting the same.","Embodiments of the present disclosure related to systems and methods for the automatic media population of a style presentation. As indicated above, multimedia presentations may find application in various areas including, but not limited to, social marketing, advertisement, art, education, entertainment, engineering, medicine, mathematics, business, scientific research and spatial temporal applications.","In one embodiment a system and method provides for a robust end-to-end digital media creation architecture that enables a user to create rich multimedia presentations and clips online with real-time editing and authoring, and then share or publish the media online. As shown in , the system  includes at least one client device  (e.g., network computing device), one or more multimedia distribution channels  (e.g., network server devices), and at least one service provider device  (e.g., network server device) in communication over the network .","In one embodiment, the network  may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of communication networks.

It should be appreciated that the client device  may be referred to as a user device or customer device without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.","In one embodiment, the client device  includes a user interface application  that may be utilized by a user  to conduct information transactions with the distribution channels  and the service provider server  over the network . For example, the user interface application  may be implemented as a multimedia presentation application to collect, create and publish information via the network . In various implementations, multimedia presentations may be published to and\/or shared with one or more of the multimedia channels  via the user interface application  over the network .","In one implementation, the user interface application  comprises a software program, such as a graphical user interface (GUI), executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with the multimedia channels  and the service provider server  via the network . In another implementation, the user interface application  comprises a browser module that provides a network interface to browse information available over the network . For example, the user interface application  may be implemented, in part, as a web browser to view information available over the network . In another example, each member of the user group  is able to access multimedia websites via the one or more multimedia channels  to view, collect and publish multimedia presentations over the network .","In various embodiments, the client device  may include other applications as may be desired in one or more implementations to provide additional features available to the user . In one example, such other applications may include security applications for implementing client-side security features, programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network  or various other types of generally known programs and\/or applications. In other examples, these other applications may interface with the user interface application  for improved efficiency and convenience. For example, files, data, and\/or various types of information may be imported from multimedia software directly into the user interface application  for ease of access to multimedia files (e.g., audio, video, pictures, clip-art, etc.).","The client device  may include a user identifier, which may be implemented, for example, as operating system registry entries, cookies associated with the user interface application , identifiers associated with hardware of the client device , or various other appropriate identifiers. The user identifier may include attributes related to the user , such as personal information (e.g., a user name, password, etc.). In one implementation, the user identifier may be passed to the service provider server  during publishing and\/or sharing of a multimedia presentation.","In one embodiment, the multimedia distribution channels  may be maintained by one or more resource providers and\/or entities (e.g., social networking sites, resource information sites, management sites, merchant sites, etc.) in communication with the network . In this regard, the service provider server , discussed below, may maintain or provide access to the one or more of the multimedia distribution channels. The multimedia distribution channels  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In one implementation, the multimedia distribution channels  may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and\/or wireless communication with the network .","In one embodiment, the service provider server  may be maintained by an online transaction processing provider and\/or entity in communication with the network . As such, the service provider server  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over the network . In one implementation, the service provider server  may be implemented as a network computing device (e.g., a network server) in wired and\/or wireless communication with the network .","As further shown in , the service provider server  includes a service interface application , which may be adapted to interact with the client device  to facilitate the collection of media, as well as the creation including editing and the publishing and\/or sharing of multimedia presentations over a network. In one example, the service provider server  may be provided and implemented by PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., USA.","The service application , in one embodiment, utilizes a collect module , a create module , and a publish module  running on a standard web browser to collect information, create presentations, and publish presentations, respectively. As described in greater detail herein, the modules , ,  enable users, such as the user , to collect diverse types of audio and visual media, create rich multimedia presentations with real-time editing and authoring using media software, such as Flash, and then share and\/or publish the rich multimedia presentations with other users via the network . In one example, the collect, create, and publish modules , ,  may be implemented within a standard web browser for interfacing with the user .","In one implementation, the user  is able to share multimedia presentations with other users via the media channels  and\/or embed multimedia presentations directly in webpages of other users. For example, the user  may provide a unique URL link for the multimedia presentation to other users. In another example, the user  may directly email multimedia presentations to multiple recipients and include a message with the email. In still another example, the user  may provide the source HTML (i.e., HyperText Markup Language) code to other users and\/or embed the source HTML code directly into another user's webpage. Still other examples include the ability to publish multimedia presentations on a website to sell a particular item or service for purchase. For items and\/or services, a media rich presentation may help users market and sell items and\/or services, which may be valuable for high-end or high-priced items and\/or services. Social and\/or dating sites may utilize these multimedia presentations to provide online users with a way to better present themselves to other online users. In various implementations, some type of webpage may be presented in a more dynamic manner by utilizing Rich Site Summary (RSS) Feeds, since, for example, a particular user's presentation may be continually changing with new media.","In various embodiments, the service provider server  may be configured to maintain, store and\/or archive multimedia presentations in a database , each of which may include information related to one or more users, such as the user , and one or more multimedia channels, such as multimedia distributions channels . In various examples, the multimedia presentations may include attributes stored as part thereof, and the attributes may be passed to the service provider server  as part of a creating, publishing and\/or sharing the multimedia presentations.","Referring to  and , in one embodiment, the collect module  includes search modules , , , , etc., to enable the user  to search, collect, view, and, store\/save media including multimedia. Such media including audio, photographic images, video, and music media from a service source, such as a PC, RSS feeds, websites, and any other online source, is searched and collected via a user interface, such as the user interface application , to a collection depository or library  associated with and viewable at same time as the storyboard  on the GUI of the interface application .","In various implementations, the user interface application  comprises multiple search tabs and\/or links for the various search sources. Search-based modules - are aggregated in a drop-down combo interface  indexed by media type and media provider (). Each search provider or search source advertises the media types it indexes, and the number of type of inputs the search provider handles. For example, a search of the Flickr community may be done via \u201cuser\u201d, \u201ctag\u201d, or \u201cfull text\u201d. When a search provider or search source is selected, the user interface updates  to show a form-based interface that allows the user to enter necessary query inputs (). Depending on the type of search provider or search source, when the user initiates a search, the request goes either to a service system server-side component  or directly to a third-party server-side component. When the request is to the search system the server-side component handles all details of contacting the third party API, avoiding any browser security issues, and allowing any results from the third-party to be normalized and cached, if desired. When requests go directly to the third-party server, that is a search source or search provider other than the service provider , the requests are subject to cross-site data restrictions imposed by the browsers and the Flash environment, and additional logic is needed to normalize any results to the service provider data model.","Search base modules may include account-based modules such as Flickr , mentioned above, and Picasa  that present an authentication interface allowing a user to connect to the user's public and\/or private photos at a third-party hosting service. Depending on the APIs supported by the third-party, users can browse, sort, and select media from corresponding user accounts once the associated user has be authenticated.","Use of the collect module enables key words to be selected to form a search query to search photos in Flickr or videos in YouTube. For example, selecting the \u201cfull text\u201d search criteria and typing in \u201csunflowers\u201d in a Flickr search query results in pictures of sunflowers or photos from Flickr being presented on the user's GUI or media page. A result of the aforementioned search query in Flickr is shown in . The collected media (sunflowers) may be viewed individually as shown in  or as photo clusters as shown in .","In this regard, the collect module or step enables the user to cluster media associated with a variable number of related media items in the collection depository and that can be dragged and dropped into the storyboard  The storyboard  is generally considered an area of the GUI reserved for the media that is later used in the creation of rich multimedia presentations. In this regard, during the process of media collection, the collection depository  may include multiple photos from a first search source, multiple photos from a second search source, or multiple videos from yet another search source while the storyboard  includes only those photos, videos, images, etc., that are at least at some point intended to be included in the creation of a rich multimedia presentation.","Media may be clustered based on time and author of the media. If the user selects the cluster mode from the media page (), the system performs a simple time based clustering using a sliding window. If consecutive photos fall within the window they are clustered together. The window duration is chosen based on a heuristic, generally, between for example, 10 seconds and 15 minutes are use based on the search provider. For example, as shown in , each media item includes credits such as date created, source (Flickr.com), and author (Sankova.o). As such, in one embodiment, those photos collected within a predetermined time frame by the same author may be clustered together. In this regard, the size or number or media items in each cluster may vary. In an alternative embodiment, the user might be able to interactively adjust the window. Because large clusters can be undesirable, the system may split clusters above a predetermined maximum size. To split a cluster a sorted list of time differentials is created. The system then attempts to cluster by the largest time difference until all sub-clusters are smaller than the maximum predetermined cluster size.","The architecture allows explicit media to be added to the storyboard  or the entire query itself to be added to the storyboard . Placing desired media on the storyboard or clip board may be accomplished by dragging and dropping. As shown in , the user can drag and drop desired individual pictures and\/or clusters of pictures onto a storyboard  on the same screen as the collection depository . The pictures can be edited into stacks if desired. In another example, the collect module  provides media on a user's media page (i.e., not placed on the storyboard). For example, with videos, a desired video can be placed onto the user's media page by typing in the corresponding URL in YouTube. The system can then display the complete as well as a series of shorter video clips.","In this regard, the collect module or step enables the user to collect video and to separate or section the video into a cluster of smaller separate video segments. More specifically, media including video, as well as audio\/music, may be divided into a plurality of relatively smaller segments of a predetermined duration. The segment duration may be based on time or data size. The whole video or selected shorter clips, as well as the photos can then be dragged and dropped (relocated) into the storybook  section to create a presentation from the media collected.","The collect module  or step may include a \u201csave\u201d icon to enable the user to save media collected from the search source or external API in the collect depository  or storyboard  so that when the storyboard  is accessed, the media is easily accessible and available for use in editing or creating rich multimedia presentations in the storyboard . In addition, the collect module  permits the search query to be saved; allowing for a \u201cshortcut\u2019 to the query to be quickly accessed.","In this regard, as shown in , all of the search-based modules - support persisting the query inputs, i.e., search query, to the search source as a Feed or network search path. In this regard, when the user starts a session, for example, with a particular application, the server returns a list of custom categories the user has created, and a list of Feeds the user has created (). Each Feed has a title, a category, and an xml-based persistence of the user inputs (). The user then saves the search query as a network search or file path. If the user selects the Feed, i.e. \u201cNew category\u201d and \u201csunflowers\u201d from one of the multiple search tabs within the \u201cmy media\u201d tab the application resubmits the query and displays the resulting media ().","In an alternative version of a Feed, the storyboard contents can be persisted as a Feed to allow saved references from multiple sources in one book marked location. Rather than persisting query inputs, the Feed contains an xml representation of the clusters of media with sufficient information to reconnect to the media, typically a URL, media type, and possibly some additional user created metadata such as a title or caption. The architecture further allows \u201cdynamic\u201d Feeds to search and saved for later use in creating multimedia presentations.","In an example of \u201cdynamic media\u201d, the user can search photos in the user's Picasa account or an RSS Feed of \u201cYahoo Most Viewed\u201d (). In one embodiment, the photos or RSS Feed are automatically shown at the bottom of the viewing page, as well as in a style viewing area  corresponding to the style chosen. As shown in , the RSS Feed of Yahoo's Most Viewed is displayed in a postcard style corresponding to the selected postcard style. The viewing page allows the user to select via a select slider  how many photos, videos, etc., are to be in the collected presentation page. For example, the number may default to twenty, but the user may select a different number and new photos with automatically be added or deleted from the currently viewed photos. Individual photos, videos, etc., which represent some event, may be selected within the style viewing area  to access event related information and\/or an event related URL where the related information provided.","As mentioned above, just as photos from Flickr or other sources may be saved in the database , so to may the \u201cdynamic\u201d content of the RSS Feed and similar search services by selection of a save or \u201cI'm done\u201d icon , and added to a multimedia presentation. In this regard, in saving the \u201cdynamic\u201d content of the RSS Feed (\u201cYahoo Most Viewed\u201d) a URL permalink (network search path or file path)  is assigned to the RSS Feed (). The URL permalink  may then be added as a \u201chot spot\u201d or as an individual frame within a multimedia presentation that is slightly different each time the presentation is viewed due to its \u201cdynamic\u201d or changing nature. The \u201cdynamic\u201d media object can refer to API calls, RSS Feeds, search queries, or any type of external call to a database where the parameters of that query can retrieve data or media dynamically.","As indicated above, once collected, the media may be saved and further categorized in the database  and edited on the system site via the service provider server . Editing may occur on the media page or in the storyboard and include one or more of sizing, rotating, overlying, moving and stacking various media backward and forward with an overlay or stack (). Video may be broken up automatically by the service provider server  into smaller segments. Selected video segments may be combined and\/or used as desired. Selected media may be placed on a virtual storyboard, such as a clipboard, on the same screen as the collection of media. Media may be edited either in the collection area\/media page or in the storyboard. In still another example, uploading media may be delayed until editing is completed.","As shown in , the service provider server  may automatically suggest a story idea to launch the creative process, or the user  may select a specific style or presentation tool. Within the presentation, there may be multiple styles, such as a picture frame, a television, a billboard, etc. In one implementation, media from the storyboard may be dragged and dropped onto the presentation. In this regard, media may be placed within the viewing window of each type of style.","Alternatively, the user can create a presentation from the media in the storybook section by selecting a style, such as a slide show, a photo slider, a room with different viewing areas including picture frames, etc. The media is then automatically loaded into the selected style. For example, a clustered set of photos may automatically play in frame, and a video clip may automatically play on a television. In another example, the branches of a tree are automatically filled with different selected media for viewing. Another style may be a page of postcards, such that when that style is selected, the previously chosen media is automatically filled into the postcards on a single page.","More specifically, in one embodiment, once media is collected, a storyboard located on the right side of the user interface may be populated with the collected media by dragging and dropping one or more of the media items or cluster of media items collected from the various media sources from the media collection area onto the storyboard for later use in creating a media piece (). In this regard, the storyboard may includes two items collected from the web, one item uploaded from a PC, and a cluster of four items also collected from the web (). Media positioned on the storyboard may be edited prior to creating a media piece. For example, individual items of media in a media cluster may be reordered (). Once media has been collected and edited, media piece creation may proceed by clicking the create arrow at the bottom of the user interface and then choosing to proceed to the create module  ().","As indicated above, to begin the process of creating a media piece the user may select a thumbnail from the presentation \u201cstyles\u201d menu (). Presentation styles may include, but are not limited to, a picture frame, billboard, kaleidoscope, street scene, landscape, etc. Once a \u201cstyle\u201d is selected media from the storyboard will automatically flow into or populate the chosen \u201cstyle\u201d (). In this regard, the presentation media shown in  has automatically populated corresponding presentation elements with the chosen presentation style. Some styles, which support movement of media as part of a presentation style, may provide the user with the ability to customize various characteristics of the movement such as speed of media rotation, etc., within the style.","Once the style is chosen, the user may also select different variations of the style. Each particular style typically has a different set of variations suited for that style. For example, for the tree style, a user may select different types of frames on the branches to contain the media, a specific background may be selected from a user image, and different style trees may be used. For the photo slider, different types and styles of frames may be used, as well as different types of presentations, e.g., spacing between photos, no spacing, and background selection. For the page of postcards, the user may select different configurations of the postcards on the page as well as different backgrounds for the page.","Once in the style presentation, the media may be edited. For example, the media may be rotated, sized, cut-out (e.g., by selecting the boundaries of an image, such as with clicks to designate points along the boundary, enabling as coarse or fine a resolution as desired), moved forward or backward in relation to adjacent media, slide multiple images to add or remove spaces within the presentation, and adding a hotspot (e.g., selecting an area of the image for additional information, such as adding a link, video, text, etc.). Other editing features may include adding audio to the background, adding text, and\/or distorting images. This further editing may depend on the style chosen, as different styles may have different editing capabilities. In one aspect, the editing may be achieved in real-time so that the user  may quickly and easily see the results and change them as needed.","In one embodiment, the publish module  enables the user  to share, publish and\/or distribute the presentation when, for example, the presentation is completed. In one implementation, as described herein, the presentation may be saved in the database  of the service provider server . Once saved, the user  may share, publish and\/or distribute presentations to any selected channel, such as one or more of the multimedia channels . Any users on the network  having access to the channels  or website related to the channels  may refresh the view, which may automatically load the presentation into that channel and\/or website for viewing the content of the presentation. As such, the presentations may be distributed to various online websites, blogs, mobile video players, and IP TV networks, and\/or on the system site.","The collect, create, and publish modules , ,  may be combined, used, and\/or modified to provide the user  with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the multimedia presentation. The choices may be a simple, easy to use tool to quickly build presentations with dynamic content from RSS feeds and online albums. Accordingly, the user  may select a presentation style and, as detailed above, link it to the user's media libraries through RSS Feeds that maintain an \u201calways on\u201d permalink to the content source.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","120","140","180","140","160","140","180","120","140","180","300"]},"In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, computer system , such as a personal computer and\/or a network server, includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, which interconnects subsystems and components, such as processing component  (e.g., processor, micro-controller, digital signal processor (DSP), etc.), system memory component  (e.g., RAM), static storage component  (e.g., ROM), disk drive component  (e.g., magnetic or optical), network interface component  (e.g., modem or Ethernet card), display component  (e.g., CRT or LCD), input component  (e.g., keyboard), and cursor control component  (e.g., mouse or trackball).
