No. 09\/237,825, filed Jan. 27, 1999, entitled ELECTRONIC BOOK SELECTION AND DELIVERY SYSTEM, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/336,247, filed Nov. 7, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,986,690 entitled ELECTRONIC BOOK SELECTION AND DELIVERY SYSTEM, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07\/991,074, filed Dec. 9, 1992, entitled REMOTE CONTROL FOR MENU DRIVEN SUBSCRIBER ACCESS TO TELEVISION PROGRAMMING and U.S. application Ser. No. 08\/160,194, entitled ADVANCED SET-TOP TERMINAL FOR CABLE TELEVISION DELIVERY SYSTEMS, filed Dec. 2, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,927.","Sparked by the concept of an information superhighway, a revolution will take place in the distribution of books. Not since the introduction of Gutenberg's movable typeset printing has the world stood on the brink of such a revolution in the distribution of text material. The definition of the word \u201cbook\u201d will change drastically in the near future. Due to reasons such as security, convenience, cost, and other technical problems, book and magazine publishers are currently only able to distribute their products in paper form. This invention solves the problems encountered by publishers.","The electronic book selection and delivery system is a new way to distribute books to bookstores, libraries, and consumers. The technological breakthroughs of this invention provide a secure electronic system for both delivering selected books and receiving payments. The system has an unusual combination of features that provides the consumer with a daily use household appliance that has a high tech aura while being very practical, portable, and easy to use.","The clear advantage of the system is that it eliminates the distribution of any physical object such as a paper book or computer memory device from any book distribution system. The purchase of a book becomes a pay-per-read\u2122 event avoiding the overhead, \u201cmiddle-men,\u201d printing costs, and time delay associated with the current book distribution system. Published material and text such as the President's speech, a new law, a court decision on abortion, or O. J. Simpson's testimony can be made immediately available to the consumer at a nominal fee.","The system is a novel combination of new technology involving the television, cable, telephone, and computer industries. It utilities high bandwidth data transmissions, strong security measures, sophisticated digital switching, high resolution visual displays and user friendly interface software.","The primary components of the text delivery system are the subsystem for placing the text onto a video signal and the subsystem for receiving and selecting text that was placed on the video signal. The preferred embodiment of the system includes additional components and optional features that enhance the system. The system may be configured for use by bookstores, libraries, and consumers. The system for consumer use is made up of four subsystems, namely: (1) an Operations Center, (2) a video distribution system, (3) a home subsystem including reception, selection, viewing, transacting and transmission capabilities, and (4) a billing and collection system.","The Operations Center performs several primary functions: manipulating text data (including receiving, formatting and storing of text data), security encoding text, cataloging books, providing a messaging center capability, and performing uplink functions. The system delivers the text from the Operations Center to consumer homes by inserting data within analog video signals. The insertion of text is generally performed with a text generator and an encoder at an uplink site that is within or near the Operations Center. The system can be several lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI), all the lines of the analog video signal, or a digital video signal to transmit text data. Using the VBI delivery method, the top ten or twenty book titles may be transmitted with video during normal programming utilizing existing cable or broadcast  transmission capability without disruption to the subscriber's video reception. Using the entire  video signal, thousands of books may be transmitted within just one hour of air time. Nearly 4 any analog or digital video distribution system may be used to deliver the video signal with included text.","The Operations Center may provide electronic books to an intermediate distribution point such as a library or a bookstore, for example. A library may store thousands of electronic book files for lending to its customers. The library may employ file server technology to store and catalog the electronic books. Electronic books supplied by the library may include a time out feature that disables viewing of the electronic book at a specified time. The library may be limited in the number of copies of a particular electronic book that can be lent out at one time. The electronic book viewer may be limited in the number of library-supplied electronic books that can be stored on the viewer at one time.","The billing and collection system performs transaction management, authorizations, collections and publisher payments automatically utilizing the telephone system.","The electronic books may be distributed to consumers and used or viewed in conjunction with an electronic book menu system. Data used to generate the menus may be distributed with the electronic books, such as in the VBI. Alternatively, the menu data may be provided using an alternative delivery path. The electronic book menus may include submenus displaying electronic books available from the Operations Center. Other submenus may display title and other book information for electronic books on a home subsystem. Still other submenus may be used to establish an account to order and pay for electronic books, to provide previews of electronic books, and to provide biographical sketches of authors of electronic books.","The primary components of the electronic book selection and delivery system  are an encoder , a video distribution system , a connector , and a text selector  as shown in . The encoder  places textual data on a video signal to form a composite signal. A variety of equipment and methods may be used to encode text data onto a video signal. The video distribution system  distributes the video signal from the single point of the encoder  to multiple locations which have connectors . The connector  receives the digital or analog video signal from the video distribution system  and separates, strips or extracts the text data from the composite video signal. If necessary, the extracted text data is converted into a digital bit stream. Text selector  works in connection with the connector  to select text.","Using a connector  and text selector  combination, various methods of selecting and retrieving desired text from a composite or video signal are possible. Text may be preselected, selected as received or selected after being received and stored. The preferred method is for the connector  to strip all the text from the video signal and have the text selector  screen all the text as received from the connector . The text selector  only stores text in long term or permanent memory if the text passes a screening process described below.","An overview of a preferred embodiment is shown in . The system  includes: an operations center  including an uplink site , a video distribution system , a home subsystem  including a video connector , a library , a viewer , and a phone connector , and telephone system  and a billing and collection subsystem . The operations center receives textual material from outside sources  such as publishers, newspapers, and on-line services. The operations center receives this textual material in various digital formats and converts them to a standard compressed format for storage. In so doing, the operations center creates a pool of textual material that is available to be delivered to the home system. Normally, the text material is grouped by books or titles for easy access. The operations center includes an uplink site for placing the text onto a video signal and sending the composite video signal into a video distribution system. The uplink site would generally include an encoder (not shown in ) to encode the text onto a video signal.","Many analog and digital video distribution systems  can be used with this text delivery system , such as, cable television distribution systems, broadcast television distribution systems, video distributed over telephone systems, direct satellite broadcast distribution systems, and other wire and wireless distribution systems. Nearly any distribution system which can deliver a video signal will work with the text delivery system. It is also possible to distribute the text without using a video signal as described below.","The home subsystem performs five primary functions, (1) connecting with a video distribution system, (2) selecting data, (3) storing data, (4) displaying data, and (5) handling transactions. An important optional function of the home sub-system is communicating using a telephone communication system. The home subsystem is made up of primarily four parts: a video connector  or similar type of connector for connecting with a video distribution system, a library unit  for storing and processing, a viewer unit  for viewing menus and text and a telephone connector  for connecting with a telephone communications system .","The billing and collection subsystem  may be co-located with the operations center  or located remote from the operations center. The billing and collection subsystem  is in communication with the home subsystem via telephone-type communication systems. Any of a number of telephone type communication systems, such as, a cellular system, will operate with the billing and collection system. The billing and collection system records the books or portions of text that are selected or ordered by the subscriber. The collection system will charge a subscriber's credit account or bill the subscriber. In addition, the billing and collection system will monitor that amount due to publishers or other outside sources  who have provided textual data or other services such as air time to enable the text delivery system  to operate.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["282","302","250","306","278","254","310","250","250","318","322","326","318","322","326"]},"The collection and billing system \u2032 shown has two sections (, ) one for transaction management, authorizations and publisher payments , and the other for customer service . The customer service section  provides for data entry and access to customer account information. Transaction accounting information  is supplied to credit card companies  by the transaction management section  of the billing and collection system \u2032. The credit card companies  provide billing  to customers either electronically or by mail.","Three methods for communicating between the subscriber base  and the billing and collection system \u2032 are shown: by telephone switching  alone, cellular switching  and telephone switching  combined, and by use of the cable system  and the telephone switching . The system shown supports both one-way  and two-way cable communication  with subscribers. Libraries and schools  as well as bookstores  may use the delivery system.","Libraries and schools  would have a modified system to allow the viewer to be checked-out or borrowed while bookstores  would rent or sell the viewer and sell electronic book data. The bookstores  as well as the libraries and schools  may be serviced by cable . Optional direct broadcast systems (DBS)  can also be used with the system .","I. The Operations Center",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["250","254","250","302","402","402","404","406","404","410","414"]},"The processing at the operations center is controlled by a processor  which uses an instruction memory . The processor and instruction memory may be supplied by a personal computer or mini-computer. To perform the catalog and messaging functions, the operations center uses a catalog and message memory  and the text generator  if necessary.","The data stream of text, catalog and messages is preferably encoded by a security ending prior to being sent to the uplink module . Various encoding techniques may be used such as the commercial derivative of NSA's encryption algorithm, Data Encryption System (DES), and General Instrument's DigiCipher II may be used by the security encoding module . Following encoding, the encoded text may be stored in text memory  prior to being sent the uplink . It is preferred that a first-in-first-out text memory arrangement is used under the control of the processor . Various types of memory may be used for the text memory  including RAM. The operations center may use file server technology for the text memory  to catalog and spool books for transmission as is described below.","To transmit textual data, the delivery system uses high bandwidth transmission techniques such as those defined by the North American Broadcast Teletext Standard (NABTS) and the World System Teletext (WST) standard. Using the WST format (where each line of the Vertical Blanking Interval contains 266 data bits), a four hundred page book, for example, may be transmitted during programming using four lines of the Vertical Blanking Interval at a rate of approximately one book every 1.6 minutes (63,840 bits per second). Alternatively, books may be transmitted over a dedicated channel, which interrupts programming so that 246 lines of video can be used to transmit approximately 2,250 books every hour (3.9 Mbits per second). A teletext type format is the simplest but possibly the slowest text format to use with the system. In either event, an encoder is utilized at an uplink site to insert textual data into the analog video signal. In many other respects, the delivery of the textual information is completed using existing cable television plants and equipment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a ","b":["282","250","500","282","504","254","250","282"]},"As shown in block , files are broken into smaller packets of information. Header information is added to the packets. The bit stream is converted from a serial digital bit stream to an analog bit stream that is compatible with an NTSC video signal. Block  shows the switching of analog data into the video lines of a video signal. The analog data is either placed in the VBI or the active video lines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b ","b":["508","512","516","520","532","524","524","532","528","524","536","540","544","544","516","548","552"]},"As an alternative to cable or television delivery methods, the telephone system may be used to transmit books to the subscribers. An average book would take about 7 minutes to transmit over the public telephone system. Using the telephone system, it is not necessary to combine video and text into a composite signal. In most other respects, the operation center would remain similar whether text delivery was by telephone or cable. It is preferred that file server technology (such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875, entitled AUDIO\/VIDEO FILE SERVER INCLUDING DECOMPRESSION\/PLAYBACK MEANS, issued to Mincer, et al., and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, entitled FILE SERVER SYSTEM HAVING HIGH-SPEED WRITE EXECUTION, issued to Noveck, et al., incorporated herein by reference) be used at the operation center with a telephone system text delivery method.","II. The Home Subsystem","The hardware configuration for a four component home subsystem  is shown in . shows a hardware configuration for a two component home subsystem. The home subsystem  performs several functions, such as receiving data and video transmissions, stripping the data from the video signal, screening and storing the data, providing user friendly interface software, displaying menus and text, processing transactions, initiating telephone calls and transmitting billing data. Various hardware configurations may be utilized to achieve the desired functions of the home subsystem. For example, as shown in , the home subsystem can be configured to utilize the reception and channel tuning capability of the current installed subscriber base of cable converter boxes and televisions . The home subsystem can also be designed as an advanced set top terminal converter box with menu generation capability, electronic memory and a telephone modem as described in section V below.","The electronic components which make up the home subsystem can be arranged in a variety of ways. In the four unit subsystem of the viewer  and library  are wired together while the remaining components communicate through RF transceivers . In the simplest version of the home subsystem there are only two units, a library  and a viewer . shows a two unit home subsystem with certain optional features. The viewer  is generally equipped with a high resolution viewing area , digital logic (including a key , security , and a microprocessor ), video graphics control and memory , power supply circuitry  (not shown), an optional battery  and an optional RF transceiver . In a two unit arrangement, the library  contains the connector function to the video distribution system, connector function to a public telephone communications system, and memory  (which may be removable and portable \u2032). More specifically, the library would include data stripping functions , digital logic , memory storage , power circuitry , optional telephone connections  (including cellular or PCN \u2032), optional battery (not shown), optional tuner module  and an optional RF transceiver . The video connector  and the public telephone system connection , as well as the removable portable memory unit  of the library may be broken out into separate components. (shows a removable portable hard disk memory \u2032 with removable cartridges .) Therefore, the home subsystem may have as many as five separate components which communicate with each other. The two, three, four or five separate components which make up the home subsystem can communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including hardwired connection , RF transceiver  and other wireless methods.","RF communications are preferred in the home because it allows the separate components to be located throughout the home without restriction.","The data communicated between the units is preferably secure data. In addition, the library  may provide power to the viewer  through the hard wire communication link .","To receive and strip the data from the video signal at the consumer's home, either a cable interface device or cable connector is used. The cable connector device includes a tuner , while the cable interface device makes use of existing tuning equipment in the home. In either configuration, data is stripped from the video signal and stored at the subscriber's location in the library . The phone connector , and modem  initiate telephone calls and transmit ordering and billing information to the Operations Center or billing and collection system. The home library  is the intelligent component of the home subsystem, incorporating the hardware and software necessary to store the text data, generate menus and effect the purchase transactions. In addition to an RF transceiver , the home library  also includes the necessary jacks and connections to allow the system to be connected to the viewer . As shown in , the library communicates the text data to the viewer in a secure format which requires a key  for decryption. The text is generally only decrypted page by page just before viewing.","a. The Video Connector",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["212","608","612","616","620"]},"The connection to the video distribution system is preferably a cable connector to a cable television delivery system, as shown in . The cable connector includes a data stripper circuit , which accepts video input from either a set top converter, TV or VCR , or an optional tuner block  that receives the CATV signal through the cable connector \u2032. The data stripper circuit  strips data out of the video, and outputs a digital bit stream to the digital logic portion  of the library unit . The data is embedded in the video signal either in the vertical blanking interval or the active video portion in an encrypted and compressed format. The data stripper circuit  can be placed inside the set top converter box , TV, or in the library unit. The data stripper circuit  outputs the digital bit stream to be used by the library digital logic .","The video connector  may also contain a channel tuner module  that can tune to the video channel and provide access to the video that contains the data to be stripped. Using the optional tuner module , a set top converter, VCR, or TV tuner is not needed in the home subsystem. The optional tuner module  would instead receive the CATV signal directly through the cable connector \u2032.","b. Library","An embodiment of the library  for a two unit home subsystem is shown in both and . The embodiment shown includes the following optional parts the video connector , phone connector , RF transceiver , and battery pack  in addition to a removal portable memory \u2032, microprocessor , instruction memory unit , digital logic , and power unit .","The library  contains a digital logic section  (not shown in ) which includes the microprocessor , the digital logic  and the instruction memory unit . The microprocessor  is preferably a secure microprocessor such as the Mot SC21 device sold by Motorola. The digital logic section  will receive the serial digital bit stream from the data stripper circuit  and process the data. Error correction will also be performed by the digital logic section  and the data will be checked for proper address. If the address of the data is correct and the library  is authorized to receive the data, the data will be transferred to the memory storage unit , \u2032. Authorization to receive the data is provided by the cable headend or another distribution point. An authorization code may be sent in the serial digital bit stream. The digital logic section  will send appropriate text and graphical data to the memory storage unit , \u2032. It transfers this data in a compressed and encrypted format and the data remains stored in a compressed and encrypted format.","i. Memory Storage Unit","The memory storage unit of the library is preferably a removable portable memory unit  (as shown in , and ). A variety of options are available for memory storage: a hard disk drive, such as an 80 megabyte, a 200 megabyte, a hard disk with removable platters, and CD ROM. Referring to , a hard disk drive unit \u2032 which contains removable platters may also be used. This would provide virtually unlimited library storage capacity. Data will be stored in the memory storage unit in a compressed and encrypted format. As is also shown in , the data will also contain a key or unique ID number that matches the ID or key of the viewer . This matching of a unique key or ID number prevents unauthorized transfer of text data from the memory storage unit to an unauthorized viewer. Small memory devices such as smart cards, electronic memory cards or PCM CIA cards (personal computer memory card industry association) may also be used to store the data.","ii. Power Circuitry","As shown in and , the library  will accept power from either AC wall power or optional battery power. It is preferred that the power circuitry provide all the voltage necessary from either the battery  or AC unit for the various circuitry in the library. Preferably the power circuitry will also provide power to the viewer through a single data cable when connected to the viewer. The power circuitry will recharge the battery using AC power when in operation. With the optional battery unit  installed, the library  becomes a portable unit and can still provide power to the viewer . In order to extend battery life, power conservation measures may be utilized, such as shutting down the memory system when not in use. When the viewer unit  is being utilized and the library circuitry is not being utilized, virtually all power may be shut down to the library .","iii. Connection to the Public Telephone System","The connection to the telephone system is preferably provided by a modem . Various available modems may be used to perform this function. As shown in , cellular phone or PCN phone connections \u2032 may also be provided. When the home subsystem is first initialized, the modem will be used to transfer the name and credit card information of the consumer to the billing and collection subsystem. The telephone connection  may be utilized each time a book is purchased by a consumer to complete and record the transaction. The telephone connection  may also be used as a means for receiving the text data from the operations center, by-passing the video distribution system. The phone connection  may be a separate unit as shown in ","iv.

The library box ID number is a unique number associated with that library  which is used to ensure security of the data. Block  determines whether an electronic file has already been opened into which the data packet can be saved. If no data file has been opened then block  opens a new data file for that packet. If an electronic file has been opened, then the packet is saved in that electronic file on disk, block . Next, the process checks to see if this is the last packet for a particular book for a particular textual data block being received . If it is the last packet of information, then the electronic file is closed and the directory of available electronic files is updated . Following either block  or , the process returns to receive another data packet from the data stream received from the data stripper block.","With the packet address is checked and the address is determined to be a broadcast address, the process determines the type of message that is being sent . The message is then stored in appropriate electronic message file  and the process is returned to block  to receive another data packet and perform another error check.","Using the process of , the library is able to receive, store and update directories related to the textual data and graphical data that can be used to depict pictures in a given book.

Process block  answers a request from the viewer  for a directory of data showing the books stored at the viewer . The directory of data is sent to the viewer  so that it may be displayed to the subscriber. Process block  handles requests from the viewer  for an index of all available books on the system. The library  will obtain an index of all the available books on the system and transmit that index, process , with menu information to the viewer box. Process block  replies to a request from the viewer  for a specific book. The library the record or transmits the information on a packet-by-packet basis to the viewer, . This process of transmitting the specific book, record, or packets to the viewer continues until the last record or packet has been sent, .","In addition to the processes shown on  in handling a request for a specific book, the library  also orders and receives specific books from the operations center  using the process as described in . Following a request for a specific book which is not stored at the library , the library  will proceed to determine the next available time the book will be on the video distribution system  and ensure reception and storage of that book (process not shown). In performing this process the library  will transmit to the viewer information on when it will obtain the text data for the book so that the subscriber may view the book. In addition to timing information, price and other ordering information may also be passed by the library unit  to the subscriber.","c. The Viewer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11","FIG. 6"],"b":["266","266","266","266","266","602","607","740","728","736","603","604"],"i":"b"},"(1) A high resolution LCD screen, preferably of VGA quality, is used by the viewer  to display text and graphic images. The screen is preferably the size of one page of a book.","(2) Digital circuitry that includes a secure microprocessor , instruction memory , and digital logic. Data is transferred to the viewer  in compressed and encrypted format. The secure microprocessor  compares the ID number of the viewer  with the incoming data stream and only stores the text data if the ID number of the viewer  matches that within the incoming data stream. It is preferred that the viewer  not output text data or other data and that the data is decompressed and decrypted only at the moment of viewing and only for the current page being viewed. These measures are preferred because they provide additional security against unauthorized access to data.","(3) A video graphics controller \u2032 that is capable of assisting and displaying VGA quality text and graphic images is included in the viewer . The graphics controller \u2032 is controlled by the digital circuitry described above. Text may be displayed in multiple font sizes.","(4) The viewer  of  has touch panel controls . The controls  allow the consumer to select stored books and books from catalogues, move a cursor, and turn pages in a book. Typically, the preferred controls include forward and reverse page buttons , a ball  for cursor movement, a selection button , a current book button  and a bookmark button  (see ).","(5) Book memory  for at least one book or more of text is included in the viewer . The memory  stores text and any graphics which represent pictures in a book. The memory  can also store menu graphics data. Two different memory  devices may be used in the viewer , one for the instructions for the microprocessor  in the digital circuitry and a second type of memory may be used for the book memory . Various memory devices available on the market may be used such as, ROM, RAM or a small hard disk. Since a book requires approximately 0.6 megabytes of storage, a small hard disk providing approximately 60 MBytes of storage provides memory to store approximately 100 books. Text for books may be stored in various font sizes so that larger or smaller fonts may be recalled from memory  as desired.","(6) Power supply circuitry  in the view will accept power from either an AC power source or from an optional battery \u2032, or the library . The power supply circuitry provides the necessary voltages to accommodate the various systems within the viewer .","(7) An optional battery \u2032 is provided in the preferred embodiment.

Various electronic memory cards such as PCM CIA can be used with this viewer .","Security, low power consumption and excellent display technology are desired features of the viewer  design. The viewer  should be lightweight and portable. The viewer  contains a software operating system that allows books to be stored, read and erased and includes the capability to order books and retain them in memory for a predefined period of time determined by the system operator. The software can be configured to allow the book to be read during a period of time (i.e., two weeks) and then automatically erased, read once and erased, or held in memory permanently. Each viewer  has a unique key . All of the data storage is encrypted with the key  for an individual viewer  to prevent more than one viewer device  accessing the text file or book file.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["266","266","740","800","266"]},"If the subscriber requests a menu of available books, process block  will select a book menu.

Process block  closes all the electronic files and signals the power circuitry to shut down the power to the various circuits in the viewer . With these examples of basic processes the viewer  is able to display book selections and display text from those books.","d. Menu System","It is preferred that the electronic book system have a menu system for selecting features and books from the electronic book system. The operating software and memory required for the menu system is preferably located at the viewer . However, it can also be located at the library or the library and the viewer  can share the software and memory needed to operate the menu system. Since the menus are usually displayed on the viewer  and it is preferred that the viewer  be capable of operating in the absence of the library, the basic software and memory to create the menus is more conveniently located at the viewer .","The preferred menu system is a system which allows sequencing between menus and provides menu graphics for graphical displays such as on the viewer . In a system which uses a set top converter these menus may also be displayed on a television screen. In the simplest embodiment, the menus provide just basic text information for the subscriber to choose from. In more sophisticated embodiments, the menus provide visual displays and icons to assist the subscriber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["850","854","858","887","888"]},"An example of an introductory menu  is shown on .

The Billing And Collection System","The billing and collection system utilizes the latest technology in electronic transaction and telephone switching to track orders, authorize deliveries, bill consumers, and credit publishers automatically. The telephone calls initiated by the phone connector are received by the billing and collection system which responds immediately without human intervention by placing the order and charging the consumers credit card account. Data is compiled periodically and publishers are credited for sales of their books. The billing and collection system may also connect with subscribers through two-way cable connections, cellular or other communication means.","It is preferred that the billing and collection system communicate with the operations center to track changes in available books and to provide statistical data to the operations center.","IV. Library and Bookstore System","The electronic book system can be modified to be used at public libraries and bookstores.  shows one possible arrangement of components for a public library or bookstore location. The main unit at public library or bookstore is the file server . The file server  is a large electronic memory unit that can store thousands of books. Various electronic storage means may be used in the file servers, such as hard disks and read-write CD ROMs and read only CD ROMs.","The system comprises five components; a converter or video connector , a controller , a viewer , and a catalog printer . The software for controlling the system is primarily located in the controller. The converter or video connector  is similar to those described above. In this configuration the controller unit  monitors the data being transferred to the file server by the converter . The controller  is preferably provided with a viewing screens and several control buttons. When it is necessary to have a larger screen to perform more sophisticated controlling of the system a viewer may be connected to the controller  and the viewer screen and controls may be used.","The controller  is only able to download books to the viewer  which are authorized to receive books from the particular file server. For security reasons it is not desirable that the public viewer  have access to more than one file server. In this way, security can be maintained over the text data for books. It is preferred that the public viewer  be limited to receiving one or two books at a time from the controller . When the user of the public viewer  needs a new or additional book he returns the viewer  to the library where he receives a new book from the controller .","In order to track the books that are available on the file server, the titles of the available books may be printed on a catalog printer . The catalog printer  is connected to the library controller  and the titles of the books are downloaded to the catalog printer . None of the coded text for any of the books can be printed using the controller  and catalog printer  of this system. In order to maintain security over the data, none of the book data is allowed to be downloaded to the printer. Once a complete printout of available book titles, magazines, or other textual material is complete, a hard copy of the catalog  can be maintained at the file server.","The system shown may also be used at bookstores. The bookstores can rent the public viewer  to customers with the text for one or two books loaded onto the viewer . The viewer  may be provided with an automatic timeout sequence. The timeout sequence would erase the textual data for the books after a certain period of time, for example, two weeks. It is expected that after a period of time (perhaps within two weeks) the renter would return the public viewer  to the bookstore and receive additional books for viewing. Using this arrangement, it is also possible for the bookstore to (permanently) sell a viewer  to a regular customer. The customer then returns to the bookstore from time to time to receive textual data for a book which the customer can then store permanently on his own viewer . Various other configurations are possible for bookstores and libraries using the file server and viewer  described.","V. Use Of Set Top Converter","Existing set top converter boxes such as those made by Scientific Atlanta or General Instruments are presently unequipped to handle the book selection system of the present invention. Although set top converters may be built which include the library functions, hardware modifications are necessary in order to use the book selection system with existing set top converter technology.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":["FIGS. 16","FIG. 16","FIG. 16"],"i":["a ","b ","a","b"],"b":["16","601","601"]},"A card addition  to a set top converter  is depicted in . The card  shown provides the additional functionality needed to utilize the book selection system with existing set top converter  technology. The card  may be configured to slip inside the frame of a set top terminal and become part of the set top terminal, an advanced set top terminal. The primary functions the card  adds to the set top converter  are the interpreting of data signals, generating of menus, sequencing of menus, and, ultimately, the ability of the viewer  to select a book using either the television or a viewer . The card  also provides a method for a remote location, such as the cable headend, to receive information on books ordered. The books ordered information and control commands may be passed from the cable headend to the card  using telephone lines.","The primary components of the card  are a PC chip CPU , a VGA graphic controller , a video combiner , logic circuitry , NTSC encoder , a receiver , demodulator (not shown), and a dialer \u2032. The card  operates by receiving the data text signal from the cable headend through the coaxial cable. The logic circuitry  of the card  receives data , infrared commands , and synchronization signals (not shown) from the set top converter . Menu selections made by the viewer  on the remote control are received by the set top converter's  IR equipment and passed through to the card . The card  interprets the IR signal and determines the book (or menu) the subscriber has selected. The card  modifies the IR command to send the information to the set top converter . The modified IR command contains the channel information needed by the set top converter . Using the phone line  and dialer \u2032, the card  is able to transmit books ordered information to the cable headend. It is also possible to receive the books over the telephone lines and by-pass the video distribution system.","These commands are passed through the interface linking the set top terminal's microprocessor with the microprocessor of the hardware upgrades. In this way, subscriber inputs, entered through the set top terminal keypad or remote control, can be transferred to any of the hardware upgrades for processing and responses generated therein can then be sent back to the set top terminal for display. In the preferred embodiment the IR commands  are transferred from set top terminal  to hardware upgrade.","Hardware upgrades may include a microprocessor, interactive software, processing circuitry, bubble memory, and a long-term memory device. In addition to these basic components, the hardware upgrade may make use of an additional telephone modem or CD-ROM device.","The information download hardware upgrade  (shown in ) allows the subscriber to download large volumes of information from the operations center or cable headend using the set top converter . The hardware upgrade  will enable subscribers to download data, such as books and magazines, to local storage. Primarily, the hardware upgrade  is an additional local storage unit  (e.g., hard disk, floppy, optical disk or magnetic cartridge and may include a microprocessor , instruction memory , and a random access memory , as shown in ). Preferably, a small portable viewer  is also provided with the upgrade  to enable downloaded text to be read without the use of a TV.","The downloadable information may be text or graphics supplied by the operations center or cable headend. With this upgrade, books may be downloaded and read anywhere with the portable reader. Using this upgrade, books may be downloaded and stored in compressed form for later decompression. The books would be decompressed only at the time of viewing. Important text that the public desires immediate access may made available through this system. Text such as the President's speech, a new law, or a recent abortion decision rendered by the Supreme Court may be made immediately available.","In the preferred embodiment, book ordering information is stored at each set top terminal until it is polled by the cable headend using a polling request message format. An example of a polling request message format consists of six fields, namely: (1) a leading flag at the beginning of the message, (2) an address field, (3) a subscriber region designation, (4) a set top terminal identifier that includes a polling command\/response (or P\/F) bit, (5) an information field, and (6) a trailing flag at the end of the message. A similar response frame format for information communicated by the set top terminal to the cable headend in response to the polling request may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 17"],"b":["617","1011","601","1011","617","1011","601"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["617","613","1013","1015","912","613","1017","1017","3"]},"Data targeted to individual set top terminals is received by the data receiver \u2032 according to each set top terminal's specific address or ID. In this way, each addressable set top terminal only receives its own data. The data receiver \u2032 may receive set top terminal  specific data in the information field of the signal frame described or on a separate data carrier located at a convenient frequency in the incoming spectrum.","Any received data includes information regarding books and menus available for selection. The subscriber may enter a series of commands  using a keypad or remote control in order to choose a channel or program. Upon receipt of such commands, the set top terminal's microprocessor  instructs the tuner to tune to the proper frequency of the channel carrying data and subsequently instructs the processing circuitry  to begin descrambling of this data.","Upon selection of a book, the microprocessor  stores any selection information in local memory (not shown) for later data transmission back to the cable headend. The set top terminal's microprocessor  coordinates all CATV signal reception and also interacts with various upstream data transmission components. Typically, the data transmitter  operates in the return frequency band between 5 and 30 MHZ. In an alternative embodiment, the frequency band of 10 to 15 MHZ may be used. Regardless, however, of the frequency band used, the data transmitter  sends information to the cable headend in the information field of the response frame described. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of variations and combinations of the above-described set top terminal hardware components may be used to accomplish upstream data transmissions.","VI. Books-On-Demand System","The electronic book system described may also be configured in a book-on-demand style. shows one example of a configuration for a book-on-demand system. A book on demand system requires more powerful two-way communications between the consumer's home, bookstore or library and either the operations center or a distribution site  such as the cable headend. This type of two-way communication can be provided by the hardware shown in  and described above.","Referring to , in a book-on-demand system, the subscriber selects the book to be download from an available menu of books. The available menu is usually sent to the subscriber location by the distribution site . After his selection, information about his selection (or request) is then communicated to either a distribution point  (such as a cable headend) or the operations center. Upon receipt of this request, the needed textual and graphical information for the book is spooled and sent to the subscriber. In this manner, books are only sent when requested by the subscriber and are sent immediately upon demand for the book.","In order to support such a demand system, the text delivery and distribution must be conducted on a strong nodal architectured distribution system, such as, a video-on-demand cable or telephone television system, or through use of individual telephone calls on the public telephone system.","The book-on-demand system allows for a greater selection of books to the subscriber and limits the amount of communicated book data that is unnecessary or unneeded. It also provides the book to the subscriber in a much timelier fashion.","In addition to a stronger distribution system, a book-on-demand system requires a distribution point  to have more sophisticated equipment to spool out the textual information. This can be accomplished using file server technology  for storing the books and ATM  or telephone-type switching (not shown) to distribute the textual information. The file server  and distribution technology that can be used in configuring such a book-on-demand system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,875 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,695, cited above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 18"],"i":["a ","a "],"b":["282","1032","1028","1036","1040","1024","1020","1044"]},"The library unit  can be connected to either a basic premium-type service cable system , a near video-on-demand type cable system (or pay-per-view (PPV) ) or a video-on-demand cable system . In connecting with either of these three systems the library  may access the cable directly or may access the system through a set top terminal \u2032, \u2033, or \u2032\u2033.","Using the two-way video-on-demand system , a subscriber is able to request a specific book title and receive that text immediately following its request. To accomplish this, the distribution point  transmits a list of available books through the cable delivery system to the library . The library  displays the list of available books on a menu or similar format. As described earlier, it is preferred that the library  use menus which list categories of available books to form its request from the distribution point . After selecting a book the library  then sends a request signal on the two-way communication system  back to the distribution point . This request signal can be handled in two ways. Either the library  initiates the request or the distribution point  polls the various libraries on to the two-way system . Upon receiving the request for the book title, the text associated with that book title is transmitted to the library  using the two-way cable system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"figref":"FIG. 18","i":"b ","b":["250","250","250","1060","1060","1028","1036","1064","1068","1072","282","1072"]},"A system controller  provides control over the regional or national book-on-demand system.
