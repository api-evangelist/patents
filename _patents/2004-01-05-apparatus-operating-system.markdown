title: Apparatus operating system
abstract: Each apparatus transmits to a control server a notification signal indicative of a pending change or a change in an output state of the apparatus. The control server has stored therein a control rule which associates an output state of one apparatus with an output state to be taken by another apparatus when the one apparatus is in the output state. The control server acquires location-related information which is set in association with a location of each apparatus. Then, the control server receives a notification signal from any one of the apparatuses, and in response to the notification signal, determines an output state to be taken by an operation target apparatus which is other than an apparatus having transmitted the notification signal, based on the control rule and the location-related information. Further, the control server operates the operation target apparatus so as to transition into an output state determined by a determination section.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an apparatus operating system, and more particularly to an apparatus operating system for controlling an apparatus based on an operation state of another apparatus.","2. Description of the Background Art","Conventionally, many types of audio apparatuses, including a television set, a radio and a stereo apparatus, have been used in a household, and it is often that a plurality of audio apparatuses are installed in one room. In a case where a plurality of audio apparatuses are installed in one room, a user is likely to use the audio apparatuses so as not to all simultaneously output sound, or likely to lower a sound level of one audio apparatus when another audio apparatus outputs sound. For example, in a case of turning on the radio when the television set is in operation, the user may lower the sound level of the television set in order to increase audibility of sound from the radio or may mute the sound from the television set. Accordingly, the user is required to perform an operation to control the sound level of the television set as well as an operation to turn on the radio.","For example, as conventional technology for operating an apparatus in accordance with surrounding situations, there has been a proposed technology for automatically controlling a sound level of an apparatus in accordance with a surrounding sound level. Specifically, this technology is intended for use in an audio apparatus for audio reproduction in an interior of a car, and is intended for automatically controlling, in accordance with a surrounding noise level, a sound level of the audio apparatus so as to increase audibility of sound therefrom.","As described above, conventionally, in a case of turning on the radio when the television set is in operation, the user is required to perform an operation to control the sound level of the television set as well as to turn on the radio. Accordingly, in a case of simultaneously operating a plurality of audio apparatuses, when one audio apparatus is controlled, another audio apparatus also has to be controlled. In this manner, conventionally, in a case of changing the sound level of one apparatus, the user is required to control another apparatus, and such control of apparatuses requires additional effort from the user. Moreover, considerable time is taken between the user operating one audio apparatus and controlling the sound level of another audio apparatus. Sound from a first audio apparatus is difficult to hear until the sound level of another audio apparatus is controlled, and therefore it is conceivable that the user might miss an opportunity to hear important information.","The above-described conventional technology for automatically controlling the sound level of the apparatus in accordance with the surrounding sound level is assumed to be applied to only one audio apparatus but not simultaneously applied to a plurality of audio apparatuses. Accordingly, in the conventional technology, for example, when two audio apparatuses are installed in one room, no determination can be made as to which audio apparatus deserves a higher priority concerning the sound level. Specifically, in a case where two audio apparatuses are simultaneously in operation, when a total sound level of the two audio apparatuses is excessively high, no determination can be made as to an extent to which the sound level should be reduced. Therefore, even if the above-described conventional technology is employed, a situation where a plurality of audio apparatuses are used cannot be handled successfully.","In a case where the apparatus is an apparatus other than an audio apparatus, it is conceivable that operations similar to those performed for a case of the audio apparatus can be performed when a plurality of apparatuses of the same type, e.g., heating apparatuses such as an air-conditioner\/heater and an electric carpet, are installed in one place. Specifically, in a case of turning on the air-conditioner\/heater when the electric carpet is in operation, a user would lower a temperature setting of the electric carpet or would turn off the electric carpet. In this manner, in a case where the plurality of heating apparatuses are installed in one place, a problem similar to that which occurs in the case of the audio apparatus may arise.","Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus operating system capable of controlling operation between a plurality of apparatuses of the same type without causing a user to perform excessive operations.","The present invention has following features to attain the object mentioned above.","A first aspect of the present invention is directed to an apparatus operating system including at least two apparatuses which provide output of the same type, and a control server capable of communicating with each apparatus. Here, each apparatus includes a communication section for transmitting to the control server a notification signal indicative of a pending change or a change in an output state of the apparatus. The control server includes a control rule storage section, a location-related information acquiring section, a determination section, and an operating section. The control rule storage section has stored therein a control rule which associates an output state of one apparatus with an output state to be taken by another apparatus when the one apparatus is in the output state. The location-related information acquiring section acquires location-related information which is set in association with a location of each apparatus. The determination section receives the notification signal from any one of the at least two apparatuses, and in response to the notification signal, determines an output state to be taken by an operation target apparatus which is other than an apparatus having transmitted the notification signal, based on the control rule and the location-related information. The operating section operates the operation target apparatus so as to transition into the output state determined by the determination section.","Note that each apparatus is an apparatus for outputting sound, for example. In this case, an output state of each apparatus corresponds to a level of sound outputted from the apparatus. Alternatively, each apparatus may be an air-conditioning and\/or heating apparatus. In this case, the output state corresponds to a temperature set by the apparatus.","Further, the communication section may transmit the notification signal when there is a pending increase or an increase of output of the apparatus. In this case, the control rule associates the increase of the output of the apparatus with a reduction of output of another apparatus, and the determination section determines the output state of the operation target apparatus so as to reduce output of the operation target apparatus.","Furthermore, the determination section may derive from the location-related information a distance between the apparatus having transmitted the notification signal and the operation target apparatus, and if this derived distance is equal to or more than a predetermined distance, the determination section may determine not to change the output state of the operation target apparatus.","Further still, the communication section may transmit the notification signal when the user has performed an operation of changing the output state of the apparatus.","Further still, the communication section may transmit the notification signal in a case where the output state of the apparatus temporarily changes for a predetermined time period. In this case, the apparatus operating system further includes a state storage section for storing a pre-operation output state of the operation target apparatus. The operating section operates the operation target apparatus such that the operation target apparatus transitions into the output state determined by the determination section, and after a lapse of the predetermined time period, the operating section operates the operation target apparatus such that the operation target apparatus transitions into the output state stored in the state storage section.","Further still, the control rule may associate an output state to be taken by the apparatus with a condition for operating the apparatus so as to transition into the output state. In this case, the control server further includes a determination section which uses the location-related information to determine whether the condition is satisfied, and the operation executing section operates the operation target apparatus only when the determination section determines that the condition is satisfied.","Note that the present invention may be provided in the form of only a control server included in the above-described apparatus operating system or in the form of a program implemented by a computer included in the control server. Alternatively, the present invention may be provided as a method for use in the apparatus operating system.","In the present invention, the control rule provided in consideration of the location-related information is used, and therefore it is possible to automatically control output states of a plurality of apparatuses in consideration of a relationship between the apparatuses. Accordingly, it is possible to control the apparatuses in such a manner that the apparatuses are operated only when necessary or details of operation vary in accordance with, for example, a distance between the apparatuses.","These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","2","3","4","4","1","3","4","1","3","1","3","4","4","1","3","1","3","1","3","1","3","4","4"]},"In , the first apparatus  includes a state detecting section , an operation executing section , and an apparatus communication section . The state detecting section  detects a change of an output state of the first apparatus . Specifically, in the first embodiment, sound is outputted, and therefore the state detecting section  detects a change of an output sound level. Moreover, the state detecting section  notifies the apparatus communication section  of this detection of the change of the sound level. In response to this notification from the state detecting section , the apparatus communication section  transmits to the control server  a notification signal which indicates that the output state of the first apparatus  has changed.","The apparatus communication section  receives an operation instruction signal transmitted from the control server  to the first apparatus . The operation instruction signal is provided in order for the control server  to operate an apparatus, and indicates details of operation the control server  causes the apparatus to perform. The operation executing section  changes the output state of the first apparatus  in accordance with the details of the operation notified by the apparatus communication section .","Note that although  does not show detailed structures of the second and third apparatuses  and , similar to the first apparatus , each of the second and third apparatuses  and  includes a state detecting section, an operation executing section, and an apparatus communication section.","In , the control server  includes a server communication section , an apparatus operating section , a control rule storage section , and a location-related information acquiring section . When the server communication section  receives a notification signal, the apparatus operating section  determines operations to be performed on apparatuses other than the apparatus from which the notification signal has been transmitted. Note that in the following descriptions, the apparatus from which the notification signal has been transmitted is referred to as a \u201cnotification apparatus\u201d, and each apparatus other than the notification apparatus is referred to as an \u201coperation target apparatus\u201d. A detailed operation of the apparatus operating section  will be described later with reference to .","The control rule storage section  has a control rule stored therein. The control rule is information indicative of correspondences between output states of a notification apparatus in a specific output state and output states to be taken by apparatuses other than the notification apparatus. The apparatus operating section  refers to the control rule to determine details of operation to be performed on the operation target apparatuses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["43","4"]},"In the exemplary control rule of , numerical values used for determining operation feasibility are associated with the notification apparatuses and the operation target apparatuses. Specifically, three types of numerical values, i.e., an execution determination value, a basic priority value, and a distance coefficient, are associated with the names and output states of the apparatuses. The apparatus operating section  uses these numerical values and the undermentioned location-related information to determine feasibility of an operation to be performed on the operation target apparatuses. Specific examples of how to determine the feasibility of the operation to be performed on the operation target apparatuses will be described later.","Referring to , the location-related information acquiring section  acquires location-related information which is set in association with a location of each of the first through third apparatuses  through . In the first embodiment, the location-related information indicates distances between the apparatuses (see  which will be described later), and is previously acquired by user input to the location-related information acquiring section . The apparatus operating section  uses the location-related information to determine whether to control an operation target apparatus. That is, the apparatus operating section  determines whether to change an output state of the operation target apparatus, based on the distances between the first through third apparatuses  through  indicated by the location-related information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["44","4","1","3","44"]},"Typically, the control server  can be realized by a personal computer. Specifically, the apparatus operating section  is realized by a CPU of a personal computer implementing a predetermined program (see  which will be described later). The control rule storage section  and the location-related information acquiring section  are realized by a storage device such as a memory included in the personal computer.","Next, a flow of a procedure in the apparatus operating system is described with reference to .  is a flowchart showing a flow of a procedure in the control server  shown in . Specifically, the flowchart of  shows a procedure performed by the apparatus operating section . For example, the procedure shown in  is started when the control server  is activated.","In , first, the apparatus operating section  receives a notification signal from anyone of the first through third apparatuses  through  via the server communication section  (step S). In this case, the notification signal contains information indicative of the name and output state of this apparatus. For example, the information indicative of the output state of the apparatus may be numerical value information indicative of a sound level or a degree of variation of the sound level (e.g., the information indicates that the sound level has increased by 3). Further, information indicative of the output state of the apparatus may indicate that the apparatus has been turned on or off. The information which indicates that the apparatus has been turned on represents that the apparatus is in a state capable of outputting sound, and the information which indicates that the apparatus has been turned off represents that the sound level is zero. Note that the apparatus operating section  waits until the notification signal is received.","Next, the apparatus operating section  designates one of the operating target apparatuses (step S). Specifically, one apparatus is designated from among apparatuses other than the apparatus having transmitted the notification signal at step S. Note that the apparatus operating section  is operated in such a manner as not to redesignate the same apparatus having already been designated at step S in a previous round of the procedure.","Next, the apparatus operating section  reads the control rule stored in the control storage section  (step S). The information read at step S does not have to be the entire control rule stored in the control rule storage section  and may be a portion of the control rule. For example, consider a case where the control rule storage section  has stored therein the control rule as shown in  and a notification signal containing information indicative of the output state \u201cTURNED ON\u201d is transmitted from the notification apparatus \u201cRADIO\u201d. In such a case, if the operation target apparatus designated at step S is the \u201cTV\u201d, at step S, the apparatus operating section  is only required to read a line of the table of  which indicates the notification apparatus \u201cRADIO\u201d, the output state \u201cTURNED ON\u201d, and the operation target apparatus \u201cTV\u201d.","Next, the apparatus operating section  reads the location-related information from the location-related information acquiring section  (step S). As step S, as in step S, the apparatus operating section  does not have to read the entire location-related information stored in the location-related acquiring section , and is only required to read a necessary portion of the information. Accordingly, the apparatus operating section  reads from the entire location-related information only information indicative of a distance between a destination apparatus having received the notification signal at step S and the operation target apparatus designated at step S.","Next, at steps S through S, the apparatus operating section  determines an operation to be performed on the operation target apparatus, based on the control rule read at step S and the location-related information read at step S. Here, an output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus can be specified based on the control rule, and it can be determined as to whether to operate the operation target apparatus, based on a priority value obtained from the location-related information. Details of steps S through S are described below.","First, the apparatus operating section  calculates the priority value (step S). For calculating the priority value, two numerical values, i.e., a basic priority value and a distance coefficient, included in the control rule, and a value of distance between apparatuses, i.e., the location-related information, are used. Specifically, the apparatus operating section  calculates the priority value, for example, using the following expression (1).\n\n(Priority value)=(Basic priority value)\u2212(Distance between apparatuses)\u00d7(Distance coefficient)\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nIn the above expression (1), the basic priority value and the distance coefficient are numerical values preset based on the control rule. When the basic priority value and distance coefficient are invariable, the priority value is decreased as the distance between apparatuses becomes greater.\n","Next, the apparatus operating section  determines whether to operate the operation target apparatus designated at step S (step S). This determination at step S is performed by comparing the priority value obtained at step S with an execution determination value included in the control rule. Specifically, when the priority value is equal to or greater than the execution determination value, the apparatus operating section  determines to operate the operation target apparatus. Accordingly, when the distance between apparatuses is lower than or equal to a predetermined distance, the operation target is operated. On the other hand, when the priority value is lower than the execution determination value, the apparatus operating section determines not to operate the operation target apparatus. Accordingly, when the distance between apparatuses is longer than the predetermined distance, the operation target apparatus is not operated.","Processing of steps S and S is described by taking as an example a case where the control rule shown in  and the location-related information shown in  are used. Here, the notification signal includes information from the apparatus \u201cRADIO\u201d which indicates the output state \u201cTURNED ON\u201d, and the \u201cTV\u201d is designated at step S as the operation target apparatus. In such a case, as shown in , the basic priority value and the distance coefficient used for obtaining the priority value are 50 and 4, respectively, and as shown in , the distance between the radio and the television set is 4 meters (m). Accordingly, the priority value obtained at step S is calculated as follows: 50\u2212(4\u00d74)=34. Then, at step S, a relationship in size between the priority value and the execution determination value is determined. Here, the priority value and the execution determination value are 34 and 30, respectively, and therefore the priority value is greater than the execution determination value. Accordingly, in this example, the television set is operated.","When it is determined at step S that the operation target apparatus is not operated, the apparatus operating section  skips processing of steps S and S, and performs processing of step S. In this case, the apparatus operating section  practically determines that the output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus designated at step S is the same as the current output state.","On the other hand, when it is determined at step S that the operation target apparatus is not operated, processing of step S is performed. Specifically, the apparatus operating section  determines the output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus designated at step S (step S). The apparatus operating section  determines the output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus with reference to the control rule. For example, in a case where the \u201cAPPARATUS\u201d and \u201cOUTPUT STATE\u201d included in the notification signal received at step S are \u201cTELEPHONE\u201d and \u201cOCCURRENCE OF RINGTONE\u201d, respectively, and the operation target apparatus designated at step S is \u201cRADIO\u201d, the output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus is determined to be \u201cSOUND LEVEL 0\u201d.","Following step S, the apparatus operating section  operates the operation target apparatus designated at step S so as to transition into the output state determined at step S (step S). Specifically, an operation instruction signal indicative of the output state determined at step S is transmitted to the operation target apparatus designated at step S via the server communication section . An operation executing section of the operation target apparatus having received the operation instruction signal executes such an operation as to cause the operation target apparatus to transition into the output state indicated by the operation instruction signal.","Next, the apparatus operating section  determines whether processing of determining the output state has been performed on all operation target apparatuses (step S). If determination as to the output state has been performed for all operation target apparatuses, the apparatus operating section  performs processing of step S. Accordingly, the apparatus operating section  waits until a new notification signal is transmitted from any one of the first through third apparatuses  through . On the other hand, if there is any operation target apparatus whose output status has not been determined, the apparatus operating section  performs processing of step S. Accordingly, the apparatus operating section  repeats processing of steps S through S until output states of all the apparatuses are determined. Since the apparatus operating section  repeats the above steps S through S, it is possible for the control server  to control the output state (sound level) of each of the first through third apparatuses  through .","As described above, in the first embodiment, sound levels of a plurality of apparatuses can be automatically controlled in accordance with distances between the apparatuses. Accordingly, for example, control can be made in such a manner as to automatically lower a sound level of a television set in a case of turning on a radio when the television set is in operation. Further, whether to perform such control can be determined in accordance with a distance between the apparatuses, and therefore sound levels of the apparatuses are not unnecessarily controlled by the apparatus operating system. Specifically, in the above example, there is a possible situation in which the sound level of the television set is not required to be lowered when the television set and the radio are considerably distanced from each other. In the apparatus operating system according to the first embodiment, sound volume of the television set can be controlled only when such control is necessary.","In the first embodiment, the location-related information indicates a distance between apparatuses. However, the location-related information used in other embodiments of the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the location-related information may indicate a location of each apparatus. In such a case, the apparatus operating section  obtains a distance between apparatuses from information indicative of the location of each apparatus, and this obtained distance can be used for determining whether to operate the operation target apparatus. Alternatively, in a case where the apparatus operating system is installed, for example, in a house with a plurality of rooms, the location-related information may be a room ID for identifying a room. For example, in a case when the location-related information is the room ID, the apparatus operating section  is able to determine whether to operate the operation target apparatus in a manner as described next. Specifically, when the room ID of an apparatus whose output state has changed and the room ID of the operation target apparatus is the same as each other, the apparatus operating section  operates the operation target apparatus, and when the room IDs are different from each other, the apparatus operating apparatus  does not operate the operation target apparatus. This allows the control server  to control outputs of only apparatuses installed in the same room.","Further, in the first embodiment, the location-related information is preset by the user. However, in other embodiments, the location-related information may be automatically acquired by the location-related information acquiring section  in a manner as described next. For example, when each apparatus includes a location acquisition device such as a global positioning system (GPS) device, the location-related information acquiring section  may acquire location information from each apparatus. Alternatively, when wireless communication is available between two apparatuses, a distance between the apparatuses may be calculated based on a reception level of radio waves transmitted from one apparatus and received by the other apparatus. Alternatively, still, when each apparatus includes a sound detecting device, the distance between the apparatuses may be calculated based on a detection result of sound outputted from one apparatus and detected by the other apparatus. By using a sensitivity level of radio waves or the detection result of sound, it is made possible to acquire such location-related information as to take account of an obstacle, and the like, located between the apparatuses.","Furthermore, in the first embodiment, if the distance between two apparatuses is within a predetermined distance range, an operation of changing the output state is performed on the operation target apparatus, and if the distance between the apparatuses exceeds the predetermined distance range, the output state of the operation target apparatus is not changed. However, other embodiments may use such a control rule as to vary a degree of changing the output state of the operation target apparatus in accordance with the distance between two apparatuses. For example, it is possible to set the control rule such that: if the distance between the apparatuses is less than or equal to 2 m, the sound level of the operation target apparatus is lowered by 10; if the distance between the apparatuses is greater than 2 m and less than or equal to 5 m, the sound level of the operation target apparatus is lowered by 5; and if the distance between the apparatuses is greater than 5 m, the sound level of the operation target apparatus is lowered by 2.","Further still, in the first embodiment, the output state to be taken by the operation target apparatus is determined based on whether the priority value obtained based on the location-related information is equal to or greater than a predetermined value (i.e., whether the priority value is equal to or greater than the execution determination value). In this case, the user is able to set the control rule to any condition by suitably setting the execution determination value, the basic priority value and the distance coefficient of the control rule. For example, the priority value becomes greater by setting the distance coefficient to a smaller value, and therefore as the distance coefficient becomes smaller, it becomes likely to be determined at step S of  that the operation target apparatus should be operated. Accordingly, for two apparatuses in which one apparatus is conceived to greatly influence the other apparatus, the distance coefficient may be set to a relatively small value. Moreover, by setting the distance coefficient to zero, it is made possible to make such a setting as to always operate the operation target apparatus regardless of the distance between the apparatuses. Alternatively, since the priority value becomes greater by setting the basic priority value to a greater value, for two apparatuses in which one apparatus is conceived to greatly influence the other apparatus, the basic priority value may be set to a relatively great value. Alternatively still, as the execution determination value becomes smaller, it becomes likely to be determined at step S of  that the operation target apparatus should be operated, and therefore for two apparatuses in which one apparatus is conceived to greatly influence the other apparatus, the execution determination value may be set to a relatively small value.","As described above, in the first embodiment, by varying the size of the execution determination value, the basic priority, or the distance coefficient, it is made possible to change the condition of the control rule. Further, in the first embodiment, the execution determination value, the basic priority value and the distance coefficient are set for each set of the notification apparatus and the operation target apparatus, and therefore a different condition can be set for each set of the notification apparatus and the operation target apparatus. Accordingly, it is possible to set such a control rule as to take account not only of the distance between apparatuses but also of the types of apparatuses.","The first embodiment has been described by taking the television set, the radio and the telephone as examples of the apparatus for outputting sound. However, the \u201capparatus for outputting sound\u201d is not limited to an apparatus intended for outputting sound. The concept of the \u201capparatus for outputting sound\u201d includes any apparatus which generates sound during operation, e.g., a microwave oven or a washing machine. In a case where the apparatus operating system includes the microwave oven and the washing machine, the following control is performed. For example, in a case of turning on the microwave oven when the television set is in operation, the control server  operates the television set such that the sound level thereof is raised. This automatically prevents the sound of the television set from becoming hard to hear due to an operating sound of the microwave oven.","A possible variation of the first embodiment will be described below.  is a block diagram illustrating structure of an apparatus operating system according to a variation of the first embodiment. In , elements similar to those shown in  are denoted by the same reference numerals as in , and descriptions thereof are omitted.","Referring to , in addition to the elements shown in , the control server  further includes an apparatus information storage section , a control rule updating section , and an apparatus information updating section . The apparatus information storage section  has stored therein apparatus information related to an apparatus included in the apparatus operating system. The control rule updating section  updates details of the control rule stored in the control rule storage section . The apparatus information updating section updates details of the apparatus information stored in the apparatus information storage section .","As shown in , the control server  may further include the control rule updating section . The control rule updating section  is typically realized by an input device, and is operable to receive user inputs. Further, the control rule updating section  updates the details of the control rule in accordance with a user's instruction. Thus, the user is able to freely change a previously set control rule. In a case where the control server  is connected to, for example, the Internet, so that the control server  is able to communicate with an external apparatus which is not included in the apparatus operating system, the control server  may acquire a new control rule from the external apparatus via the Internet to update the previously set control rule.","Further, as shown in , the control server  may further include the apparatus information storage section . The apparatus information storage section  is formed by a storage device such as a RAM.  is a table illustrating an example of the apparatus information stored in the apparatus information storage section  shown in . In the table of the apparatus information shown in , apparatus IDs, apparatus types, and state information are associated with each other.","Each apparatus ID identifies an apparatus included in the apparatus operating system. In the above-described first embodiment, although each apparatus is identified by its name, the apparatus ID may be used in the first embodiment as in this variation. In a case of using the apparatus ID, a notification signal transmitted from each of the first through third apparatuses  through  contains the apparatus ID and a post-change output state. The apparatus ID is also used in the control rule to identify each apparatus.","Each apparatus type indicates a type of an apparatus such as a television set or a radio. The state information indicates a current output state of an apparatus. The control server  holds these apparatus types and output states therein, and therefore can obtain an output state of each apparatus. For example, details of the apparatus information are displayed on a display device (not shown) included in the control server , so that the user is able to recognize the output state of each apparatus.","The state information contained in the apparatus information is updated each time the control server  receives a notification signal from an apparatus. Specifically, the apparatus operating section  updates the state information based on the apparatus ID and the output state contained in the notification signal transmitted from the apparatus. Thus, the state information is always updated to latest information. Note that the control server  may be provided with the apparatus information updating section  to update the apparatus information. With the apparatus information updating section , the apparatus information can be updated as in the case of the control rule, and therefore the operating system can readily deal with an addition of a new apparatus thereto.","An apparatus operating system according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described below. Structure of the apparatus operating system according to the second embodiment is similar to that of the apparatus operating system according to the first embodiment shown in . Following descriptions are mainly directed to differences between the first and second embodiments.","In the second embodiment, control rule storage section  has stored therein time information as well as a control rule as shown in .  is a table illustrating an example of the time information stored in the control rule storage section . As shown in the table of , in the time information, time is associated with time coefficients. Each time coefficient is used for calculating a priority value. Specifically, in the second embodiment, apparatus operating section  calculates the priority value using the time coefficient as well as a basic priority value, a distance coefficient and location-related information. More specifically, the apparatus operating section  receives a notification signal from an apparatus (see, for example, step S of ), and thereafter refers to the time information to identify a value of a time coefficient associated with current time. Further, the apparatus operating section  calculates the priority value by substituting the identified time coefficient into the following expression (2).\n\n(Priority value)=(Basic priority value)\u2212(Distance between apparatuses)\u00d7(Distance coefficient)+(Time coefficient)\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In this manner, in the second embodiment, the apparatus operating section  is able to determine based on the current time whether to operate the operation target apparatus. Accordingly, details of the control rule can be changed in accordance with the current time. For example, it is possible to set the control rule in such a manner that sound level of a radio takes priority over sound levels of other apparatuses during daytime and a sound level of the television set takes priority over sound levels of other apparatuses during nighttime.","As described above, in the second embodiment, the details of the control rule are changed in accordance with the current time. However, in other embodiments, the control rule storage section  may have stored therein control rules each corresponding to a different time slot, so that the apparatus operating section  can select and use a proper one of the control rules in accordance with the current time.","An apparatus operating system according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described below.  is a block diagram illustrating structure of the apparatus operating system according to the third embodiment of the present invention. In , elements similar to those shown in  are denoted by the same reference numerals as in , and descriptions thereof are omitted. Following descriptions are mainly directed to differences between the first and third embodiment.","Referring to , in addition to the elements shown in , the control server  further includes a state storage section . The state storage section  is formed by a storage device such as a RAM, and has stored therein an output state of an operation target apparatus on which no operation has been performed.","In the third embodiment, a state detecting section of each apparatus detects that a user has performed an operation of changing an output state, thereby detecting a change of the output state of the apparatus. Specifically, the state detecting section detects an operation of raising\/lowering sound level and an operation of turning on\/off the apparatus. In response to this detection by the state detecting section, the apparatus communication section transmits a notification signal to the control server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["1","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8","FIG. 10","FIG. 4","FIG. 10"],"b":["4","1","6"]},"If a determination result at step S is positive, apparatus operating section  saves into state storage section  a current output state of the operation target apparatus designated at step S (i.e., a pre-operation output state) (step S). Specifically, the apparatus operating section  requests the operation target apparatus designated at step S to transmit the current output state. In response to the request, the operating target apparatus transmits information indicative of the current output state to the control server . The apparatus operating section  saves the information transmitted from the operation target apparatus into the state storage section .","At next step S, the apparatus operating section  determines an operation state to be taken by the operation target apparatus designated at step S. At following step S, the apparatus operating section  operates the operation target apparatus designated at step S so as to transition into the output state determined at step S. In the third embodiment, although processing of steps S and S is performed in a manner as described in the first embodiment, the control rule shown in  is used instead of using the control rule as shown in . Accordingly, for example, when a button of the intercom is depressed, the apparatus operating section  operates the television set and the radio such that their sound levels are reduced to zero and restored to their respective pre-operation output states three seconds later. In this case, the apparatus operating section  refers to information saved in the state storage section  in order to find pre-operation output states.","As described above, in the third embodiment, the pre-operation output states of the operation target apparatuses are saved into the state storage section , and therefore it is possible to temporarily change the output states of the operation target apparatuses, and thereafter to restore original output states. The third embodiment is useful when used in such a case that an output state of the operation target apparatus can be temporarily changed depending on a type of an apparatus or how to set the control rule. In the third embodiment, for example, when the intercom or the telephone rings, it is possible to readily implement an operation of temporarily reducing the sound level of an apparatus other than the intercom or the telephone.","As described above, the present invention makes it possible to automatically operate an apparatus based on an operation of another apparatus, thereby eliminating a user's effort to operate the apparatuses. Moreover, in the present invention, the location-related information is taken into consideration for operating the apparatuses, and therefore the apparatus operating system is able to control the apparatuses in consideration of a relationship between the apparatuses. Specifically, the apparatus operating system is able to control the apparatuses in such a manner that the apparatuses are operated only when necessary or details of the operation vary in accordance with, for example, a distance between the apparatuses.","In the first through third embodiments, the control server  is used for controlling each of the first through third apparatuses  through  and does not provide output of the same type as output of each of the first through third apparatuses  through . However, in other embodiments, the control server  may provide output of the same type as output of each of the first through third apparatuses  through .  is a block diagram illustrating structure of an apparatus operating system according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , control server  may include a state detecting section  and an operation executing section . Note that the state detecting section  is the same as the aforementioned state detecting section included in each apparatus, and the operation executing section  is the same as the aforementioned operation executing section included in each apparatus.","Further, in the first through third embodiment, the control server  operates the operation target apparatus(es), i.e., an apparatus(es) other than an apparatus having transmitted a notification signal. However, in other embodiments, the apparatus having transmitted the notification signal, as well as the operation target apparatus(es), may be operated. For example, in the control rule as shown in , the same apparatus is simultaneously defined as the \u201cNOTIFICATION APPARATUS\u201d and the \u201cOPERATION TARGET APPARATUS\u201d.","Further still, in the first through third embodiments, the control server  may operate the operation target apparatus before the apparatus having transmitted the notification signal actually changes its output state. Specifically, each apparatus included in the apparatus operating system may be operated in the following manner. The state detecting section of each apparatus detects that a user has performed an operation of changing the output state, thereby detecting a change of the output state of the apparatus. In response to this, the apparatus communication section transmits a notification signal to the control server . Then, the control server  operates the operation target apparatus. After completion of this operation, the operation target apparatus notifies the control server  of the completion of the operation. After receiving the notification, the control server  notifies this notification apparatus of the completion of the operation. After receiving this notification, the operation executing section of the notification apparatus operates the notification apparatus. In the above-described manner, the output state of the operation target apparatus changes before the output state of the notification apparatus operated by the user changes. For example, in a case of raising the sound level of the notification apparatus and lowering the sound level of the operation target apparatus, the sound level of the operation target apparatus is lowered before raising the sound level of the notification apparatus, and therefore there is no possibility of a user feeling uncomfortable about the sound levels of the apparatuses.","Further still, in the first through third embodiments, the \u201capparatuses for outputting sound\u201d have been described as an example of the apparatuses providing output of the same type. However, each apparatus included in the apparatus operating system of the present invention is not limited to the apparatus for outputting sound, and may be a heating or air-conditioning apparatus such as air-conditioner\/heater, an electric heater or an electric carpet. In such a case, an output state to be controlled is a state of temperature set by each apparatus. For example, in a case of turning on the air-conditioner\/heater when the electric carpet is in operation, it is conceivable that the control server lowers a set temperature of the electric carpet. In this case, as in the first through third embodiments, it is possible to eliminate a user's effort to operate the apparatuses.","While the invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous other modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":"44"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":"45"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 8"],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
