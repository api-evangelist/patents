title: Scripted dynamic document generation using dynamic document template scripts
abstract: A dynamic document template having static data, dynamic data, and/or procedural statements may be called by an application on a server. The dynamic document template is separate from the application program and is processed to form an interim script, which is then executed by a host computer system. The script generates document records in HTML or XML format that are output to a document. The data and procedural statements in the dynamic document template may be distinguished through interpreting mark-up language surrounding the data and procedural statements. The dynamic document templates execute in a separate namespace from the application and preserve the state of data in the application. A given application may call more than one dynamic document template to generate different portions of the output document. Additionally, the dynamic document templates may be replaced with new templates without affecting the application.

For example, the arguments may be passed in a JavaScript arg[ ] Array object. According to one embodiment, when the addByTemplate( ) function is executed an arg[ ] Array may be passed to the addByTemplate( ) function including information to be passed to the dynamic document template . When passing variables, string, number, and Boolean data types may be passed by value to the dynamic document template . The application  may retrieve modified values from the dynamic document template  for variables in the passed arg[ ] Array. Composite objects such as, for example, Dataset objects and Array objects may be passed by-reference to the dynamic document template .","According to one embodiment, the addByTemplate( ) function includes a callback function for the calling Dataset object with supporting logic to convert the document template into an interim template JavaScript ; validate the caller's arguments; load and execute the interim template JavaScript and optional TEMPLATE( ) entry-point function ; and transfer any non by-reference return TEMPLATE( ) entry point arguments to the callers arg[ ] Array.","The dynamic document template  would normally be physically separate from the application  such that dynamic document templates may be modified and maintained without impacting the application . Additionally, separating the dynamic document template  from the application  allows debugging action for the addByTemplate( ) function. The dynamic document template  may also have access only to variables in its local namespace and variables passed by the application through arguments to the dynamic document template . Thus, operations in the dynamic document template  have a minimally adverse impact to variables in other portions of the application . Furthermore, the separate document template scripts may be called from more than one application program, and may be subject to security controls imposed by the application environment.","According to one embodiment, a dynamic document template  may include lines containing either literal data to generate one output document record that is appended to a target dataset that invoked the addByTemplate( ) function or a procedural statement. Lines of the dynamic document template  not placed between procedural delimiters may be interpreted literally. Within literal data, assignment delimiters may bracket variables, function calls, or complex expressions whose evaluation directly inserts data into a generated output dataset record.","The method  continues to block  with generating a script from the dynamic document template. For example, the dynamic document template  of  may generate a script . The script may be a JavaScript. The dynamic document template  may include static data, dynamic data, and\/or procedural statements for generating the script . The static data, dynamic data, and\/or procedural statements may be distinguished by mark-up syntax in the dynamic document template . For example, \u201c<%\u201d and \u201c%>\u201d may be used to delimit procedural statements from literal data. Within literal data \u201c<%=\u201d and \u201c%>\u201d may be used to delimit dynamic variable data. A TEMPLATE( ) entry-point function may be included in the dynamic document template  for handling arguments passed from the application . An example of the dynamic document template  is presented as Listing  in the Computer Program Listing Appendix.","According to one embodiment, the script  is generated temporarily as an interim script, which is executed and the document records generated are appended to an output document . After the interim script  is generated, a TEMPLATE( ) entry-point function of the script  may be executed. After the interim script  completes execution, the interim script  may be removed from memory.","According to one embodiment, the script  is generated from the dynamic document template  by interpreting each line in the dynamic document template  according to the syntax delimiters to append a new converted line to the interim script .","The method of  then continues to block  by executing the script  to generate document records, which may be appended to the output document . The document records may be, for example HTML or XML formatted document records. According to one embodiment, the document records are appended to a target dataset object as the script  executes such that if the script  exits after an error, the target dataset object contains generated document records up to the time the script  encounters the error.","According to one embodiment, the script  may be executed by a target Dataset object addByTemplate( ) function, which calls an entry-point function in the script  such as TEMPLATE( ) with optional passed arguments.","One example of the method  of  is illustrated in Listings - of the Computer Program Listing. Listing  of the Computer Program Listing includes an application with a call to the addByTemplate( ) function that executes a dynamic document template. The called dynamic document template is presented in Listing  of the Computer Program Listing. The Listing  dynamic document template contains procedural statements (e.g., line ), literal data (e.g., line ) and dynamic data (e.g., the second from last line has <%=counting(count)%>). Document records created from executing a script generated from the dynamic document template of Listing  are shown in Listing  assuming the argument passed was a value of \u20185\u2019 for the count \u2018entry-point\u2019 function parameter.","Another example of the method  of  is illustrated in Listings - of the Computer Program Listing. Listing  of the Computer Program Listing includes an application with a call to the addByTemplate( ) function that executes a dynamic document template. The called dynamic document template is presented in Listing  of the Computer Program Listing. Document records generated from the dynamic document template of Listing  are shown in Listing .","Yet another example of the method  of  is illustrated in Listings - of the Computer Program Listing. Listing  of the Computer Program Listing includes an application with a call to the addByTemplate( ) function that executes a dynamic document template. The called dynamic document template is presented in Listing  of the Computer Program Listing. Document records generated from the dynamic document template of Listing  are shown in Listing .","A further example of the method  of  is illustrated in Listings - of the Computer Program Listing. Listing  of the Computer Program Listing includes an application with a call to the addByTemplate( ) function that executes a dynamic document template. The called dynamic document template is presented in Listing  of the Computer Program Listing. Document records generated from the dynamic document template of Listing  are shown in Listing .","Separating static data and dynamic data with a dynamic document template as described above improves usability of an application accessing the dynamic document template. The application may call the dynamic document template without having data not passed to the dynamic document template inadvertently altered. Additionally, the inclusion of dynamic document templates allows easy modification of an application accessing the dynamic document templates. For example, a user or administrator of an application may replace a first set of dynamic document templates with a second set of dynamic document templates without altering code in the application or operation of the application.","Although the present disclosure and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.
