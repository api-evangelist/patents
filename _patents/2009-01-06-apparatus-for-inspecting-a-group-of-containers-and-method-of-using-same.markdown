{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was developed under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to techniques for inspecting containers. More particularly, the invention relates to techniques for detecting the presence of certain materials, such as hazardous and\/or radiological materials, in a group of containers.","Many laws govern the transport of certain materials, for example, across government borders. These laws are often enacted to protect the public from exposure to illegal or hazardous materials. In particular, the transport of hazardous materials, such as radiological materials, poses a significant threat to the public. It is, therefore, desirable to detect the presence of certain materials so that action may be taken to prevent potential dangers.","In some cases, certain materials are surreptitiously transported in containers to conceal their presence. Border inspections are often provided to identify illegal and\/or hazardous materials. Cargo ships, trucks, and other transport vehicles carry a vast amount of containers into, for example, the United States every day. The vast quantity of containers transported across such borders limit the ability to examine all containers and\/or detect certain materials. Moreover, manning, tools and\/or facilities are often limited or unavailable for inspection of containers.","Some scanning tools have been employed, for example, at border stations to inspect incoming containers and detect illegal and\/or hazardous materials. For example, radiation detectors, such as Geiger counters, have been developed to determine the presence of radiation. More recently, material sensors, such as scintillation detectors (e.g. sodium iodide, cesium iodide, lanthanum bromide detectors), isotope identifiers (e.g. GR-135), neutron counters (e.g. LLNL-developed or other fission meters), spectroscopic tools (e.g. gamma ray detectors) and other equipment, have been developed to sense the presence of radioactive materials. Examples of techniques for material sensing are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,186,987, 7,019,637, 6,649,915, 6,480,141, 6,373,064, 6,344,650, and 6175120.","Material sensors typically need to be placed in proximity to a source to detect material parameters, such as those detected using the scanning tools listed above and\/or other measurements, that are indicative of the presence of a specified material therein. Given the vast quantity of materials that are transported daily, such proximate placement for sensing is not always feasible. Moreover, materials are often transported in containers and\/or in vessels that can be difficult to access. For example, cargo ships often contain a large number of heavy containers that are lifted by crane and stacked in a cargo hold. The placement and structure of containers may make it challenging for sensors to detect materials housed within the containers. Accessing containers in a storage facility and\/or detecting materials in the containers can be difficult and time consuming.","Techniques have been developed and\/or suggested to facilitate inspection of containers. Manual devices, such as Geiger counters, have been used by individuals to scan containers. Stationary devices have been developed to place sensors at certain locations to inspect materials as they pass the sensor. For example, suggestions have been made to instrument cargo ships with sensors, or to position sensors in vessel cargo bays, to detect certain materials. Techniques have also been suggested to deploy mobile robots. Some robotic techniques may involve cooperative robotics, tandem robots or robotic swarms. Examples of robotic techniques are described in US Patent\/Publication Nos. 20040112238, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,480,141, 6,438,456, 6,247,546, 6,308,791, 6,687,571, 6,523,629, 6,408,226, 6,484,083, 6,636,847, 6,826,431, and 6,377,878. While various existing detection devices and robotic techniques may be useful in certain applications, efficient inspection of containers, such as incoming cargo, remains a challenge.","Despite the development and advancement of various inspection or robotic devices, there remains a need to provide techniques for efficiently inspecting a group of containers to determine the presence of certain materials. It is desirable that such techniques enable selective positioning of inspectors having sensing capabilities at various locations on, between and\/or about the containers as necessary to detect certain materials. It is further desirable that such techniques provide for cooperative inspecting of the group of containers to efficiently complete inspection. Such inspectors would preferably provide one or more of the following features\/functions, among others: selective positioning of the inspectors about a group of containers, extendable sensors positionable proximate even remote containers, means for traversing containers or other obstacles to position the inspectors in a known and\/or desired position, cooperatively inspecting a group of containers, data processing and\/or analysis (locally and\/or remotely), and communication (e.g. data and\/or commands) between the inspector(s) and\/or external sources. Such desired techniques and\/or features are not known to exist in the prior art.","In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to an apparatus for inspecting a plurality of containers. Each container has an outer surface for housing at least one material therein. The apparatus includes at least one inspection vehicle and at least one detector extendable from the inspection vehicle. Each inspection vehicle has a plurality of wheels for movably positioning about the plurality of containers. The wheels have at least one magnet for selectively adhering to the outer surface of at least one of the containers whereby the inspection vehicle traverses the container(s). Each detector is positionable proximate at least one of the containers. Each detector has at least one sensor for measuring at least one characteristic of the containers.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to an apparatus for inspecting a plurality of containers. Each container has an outer surface for housing at least one material therein. The apparatus includes at least one inspection vehicle and at least one deployable detector extendable from the inspection vehicle. Each inspection vehicle has a plurality of wheels for movably positioning about the plurality of containers whereby the inspection vehicle traverses the container(s). Each deployable detector is positionable proximate at least one of the containers. Each deployable detector has at least one sensor for measuring at least one characteristic of the containers.","In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for inspecting a plurality of containers. Each container has an outer surface for housing at least one material therein. The method involves movably positioning at least one inspection vehicle having a plurality of wheels and at least one detector operatively connected thereto about the plurality of containers, traversing at least one of the containers by selectively adhering the wheels via at least one magnet to the outer surface of at least one of the containers, positioning at least one detector proximate at least one of the containers (each detector having at least one sensor), and measuring at least one characteristic of the containers via the sensor(s). The method may further involve operatively connecting a base station with the inspection vehicle(s) for communication therebetween.","Finally, in at least one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for inspecting a plurality of containers. Each container has an outer surface for housing at least one material therein. The method involves movably positioning at least one inspection vehicle having a plurality of wheels about the plurality of containers, extending at least one deployable detector from the inspection vehicle(s) to a position proximate at least one of the containers (each deployable detector having at least one sensor), and measuring at least one characteristic of the containers via the sensor(s). The method may further involve operatively connecting a base station with the inspection vehicle(s) for communication therebetween.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Presently preferred embodiments of the invention are shown in the above-identified figures and described in detail below.

The base station(s)  may also communicate with external sources, such as databases or control stations, to gather information, process data, store information and\/or to receive commands.","The inspectors  are adapted to maneuver about the group  of containers  to collect data relating thereto. In particular, the inspectors  are preferably positionable about the containers  for taking measurements thereof concerning the presence of specified materials. As shown, the inspectors  include an inspection vehicle  positionable about the containers  and a deployable detector  extendable from the inspection vehicle  to a position adjacent the containers  for measurement thereof.","The environment depicted shows a group  of containers  stored together in close proximity. The containers may be housed, for example, in a warehouse, vessel (e.g. cargo ship) or other storage facility. As shown, the containers may be stacked in close proximity for storage purposes. Depending on placement, the containers may be close to walls, close together, or have varying spacing. The containers may also be stacked vertically at various heights and\/or in various arrangements.","Each of the containers  depicted is preferably capable of carrying various items (not shown), such as cargo. Each of the containers  preferably has an outer surface  defining an internal chamber  for housing the items. Typically, such items are goods transported in the internal chamber  of the containers . The containers  may be provided with doors  to access the internal chamber  of the container . The outer surface  is preferably made of metal or other magnetic material.","While the containers  are depicted in a specific configuration, it will be appreciated that the containers may be arranged in various configurations. The containers as depicted are rectangular in shape, but may also have different geometries, cavities, protrusions or other configurations. As mentioned previously, the containers may be housed in various storage facilities. The containers may be placed about walls, fixtures, or other items positioned within such facilities.

In some cases, the inspection vehicle(s)  may traverse a portion of the ground, facility floor, walls or other features to reach the desired container(s). The inspection vehicles  may then be positioned about the container  to take the desired measurements.","The inspection vehicle  is provided with a cable  with the deployable detector  attached at a lower end thereof. The inspection vehicle  is preferably adapted to selectively extend and retract the deployable detector  a distance below the inspection vehicle . The deployable detector  may also be selectively retracted to return the deployable detector  to the stowed position and\/or to a desired distance below the inspection vehicle . The deployable detector  is positioned to measure characteristics, such as material properties, of the desired container(s)  and\/or items therein to determine the presence of certain materials.

The containers  of  have a gap  therebetween. The inspector  is positionable about the gap  for placement of the deployable detector  therein. The deployable detector  may be positioned at a desired depth and\/or position along a container as desired. In some cases, it may be desirable to drop the deployable detector  a distance between containers  to reach additional containers  stacked a distance below. Measurements may be taken as the inspection vehicle  and\/or deployable detector  are moved about the containers . The inspection vehicle  and\/or deployable detector  may also be selectively positioned adjacent the desired container(s)  and into a position that facilitates measurement of the container(s) and\/or detection of certain materials.","As shown, obstacles, such as hinge  may obstruct the path of the deployable detector  and potentially stick the deployable detector . Preferably, the cable  is capable of selectively extending and retracting the deployable detector  to facilitate placement of the deployable detector , to prevent sticking and\/or to release the deployable detector  from pinch points. Also, the movement of the cable  may be manipulated alone, or in combination with the movement of the inspection vehicle , to free a stuck deployable detector .","While the deployable detector  is depicted as being lowered from the inspection vehicle  via a cable , it will be appreciated that any extender, such as a pulley  with cable , may be used to extend and retract the deployable detector  in a desired direction and a desired distance to achieve a desired position. One or more such extenders may be used in combination with one or more inspection vehicles .

The Legend further indicates that results corresponding to portions of the graph designated by coefficients of friction (\u03bc) having a value of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 indicate a Go status. The value of the coefficient of friction indicates the effectiveness (e.g. difficulty or ease) of the vehicle to traverse the surface.","The graphical representation  includes a plurality of position images (-) and corresponding Go\/No-Go predictions (-) given a specified wheel magnetic force and a corresponding coefficient of friction.

One or more stops may be made along the various containers.","Part or all of the inspection process may be repeated as necessary. Once the inspection is completed, the inspectors  may be returned to the original position. Alternatively, additional and\/or repeat measurements may be selectively taken. Preferably, data from the sensors is communicated to a base station in real time. Data may be collected, processed and analyzed before, during and\/or after inspection. The inspectors  may analyze data and\/or provide data to other sources for analysis. In cases where the data indicates a certain situation, an alert may be generated and\/or action taken. Containers indicating the presence of certain materials may be re-inspected and\/or retrieved for further review.","The inspectors  are preferably deployed in a manner that will permit fast and efficient inspection. Cooperative, tandem, swarm and\/or other multiple robot techniques described herein may be utilized to plan and execute the positioning of the inspectors. The inspectors  are preferably deployed about the containers  according to a predetermined routine. The inspectors  may be activated to cooperatively pass about the group  of containers  to take measurements thereof. Preferably, the routines provide for fast and efficient scanning of all of the containers . An analysis of the containers (e.g. number, length), environment (e.g. obstacles), equipment (e.g. number of inspectors), inspection criteria (e.g. inspection location), operation time (e.g. dwell time), data collected and other inspection parameters may be performed to determine an optimized routine for performing the inspection.","Other factors, such as location of each inspector and depth of the deployable detector at a given time, may also be considered. As the inspectors  pass along the group of containers , varying conditions, measurement results, or other factors may change thereby requiring adjustment of the route and\/or routines of one or more inspectors. The inspectors  preferably cooperatively evaluate the situation to enable optimum inspection of the containers . Multiple robot techniques are preferably used to consider adjusting the inspection based on changing conditions and\/or collected data. Control systems may be provided to permit manipulation and\/or adjustment of the inspectors and\/or the inspection. For example, if an inspector  becomes stuck, it may be necessary for the remaining inspectors to vary their routes and\/or operations to complete the additional measurements. In another example, if an inspector  detects certain materials, an alarm may issue requiring action with respect to certain containers. Secondary measurements of alerted containers may be required by other inspectors  and\/or variation of existing routes may be required. The inspection time may be estimated by an assessment of the containers and their environment. By way of example, an inspection may involve a cargo ship having Ncontainers, each container having a length L. A required number of inspections Nmay be performed that require an inspection time tfor each inspection. The configuration of the containers may allow for a reduced number of inspections, for example where adjacent rows of containers may be inspected simultaneously. A configuration factor Cmay be assigned based on the configuration. The estimated inspection time tmay be determined based on the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","insp"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msub":[{"mi":["N","con"]},{"mi":["C","fact"]}]},"mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7"],"msub":[{"mi":["N","insp"]},{"mi":["t","stop"]}]}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"Using Equation 1 in an example involving the inspection of a cargo ship having 10,000 twenty foot long containers stacked in rows requiring three inspections on each side (six total) at one minute each, two inspections may be performed at each location and the configuration factor Cis 2. The resulting inspection time tfor a single inspector to complete the inspection would be 526 hours based on Equation 1.","The corresponding travel time tfor the inspection may be determined based on the following equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["t","trav"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":[{"mi":["N","con"]},{"mi":["C","fact"]}]},{"msub":[{"mi":["L","con"]},{"mi":["V","veh"]}]}],"mo":["\u00b7","\u00b7"],"msub":{"mi":["N","insp"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"where inspection time tfor each inspection may be estimated based on the average vehicle speed Vof the inspector and the container length L. In the case where the containers are stacked in adjacent rows, two inspections may be performed at each location (see, e.g., deployable detector  of ) and the configuration factor Cis 1.9. However, the end columns are not measured twice. Thus, the Cmust be adjusted to account for end rows when determining travel times. Applying Equation 2 to the example involving the inspection of 10,000 twenty foot containers by a single inspector having a speed of 0.5 ft\/sec, the resulting travel time based on equation 2 is 59 hours.","The total time tfor inspecting all of the containers may be determined by the following equation:\n\n\u2003\u2003Equation 3\n\nApplying Equation 2 to the example resulting in an inspection time of 526 hours and a travel time of 59 hours, the estimated total travel time would be 585 hours, or 3.5 weeks.\n","The duration of the inspection may significantly be reduced by using a collective of inspectors to perform the same inspection. In an example involving the inspection of 10,000 twenty foot containers by inspectors having a speed of 0.5 ft\/sec, the resulting total time twould reduce to less than 2.5 days.","It will be understood from the foregoing description that various modifications and changes may be made in the preferred and alternative embodiments of the present invention without departing from its true spirit.
