{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","System Overview","The Directory Management Process:"],"p":["This disclosure relates to web service registries and repositories and, more particularly, to automatically-updating web service registries and repositories.","Often, in enterprise environments, various web services may be simultaneously deployed and running. Unfortunately, these web services may be underutilized because users within the enterprise environment simply do not know that such web services are available.","Accordingly, web service registries and repositories act as a centralized storage location for storing web service definitions and web service metadata. Unfortunately, these web service registries and repositories are not automatically updated and are often out of date or inaccurate. Accordingly, in order to maintain the accuracy of these web service registries and repositories, the web service registries and repositories must be manually updated by an administrator.","In a first implementation, a method includes defining at least one target system. The at least one target system is accessed to identify one or more web services available via the at least one target system, thus defining one or more available services. Information concerning the one or more available web services is identified. At least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services is published within a web services directory.","One or more of the following features may be included. Identifying information concerning the one or more available web services may include one or more of: retrieving information concerning the one or more available web services from the at least one target system; and generating information concerning the one or more available web services.","The one or more web services available via the at least one target system may be defined via a web services description language (WSDL) file. The one or more web services available via the at least one target system may be defined via a service component architecture (SCA) module.","The SCA module may define one or more of: a WSDL file; a library file; and a module file. The information identified concerning the one or more available services may include one or more of: a WSDL file; an SCA module; application metadata for identifying an enterprise application through which the one or more available services is available; system metadata for identifying the target system on which the enterprise application is executed; and status metadata for defining the status of the one or more available services.","Publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within a web services directory may include: graphically depicting at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory. Publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within a web services directory may include: making available for processing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory.","The web services directory may include a services registry and repository. The information identified concerning the one or more available services may be filtered to remove redundant web service information prior to publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory.","In another implementation, a computer program product resides on a computer readable medium that has a plurality of instructions stored on it. When executed by a processor, the instructions cause the processor to perform operations including defining at least one target system. The at least one target system is accessed to identify one or more web services available via the at least one target system, thus defining one or more available services. Information concerning the one or more available web services is identified. At least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services is published within a web services directory.","One or more of the following features may be included. Identifying information concerning the one or more available web services may include one or more of: retrieving information concerning the one or more available web services from the at least one target system; and generating information concerning the one or more available web services.","The one or more web services available via the at least one target system may be defined via a web services description language (WSDL) file. The one or more web services available via the at least one target system may be defined via a service component architecture (SCA) module.","The SCA module may define one or more of: a WSDL file; a library file; and a module file. The information identified concerning the one or more available services may include one or more of: a WSDL file; an SCA module; application metadata for identifying an enterprise application through which the one or more available services is available; system metadata for identifying the target system on which the enterprise application is executed; and status metadata for defining the status of the one or more available services.","Publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within a web services directory may include: graphically depicting at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory. Publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within a web services directory may include: making available for processing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory.","The web services directory may include a services registry and repository. The information identified concerning the one or more available services may be filtered to remove redundant web service information prior to publishing at least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services within the web services directory.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.","Referring to , there is shown directory management process  that may reside on and may be executed by server computer , which may be connected to network  (e.g., the Internet or a local area network). Examples of server computer  may include, but are not limited to: a personal computer, a server computer, a series of server computers, a mini computer, and a mainframe computer. Server computer  may be a web server (or a series of servers) running a network operating system, examples of which may include but are not limited to: Microsoft Windows XP Server\u2122; Novell Netware\u2122; or Redhat Linux\u2122, for example.","As will be discussed below in greater detail, directory management process  may define at least one target system. The at least one target system may be accessed to identify one or more web services available via the at least one target system, thus defining one or more available services. Information concerning the one or more available web services may be identified. At least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services may be published within a web services directory.","The instruction sets and subroutines of directory management process , which may be stored on storage device  coupled to server computer , may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) incorporated into server computer . Storage device  may include but is not limited to: a hard disk drive; a tape drive; an optical drive; a RAID array; a random access memory (RAM); and a read-only memory (ROM).","Server computer  may execute a web server application, examples of which may include but are not limited to: IBM WebSphere\u2122, Microsoft IIS\u2122, Novell Webserver\u2122, or Apache Webserver\u2122, that allows for HTTP (i.e., HyperText Transfer Protocol) access to server computer  via network . Network  may be connected to one or more secondary networks (e.g., network ), examples of which may include but are not limited to: a local area network; a wide area network; or an intranet, for example.","Server computer  may execute web services registry and repository (WSRR) application , examples of which may include but are not limited to IBM WebSphere\u2122 services registry and repository. WSRR application  may allow an organization to store, manage, and access their web service information so that the corresponding web services may be efficiently utilized by the employees of the organization. Directory management process  may be a stand alone application that interfaces with WSRR application  or an applet\/application that is executed within WSRR application .","The instruction sets and subroutines of WSRR application , which may be stored on storage device  coupled to server computer  may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) incorporated into server computer .","The instruction sets and subroutines of browser applications , , , , which may be stored on storage devices , , ,  (respectively) coupled to client electronic devices , , ,  (respectively), may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory architectures (not shown) incorporated into client electronic devices , , ,  (respectively). Storage devices , , ,  may include but are not limited to: hard disk drives; tape drives; optical drives; RAID arrays; random access memories (RAM); read-only memories (ROM), compact flash (CF) storage devices, secure digital (SD) storage devices, and memory stick storage devices. Examples of client electronic devices , , ,  may include, but are not limited to, personal computer , laptop computer , personal digital assistant , notebook computer , a server (not shown), a data-enabled, cellular telephone (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown). Using browser applications , , , , users , , ,  (respectively) may access and browse one or more services directories (to be discussed below in greater detail) maintained by WSRR application .","Users , , ,  may access WSRR application  directly through the device on which the browsing application (e.g., browsing applications , , , ) is executed, namely client electronic devices , , , , for example. Users , , ,  may access WSRR application  directly through network  or through secondary network . Further, server computer  (i.e., the computer that executes WSRR application ) may be connected to network  through secondary network , as illustrated with link line  (shown in phantom).","The various client electronic devices may be directly or indirectly coupled to network  (or network ). For example, personal computer  is shown directly coupled to network  via a hardwired network connection. Further, notebook computer  is shown directly coupled to network  via a hardwired network connection. Laptop computer  is shown wirelessly coupled to network  via wireless communication channel  established between laptop computer  and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) , which is shown directly coupled to network . WAP  may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, Wi-Fi, and\/or Bluetooth device that is capable of establishing wireless communication channel  between laptop computer  and WAP . Personal digital assistant  is shown wirelessly coupled to network  via wireless communication channel  established between personal digital assistant  and cellular network\/bridge , which is shown directly coupled to network .","As is known in the art, all of the IEEE 802.11x specifications may use Ethernet protocol and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (i.e., CSMA\/CA) for path sharing. The various 802.11x specifications may use phase-shift keying (i.e., PSK) modulation or complementary code keying (i.e., CCK) modulation, for example. As is known in the art, Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that allows e.g., mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants to be interconnected using a short-range wireless connection.","Client electronic devices , , ,  may each execute an operating system, examples of which may include but are not limited to Microsoft Windows\u2122, Microsoft Windows CE\u2122, Redhat Linux\u2122, or a custom operating system.","For the following discussion, browser application  is going to be described for illustrative purposes. However, this is not intended to be a limitation of this disclosure, as other browsing applications (e.g., browsing applications , , ) may be equally utilized.","Assume for illustrative purposes that WSRR application  maintains web services directory  (e.g., a services registry & repository) that identifies the various web services that are available for use by e.g., users , , , . Server computer  may be a web server that is configured to provide three web services, namely web service , , . Web services , ,  may be accessible by users , , ,  via browser applications , , ,  executed on client electronic devices , , , .","When accessing one or more of web services , , , a standardized protocol may be used. For example, SOAP (i.e., Simple Object Access Protocol) may be used to couple a client electronic device (e.g., desktop computer , laptop computer , personal digital assistant , and notebook computer ) to web services , , .","As is known in the art, the SOAP protocol allows XML (eXtensible Markup Language) messages to be exchanged across computer networks (e.g., networks , ). These messages may be exchanged using HTTP (i.e., HyperText Transfer Protocol).","SOAP may use the RPC (i.e., Remote Procedure Protocol) process, in which a first network node (e.g. laptop computer ) sends a request message to another network node (e.g., server computer ), and the second network node (e.g., server computer ) sends a response message to the first network node (e.g., laptop computer ). While the system is described above as utilizing SOAP, other configurations are possible and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. For example, other protocols may be used, such as JSON (i.e., Java Script Object Notation), REST (i.e., REpresentational State Transfer), and XML-RPC (i.e., eXtensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Protocol).","Server computer  may execute API  to enable communication between server computer  and e.g., desktop computer , laptop computer , personal digital assistant , and notebook computer  via e.g., SOAP. While a single API (i.e., API ) is shown, this is for illustrative purposes only, as other configurations are possible and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. For example, a unique API may be utilized for each web service available.","API  may act as an interface for the various web services available via server computer , thus allowing requests for services (e.g., web services , , ) to be made by other computer programs (e.g., browser applications , , , ) executed on e.g., desktop computer , laptop computer , personal digital assistant , and notebook computer .","API  may describe how browser applications , , ,  may access e.g., web services , ,  without granting access to the source code of the services or requiring a detailed understanding of the internal workings of the services.","Assume for illustrative purposes that web service  is a stock quote service; web service  is an insurance quote service; and web service  is an address lookup service. Accordingly, API  may be configured to enable e.g., user  of e.g., laptop computer  to obtain a stock quote for e.g., 1,000 shares of IBM stock. API  may be configured to further allow user  of personal digital assistant  to obtain a quote for $1,000,000 of term life insurance. Additionally, API  may be configured to further allow user  of notebook computer  to determine an address of a store within Armonk, N.Y.","When configuring a client electronic device (e.g., laptop computer ) to access e.g., web services , ,  offered by server computer , a standardized protocol may be established between the two devices (e.g., laptop computer  and server computer ). As discussed above, an example of such a standardized protocol is SOAP. Once the standardized protocol is established and the devices are capable of communicating with each other, one or more WSDL (i.e., Web Services Description Language) files (e.g., WSDL file ) resident on e.g., storage device  may be processed by the client electronic device (e.g., laptop computer ) to allow for communication between laptop computer  and server computer .","WSDL file  may be a service description (typically XML) describing how a client device may communicate with a web service. For example, WSDL  may describe how browser application  (and, therefore, laptop computer ) may communicate with e.g., web service  via API . For example, WSDL  may define e.g., the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with web service . Typically, the supported operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to the network protocol (e.g., SOAP). Accordingly, WSDL  may define the public interface for e.g., web service .","Accordingly, when configuring e.g., laptop computer  to access e.g., web service , once communication is established (using a standardized protocol) between e.g., server computer  and e.g., laptop computer , laptop computer  may obtain one or more WSDL files (e.g., WSDL file ) from server computer  and may process the obtained WSDL file(s) to effectuate communication between the two systems (i.e., laptop computer  and server computer ). Examples of WSDL files are as follows:","Stock Quote WSDL

generating WSDL files, the manner in which the WSDL files are configured may vary based upon the intent of the programmer. For example, a single WSDL file may be designed to effectuate access for all services\/functions available via server computer  (namely web services , , ). Alternatively, separate WSDL files may be made available for each service\/function available within server computer . For example, a first WSDL file may be made available for web service ; a second WSDL file may be made available for web service ; and a third WSDL file may be made available for web service .","As stated above and as will be discussed below in greater detail, directory management process  may define at least one target system. The at least one target system may be accessed to identify one or more web services available via the at least one target system, thus defining one or more available services. Information concerning the one or more available web services may be identified. At least a portion of the information concerning the one or more available web services may be published within a web services directory.","Assume for this example that server computer  has not yet been indexed by WSRR application  and, therefore, web services , ,  are not published\/included\/defined within web services directory . For this illustrative example, assume that user  is an administrator of WSRR application  and would like to have web services , ,  defined within web services directory .","Referring also to , user  may utilize directory management process  to define  at least one target system for interrogation by directory management process . Specifically, user  may define  one or more target systems (e.g., server computer ) for directory management process  to analyze. When defining  the target system(s), user  may utilize user interface  rendered by directory management process . The manner in which the target system(s) are defined  within user interface  may vary depending on the manner in which user interface  is configured. For example, user interface  may be configured to e.g., allow user  to define  server computer  within defining field  via a unique IP (i.e., internet protocol) address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or a unique computer name (e.g., speedy2) within a computer domain.","While directory management process  is described as allowing user  to define  the target system via IP addresses and\/or computer names, this is for illustrative purposes only, as other configurations are possible. For example, a URL may be able to define a target system provided that the URL definitively defines a unique target system (or a plurality of systems that each offer the same web services).","Once sufficiently defined , user  may select \u201cinterrogate\u201d button  (using onscreen pointer  controllable via e.g., a mouse; not shown) to initiate directory management process  accessing  the target system (e.g., server computer ) to identify one or more web services available via e.g., server computer . Alternatively, user  may select \u201ccancel\u201d button  with onscreen pointer .","As discussed above and in this particular example, server computer  is configured to provide three web services, namely web service , , . Accordingly, upon directory management process  accessing  server computer , directory management process  may identify web services , ,  as being available via server computer .","Once directory management process  identifies the specific web services (e.g., web services , , ) available via server computer , directory management process  may identify  information  concerning web services , , . As will be discussed below in greater detail, at least a portion of information  concerning web services , ,  may be published  within web services directory .","The various web services (e.g., web services , , ) available via server computer  may be defined using various methodologies, examples of which may include but are not limited to: one or more web services description language (WSDL) files and\/or one or more service component architecture (SCA) modules, wherein SCA modules may include: a WSDL file; a library file; and another module file.","Accordingly, the information identified  (by directory management process ) concerning the one or more available web services (e.g., web services , , ) may include one or more of: a WSDL file; an SCA module; application metadata for identifying an enterprise application (e.g., a stock quote application; not shown) through which one or more available services (e.g., a stock quote service) is available; system metadata for identifying the target system (e.g., server computer ) on which the enterprise application (e.g., the stock quote application; not shown) is executed; and status metadata for defining the status (e.g., online\/offline) of the one or more available services (e.g., the stock quote service).","Once directory management process  identifies  information  concerning web services , , , all or a portion of information  may be retrieved  from e.g., server computer  and stored on server computer  (i.e., the computer that executes directory management process ). Additionally, directory management process  may generate  at least a portion of information  based, at least in part, upon the information retrieved  from directory management process . Examples of information generated by directory management process  may include but are not limited to a date\/time stamp concerning the date and time that information  was retrieved  from e.g., server computer ; and the above-described status metadata.","At least a portion of information  retrieved from e.g., server computer  concerning web services , ,  may be filtered  to remove redundant information. For example, assume that a single service (e.g., web service ) is described using both a WSDL file (for a first type of system) and a SCA module (for a second type of system). As discussed above, SCA modules may include: a WSDL file; a library file; and another module file. Accordingly, when identifying  and retrieving information  concerning web service , a redundant information condition may occur. Specifically, two identical WSDL files may be included within information , one the stand alone WSDL file and the second being the WSDL file included within the SCA module.","Accordingly, directory management process  may filter  the redundant copy of the WSDL file from information . When filtering information , directory management process  may utilize one of many known file comparison techniques (e.g., CRC checks, byte-by-byte comparisons) to determine if any of the individual files included within information  are redundant. If so, directory management process  may remove the redundant file.","Once directory management process  filters  information  (if filtering is performed), directory management process  may publish all or a portion of information  within web services directory .","Concerning the manner in which directory management process  publishes all or a portion of information  to web services directory , all or a portion of information  may be graphically depicted within web services directory . Additionally\/alternatively, all or a portion of information  may be made available for processing by e.g., laptop computer .","For example, once directory management process  publishes  all or a portion of information  within web services directory , one or more of users , ,   may access web services directory  using one or more of browser applications , , ,  (respectively). Once web services directory  is accessed, the data included within web services directory  may be presented to the user in various ways, such as in table  () and table  (), in which the WSDL files included within web services directory  are presented in tabular form and associated with various namespaces (e.g., http:\/\/soap.amazon.com). Additionally\/alternatively, the data included within web services directory  may be presented to the user in tabular form (see table ,  & table , ), in which one or more details of a particular WSDL file (e.g., AddressFetcher2.wsdl & WSRR_Goverance_API_binding.wsdl).","Additionally, directory management process  may process (i.e., \u201cshred\u201d) at least a portion of information  retrieved from e.g., server computer  concerning web services , ,  to parse information  into a series of discrete logical objects (not shown). Once parsed, directory management process  may apply the above-described metadata to one or more of the discrete logical objects to define e.g., the enterprise application (e.g., a stock quote application; not shown) and target system (e.g., server computer ) associated with the discrete logical object. Further, the metadata may define relationships between the above-described logical objects and one or more of the above-described WSDL files, SCA modules, or any portions thereof. Directory management process  may render the above-described discrete logical objects in a graphical format as shown in e.g., display screen  ().","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
