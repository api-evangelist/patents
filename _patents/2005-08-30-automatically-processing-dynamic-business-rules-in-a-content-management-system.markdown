No. 10\/980,716, which was filed on Nov. 3, 2004, and to co-pending U.S. patent application titled \u201cSystem and Method for Defining and Generating Document Management Applications for Model-Driven Document Management\u201d, Ser. No. 11\/123,735, which was filed on May 5, 2005, both of which are assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention generally relates to content management. More specifically, the present system pertains to a business rule engine in a content management application that applies dynamic, selectable business rules to data items; the business rules manage processing of the data items and execute actions based on information in the data items.","Content management (CM) is defined as software that builds, organizes, manages, and stores collections of digital works in any medium or format. Content management refers to the process of handling various types of structured and unstructured information, including images and documents that may contain billing data, customer service information, or other types of content. Content management further refers to the process of capturing, storing, sorting, codifying, integrating, updating and protecting any and all information. Studies estimate that more than 75% of enterprise data is unstructured and document-related.","Key technologies in the content management market comprise traditional document management, Web content management, digital asset management, and records management. Users of content management are in document-heavy industries, where document management is often essential for regulatory or compliance reasons. A real-time enterprise needs content management so it can create, access, and transfer information, as needed, to meet business goals of the enterprise.","Current content comprises many different forms of unstructured data that requires management:\n\n","While outwardly dissimilar, these forms of enterprise content have similar management needs. To be truly useful, a content management solution is required to address requirements for mass storage, search and access, personalization, integration with business applications, access and version control, and rapid delivery over the Internet. From a data point of view, the difference from conventional relational databases is the support for unstructured content.","Business rule processing is a vital aspect of content management and enterprise information systems. A business rule is a statement that defines or constraints some aspect of a business. The business rule asserts business structure; the business rule further controls or influences the behavior of the business. These constraints are present in many business applications such as negotiations, including procurements and auction configuration, financial applications, catalogs and storefronts, as well as security authorization and trust management. Specific examples of business rules are:\n\n","Conventional business rules applications comprise a standard vocabulary for knitting together business organizations and constraining various business behaviors. One conventional technology utilizes business rule classification methodologies and specification languages to model business rules. Another conventional technology comprises a conceptual model that covers business rule terminology, semantic definitions, business rule classification methodologies, and information system integration. Yet another conventional approach identifies the quick change in business rule specifications as an issue and suggests a robust and flexible business rule management scenario for enterprises to solve the problem. A further conventional application proposes a metamodel for business rule specification, a metamodel for business rule vocabulary, an XML representation for business rules, and vocabularies based on XML.","Conventional active databases are closely related to business rule processing in information systems. Traditional databases, also called passive databases, perform CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) operations at the request of users or client applications. Active databases enhance passive database capabilities by adding triggers and assertions that automatically perform operations based on predefined business rules. Those business rules usually have the recurring pattern of Event-Condition-Action (ECA): event determines when the business rules need to be evaluated; condition defines what is to be evaluated; and action specifies what to do when the condition is satisfied. Some conventional systems support business rule processing in the form of triggers and procedures.","Although this technology has proven to be useful, it would be desirable to present additional improvements. Directly applying those active database systems to business rule processing encounters limitations: events, conditions, and actions are mostly limited to database operations; business rules have poor portability due to lack of standards in trigger syntax, semantics, and execution behavior; there are limitations on number of triggers per table; trigger scheduling and interaction capabilities are limited; and integration with external applications is unsatisfactory.","Expert systems are related to business rule processing. An expert system is an information system that can solve problems in a domain by using information and analytical techniques developed by domain experts. Domain knowledge is usually encoded in business rules and an inference engine makes decisions based on these business rules and other available facts. Expert system business rules are in the form of Condition-Action (CA): the inference engine matches the business rule conditions with the facts in the working memory, and then executes actions in the matching business rules. One expert system uses a forward chaining inference engine and programs search working memory to find matching business rules for execution.","Although business rule processing for conventional technology has proven to be useful, it would be desirable to present additional improvements. Business rules are not static; business rules change frequently due to the changes in user requirements, company policies, government regulations, economic trends, etc. In conventional systems, business rule logic is embedded into the application logic. In conventional systems, business rule processing capabilities are widely dispersed and deeply embedded in many parts of the content management system such as in the client application, in the middle tier, and in the backend repository. Consequently, it is difficult to identify and change the business rule logic as required by dynamic business scenarios. Developers are required to know implementation details about where to make changes without affecting existing code.","Some conventional business rule applications comprise commercial off-the-shelf products that are developed by different parties. In this case, the change process is more difficult since interface standardization and compatibility problems may arise. When the upgrade to the business rule processing is completed, comprehensive testing and trial processing is required. The upgrade to the business rule processing can be disruptive because the existing content management system is typically brought offline before the upgraded system is operational.","In most existing architecture designs, the business logic and constraints are not abstracted out as business rules. Rather, the business logic and constraints are spread across various parts of system: in the client application, in the middle tier, and in the backend repository. These designs reveal many problems: the architecture is not resilient to frequent business logic changes; system development and maintenance cost is high because business rule processing implementation is tightly coupled; and there is no central fine-grained managerial control over the business rule execution, monitoring, and logging.","What is therefore needed is a system, a computer program product, and an associated method for automatically processing dynamic business rules in a content management system. The need for such a solution has heretofore remained unsatisfied.","The present invention satisfies this need, and presents a system, a service, a computer program product, and an associated method (collectively referred to herein as \u201cthe system\u201d or \u201cthe present system\u201d) for automatically processing dynamic business rules in a content management system. The present system operates separately from the content management system, allowing frequent updates to the business rules that can be automatically adapted by the business rule processing system. While the present system is described in terms of a content management system, it should be clear that the present system is applicable as well to any repository such as, for example, file systems, relational databases, object oriented database, XML databases, etc.","The present system utilizes a stand-alone business rule engine. Business logic is encoded as business rule definition files using a platform-independent language; business rule definition files are stored in a central business rule repository. The business rules are managed and executed by a business rule engine that provides business rule processing services to other parts of a content management system. The present system reduces development and maintenance cost, accelerates the business rule update cycle, and simplifies administration efforts.","The present system comprises a centralized business rule processing system that comprises a separate layer dedicated for business rule processing. Business rules in the present system are externalized from the application code of the content management system and are executed in a stand-alone business rule engine. The present system comprises an architecture that is loosely coupled to the content management application; the present system further comprises a well-defined interface between different parts of the content management system. The present system simplifies development of business rules and provides portability and reusability of business rules. When the specifications for the business rules change, only the business rules are updated. Business rules can be independently authored and deployed into the runtime environment of the content management system without restarting transactional runtime systems, thus enabling dynamic upgrades of the business rule processing system that are automatically incorporated into operation of the business rule processing system.","Business rules are encoded as text files using a business rule definition language that is independent of programming languages or computing platforms. A business rule repository stores the business rule definition files and provides query and management facilities. The business rule engine executes the business rules in a certain order according to a specified inference engine type (forward chaining, backward chaining, etc.) and provides corresponding services to other parts of the content management system. The business rule engine is typically invoked by specific events in the system such as, for example, arrival of new data for validation. The business rule engine queries the business rule repository, locates matching business rules and related resources, and executes the located business rules.","Business rulesets are partitioned according to the data types and action types so that the relevant business rules can be located efficiently. Conditions in the business rule definition are checked and actions executed based on the results of condition evaluation. Examples of actions comprise passing messages to client applications, data operations on the repository, routing data for further processing in a workflow, etc. The repository is the persistent storage of data, metadata, and content, similar to repositories of traditional information systems.","Business rules are executed on a server side rather than a client side. Consequently, the same validation module does not need to be implemented for individual client applications on different platforms, avoiding potential incompatibility problems. Execution of the present system is transparent to client applications; only data and event messages are exchanged between clients and the server. No changes need to be made in individual clients when business rules are modified. A user can update business rules on the server side; the updated rules are applied to the next data item that matches the modified business rules. Furthermore, the present system enables fine grain control such as access control based on client types, user profiles, etc.","Typically for any action, the present system executes one or more business rules in the form of business rulesets either before taking an action, during an action, or after an action. The present system classifies business rulesets into different types according to the data processing stages: ENTRY stage, ACTION stage, and POST stage. When input data initially enters the business rule engine, ENTRY business rulesets are applied to the input data. After the ENTRY business rulesets are evaluated, the present system executes ACTION business rulesets in the ACTION stage. The ACTION business rulesets modify the content management repository. After the state of the content management repository is modified by the ACTION business rulesets, the present system triggers other possible actions based on the modified state of the content management repository . These business rulesets are categorized as POST business rulesets and this business rule processing stage is the POST stage.","In conventional systems, ACTION and POST business rulesets are usually not possible to implement in client applications for design, security, and performance considerations. Client applications typically require direct access to the content management repository and other parts of the content management system in a middle tier for ACTION and POST business rulesets to be coded into the client layer. This design of deep coupling is not flexible for frequent changes either at the client side or the server side. Implementing ACTION and POST business rules in conventional systems further imposes potential security threats because a bug in the client application can open the door to malicious attackers to the overall content management system. Frequent data and command flow back and forward can affect the system performance as well. In comparison, the present system can incorporate ACTION and POST business rulesets in a business rule engine without exhibiting the above-mentioned behaviors.","The present system decouples business logic from other parts of the content management system. Business logic is not dependent on the mechanisms for obtaining data or executing actions. The architecture of the present system provides standard interfaces between a data\/event layer, the business rule processing layer, and a repository layer. Business logic is managed in a centralized way. Business logic is encoded into small pieces called business rules. The present system precisely controls execution of business rules, execution timing, and execution sequence.","Changes to the business logic are simply translated as creating, updating or deleting the matching business rules. Conflicts and anomalies are quickly and easily resolved and fixed. Furthermore, the total cost of ownership of a content management system utilizing the present system is lower than that of conventional systems because maintenance and development is significantly reduced, the business rule update cycle is accelerated, and the administration process is simplified. The present system allows implementation of additional facilities such as, for example, logging, auditing, and testing.","A useful application of the present system is in enforcing regulatory compliance. For example, the present system can comprise business rules that control when an item can be deleted or updated by the content management system. Adapting to changing regulations is made easier due to the separation of the business rules from the application logic of the content management system.","The following definitions and explanations provide background information pertaining to the technical field of the present invention, and are intended to facilitate the understanding of the present invention without limiting its scope:","Business Rule: A statement defining or constraining some aspect of a business. The business rule is intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.","HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A standard language for attaching presentation and linking attributes to informational content within documents.","XML: extensible Markup Language. A standard format used to describe semi-structured documents and data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","10","10","15","10"]},"While system  is referenced in terms of a data item generated by a user through interaction with a user interface, system  can be used to process one or more business rules associated with any data type or form that can be electronically transmitted, processed, and stored, such as, for example, paper or electronic documents, photographs, video recordings, audio recordings, etc. Furthermore, while the system  is described in terms of a content management system, it should be clear that the present system is applicable as well to any repository such as, for example, file systems, relational databases, object oriented database, XML databases, etc. Moreover, while system  is described in terms of Java, it should be clear that the present system is applicable as well to any object-oriented programming language that is platform independent.","Building blocks of a data model of the content management system  are item types and attributes. In database terminology, an item type corresponds to a table or relation and an attribute corresponds to a table attribute. However, unlike a flat relational table, an item type can have a hierarchical tree-like structure much like an object in object-oriented languages. Attributes for an item type can be structured with parent and child relationships that match the hierarchical structure found in real-world customer application environments. This feature is used to modeling repeating groups in which multiple instances or values of attributes may be present.","For example, a customer insurance policy can have multiple operators and multiple vehicles to be insured. The root node is called the root component and the inner nodes are called child components. Item types also capture information regarding versioning policy and retention period for the items. Application data comprises instances of these item types, called \u201citems\u201d.","The content management system  comprises a client layer , the business rule processing server , and a content management repository . The client layer  comprises various types of client applications that allow a user to enter information in forms; the entered data is referenced as input data or data items. Exemplary client applications comprise an HTML form client  and an XForm client . The HTML form client  and the XForm client  submit information to system  and the content management repository  through an application server . The HTML form client  and the XForm client  represent web-based clients. Other clients  submit information to system  and the content management repository  directly. The content management repository  comprises a repository server  and a repository storage .","The application server  and the other clients  can access the business rule processing server  and the content management repository  through a network . The business rule processing server  accesses the content management repository  and the client layer  through network .","The application server , the other clients , the business rule processing server , and the repository server  each comprise software that allows a secure interface over network . The business rule server  and the repository server  are each connected to network  via a communications link ,  respectively. The communications link ,  comprises links such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link. The application server  and the other clients  can be connected to network  via communications links such as a telephone, cable, or satellite link. The application server  and the other clients  are connected to network  via a communications link , , respectively.","While system  is described in terms of network , the application server , the other clients , the business rule processing server , and the repository server  may also communicate via a local area network, a wide area network, or any other network that allows communication between the application server , the other clients , the business rule processing server , and the repository server . Furthermore, any one or more of the application server , the other clients , the business rule processing server , and the repository server  may be co-located, communicating over a network such as, for example, a local area network while others of the application server , the other clients , the business rule processing server , and the repository server  are located remotely, connecting over a network such as, for example, the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","10","205","210","215","220","205","225","230","225"]},"Client interfaces supported by system  comprise web clients such as the XFORM client  and the HTML form client , and the other clients  that communicate directly with the business rule engine  by calling the business rule processing API . Web clients comprise a Web browser that supports, for example, HTML, XHTML, XForm, etc. Users input data into the Web browser, which performs a mapping between the input data and a data model schema in the content management repository .","The Web client submits the data and the mapping information to the application server . The application server  performs processing and invokes system , passing the data via the API methods of the business rule processing API . Response from system  is returned and rendered at the Web clients. Direct communication from the other clients  to the business rule processing server  is set up locally or over the network  through network file systems, RMI, or Web services.","The business rule processing API  accepts data and events from the client layer  and feeds processing results back to the client layer . The business rule repository  stores business rule definition files. The business rule configuration file  functions as a business rule querying mechanism. A business rule processing connector  comprises a library; the business rule processing connector  is a connector between the business rule engine  and the content management repository , providing content-management-related operations for temporary in-memory objects and persistent in-repository objects stored in the content management repository .","The business rule engine  performs actions comprising querying the business rule repository  to find matching business rules, parsing and executing business rules with related actions, communicating with the content management repository  to carry out create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, and reporting business rule processing results to client applications in the client layer .","The business rule processing connector  assumes the responsibilities of communicating between the content management repository  and the business rule engine . The business rule processing connector  is a library class that comprises various methods to perform create, retrieve, update, and delete operations on item instances that are stored in-memory or in-repository in the content management repository .","The rule module  utilizes one or more business rule definitions file stored in the business rule repository . The business rule definition file is also referenced as a business ruleset because the business rule definition file comprises many business rule blocks. Each business rule block itself comprises many small pieces of business rule definitions. The business rule definition file comprises text format and XML format.

Classification of business rulesets improves scalability when the number of business rules is large.","An exemplary business rule configuration file is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d?>"},{"entry":"<RSMapping xmlns:xsi=\u201chttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\u201d"},{"entry":"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\u201cC:\\project\\BusinessRuleEngine\\"},{"entry":"src\\RSConfig.xsd\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<ItemType ITName=\u201cClaim\u201d StopOnFirstViolation=\u201cfalse\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<ActionType>INSERT<\/ActionType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSType>ENTRY<\/RSType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSName>claim_insert_entry<\/RSName>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSFileType>ARL<\/RSFileType>"},{"entry":"\u2003<RSFileLocation>C:\/eclipse3.0\/workspace\/BusinessRuleEngine\/src\/"},{"entry":"claim_insert_entry.arl<\/RSFileLocation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2003<business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<ActionType>INSERT<\/ActionType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSType>ACTION<\/RSType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSName>claim_insert_action<\/RSName>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSFileType>ARL<\/RSFileType>"},{"entry":"\u2003<RSFileLocation>C:\/eclipse3.0\/workspace\/BusinessRuleEngine\/src\/"},{"entry":"claim_insert_action.arl<\/RSFileLocation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2003<business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<ActionType>INSERT<\/ActionType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSType>POST<\/RSType>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSName>claim_insert_post<\/RSName>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003<RSFileType>ARL<\/RSFileType>"},{"entry":"\u2003<RSFileLocation>C:\/eclipse3.0\/workspace\/BusinessRuleEngine\/src\/"},{"entry":"claim_insert_post.arl<\/RSFileLocation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<\/business ruleset>"},{"entry":"\u2002<\/ItemType>"},{"entry":"\u2002..."},{"entry":"<\/RSMapping>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The exemplary business rule configuration file  shows business ruleset information for a claim item in an insurance application. The exemplary business rule configuration file defines available business ruleset definitions (business ruleset elements) for each item type (ItemType element). The ItemType element has the following attributes: ITName is a string for the ItemType name, StopOnFirstViolation is a Boolean to indicate whether the business rule engine  stops processing a business ruleset when it encounters the initial violation. In each business ruleset, system  can have one or more related business rule definitions and one item instance can violate one or more of the related business rule definitions. If StopOnFirstViolation is false, the business rule engine  does not stop processing at the initial business rule violation.","In one embodiment, the business rule configuration file  comprises XML, as illustrated by the schema view of . The business rule configuration file  comprises a business ruleset mapping . The business ruleset mapping  provides a mapping between a business ruleset and a data type. The business ruleset mapping  comprises one or more item types such as item type , , through item type N, , collectively referenced as item types . In general, the item types  correspond to a table or a relation and comprise a hierarchical tree structure.","Each of the item types  comprises zero or more business ruleset elements. For example, item type , , comprises business ruleset -, , through business ruleset -N,  (collectively referenced as business ruleset , ). Item type N, , comprises business ruleset N-, , through business ruleset N-N,  (collectively referenced as business ruleset N, ). Each of the business ruleset elements (i.e., business ruleset ,  through business ruleset N, ) comprises the following child elements: ActionType, RSType, RSName, RSFileType, and RSFileLocation. In , child elements are shown for business rule set -, : ActionType -, ; RSType -, ; RSName -, ; RSFileType -, ; and RSFileLocation -, .","In general, ActionType captures information about what action triggers the business rule. Client applications may need to invoke the business rule engine  at different times while performing different actions on data items. System  comprises the following action types: INSERT for creating a new item instance in the content management repository ; UPDATE for changing content of an existing item instance in the content management repository ; and DELETE for removing an existing item instance from the content management repository . Action types can comprise other actions such as moving an item from one stage to the next in a workflow, etc. RSName assigns a string to each business ruleset bean as a name. RSFileType selects the format type of the ruleset file such as, for example, text or XML. RSFileLocation comprises a string for a path in the file system where the business rule definition file can be located.","RSType contains a string that specifies the business ruleset type. Typically for any action, system  executes one or more business rules either before taking an action, during an action or after an action. System  classifies business rulesets into different types according to the data processing stages: ENTRY stage, ACTION stage, and POST stage.","When input data initially enters the business rule engine , ENTRY business rulesets are applied to the input data. ENTRY business rulesets can be used to validate a data item before taking an action. In an auto-fill feature, ENTRY business rulesets can be used to automatically set some attributes of the data item based on predetermined conditions. ENTRY business rulesets can perform queries on the content management repository  to obtain attribute values based on pre-defined primary-foreign key relationships on the data model of the content management system . The query results are used to automatically replace invalid attribute values and fill missing attribute values.","For example, the business rule set mapping  comprises a policy item type (insurance policy) and claim item type (claim filed for an accident). The policy item type and claim item type comprise a PolicyNumber attribute and a NamedInsured attribute. The PolicyNumber attribute can be used as a primary key on the policy item type and a foreign key on the claim item type. If an instance of the policy item type in the content management repository  comprises a PolicyNumber that matches the PolicyNumber of the incoming instance of the claim item type, system  knows that the instance of the claim item type is valid because the claimed PolicyNumber exists. Further, system  can automatically assign the NamedInsured value on the instance of the Policy item type to the NamedInsured attribute on the instance of the claim item type.","The auto-fill feature can avoid invalid input data and reduce input effort. After validation and auto-fill, the remaining ENTRY business rulesets are executed on the input data to test constraints on value boundary, relationship cardinality, and other user-specified conditions. For example, system  can comprise a business ruleset that checks whether the age of a person falls between 18 and 24 (young driver) or between 50 and 70 (senior driver) as a group for special insurance rates.","In one embodiment, validation functionality such as validation performed by ENTRY business rulesets is implemented in the client applications, i.e., validation using JavaScript in a Web browser.","After the ENTRY business rulesets are evaluated, system  executes ACTION business rulesets. ACTION business rulesets perform operations on the input data such as, for example, insert a new item instance into the content management repository , or update existing item instances in the content management repository .","After the state of the content management repository  is modified by the ACTION business rulesets, system  triggers other possible actions based on the modified state of the content management repository . These business rulesets are categorized as POST business rulesets and this business rule processing stage is the POST stage. For example, an exemplary POST business ruleset is defined as \u201cwhen all the auto insurance application documents are ready and verified, create a new folder (a special item type in the content management repository ), and notify manager Jack for endorsement\u201d. This POST business ruleset generates a new folder in the content management repository , places the application documents in the generated folder, and routes the generated folder to a workflow system for approval by the manager.","POST business rulesets provide a mechanism to initiate further steps after an action has been taken to update the state of the content management repository . POST business rulesets can be used to initiate and execute a business process and to support event-based actions and notifications. A POST action may trigger cascading calls into the business rule engine  since the generation of another item can require execution of the ENTRY, ACTION, and POST business rules for that generated item.","System  exposes the following public API methods for an application in the client layer  to use: a validate method (validate ) and a commit method (commit ( )). The validate method requests the business rule engine  to execute the ENTRY business rulesets on the input data in-memory. The commit method requests the business rule engine  to process the applicable business rulesets in, for example, the following order: ENTRY business rulesets, ACTION business rulesets, and POST business rulesets. Consequently, the validate method allows applications in the client layer  to initiate pre-submit validation ensuring that input data are valid. The validate method further automatically fills certain missing data through queries to the content management repository . When the applications in the client layer  are ready to submit the data to the content management repository , the commit method is called. The business rules associated with the input data type are executed to change the state of the content management repository  and trigger future operations based on the modified state of the content management repository .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 4A"],"b":["4","4","400","10","405","35","30","10","15","45","410","425","40","10","220","415"]},"Based on the input data, event types, and attributes, the business rule engine  queries the business rule configuration file and retrieves business rule definition files associated with the data from the business rule repository  (step ).","If at decision step  it is determined that validation is not required, the business rule engine  identifies the business rule repository  ENTRY business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The ENTRY business rulesets contain the validation rules for the input data as well as rules for auto-filling certain fields of the data.","The business rule engine  performs the identified ENTRY business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The business rule engine  then returns the validation results, along with the auto-filled fields to the client (step ). The client presents this information to the user through the user interface. The user reviews and updates as needed data on the commit form (step ).","Based on the user interaction, the client determines whether a user commit is required for the input data (decision step ). If a user commit is required, the client applications of the user provide input data with or without the application server  to system  by calling the commit( ) method of the business rule processing API  (step ). The business rule engine  identifies in the business rule repository  ENTRY business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The business rule engine  performs the identified ENTRY business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ).","After applying the ENTRY rules, the business rule engine  identifies in the business rule repository  ACTION business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The business rule engine  performs the identified ACTION business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The business rule engine  identifies in the business rule repository  POST business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ). The business rule engine  performs the identified POST business ruleset(s) that match the input data (step ).","During the business rule execution process, the business rule engine  communicates with the content management repository  to perform create, retrieve, update, and delete operations. The data model for client applications in the client layer  is pre-defined in the content management repository  and the business rule engine  knows the mapping between input data and the data model. Consequently, the business rule engine  can recognize input data types and applications can be notified of results in the desired format. The results further trigger other type of actions if the business rule engine is integrated with applications such as, for example, process management or workflow systems.","As illustrated in  by a method  of system , system  enables dynamic scenarios in which business rules may change over time due to changes in the business requirements, company policies, government regulations, etc. The business rule engine  monitors the business rule configuration file  and the business rule definition files in the business rule repository  for changes (step ). If changes are not found (decision step ), the business rule engine  continues monitoring in step .","When changes are found (decision step ), the business rule engine  updates the memory data structure of the business rule engine  with new or updated business rule configuration file(s)  and the new or updated business rule definition file(s) (step ). The new or updated business rule definition file(s) and the new or updated business rule configuration files(s)  are effective on the next invocation of the business rule engine . The business rule engine  applies to subsequent input data the new or updated business rule configuration file(s)  and the new or updated business rule definition file(s) (step ). Consequently, the business rulesets can be dynamically updated without having to explicitly shut down the server applications. The business rule engine  returns to step  and continues to monitor the business rule configuration file  and the business rule definition files.","An exemplary application of system  comprises auto insurance management.
