title: Search engine
abstract: The present invention provides for a method of updating an internet search engine database with the results of a user's selection of specific web page listings from the general web page listing provided to the user as a result of his initial keyword search entry. By updating the database with the selections of many different users, the database can be updated to prioritize those web listings that have been selected the most with respect to a given keyword, and thereby presenting first the most popular web page listings in a subsequent search using the same keyword search entry.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/115,802 filed Jul. 15, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,675.","This application is related to U.S. Application Ser. No. 60\/078,199 entitled \u201cImproved Search Engine\u201d that was filed on Mar. 16, 1998.","The present invention relates to a method and apparatus that allows for enhanced database searching, and more particularly, for use as an internet search engine.","An efficient and practical means of obtaining relevant information and also screening unwanted\/uninteresting information has been an ongoing need, especially since the inception of the internet. This need is particularly acute at present due to the exponential growth in the number of world-wide web sites and the sheer volume of information contained therein. In an attempt to index the information available on the internet, a number of software search engines have been created via which a user enters a search command comprised of suitable keywords from a keyboard at his personal computer. The search command is transmitted to a server computer, that has a search engine associated with the server computer. The search engine receives the search command, and then using it scans for these key words through a database of web addresses and the text stored on the web sites. Thereafter, the results of the scan are transmitted from the server computer back to the user's computer and displayed on the screen of the user's computer.","In order for the search engine to be aware of new web sites and to update its records of existing sites, either the proprietors of the web sites notify the search engine themselves or the information may be obtained via a \u2018web crawler\u2019 to update the database at the server computer. A web crawler is an automated program which explores and records the contents of a web site and its links to other sites, thereby spreading between sites in an attempt to index all the current sites.","This database structure and method of searching it poses some significant difficulties. The internet growth-rate has resulted in a substantial backlog in the scanning of new sites, notwithstanding the fact that web sites are frequently deleted, re-addressed, updated and so forth, thus leaving the search engine with outdated and\/or misleading information. Although the web crawlers can be configured to prioritize possible key-words according to their location (title, embedded link, address etc), nevertheless, depending on the type of search engine used, substantial portions of the web site text (often involving the majority or even all of the site text) is still required to be scanned. This results in colossal storage requirements for the search engine. Furthermore, a typical key word search may bring up an excessively large volume of material, the majority of which may be of little interest to the user. The user typically makes a selection from the list based on the brief descriptions of the site and explores the chosen sites until the desired information is located.","These results are in the form of a list, ranked according to criteria specific to the search engine. These criteria may range from the number of occurrences of the key-words anywhere within the searched text, to methods giving a weighting to key-words used in particular positions (as previously mentioned). When multiple key-words have been used, sites are also ranked according to the number of different key-words applicable. A fundamental drawback of all these ranking systems is their objectivity\u2014they are determined according to the programmed criteria of the search engine, and the emphasis placed on particular types of site design, rather than any measure of the actual users' opinions. Indeed this can lead to the absurd situation whereby in an attempt to ensure a favorable rating by the most commonly used search engines, some designers deliberately configure their sites in the light of the previously mentioned criteria, to the detriment of the presentation, readability and content of the site.","It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate the aforementioned disadvantages of conventional search engines by harnessing the cerebral power of the human operator.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel search engine with enhanced efficiency, usability and effectiveness with a reduced system storage and\/or computational requirements in comparison to existing software engines.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a variety of indications of the popularity of the search data, together with an indication of its date of creation or updating.","In order to obtain the above recited advantages of the present invention, among others, one embodiment of the present invention provides for a method of updating an internet search engine database with the results of a user's selection of specific web page listings from the general web page listing provided to the user as a result of his initial keyword search entry. By updating the database with the selections of many different users, the database can be updated to prioritize those web listings that have been selected the most with respect to a given keyword, and thereby presenting first the most popular web page listings in a subsequent search using the same keyword search entry.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of determining content to provide along with listings transmitted from a server computer to user sites is provided. In this embodiment, there is obtained a content listing from each one of a plurality of different developer sites. Each of the content listings includes content, a developer identifier, and a keyword, and a keyword selection factor. Thereafter, there is determined a particular keyword from the obtained keywords that is the same for different content listings. For that particular keyword, the keyword selection factor is used in determining when to transmit different content listings to the user sites.","In still another embodiment, there is provided a method of updating a keyword table with the results of a user's selection of specific keywords which were obtained from a list of related keywords presented to the user. By updating the database with selections of many different users associated with that same keyword, appropriate keywords can be provided and presented first when that same keyword is subsequently entered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},"The present invention is preferably implemented in a network environment wherein each computer contains, typically, a microprocessor, memory, and modem, and certain of the computers contain displays and the like, as are well known. As shown in , a plurality of user sites\/computers A-D are shown, as are a plurality of server computers A-B, and developer sites\/computers A-B. It is understood that in a typical internet network, that different server computers  can be interconnected together, as is illustrated. Further, while only a few user sites, developer sites and server computers are shown, it is understood that thousands of such computers are interconnected together.","While the specific embodiments of the present invention are written for applications in which the invention is implemented as sequences of coded program instructions operated upon by a server computer  as illustrated, it will be understood that certain sequences of these program instructions could instead be implemented in other forms, such as processors having specific instructions specifically tailored for the applications described hereinafter.","As will be illustrated hereinafter, additional operations, transparent to the user, are implemented in order to obtain search results in the future based upon currently made searches. As shown, the present invention has various capabilities, each of which are illustrated in a parallel flow in , which illustrates an overview of the different capabilities that can be ongoing simultaneously.

Thereafter, in step , search input obtained from one of a variety of sources is input and used along with the algorithm selected in step  to determine search results. The results of this search are then displayed to the user, as shown by steps of displaying a created list of web pages, displaying passively suggested web pages, and displaying actively suggested web pages, identified as steps , , and , respectively, in . This capability, and how it is implemented, will be described in more detail hereinafter.","In order for keyword suggestion to take place, which the user may or may not select, there is preferably an initial step  in which the type of keyword search algorithm to use is selected. Although many systems may have only one such algorithm, various ones, as described hereinafter, are possible. Once the keyword search algorithm is selected, step  follows in which, based upon a keyword entered by a user, the current set of keyword data is operated upon to determine associated keywords. The results of this operation are then displayed to the user in .

As illustrated in , which provide an overview of the search engine capabilities according to the present invention in which web pages are selected in making up the search results provided to the end user. In step , the user enters up to 4 sets of data: keyword , profile type , search type  and User ID . The IP address  and date-time  are not entered by the user but can be read when a user uses the search engine. This data is used is used in parallel in steps  and  to produce list of web pages. Step , discussed in detail hereinafter, is the process of selecting web pages from novel new search engine data sets produced in accordance with the present invention. This can run, if desired, in parallel with step  which obtains a selection of web pages from other existing search engines. Thereafter, selection of web pages from step  and  are combined and tagged in step . The process of tagging the list of web pages, described in more detail below, enables a set of data, shown as surfer trace data in , to be created and sent back to the search engine when the search engine user selects a web-page from the list in step . The process of selecting a tagged web-page creates the following series of data which is used to update the search engine data sets; keyword , URL , user ID , IP address , date-time , brief web page description .","Although it is preferred to use all of these different data types in the surfer trace data, use of different combinations of this data is fully within the intended scope of the present invention. The description  will typically only be included in the preferred embodiment of the invention when a new site is added to the data set  of the search engine , and the description used will be that description that appears on the original list of web pages. The date-time data  may only indicate that a site was selected, rather than record the period of time a user was at a particular site, as explained further hereinafter. This process is invisible to the user who, upon selecting the web-page from the list of web pages is taken directly to the corresponding URL, step . Details of the implementation of steps ,  and  will be described in more detail hereinafter.","After the initial selection the user may choose to access another of the web-page URL search results. Depending on the relevance of the site, the user may spend time reading, downloading, exploring further pages, embedded links and so forth, or if the site appears irrelevant\/uninteresting, the user may return directly back to the search results after a short period. The time difference between the two selections is recorded as the difference between two date\/time data  from subsequent selections from the list of web page searches (in this embodiment, one can only measure the time spent at one web page if another selection is made after visiting that web page\u2014this then provides another surfer trace  which allow a time difference to be calculated). This surfer trace data on the popularity of web pages is used to rank the subsequent searches, as described further hereinafter.","Thus, according to the present invention, it is the human users' powers of reasoning and analysis that is being used to establish the relevance of the different results to the subject matter of the search. The present invention utilizes the cumulative processing and reasoning of all the human users' to provide a vastly more effective means of obtaining the required information sources than is presently possible with the type of method described above.","As described above, human brain power is captured by recording which web pages the user goes to after each keyword search. According to the present invention, collecting the surfer trace data is achieved by sending, in the list of web pages generated by the search to the user, hidden links that will automatically send information back to the search engine (or a subsidiary server). While the user only sees that his intended link is displayed, the hidden link notifies the search engine of the transfer, which process can be executed with a Java applet. Thus, when the Internet user selects a web-page it takes the user to that address but also sends off the surfer trace data to the search engine , which notes what has been selected. When the user returns to the list of web pages and selects another web page listing, another Java applet is then executed which creates another surfer trace. The difference between the data time data in this surfer trace from two sequential selections captures the time period that the user has been at the previous web site. This occurs without the user knowing this data is being sent.","In another embodiment, rather than using multiple Java applets to collect a complete list of surfer trace data, there is no description data , and the date-time data  indicates that a user visited a particular web site. In one specific embodiment, the user must visit a particular web site for greater than a predetermined period of time, such as one minute or fifteen minutes, depending on what is an appropriate time to have looked at the site for the visit to the site to count and for any surfer trace data to be sent back to the search engine , as well be described hereinafter. In this embodiment, each applet contains all of the information necessary to update the database at the search engine. Another embodiment collects the surfer trace data prior to a user navigating to the intended web site. Other ways of obtaining this surfer trace data are possible and are within the intended scope of the present invention.","Thus, the search results page according to the present invention is therefore differently formatted from conventional search engines' results pages. The difference is in action rather than content. Visually, the page looks the same to the user as standard search results from other search engines.","An example illustrates this point: In a conventional search, the results page for a search of the keyword \u201cWeather\u201d may read: 1. www.weather.com Today's weather forecast. Today is expected to be fine and sunny everywhere.","The HTTP link associated with the \u201cwww.weather.com\u201d label is \u201chttp:\/\/www.weather.com\u201d. This means that if the user selects this link, they will navigate to this page directly","In contrast, according to the present invention, the tagged result page for the search made suing the keyword \u201cWeather\u201d may read","1. www.weather.com Today's weather forecast. Today is expected to be fine and sunny everywhere.","The HTTP link associated with the \u201cwww.weather.com\u201d label is \u201clink.asp?n=1.\u201d If the user selects this link, therefore, in a process is invisible to the user, the user is first directed to the link.asp page on the site corresponding to the web server using the search engine  according to the present invention, and pass parameter n with value 1.","Server side code (application code that runs on the web server) uses this parameter to identify the URL and description of the user's chosen site. This information is then stored in a database Table along with other surfer trace data. The server side code then executes a redirect operation to the user's required URL. The user then sees their required page appear.","The source of search results is independent to this activity. The destination page of the user is independent of this activity. The process is one of recording a user, keyword and destination into a database. This method of tracking can only record the initial web-page visited after a keyword search. If the user continues to return to the search results list then subsequent web-page visits can be recorded.","The surfer trace data that is sent back to the data sets  of the search engine  as a result of the user selecting the web-page can be encrypted to prevent fraudulent users from sending fake data to the search engine.","Another method of tracking where a user may connect to from an initial URL selection (if they do not return to the search result page) is to run the selected web-pages as part of a \u2018frame\u2019 located at the search engine web-site. This permits a complete record of the web pages visited to be recorded after a keyword is entered. However, this imposes an additional level of complexity to the system with a possible decrease in system response time.","As previously mentioned, the surfer trace data that can be collected includes keyword , URL , user ID , IP address , date-time , brief web page description , and is identified as such since it provides a trace or record of how searchers (surfers) use the search engine. This data is used to improve future searches building on the preferences of previous searchers. The surfer trace is thus a measure of the preferred choices of an individual user or web \u2018surfers\u2019 from the initial search results for a particular set of key-words.","How the Data Sets are Created that Determine the List of Web Pages",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["164","166","168","170","172","174","188"]},"The structure of the aforementioned data sets are described in more detail hereinafter.

If the user has a profile type then the cumulative number for the keyword for each type of profile will also be incremented (W, W W etc).","Populating the Web-Page Data Table (URL Table) ","This table is populated in a number of ways, including:\n\n","The cumulative surfer trace table , also referred to above as Table 4, is populated each time a \u201ctagged\u201d web-page is selected by a user. This sends a packet of surfer trace information, such that the surfer trace data is added to the table each time the user selects another web page from a web page list.","Populating the Keyword URL Link Table ","The data from the cumulative surfer trace  is used to update the popularity of web pages as recorded in Table 3 (X,Y), also referred to as the keyword URL link table . The frequency of updating Table 3 with the data from the cumulative surfer trace () to obtain new values of X and Y is a variable that can be changed, from ranges that are shorter than every hour to longer than every month. It should be noted that different keywords can be updated at different intervals of time.","An intermediary step in processing the cumulative surfer trace is to form a cumulative surfer hit table. This is subsequently used to modify the values of and X,Y in Table 3","As mentioned above, the simplest method of recording a link (\u201cuseful visit\u201d or \u201chit\u201d) between a keyword and a URL would be to count each keyword, URL paring in a surfer trace as a \u201chit\u201d. A more meaningful and sophisticated method is only to count a location selection as a valid if the user meets certain criteria. This criterion could be the user exceeding a specified time at a location. If this criterion was not met, the selection would not be increase the cumulative value of X in Table 3.","It is also possible to increment the value of X based on the time spent at the web page. The longer the time spent the more this increments the value of X. X does not have to be a whole number.","Due to the variations in web-site capabilities in terms of log-on times, down loading times, bandwidth, and response times, the predetermined time used to denote a valid \u2018hit\u2019 may be suitably altered. Specialist web crawlers may be employed to independently validate such data.","The selection of a content provider's banner after a keyword search counts as a hit for their web-page (increment the value of X). This will enable their web pages to possibly go up the popularity list associated with the keyword. This acts as a mechanism to enable a web-page developer to pay to be seen with a keyword. They can not pay to go up the popularity list\u2014this will only occur if people visit their site and spend time there and record a valid hit for the popular list.

For example, an URL submission specifically targeted at New Zealanders (e.g. Z) will appear at the top of keyword new list when New Zealanders search for that keyword. It will remain at the top until someone else submits a URL for that keyword targeted at New Zealanders. URL's that are targeted at other audiences will not appear as new sites for New Zealanders or alternatively they will not feature as high in the new list as the ones specifically targeted at New Zealanders.","The data on new web pages does not necessarily have to be entered by web-page developers. It could be automated by having a web document template that automatically submits data to the search engine whenever the information on the web-page has been significantly changed. It would prompt the web-page developer to change any key-words as appropriate.","Another embodiment requires sending specialist crawlers out to find web site addresses and key-words, though this has many of the drawbacks of existing web-crawlers. It could only be effective if web designers deliberately configured their page with the key-words identified. Any web site designer\/proprietor willing to do this would also presumably be willing to submit any updates to the search engine to benefit from the instantaneous listing on the search results.","An extension of this principle is to auto-detect if a web address possessed key-word information in the database and then automatically send an invitation to provide the information to enable their web-page to be found easily. The ideal number of key-words to be submitted with each web-page is preferably less than 50 and probably preferable within the range of about 5 and 20. This also advantageously forces web-site designers to find the most appropriate keywords to describe their site and also enable them to choose the audience they wish to target.","The web-page submission process may also include web-page developer identification process that restricts the ability of people to use the system fraudulently.

From this the percentage increase in hits is calculated. An alternative method would be to rank the rate of change of popularity by the number of places they rose compared to last time.","The formula of calculating the rate of change of popularity for this embodiment is given by:\n\n((X\u2212Y)\/Y)\u00b7(X\/(X\u03b2))\n\nwhere Xis the maximum value of X for the corresponding key-words and \u03b2 is an additional variable that can be changed to alter the relative significance of changes at the top and bottom of the popularity list.\n","The reason for multiplying by the maximum value of X is to ensure that small changes at the lower popularity levels do not swamp more significant changes higher up the table. For example, a web site having previously recorded only one selection and then attracting 5 hits the next day would exhibit percentage increase of 500% whilst another web-page may have experienced an increase from 520 hits to 4000 hits (a much more significant increase) though this would otherwise appear as a lower percentage increase.","Random Search.","This is a random selection of less-popular web-pages for the user that want to look at web-pages off the beaten track, based upon a random selection of web pages that has any value of X, Y, and Z associated with a keyword that is entered. Accordingly, after a user enters a keyword in step  as indicated in , reference is made to the keyword URL link table  illustrated in , and a random list of web pages numbers are generated automatically using a random number generator are determined, as illustrated at step . Only web pages that have values for X, Y or Z associated with the key word are chosen in this random selection as this indicates that at some stage in the past as used or web page developer thought the web page had some connection to the keyword. Thereafter, in step  the list of web-page numbers found from step  is combined with the URL address and web-page description from Table 2 ( ). In step  the resulting list of web pages is then tagged, depending on the results of step  in  as described previously, and sent to the user for them to make their selections.","Conventional Search.","This is the normal search method of a conventional search engine, referenced as other search engine  in , which may or may not be included along with the searches according to the present invention, at the option of the user, as noted previously.","Content Only Search.","This is a list of content, such as advertisements, associated with the key-word, which the user cannot control.

Because the user has a password that can be used to logon to the system the user will thus be able to access their personal preferences form from any computer.","Due to this search capability there is, therefore, no need to manually bookmark web pages. If a user forgot to book-mark a good site on, for example, \u2018marbles\u2019, they can easily find it by retyping the keyword that lead them to that site. If a user's preferences change they will be reflected in the personal links table .","Another embodiment of the personal preference search includes specifying the date the web page was last visited, with or without using a keyword. The web pages are then ranked based on Z in personal links table  of . For example if a user looked at a site in the middle of last year the user can refine the search by date, thus making it easier to find a previously useful web-pages more easily, even if they could not remember the relevant keyword.","This automatic book-marking feature can also act as a device for monitoring the type of Internet use being undertaken by a particular computer and thus for example, can provide warning to parents\/employers of children\/employees accessing undesirable sites, such as adult web-pages. In a preferred embodiment, for parents\/employers unlikely to use the computer themselves, notification of such usage is automatically provided by letter to the parent\/employer that lists the keywords selected and web pages visited by the children\/employees. This information is found directly from each user table  of . This requires a user identification code that also included parental\/employee information.","Collective Search","The collective search, as illustrated in , is the default search according to the present invention and is used when the user does not actively choose on of the other search options.","Upon entry of a keyword in step , that keyword is used to select from a combination of web page selections associated with that keyword. As shown, for example, in step , an equally weighted combination of conventional, popular, highflier, new and past search results is used to obtain a list of web page numbers. Thereafter, in step  the list of web-page numbers found from step  is combined with the URL address and web-page description from Table 2 ( ). In step  the resulting list of web pages is then tagged, depending on the results of step  in  as described previously, and sent to the user for them to make their selections. the system is first configured, the search engine  database will not posses any information on popular, high flyers and new web page hit-lists, so search results will initially be obtained from the conventional hit-list (normal search engine), and the tagged web pages then used to create the database sets as have been described.

Using the search system of the present invention, the users' themselves dynamically decide what is and is not worth seeing. Thus, although editorial input is needed regarding a hierarchy of subjects, the web-pages that emerge as the most popular for each of these subjects will evolve automatically.","Use of Data Sets for Different Groups of People","Different popular hit-lists may be employed to provide results which would reflect different cultural, geographical, professional, gender or age interests. Thus, as shown in , when a user enters a keyword and User ID in step , the default profile of the user can be used to reflect the type of web pages that people of the same \u201cgroup\u201d as the user profiles desire to see. Thus, the search that takes place in step  is based on the subscripted X, Y and Z values obtained from the default profile of people of those \u201cgroup\u201d affiliations identified in the user's personal profile obtained in step . Thus, the rather than an overall global search result, search results are obtained particularized for the group that the user identifies with. The resulting list of web pages, derived from steps  and , as have been previously described, are particularized for that group.","Thus, for a particular user with the profile type New Zealand selected as a geographical factor, a search for team field sports and related key-words, rugby material might figure prominently, whereas an American profile type may produce a bias towards baseball\/American football material, for example. This technique offers the ability to discriminate between the different meanings of the same words, according to the context of the popular hit-list associated with a particular profile type. A general search using a key-word \u2018accommodation\u2019 for example would include results related to housing, renting and similar, whereas if the user indicated an interest in optometry in their profile type, then the term \u2018accommodation\u2019 would be interpreted quite differently.","The relevance of such sites will evolve automatically, without any active evaluation of the sites by the search engine operator or the user. There are no complex algorithms required to analyze the relevance of web-sites for particular types of users. Instead, the type of site deemed relevant will be decided by those users selecting those characteristics for their profile type, i.e. American females interested in rock-climbing. Sites of greater relevance will naturally attract more hits, increasing their ranking and thus increasing the chance of a subsequent user also investigating the site. In the above example, any web sites listed for the keyword \u2018accommodation\u2019 which were unrelated to optometry, sight, lens, vision, etc., would not be accessed for the period of time required to make a valid hit. It would therefore receive a very low ranking and hence be even less likely to be accessed by further users.","The user can select different profile types for different searches during a single session and is not be restricted to the default profile types.","In a further embodiment of the invention, there can be included a level of authentication for person's of a certain group to have their search results actually be used for purpose of updating the database relating to that group. For example, doctors who have a user ID that identifies them as doctors may perform a search related to a certain medical condition, and their selections can be tagged and used in the database for that group of doctors as has been previously described. However, although patient's may desire to identify their profile with that of the same group of doctors, their selections are not as significant as those of the actual doctors, and thus while they are able to view the web page listings that doctors deem most pertinent, their selections are not used to update the doctor's group database, since their IDs do not identify them as a doctor","Limiting Search Options","Another feature of the present invention is keyword eliminator feature, which is illustrated in , and prevents certain users, such as children, from searching for undesirable keywords and web-pages when the keyword eliminator feature is turned on. The present inventor's have realized that it is potentially much easier for example, to stop children searching for pornography, rather than attempting to trace and prevent access to all sites on the Internet with pornographic content. This would be used as a complimentary tool to existing \u201cnet nanny\u201d type devices. Thus, as shown in , with the keyword eliminator turned on, a preexisting table inaccessible keywords is stored in a table and compared in step  with a keyword previously entered, as shown by step . Thus, keywords that are inaccessible will not be searched. Thus, for example, parents could choose the types of keywords  that they do not want their children to search for\u2014and this will be different for different sets of parents. The system filters out the keywords that may be used for subsequent searching in step .","Determining which Users to Sample",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0203","num":"0245"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 4"],"b":"170"},"As shown in , after entry of keywords and other data in step , there are three decisions that determine whether results are actually \u201ctagged\u201d as has been previously described in step  of .","As shown by step , for a user that has a user ID and has chosen to use the personal links table  of  (Table 6) as previously described, it is necessary to \u201ctag\u201d all of their results so that all of their past preferences are recorded in their personal links table . The search engine according to the present invention system can update the user's personal preferences but not update Table 3 if certain security levels have not been satisfied (see below). If, however, the personal link table  is stored on an individual's computer rather than at central location there is no need to send out tagged results as the data is stored locally.","As shown by step , when a keyword is submitted, a check is made that the IP address  has not already searched the keyword using security table  (Table 7) before the user is sent a set of tagged results. If so, the user can still undertake the search though it will not contribute to the cumulative surfer trace  (Table 4). This allows all normal users to affect the popular hit-list and all users to search whatever they would like, but prevents fraudulent users, such as spammers, from contributing to the popular hit-list. The security table  can also include information on links between keywords  and a user ID  to detect repeat searching.","While it is possible for user's to change the IP address of their computer, this is also detectable and preventable by a number of methods such registering and tracking the use of IP numbers.","methods to exclude false searches include:\n\n","As shown by step , popular keywords can be traced once every tenth, hundredth, or even thousandth occurrence, and the frequency of this selection can be changed to optimize the system. The frequency of keyword usage is determined from keyword table  as shown in  (Table 1). The frequency of sending out tagged results can also be linked to the rate at which popularity is changing for different key words. For example the keyword \u201cIBM\u201d would probably have IBM's home page at the top and most user's would go there, whereas the key word \u201clatest fads\u201d may have a constantly changes set of web pages that needs to be sampled more frequently.","To avoid the keyword URL link table  of  (Table 3) from becoming unduly large, one method is to only register keywords in Table 3 once they reach a certain frequency of usage. This is controlled by not sending out tagged results for less frequently used keywords (found from Table 1).","Active Suggestion of Web Pages to Visit","Another feature of the present is illustrated by , and involves using data to actively suggest web pages. This is different from a search because the user sets up the request and is informed if there is any new data on the subject. To do this the users has to actively specify which keywords they are interested in and the profile type that they would like to act as a filter or agent and the search type (new, highflying, popular) in step . This information is stored in the user's profile ID  shown in  (Table 5).","Thus, at various interval's the user receives a list of suggested web pages determined by a group of like minded humans. For example a user may choose to be notified of web pages with the following",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0213","num":"0258"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00025","num":"00025"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Keyword 582","profile type (agent 588)","Search type 586"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Rugby","New Zealand, Male","highflying"]},{"entry":["Decay treatments","Dentist","new"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"This way if there are highflying web pages on \u201crugby\u201d that other New Zealand males found useful (i.e. they spent a significant amount of time looking at the information\u2014high rate of change of X in Table 3) the user would be notified. Similarly if there was any new information on \u201cdecay treatments\u201d submitted for dentists to look at, the user would be identified about it (value of Z in Table 3). It is unlikely that a computer agent will ever be as good at filtering information as a selected group of peers. An advantage of this system compare to other \u201cagent type\u201d software is that this does not require any software on the user's computer. It is all included as a natural extension to the other search engine data sets.","The suggested web-sites can be displayed for the user when they next access the search engine or they may choose to be notified of these suggested web pages via e-mail notification.

For example, it may be that the user frequently looks at Rugby information as a \u201cNew Zealand, male\u201d and looks at decay treatments as a \u201cdentist\u201d. This information can be found from the automatic book marking table, previously referred to personal links table . If the user has not looked at these subjects for a certain length of time and there are new or highflying information sources, the user will be automatically notified of these new information sources.","In a modification of this embodiment, a periodic e-mail can be sent out with the two newest and highest flying sites related to the key-words of the user.","Determining a List of Suggested Keywords","A problem with Internet searching for many users is knowing which key-word to use for searching. While the present invention could be implemented with an infinite number of keywords, too many key-words (includes phrases) that users choose can be problematic.","Accordingly, as shown in , the present invention also provides for a data set  that provides synonyms for the keywords entered along with the particular profile type in step . The system represented in  is referred to as a key word suggester. This is implemented, in one embodiment, by matching the key-word entered by the user in step  with the existing key-words and phrases in keyword table  of  (Table 1) that other users have tried using other search methods, identified in step . Each keyword is then tagged in step , and those that are selected by a user in step  are used to form a keyword surfer trace  as shown in , which contains the original keyword  that the user entered, the keyword selected , and the IP address , user ID  and date-time  data as in the previously described web page surfer trace.","The data from the cumulative keyword surfer trace  is then used to reinforce links between keywords. In this way the system learns which keywords are associated with each other. The system learns which words are related to each other in the same way that the system learns which URL's are associated with the key-words. The lists of suggested keywords will become more relevant over time as the relevancy is improved each time the keyword suggester is used.","Creating Data Sets that Determine the Suggested Keywords","As shown in , a keyword link table  and a cumulative keyword trace table  are used along with the previously described security table  to create the data sets for suggested keywords. The key-word link table , shown in Table 10 below, records how often each key-word is selected from the suggested key-word list.

Thus, if people enter an uncommon keyword such as \u201ccassetes\u201d instead of \u201ccassettes\u201d the key-word suggester will suggest that the user tries \u201ccassettes\u201d. There is therefore, no need to create a set of URL-keyword links in Table 3 for \u201ccassetes\u201d Thus saving on data space and there is also no need to send a tagged set of results for the keyword \u201ccassetes\u201d. Hence there will be less data sent back to the search engine.","It is also a contemplated embodiment to run the keyword suggester like Table 3 and have high flying keyword associations and new keyword associations so the system can learn how keyword associations change over time. For example, the keyword suggester trace can store the most recent keyword links and modify the main key-word trace by a history factor, in the same way as Table 3 is modified by the cumulative surfer trace.","The cumulative keyword surfer trace  is processed in the same way as the cumulative web-page surfer trace  of  to reinforce links between keywords in the keyword link table  (Table 10). A time variable can also be included so that if a user chooses another keyword very quickly it is assumed that the previous keyword was not useful and is not counted as a keyword surfer trace.","Also, the individual keyword suggester can store, for each user, their personal keyword links. Further, the keyword suggester can be based on a number of different profile types. The word associations may be quite different for people of different culture, nationality, occupation and age etc. Different keyword suggesters can capture the key-word association of different groups of people.

Using the Tables to create a list of suggested keywords",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0235","num":"0286"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"One manner is by ranking the values of X in the keyword link table  (Table 10). This ranked list of keywords is combined with keywords from a normal search of keywords, described previously with respect to step  of .","Another manner of suggesting keywords, shown as step , is to compare the popular list (URLs X values) for the user-entered key-word with the popular-list of other key-words in Table 3. A similarity pattern X values in Table 3 indicates that these keywords are similar. For example a user may search for \u201cfilm reviews\u201d and the keyword suggester may come up with \u201cmovie reviews\u201d which has a more comprehensively searched list of sites. In this case there is no physical similarity between the words movie and film, but they are linked by the similarity of the patterns of URLs links they have in common in Table 3.","The usefulness of the key word suggester list is enhanced indicated by step , by associating with each key-word on the suggestion list an indication of whether there are any of the aforementioned searches available (popular, high flyer, etc.) for that key-word in keyword URL links table  of  (Table 3). The keywords with the most search results are then highlighted.","Decision to Send out Tagged Keyword Suggestions List","The security table  and keyword link table  are used to determine which keyword links to sample in a manner similar to that previously described with respect to tagging web pages. As with the decision for tagging web pages this can depend on whether it is a repeat keyword (found from security table ) and on the frequency of keyword usage (found from keyword table ), as well as the considerations previously discussed.","Determining Other Content","When searching on the Internet, various different web pages listings and web pages are displayed as has been described. One common characteristic of each these different web page listings that have been described is that when they are displayed they appear substantially identical to one another. As shown in , each of the different listings , though the text may be different, is otherwise visually identical. Other listings , however, are many times larger than the listings , may include graphical content, and appear more prominent when displayed to the user. Such listings can contain the same content as a web page listing, or other content, such as advertisements, pictures, editorials and the like.","This other content may be displayed to a particular user based upon key-words, user profile type (nationality, age, gender, occupation, and so forth) and the time of the day, for example.","In many instances, this content that is displayed along with web page listings is inserted into the display area using mechanisms that are different from the searching system described previously with respect to conventional search engines. The mechanism by which this content is displayed in large measure based upon some other criteria, such as payment for the space that is used. While the system for selecting this content works, it is difficult to keep track of which content was displayed when, especially if that content is frequently changed. Thus, another aspect of the present invention, which will now be discussed, is a system for tracking changing content, and allowing for content providers to dynamically select when their content will be displayed.","This dynamic selectable content, as illustrated in , may be displayed to the viewer based upon keyword or profile type as entered by the viewer in step  as shown. Within the content selector step  that then follows, the time of the day is considered and used in selecting the appropriate content  as illustrated in  along with the web page listings . Each content  transmitted with the search results made up of web page listings  is tagged in step . Thus, if a user in step  selects that content , the results of that selection is fed back to the content selector  so that the content database associated therewith, can be updated as surfer trace data in a manner such as has been previously described. Thereafter, in step , that content  is displayed, typically simultaneously with content ","In addition to the surfer trace data being input as has been previously described, this content embodiment also provides for the web page developer, or content provider, to determine the frequency with which this content will be reviewed, and, depending upon the patterns of users with respect to web page listings that are viewed, alter the manner in which the content provider's content  is displayed based upon key words, user profile and the like. In order to implement this dynamic content flexibility, there are three additional data tables, illustrated in , which are used to track the changing content . These tables are keyword content data table , personal profile content data table ; and content provider data table .","Keyword content data table  is illustrated in more detail in Table 12 below, and its characteristics are:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0246","num":"0302"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00028","num":"00028"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 12"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Keyword content data sets"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Amount of",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Cumulative","Content","Content","Content"]},{"entry":[{},"hits for one","sent out","Provider 1","Provider 2","Total"]},{"entry":["Keyword","month (H)","(N)","(A1)","(A2)","(T)","(P)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Books",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":"Fish"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"This Table can also include the maximum content value M that the content provider is prepared to give.

In addition there could be different content values for different time periods in each country or area.","It is possible that provider's of content  could target both the key-word and the audience by identifying each of the keywords with target audiences, e.g. the number of hits associated with the word rugby could be broken down into the different profile type s that search for the word rugby.

Each time a content provider's content  is sent out this event is also recorded in the content provider's details Table . This will also record the number of click-throughs (,,,,) and the cost, in terms of payment or votes, of the content . This will form the basis of the electronic bill or tabulation that is thereafter forwarded to the content provider.","How the Data Sets are Used to Select Content Sent out to Users","In the discussion that follows, with reference to , it is assumed that only one banner of content  is transmitted with each set of web page search results . The same algorithms apply if there are multiple sets of content transmitted with each set of web page results.","A keyword and profile type are submitted to the search engine in step . From keyword content data table , personal profile content data table , the value of content  for each is found from the value of P in the Tables. The highest value of P for the keyword or profile type, determined in step , determines the type of content (keyword or profile type) that is transmitted along with the web page listings . It may be that there is no specific value for the keyword and the user may not be using a specific profile type. In this case the values for unassigned content items will be used (from Table 13 for users without a profile). Choosing which specific content item  is sent out is discussed below. The details for the content item (their graphics, text, associated programs, etc) are taken from Table 14, content provider details table  and transmitted to the user in step . Details of the content items  transmitted for each content provider are also sent to the content provider, as shown by step , at regular intervals.","Determining Whether it is Keyword or Profile Content that is Transmitted","The type of content  transmitted is dependent upon whether it is a key word based content or profile option based content. For example a Male from the US may search for fish. The value applicable to this search is, keyword=fish, profile=male, profile=US, profile=US, male. When deciding which content gets displayed, the system compares the value of the content for all the possibilities (keyword, combinations of profile types) and sends out the content that has the most value, as determined in step . For example an under 21 male may search using the key-word \u201cRugby\u201d and the value for the associated content for Rugby is 0.1 per view, whereas the value per view for targeting an under 21 male is 0.2 and thus the content targeted at the male under 21 would be displayed rather than the rugby content. It is important to note that the cumulative frequency of times that content items  are transmitted (N) will be different to the total cumulative frequency for the targeted area (H). In this example the cumulative frequency (H) of the number of times \u2018rugby\u2019 is searched for and \u2018males under 21\u2019 would both incremented by one (via Table 1). However, the number of times an item of content  is displayed would be incremented only for the \u2018male under 21\u2019 Table (this is the figure used to determine the value of the content per unit view.","Determining which Specific Content is Transmitted","The example below shows how content associated with the keyword is selected.

The advertiser can also be told the number of views per month they are likely to get for their bid (N*(A\/T)). These changes are calculated in real-time to give the new content provider an indication of how their bid will influence the value and the views they will receive for their bid. If a value and number of views are agreeable to the advertiser they can choose to submit it as a bid for the defined period, such as a day, week, or month, for instance. The details of other content providers are, preferably, not made public. Content providers may also enter a maximum value M they can part with for their content. This provides content providers with some security against paying too much if the value changes. If the value goes too high then a content provider's bid can drop off the list (if P is greater than M then A is not counted as a bid for that particular content provider). The bid would go back on the list if the value went down again, thus acting as a stabilizing mechanism. The content provider can, in a preferred embodiment, be notified by e-mail if their content  has dropped off the list due to their value limit M.","As shown by the content provider details table  of , for instance, content providers thus have an account with the search engine proprietors and procedures for debiting their account for their content is automatically calculated from the account details on a periodic basis. An electronic statement of the number of views, cost per view, number of click-throughs and cost per click-through for each content provider is also forwarded to each content provider, since this information is also stored in content provider details table  (Table 14). In a preferred embodiment, it is possible to identify clusters of similar keywords based on the keyword link table. The reason for identifying clusters of keywords is so that content  can be targeted at groups of words rather than just individual words. The cluster for the key-word \u201ccar\u201d may include hundreds or thousands of words that have links to the word car (e.g. convertibles, automobiles, vans). Statistical clustering techniques are used to define the size and frequency of key-word clusters. This makes it a much more automatic process than an editor deciding on clusters of keywords for content provider's to target.","The same system can be used to set values for keyword clusters. While grouping words in this way would incur an increased administration cost, it is nevertheless computationally similar and only initiated once a certain level of hits on a keyword had been exceeded.","Content only search Users can also purposely choose to search only the content provider associated with a keyword. In this case the search results will be based on the values of A in Table 12. The content providers that pay the most will be at the top of the list.","The key-word suggester can also help content providers choose key-words or sets of key-words that they would like to display.","Controlling the Search Engine System","There are a number of parameters that can change the way in which the search engine according to the present invention ranks web pages. These factors (described in detail below) are:\n\n","This determines the rate of decay of the existing popular lists (popular hit list) as described in the text previously. This is a number between 1 and 0. A high history factor will make it difficult to change the existing popularity lists. As an example if the rate of searching for a particular keyword is increasing quickly, then the history factor should be lower to enable emerging web pages to rise up the popularity list.\n\n","This is a measure of the frequency with which the popularity lists are updated with information about the users' activities (i.e. the surfer trace), for example, this may be measured once a day or even once a month depending on the rate of change of popularity of particular keyword searches.\n\n","This is the frequency of sampling the information of how users are searching. If it is a common keyword it is not necessary to monitor every search. It may be that only a percentage of all searches need be monitored to accurately determine web-page popularity.\n\n","The mix of web pages presented to the user as a default can be changed if necessary to reflect the way in which search results evolve over time.\n\n","The \u201ccontent hit factor\u201d is a measure of the weighting given to a hit on content being recorded as a hit for a keyword. The default setting is that a hit on content counts the same as a hit from the list of web pages. The value of content hits can be set higher or lower than unity, depending on the price of the content, e.g. the \u201ccontent hit factor\u201d may need to be increased for valuable keywords as this would decrease the ability to spam these commercially valuable keywords. The higher the content factor, the higher the resistance to spam as the search results would be more dependent on price rather than popularity.\n\n","Content providers bid a certain amount for a particular time period e.g. one month. This time period may be different depending on the rate-of-change of the price. If the price is changing rapidly or is very stable, the time period may be respectively shortened or lengthened correspondingly.\n\n","This number could be changed to influence how the system learns from new web pages submissions.\n\n","If the date of submission for a web-page is too close to the existing submission for that web-page, then it is not accepted. This length of time can be changed depending on any of the above factors\n\n","This number can be changed to reduce the possibility of spamming\n\n","The security Table that restricts abuse, notes the links between keywords and IP addresses of user identifications. The length of time between refreshing this Table can be changed to make it harder to spam the system.","The settings for these factors can be different for different keywords or groups of people depending on:\n\n","The precise setting of each of these factors will not be known until the system begins operation \u2018learning\u2019 about the users behaviors. The optimum settings for different situations may be determined by experimentation.","Other Applications","Though the preferred embodiment has been described with reference to a software useable on a computer network for searching the Internet, it will be appreciated that the invention may be readily applied to any search system where a human user chooses results from a set of initial search results. Such a system may for example be part of an, a LAN or WAN or even a database on an individual PC.","Examples of other possible areas of application for the present invention are described below.","Intranet Searches and other Data Base Searches","Intranet searches at present suffer from similar drawbacks from Internet searches, indeed some intranets can in themselves be extremely substantial systems, in which identifying a particular information source or item can be equally problematic. Utilizing the present invention in such applications is within the intended scope of the present invention.","Searching Other Media Forms","The present invention is also intended to be applied matching a user's profile to other media sources (such as pay per-view, television, videos, music and the like), thus allowing content targeted to a particular audience. The same form of search lists as described above (Popular-list, High-flyers, Hot-off the press, etc) may be employed to direct users to appropriate material.","Shopping","The search techniques described herein can be implemented in a consumer network to assist shoppers in selecting items from within one shop or among a large number of shops. Instead of using a keyword-URL link Table, there would be used a keyword-item purchased link Table, that then records what items were purchased after each shopping request (key-word). This embodiment also records where the user purchased the product. Each time a shopper purchased an item this would increment the popularity of that item, using the same techniques described previously.","The profile type s in this embodiment can be used to record the types of purchases made by different sets of people. One could, for example, select a profile type and see what are the most commonly purchased items for a range of users, and would provide assistance in choosing gifts for people who have a different profile type than yourself.","Scientific Publications","Searching scientific data bases (on-line papers, journals, etc.) with the present invention will dramatically reduce the time spent examining obscure, or esoteric areas only to find the information irrelevant. The criteria for a valid hit for such uses would typically incorporate the extended time feature described above to establish the usefulness of the information source. The refereeing and referencing of academic\/scientific papers using the present invention could enhanced by classifying different levels or types of user, e.g. Dr, Professor etc. postgraduate, and so forth. This will enable users to see. for example, what information sources the eminent authorities in a particular field found of interest. It would also allows the authors of a paper to become aware of how often their publication was accessed and possibly further indicate where and how often the paper was used as a reference in subsequent papers. Users may have to formally register with different organizations to obtain levels of ability to referee. Users may also choose the level of refereeing for their searching.","Online Help","There is currently a substantial global requirement for on-line help and support, particularly for computer\/software applications. Such a need would be considerably assuaged by use of the present invention as the software developers obtain a direct feedback to the type and frequency of particular inquiries, whilst the users receive the accumulated benefit of the previous users. Different profile type s would enable the answers to be provided in an appropriate form for the user, e.g. novice, expert, etc. The keyword suggester may, for example, suggest searching with key-words (questions) more likely to yield a satisfactory response. There can be a range of answers to each question and as the system learns it will converge on to the best answers.","Question and Answer Services","Current On-line question\/answer programs could be configured to run via the present invention, thus enabling answers to repeatedly asked questions to be based on previous questions and similar questions to be suggested.","Content Optimization on Other Parts of the Internet","The same content bidding mechanism could be used to determine the price of content for any location on the Internet, not just web page listings as identified above. In this embodiment, content providers will bid for a general content space to set the price automatically.","The profile type information from the search engine could be used as a passport so that other advertisements on the Internet could be more targeted to different audiences. This profile type information could also be used by web-page developers to customize their web-page for different sets of users.","People Matching Service","In another embodiment, the system according to the present invention can be used as a dating service and\/or a method for matching people with similar preferences by doing a statistical analysis to compare the individual preferences (Table 6) of groups of users. The individual past preference Tables, in this embodiment, would preferably be normalized and compared to each other using a standard correlation coefficient. When compared to other users it would give a numerical indication of how similar their preferences are.","The same embodiment could also be used to find information about similar people from there past preferences Tables. For example one could ask to be give the names of people in New Zealand with an interest in Ecological Economics and a search could be made of the personal preferences Tables. Such an embodiment, however, would typically include a password\/consent indicator that provides consent of identified persons to give out their information, which consent could be given, for example, in only certain circumstances, which circumstances are limited to searchers who have a level of authority and password indicating the same, or for persons who identify themselves with certain characteristics.","While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment. For example, each of the features described above can be use singly or in combination, as set forth below in the claims, without other features described above which are patentably significant by themselves. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other advantages of the present invention may be appreciated from studying the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment together with the drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 25"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
