title: Aerial bogey discrimination technique
abstract: A computer-implemented analysis method is provided for identifying a flight trajectory of a bogey relative to earth's surface. The method includes a first step of obtaining first and second altitudes and velocities of the bogey separated by a first time interval. The second step calculates a first difference between the first and second velocities divided by the first time interval to obtain an acceleration vector. The third step determines the direction of the velocity vector. The fourth step determines whether direction of the second velocity vector exceeds an upward pointing threshold. The fifth step determines whether the acceleration vector is negative and substantially perpendicular to earth's surface as a second result being valid. The sixth step reports that the bogey represents a ballistic projectile in response to the first and second results.

In particular, the invention relates to techniques to distinguish between ballistic and flat trajectory airborne vehicles and categorize accordingly for appropriate interception response.","An unidentified aerial object or \u201cbogey\u201d represents a prospective threat to a defended asset. To intercept the threat as a target, the defender must categorize ballistic trajectories on the basis of intermittent observation of an object's trajectory. This has represented a difficult problem by conventional analysis techniques using observably available data.","Conventional techniques for categorizing intermittently observed object trajectories yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an indication of apparent acceleration direction with respect to an object's local horizontal plane associated with the intermittently observed object trajectory.","Various exemplary embodiments provide a computer-implemented analysis method to identify a flight trajectory of a bogey relative to earth's surface. The method includes a first step of obtaining first and second altitudes and velocities of the bogey separated by a first time interval. The second step calculates a first difference between the first and second velocities divided by the first time interval to obtain an acceleration vector. The third step determines the direction of the velocity vector.","The fourth step determines whether direction of the second velocity vector exceeds an upward pointing threshold. The fifth step determines whether the acceleration vector is negative and substantially perpendicular to earth's surface as a second result being valid. The sixth step reports that the bogey represents a ballistic projectile in response to the first and second results. Various additional embodiments provide transformations to aid in processing the vector information.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the components, process steps, and\/or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and\/or general purpose machines.","In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or a floating point gate array (FPGA) or other related component.","Conventional techniques for bogey identification rely on additional information beyond observations of the object's trajectory. Conventional techniques include independent indicators that the object's trajectory is accelerating or that the object's altitude is above earth's surface. Such techniques potentially assume that the object's behavior is associated with the object's position. This condition is not always valid, which can lead to interception failure. The instant disclosure describes a technique for categorizing ballistic tracks based on a sequence of system reports of a target's velocity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","140","145","150","155","160"],"smallcaps":["OOST","SCENT","ESCENT"]},"For the notional diagram view , the A\u2014and Dphases correspond to ballistic motion phases of the trajectory. Observed velocity and acceleration vector quantities have distinct characteristics during each phase:","B\u2014During boost mode  until burnout , acceleration points up, close to the direction of the velocity, which may approach vertical in the upward direction.","A\u2014During coast  (after boost) and through apogee , acceleration points down, while velocity gradually changes from up to horizontal.","D\u2014During descent , both quantities point down, with velocity changing from horizontal to potentially near vertical down.","In the diagram view , lower arrows  on the V-line indicate the velocity direction, while upper arrows  on the A-line indicate the acceleration direction. For aircraft trajectories having constant velocity, the acceleration is substantially zero (for all directions, in comparison to a ballistic missile). These considerations enable development of a procedure to distinguish between ballistic and non-ballistic type trajectories.","The following information describes an algorithmic process for calculating the velocity and acceleration directions of a bogey, referred to herein as a \u201ctarget\u201d generally. The process starts with an observed (or calculated) velocity data stream. The process then tests those values to determine transition from Bphase to Aintervals for purpose of categorizing the velocity data stream as representative of a ballistic-type trajectory. The analysis assumes that input velocity stream is or can be represented in the coordinate system horizontal to the earth surface at the target's position.","An observed target's velocity components can be transformed from the observed position and velocity coordinates to the target's coordinate system using supplementary formulae described subsequently. Within the target's frame, both the Flight Path Angle (FPA) and the Acceleration Path Angle (APA) formulae indicated herein may be applied to the transformed velocity coordinates.","The relative processes considered are described herein.

The examples include a bottle rocket and a balsa-wood toy airplane. The high-performance bottle rocket produces thrust against the force of gravity, causing the rocket to move upwards. During this Bphase , both gravity and thrust forces affect the rocket's motion. After exhaustion of its propellant at cutoff , the rocket continues upward until the gravity overcomes its inertia so as to reduce vertical ascent speed. This is labeled as the BAphase , during which gravity gradually overcomes the upward velocity until the rocket reaches its maximum height on an inverted parabolic trajectory. Upon the rocket reaching its peak at apogee , it begins to descend in the mode labeled as BD.","As a simplified numerical example, a massless bottle rocket exerting thrust to accelerate at 20 m\/s(meters-per-second-squared), with an acceleration angle of 75\u00b0 from horizontal, and subject to 9.8 m\/sgravity, achieves a velocity vector (x, y, z) of",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0043"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2003","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"46.6"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"85.7"}}]}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0044"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2003","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"51.8"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"95.2"}}]}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0045"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2003","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"5.2"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}}]}},"mo":","}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","230","240","200"]},"For example, the rocket's boost mode  has initially zero velocity vectors, whereas these vectors are non-zero for end-of-boost , ascent  and descent .

In addition, the airplane  exhibits constant velocity and no change in altitude, so that the airplane's FPA remains zero and its APA is indefinite.","The exemplary discriminator has the advantage of being applicable on the basis of a target velocity data stream. Additional target position data and knowledge of earth radius may be incorporated to support conversion of observed target data to local target coordinate system.","Conventional interpretation assumes that acceleration components derive from measured velocity values.
