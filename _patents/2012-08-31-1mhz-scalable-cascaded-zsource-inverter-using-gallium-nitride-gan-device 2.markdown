The Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to an inverter, more specifically, a scalable cascaded Z-source inverter.","Department Of Energy requests $2.4 billion for renewable energy, efficiency in fiscal year 2011. The proposed budget boosts renewable energy sources and storages application and development, such as wind power, solar power, batteries, and fuel cells and so on. There is the widespread growth of distributed energy systems using these renewable energy sources and storages. More and more attention is paid to the high power density, high power efficiency, high power quality and high system reliability of the distributed energy systems.","The main reason that prevents the grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems from realizing its full market potential is the power losses due to the module mismatch, orientation mismatch, partial shading, and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) inefficiencies. The traditional cascaded dc-dc converter topology shown in  can interface distributed PV modules and achieve MPPT for each PV module, therefore reduces the power loss. However, the configuration has dc-dc and dc-ac conversion stages, which decrease the overall system efficiency. Moreover, the switching frequency of dc-ac inverter is limited leading to the big size AC filter and large electrolyte capacitors, which restricts the system power quality and power density. Cascaded multilevel inverter topology such as H-bridge inverter, shown in , can interface distributed PV modules, achieve MPPT for each PV module and single stage energy conversion, support a higher equivalent pulse width modulation (PWM) frequency and a larger DC bus voltage. Nevertheless, the H-bridge inverter lacks boost function so that the inverter kVA requirement has to be increased twice with a PV voltage range of 1:2, which restricts the system power density. In addition, both configurations are not able to be immune to shoot-through faults. Therefore, the modular system meets a daunting challenge.","The present invention provides a scalable cascaded Z-source inverter configuration for dc-ac power conversion that can integrate distributed renewable energy sources and storages with wide voltage ranges. One embodiment of the invention in PV application is shown in . Single energy conversion and boost function can be achieved simultaneously. Independent MPPT for each Z-source inverter module can implement an efficient PV energy conversion. In another embodiment of the invention, the commercial low voltage GaN device is be used to facilitate modular structure due to its ultra-high frequency, small size AC filter and DC electrolyte capacitor, which reduces losses significantly and achieves high power efficiency.","The present invention is immune to shoot-through faults especially operating at high switching frequency and enhance the system reliability. A comprehensive Z-source network design is developed based on an innovative equivalent AC circuit model for the single phase PV system. Flexible and reliable control system integrated is developed to improve the PV energy harvesting capability. In particular, the invention is suitable for hybrid renewable energy sources and storages application in wide system operation range. High power density, high power efficiency, high power quality and high system reliability can be achieved.","In the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","In one embodiment, the scalable cascaded Z-source inverter module can be applied for the 1 kW\/120V single phase grid-connected PV system with 1 MHz frequency output, shown in . The 100V\/25 A\/7 m\u03a9 GaN transistors recently introduced to the market by EPC Corporation are used in each Z-source inverter module (ZSIM). Each ZSIM is a standardized open-frame power module with 250 W. The input voltage of the PV module at maximum output power varies between 30V and 60V based on different PV manufactures. In order to generate 1 MHz operation frequency at output terminals, the switching frequency of each ZSIM is 125 kHz due to phase-shift PWM modulation method. The PV system facilitates to expand capacity to by series and paralleled inverter module.

The peak to peak value of the DFF power is twice DC power, which is PV power. From the energy conservation point of view, the DFF power should be absorbed by the input capacitor and Z-source capacitors, which causes DFF voltage ripple. Since the Z-source capacitor voltage Vis much greater than input capacitor voltage V, Z-source capacitors should be used to deal with the DFF power. Otherwise, the total capacitance will increase resulting in low power density. In addition, input capacitor with big capacitance will cause the phase-shift between Vand Vdue to the equivalent LC filter on DC side, which will increase the burden of total capacitors to handle the DFF power. Therefore, the input capacitor is used for handling most high frequency voltage ripple. The maximum high frequency voltage ripple occurs during shoot-through period and PV module only delivers power to input capacitor.

In order to achieve good voltage performance and maximum power point track (MPPT), \u0394Vis limited with 1%.  shows the relationship among C, Cand \u0394V. It can be seen that Z-source capacitors can handle the DFF voltage ripple better than input capacitor.","There are four 100V GaN devices in each ZSIM. The power loss of each 250 W module is calculated around 10 watts so the maximum efficiency is around 96% at about half of rated output power when the input diode is used.  shows the power loss distribution of the switching and conduction loss of GaN devices, input diode loss, the inductors and capacitors loss on Z-source network, and the input capacitor loss. Since the proposed topology allows each module to switch at only a fraction of the 1 MHz system frequency, distribution of power losses to a larger number of power devices leading to high efficiency at 1 MHz and air cooling becomes achievable. This architecture is particularly suitable for PV system where distributed PV arrays can be monitored, controlled, maintained, or replaced if necessary. If synchronous rectifier (SR) replaces the input diode to be in series with PV module, the efficiency of each Z-source inverter module is increased from 96% to 98.5%, shown in .","Another embodiment of the present invention is the control system, as shown in . Each ZSIM receives the voltage and current sensed from each PV module and sent to the MPPT control block. The MPPT control is used to generate the output voltage reference of the PV module. MPPT control can be achieved by different methods, such as perturb and observe (P&O), incremental conductance (INC), ripple correlation control (RCC), etc. Therefore the output voltage of each PV module can be controlled accordingly to follow its own maximum power point (MPP). The PV module voltage control block generates a boost strip line o fabricate the PWM signal with boost function for each inverter module by shoot-through state. The controls of each ZSIM are independent so the MPPT of each module can be achieved even when PV modules receive different solar irradiation levels. The control system also includes the capacitor voltage control of each Z-source network and independent reactive power control. The Z-source capacitor voltage of each module is controlled to track the same reference by PI control with feedforwards so that the desired AC output voltage can be obtained. The output of capacitor voltage control contributes to the d-axis components of grid current. The reactive power control with PI controller is related to the q-axis components of grid current. Therefore, the desired gird current reference can be synthesized in the system control highlighted in dashed box in . In order to achieve the direct control of grid current, a proportional resonant (PR) is adopted to achieve the zero error. The output of the current control is added to the grid voltage feedforwards to generate the total inverter output voltage. However, considering the possible different real power and desired equal reactive power from each module, a real and reactive components extraction mechanism is developed to extract real and reactive power from each module. Due to the same AC current flowing through each module, the voltage distribution decides the power distribution. Therefore, the modulation index of each module can be generated based on the developed real and reactive components of output voltage. As a result, the objective voltage modulation of each inverter module is sent to PWM generation block, which will cooperate with the above boost strip line to generate the final PWM signal. If the number of inverter modules changes, the whole control remains the same except the minimum modification on \u201cGrid current reference synthesis\u201d and \u201cVoltage modulation distribution\u201d blocks. The control strategy provides a flexible and reliable operation to improve the system efficiency especially when PV modules operate under different solar irradiation levels. The same voltage on the dc-link after the Z-source network of each module can be guaranteed by the appropriate control to reduce the risk of low-frequency harmonic voltage on the total ac inverter output voltage spectrum.","The control system in the present invention may be extended to different cascaded PV inverter, such as traditional cascaded PV inverter without dc-dc converter, cascaded PV inverter with dc-dc converter. It is also flexible to be expanded to three phase cascaded inverter system.","The performance of the PV system with four cascaded ZSIM is verified in Matlab\/Simulink+PSIM simulation platform.  show the simulation results when the designed Z-source network and developed control method were implemented on the PV system. As shown in , the temperature is 25\u00b0 C. and solar irradiation is 1000 W\/mfor four PV modules before 0.5 s. At 0.5 s, the solar irradiation over first three PV models (PV, PV, and PV) decreases to 700 W\/m, 800 W\/mand 900 W\/mrespectively. The solar irradiation over fourth PV model (PV) keeps to 1000 W\/m. It is observed that the powers from PV (P), PV (P), and PV (P) can be controlled to track their MMP smoothly and fast from 250 W to 165 W (P), 190 W (P), and 220 W (P) at 0.5 s in (a-c), respectively. And the power from PV (P) always tracks the MPP of 250 W (P) regardless of the other PV power changes in (d).  shows the input real power from four PV modules (P) and the power to grid (P). At 0.5 s, the Pchanges from 1000 kW to 825 W and Pdecreases from 985 W to 815 W. In the simulation, only conduction loss of each GaN device and the loss on AC line impedance are considered. The total output voltage of the cascaded inverter (V) and grid current (i) are shown in . Due to the small modulation index, there is only seven-level output voltage, not nine-level. The reactive power to grid is controlled to be zero. The grid current is almost in phase with the inverter output voltage if the reactive power on AC output filter is negligible.  show that the good performance and power quality of the PV system.  shows the V, V, and Vof the first ZSIM. It can be seen that the Vcan be controlled to 60V during non-shoot-through period regardless of solar irradiation variation.  shows \u0394V, \u0394Vand the high frequency current ripple through inductor (i) under different solar irradiation conditions for the first ZSIM. The current ripple is less than 40%, as well \u0394Vand \u0394Vare less than 1%. The frequency of current ripple is 250 kHz due to phase-shift PWM method.","The integration of PV system and control system is shown in . The control system is a central control system. It collects voltage and current of each PV module, and capacitor voltage of each Z-source PV inverter module, grid voltage and grid current. With the appropriate control, it generates the objective PWM signal to each PV inverter module. The PWM signal can be transmitted by fiber-optical cable to improve the system reliability. One distributed control system can be also achieved by the control objective change.","It will be seen that the advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained.
