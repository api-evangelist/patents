{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to electrical feedthroughs, and more particularly but without limitation to electrical feedthroughs for implantable medical devices (IMD's).","Electrical feedthroughs provide an electrical circuit path extending through a sealed container, such as a housing of an implantable medical device (IMD). Electrical feedthroughs include a conductive feedthrough pin that is electrically insulated from the container. In some examples, a feedthrough includes a ferrule and an insulator such as a hermetic glass or ceramic seal that supports the feedthrough pin within the ferrule.","Electrical feedthroughs for IMDs may be used in electrical medical devices such as electrical stimulators including neurostimulators and cardiac stimulators. Such electrical medical devices can be susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). At certain frequencies, for example, EMI can inhibit stimulation signals from an electrical stimulator, such as pacing signals. For this reason, electrical feedthroughs may include a capacitor to shunt high frequency EMI from the feedthrough pin. In some examples, a capacitor is included within the ferrule such that the capacitor electrically contacts the feedthrough pin and the ferrule to shunt high frequency EMI away from the feedthrough pin.","In operation, a feedthrough capacitor permits passage of relatively low frequency electrical signals along the feedthrough pin, while shunting and shielding undesired high frequency interference signals to the ferrule, which may be physically and electrically coupled to a conductive housing of the device. Shunting high frequency interference signals away from the feedthrough pin mitigates the effects of EMI on a device by filtering high frequency signals from the feedthrough pin before the signals enter the interior of the device. This can limit adverse effects of EMI on the operations of an IMD, such as sensing, neurostimulation and\/or cardiac stimulation therapy.","This disclosure includes a variety of techniques that facilitate compact connector assemblies for IMDs. As one example, a connector assembly may include a plurality of feedthrough pins mounted in a staggered arrangement within an array plate of connector assembly.","In another example, each of the feedthrough pins may be electrically and mechanically bonded at an angle of less than 135 degrees to conductive strips of an electronics module assembly. In addition, the conductive strips of the electronics module assembly may be electrically and mechanically bonded at an angle of less than 135 degrees to conductors of a flexible circuit. The arrangement of the feedthrough pins, electronics module assembly and the flexible circuit may limit bending of conductors in the flexible circuit. By limiting bending of conductors in the flexible circuit, the connector assembly may not require the space otherwise necessary to provide a minimum bending radius of the flexible circuit.","In addition, a connector assembly may also include capacitors with a parallelogram-shaped profile. The capacitor may be mounted within a recess of an array plate of the connector assembly below the electronics module assembly and serves as a filter for multiple feedthrough pins.","In one example, this disclosure is directed to a connector assembly for an implantable medical device. The connector assembly comprises a plurality of feedthroughs mounted in a conductive array plate, each feedthrough in the plurality of feedthroughs including a feedthrough pin electrically isolated from the conductive array plate by an insulator. The connector assembly further comprises an electronic module assembly including a plurality of conductive strips set in a non-conductive block, wherein each of the plurality of conductive strips is in physical and electrical contact with a corresponding one of the feedthrough pins of the plurality of feedthroughs at a first set of electrical joints. The plurality of conductive strips is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the feedthrough pins at the first set of electrical joints. The connector assembly further comprises at least one circuit, the circuit including a plurality of conductors corresponding to the plurality of feedthroughs. Each of the plurality of conductors of the circuit is in physical and electrical contact with a corresponding one of the conductive strips of the plurality of conductive strips of the electronic module assembly at a second set of electrical joints. The plurality of conductors is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the plurality of conductive strips at the second set of electrical joints.","In another example, this disclosure is directed to an implantable medical device comprising a substantially sealed housing encasing control electronics, and a connector assembly that extends through the substantially sealed housing and provides electrical connections between the control electronics and a component of the implantable medical device located exterior to the substantially sealed housin. The connector assembly comprises a plurality of feedthroughs mounted in a conductive array plate, each feedthrough in the plurality of feedthroughs including a feedthrough pin electrically isolated from the conductive array plate by an insulator. The connector assembly further comprises an electronic module assembly including a plurality of conductive strips set in a non-conductive block, wherein each of the plurality of conductive strips is in physical and electrical contact with a corresponding one of the feedthrough pins of the plurality of feedthroughs at a first set of electrical joints. The plurality of conductive strips is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the feedthrough pins at the first set of electrical joints.

The plurality of conductors is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the plurality of conductive strips at the second set of electrical joints.","In a different example, this disclosure is directed to a method of manufacturing a connector assembly for an implantable medical device. The method comprises positioning a plurality of feedthroughs within the apertures of an array plate, wherein each feedthrough in the plurality of feedthroughs includes an electrically conductive ferrule, an insulator located within the ferrule, and a feedthrough pin extending through the insulator such that it is electrically isolated from the ferrule by the insulator. The method further comprises electrically connecting and mechanically securing the ferrules of the feedthroughs to the array plate and positioning a capacitor including a set of apertures corresponding to more than one of the feedthrough pins over the feedthrough pins and into the recess of the array plate. The method further comprises electrically connecting and mechanically securing the capacitor to the array plate and to the more than one of the feedthrough pins such that the capacitor functions as a filter for the feedthrough pins in electrical contact with the capacitor, positioning an electronic module assembly including a set of conductive strips corresponding to more than one of the feedthrough pins over the feedthrough pins such that the capacitor is positioned between the electronic module assembly and the array plate, and electrically connecting and mechanically securing each of the feedthrough pins to the corresponding conductive strip in the electronic module assembly to form a first set of electrical joints. The plurality of conductive strips is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the feedthrough pins after forming the first set of electrical joints. The method further comprises positioning at least one circuit, the circuit including a plurality of conductors corresponding to the plurality of feedthroughs, adjacent to a corresponding one of the conductive strips of the plurality of conductive strips of the electronic module assembly, and electrically connecting and mechanically securing each of the plurality of conductors of the circuit to the corresponding one of the conductive strips of the plurality of conductive strips of the electronic module assembly to form a second set of electrical joints. The plurality of conductors is at an angle of less than 135 degrees relative to the plurality of conductive strips after forming the second set of electrical joints","The details of one or more examples of this disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","100","20","20","20"]},"IMD  includes electrical components to facilitate the medical therapy and\/or sensing functions. For example, the electrical components may include one or more of a processor, stimulation generator, switch matrix, telemetry circuitry, memory, power supply, such as one or more rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries and\/or capacitors, and other components.","IMD  includes a substantially sealed housing . Substantially sealed housing  includes a case formed from a biocompatible material, and may be formed from a conductive material including titanium or stainless steel. Connector assembly  provides electrical connections between the components within the substantially sealed housing, such as power device  and controller assembly , and the components outside the substantially sealed housing, including connector body  and antenna . Power device , may include one or more batteries and\/or capacitors. Connector body  and antenna  are located outside the substantially sealer housing.","Controller assembly  may include a circuit board having a processor, memory, transmitter, receiver, and\/or other appropriate portions. Connector body  may extend from or be integrated with the case of substantially sealed housing . Connector body  includes ports  that interconnect with one or more connector terminals of one or more medical lead assemblies (not shown). In different examples, connector body  may include IS-1 connectors, IS-4 connectors or other suitable connectors. Each medical lead assembly includes one more conductors running the length of the medical lead assembly and sensing and\/or stimulation electrodes that electrically connect to the connector terminals via the conductors. Connector body  further includes setscrews , which serve to secure the connector terminals of the medical lead assemblies within ports .","Antenna  is in electrical communication with an unfiltered feedthrough pin. Antenna  facilitates telemetry between IMD  and an external device such as a clinician programmer or a patient programmer when IMD  is implanted within a patient. For example, IMD  sends or receives therapy programs, therapy\/or sensing history or other information via antenna .","Connector body  and antenna  are electrically connected to components within substantially sealed housing  via connector assembly . For example, feedthrough pins of connector assembly  may be spot-welded to a ball seal stack within connector body . As described in further detail with respect to , connector assembly  includes a variety of features that facilitate a relatively high-density arrangement of electrically conductive paths through substantially sealed housing . As one example, connector assembly  includes a plurality of unipolar feedthroughs mounted in a staggered arrangement within an array plate of connector assembly . Unipolar feedthroughs include a single feedthrough pin supported within a ferrule by an insulator. Each of the feedthrough pins of the unipolar feedthroughs are electrically and mechanically connected at an angle of less than 135 degrees to conductive strips of an electronics module assembly. In addition, the conductive strips of the electronics module assembly are electrically and mechanically connected at an angle of less than 135 degrees to conductors of a flexible circuit.","The arrangement of the feedthrough pins, electronics module assembly and the flexible circuit limits bending of conductors in the flexible circuit between the electronics module assembly and components within housing , such as controller assembly , which can limit bending of conductors in the flexible circuit. For example, by limiting bending of conductors in the flexible circuit, the connector assembly does not require the space necessary to provide a minimum bending radius of the flexible circuit. A minimum bending radius of the flexible circuit may correspond to a bending radius which may adversely affect the integrity of conductors within the flexible circuit, e.g., due to fatigue loading.","In other examples, connector assembly  may connect to a circuit mounted on a relatively rigid substrate. Connector assembly  may facilitate using a circuit mounted on relatively rigid substrate because the design of connector assembly  does not require the circuit itself to bend within the IMD housing.","In addition, connector assembly  also includes two capacitors with parallelogram-shaped profiles. Each capacitor is mounted within a recess of the array plate of connector assembly  below the electronics module assembly and serves as a filter for multiple feedthrough pins, e.g., to mitigate electromagnetic interference. The shape of the capacitors allows the capacitors to be mounted in only one orientation within the recess of the array plate, i.e., \u201ckeyed,\u201d which precludes mounting the capacitors upside-down during the assembly of connector assembly , and which may simplify the manufacturing process and reduce mistakes during manufacturing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIGS. 7A-7C","FIG. 8","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","130","100","120","110","120","140","112","110","120","112","140","113","120","120","110","113","140","100","8","8"]},"As shown in , conductive array plate  includes recess  to receive feedthroughs , , ground pin  and capacitors .

In addition, apertures  are arranged in substantially straight and substantially parallel rows , . Apertures  are staggered within rows , . As one example, apertures  may be equally staggered such that an aperture  within row  is equidistant to the two closest apertures  within row . The staggered arrangement of apertures  within rows ,  reduces the distance between rows ,  necessary to prevent arcing between the feedthrough pins. Depending on the voltage between adjacent feedthrough pins , feedthrough pins  may need to be spaced a minimum of 55 mils (0.055 inches) from each other to prevent arcing between the feedthrough pins. By staggering feedthrough pins  in row  relative to feedthrough pins  in row , row  can be closer than 55 mils (0.055 inches) to row . This allows connector assembly  to be thinner than if feedthrough pins  in row  were aligned with feedthrough pins  in row .","When feedthrough  is mounted on an IMD, such as IMD  (), outer surface  of feedthrough  is external to the internal environment of substantially sealed housing , whereas inner surface  is located within the internal environment of substantially sealed housing . Outer surface  and inner surface  are indicated with respect to conductive array plate  in . The reference numerals for outer surface  and inner surface  are used throughout  to indicate portions of components located externally to the internal environment of substantially sealed housing  () and to indicate portions of components located within the internal environment of substantially sealed housing  ().","One unipolar feedthrough  is illustrated in .

Similarly, gold brazing  forms a seal, such as a hermetic seal, between insulator  and feedthrough pin . In other examples, different seals may be used between ferrule , insulator  and feedthrough pin . In some examples, insulator  may be sputtered with niobium to facilitate bonding with gold brazing  and gold brazing .","Feedthrough pin  includes a coating , which may be located on either or both of the interior side  and the external side  of feedthrough pin . Coating  may improve electrical connections between the feedthrough pin and conductive strips  of electronics module assembly  and between the feedthrough pin and conductors of connector body  (). As one example, coating  may comprise gold sputtering.","Ground pin  is illustrated in . Ground pin  is sized similarly to unipolar feedthrough  such that it is configured to fit within one of apertures  within recess  of array plate  and be located adjacent to feedthroughs , . For example, ground pin  includes notch , which is configured to register with one of apertures  in recess  of array plate . Ground pin  is formed from a biocompatible metal, such as a stainless steel or titanium alloy. As one example, ground pin  may be machined from a solid piece of metal. When mounted within one of apertures  within recess  of conductive array plate , ground pin  is grounded to housing  () via conductive array plate .

No. 2010\/0179606, titled \u201cCAPACITOR FOR FILTERED FEEDTHROUGH WITH ANNULAR MEMBER,\u201d by Iyer, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.","Capacitor  has a parallelogram-shaped profile. The profile of capacitor  allows capacitor  to be mounted in only one orientation within the recess of the array plate, which precludes mounting capacitor  upside-down during the assembly of connector assembly , which may simplify the manufacturing process and reduce mistakes during manufacturing. As one example, to provide a different profile when positioned upside-down adjacent sides of the parallelogram-shaped profile may be of unequal lengths, i.e., the parallelogram-shaped profile is not a rhombus.
