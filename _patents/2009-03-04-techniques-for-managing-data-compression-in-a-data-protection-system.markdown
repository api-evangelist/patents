Volumes , , , and may contain data stored in one or more formats or data structures. Data structures may be determined by an underlying platform or system supporting an application. Volumes , , , and may be unshared storage containing clustered data.","Computer  may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a server, a backup server, or other computer capable of managing data compression in a data protection system. Computer  may receive data from user input, a network management system, a network provisioning system, a management information base, a database, a file, a web service, and\/or an application programming interface. Computer  may query other systems and\/or local or remote storage such as network elements  and , and storage  and  to manage requests for one or more data operations, create, modify, or access data management policies, and\/or query storage information.

Multiple copies of one or more portions of data on network element  may be made and stored in one or more formats and for a plurality of purposes. For example, data may be copied, replicated, or backed up or otherwise provided to network element . Network element  may serve as a backup server. Data, such as volumes and , may be copied, replicated, or backed up to volumes and , respectively. Volumes and may be uncompressed data. In one or more embodiments, data stored on network element  may be in a backup format, such as a backup image, a snapshot, or other formats.","According to one or more embodiments, backup data from network element  may be copied, formatted, compressed, and\/or processed further as part of subsequent life cycle management changes. For example, as described above an initial backup may be made to storage on network element . Other backups, copies, archives, or data operations may be performed. Storage  may store data which is stored in a lossless, compressed format.","A framework of a data protection system may associate one or more algorithms with a file type. A data management policy may associate other attributes of data with a data management policy. For example, attributes may include data ownership, author, data type, creation date, expiration date, edit date, last access date, data size, and data purpose. Copies of data may be made for multiple purposes, including an initial backup, a backup for legal compliance (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance), for financial purposes (e.g., tax records, transactional records), and for other purposes (e.g., employee records, medical records used in a study, etc.). A data management policy may specify a compression level that may be used on one or more portions of data based at least in part on one or more attributes of data, the purpose of the data, the storage location of the data, and\/or other factors.","In one or more embodiments, computer  may be a backup server or other computing platform managing or administering a data protection system. A data operation request such as a backup request, an archive request, a replication request, a copy request, or a deletion request may be received by computer . For example, computer  may receive a backup request for data on network element . Data on network element  may be backed up initially in a uncompressed format, such as to network element .","Computer  may also receive a data operation request to backup data to nearline storage. For example, storage  may be nearline storage. The compression level of one or more portions of data in a backup image may be determined by a data management policy. As a non-limiting example, one or more portions of a backup image may be losslessly compressed and stored on storage . According to some embodiments, one or more portions may also be lossy compressed.","Computer  may further receive a data operation request to backup data to an archive site. For example, data may be backed up to tape and shipped to remote storage . This may be to comply with a disaster recovery plan of a data management policy. A backup image stored on tape may be comprised of multiple types of data. For example, a backup image may contain text files, database data, image data (e.g., jpeg files, gif files, etc.), audio data (e.g., MP3 files, Wave files, etc.), video data (e.g., MPEG files, MOV files, etc.), or application and storage specific formats. Computer  may determine a data type or file type by analyzing content, metadata, a file extension, and\/or file attributes associated with the data.","An archive request received by computer  may enable compression of data to be archived. One or more portions of data in a backup image may be lossy compressed based on a type of data and a data management policy associated with the data. For example, one or more portions of a backup image may be image files that may be lossy compressed.","A data management policy may determine not only whether one or more portions of a backup image may be compressed, but also the compression ratio that may be utilized. For example, computer  may prepare a backup image of data which may contain multi-media files such as images. Computer  may utilize a data management policy, metadata associated with the backup data, file types of the backup data, compression algorithms associated with a backup data type, or other backup data attributes in order to determine whether to compress one or more portions of data, what compression algorithm to use for one or more portions of data, what compression level to use for one or more portions of data, or other compression settings. For example, backup data may contain medical images. The data management policy may require medical images to use lossless compression for an initial backup and lossy compression for archival after a certain number of years. Furthermore, for medical images in which lossy compression is permitted a level of compression may be specified. For example, the compression ratio may be determined by a type of medical data (e.g., X-rays may be compressed to a first specified maximum compression level in order to preserve relevant medical information and CAT scans may be compressed to a second specified maximum compression level). Computer  may also determine a data type of one or more portions of a backup image and may match a data type to a compression algorithm. In one or more embodiments, maximum compression of a backup image may be achieved by evaluating one or more portions of the backup image individually to enable appropriate compression for the individual portions of the backup image.","A data protection system may enable the use of multiple compression algorithms, different compression types (e.g., lossy, lossless), multiple compression levels, and\/or other compression settings within a single data operation such as a backup. The different compression settings may be on a file by file basis within a backup. The different compression settings may be modified at each data operation. This may enable progressive reduction of storage space required for a data set and further compression as data ages. Data compression settings may be managed by a data management policy and may be independent of a storage platform, of a data age, or of other factors (e.g., an archival copy may be maintained losslessly regardless of the data age). A data protection system may use a data management policy to manage a plurality of copies of a set of data to ensure that the plurality of copies comply with individual requirements (e.g., legal compliance, business purposes, tax purposes, disaster recovery, etc.) by using the minimum storage needed for fidelity. A data protection system may also expire and\/or delete unneeded data.","A user may specify one or more compression algorithms to utilize for a particular file and\/or data type. For example, a user may specify a lossless compression algorithm to used for a file type and a lossy compression algorithm to be used for the file type. According to one or more embodiments, a data management policy may specify whether to use the associated lossy compression algorithm or the associated lossless compression algorithm.","Certain backup images, portions of backup images, and\/or data files may have uses or other criteria specified in metadata associated with the images and\/or files. The criteria specified in metadata may influence or determine a compression type or a compression level to be used for the images and\/or files. For example, artistic image data may be flagged in metadata so that lossless compression is not used. Artistic sound data may be flagged so that lossy compression may be used but the compression level may be limited so that no loss may occur in a human perceptible range.","Referring to , there is shown a module  for managing data compression in a data protection system in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in , the compression management module  may contain one or more components including compression policy module , data analysis module , compression configuration module , restoration management module , and error handling module . One or more of these components may be executed on a computing platform associated with a data protection system. For example, computer  of  may be a backup server which may utilize one or more components of module .","Compression policy module  may enable the creation, modification, and deletion of one or more data management policies. Data management policies may specify compression algorithms to be used for one or more file types, compression types to be used (e.g., lossy, lossless), compression levels to be used, and other file operation rules. In one or more embodiments, compression policy module  may provide a user interface for viewing, creation, modification, and deletion of one or more data management policies.","Data analysis module  may analyze one or more portions of backup data including, but not limited to, file size, data type, destination storage media type, and file purpose (e.g., medical, legal, tax, business, archive, etc.). Data analysis module  may provide information to compression configuration module .","Compression configuration module  may analyze a data operation request, data management policy information, information received from data analysis module  and other factors prior to configuring compression for the data operation request. In one or more embodiments, compression configuration module  may, after analyzing data and determining permissible and possible compression settings, automatically configure one or more compression settings and\/or perform compression. According to some embodiments, compression configuration module  may provide an interface, such as a user interface, for selecting among available compression settings or verifying suggested compression settings for one or more portions of a data operation request.","Restoration management module  may provide a user interface enabling a user to view one or more options and one or more copies of a requested file, backup image, or other data to restore. Restoration management module  may enable a user to view a fidelity level of data (e.g., a loss of fidelity via lossy compression), a compression ratio of data, a compression type of data (e.g., compression algorithm used, lossy, and lossless), a storage media used for the data, a backup date of the data, and other attributes. A user may be able to choose among a fidelity level of the data, an estimated restoration speed, and other factors.","Error handling module  may handle errors associated with managing data compression in a data protection system. Error handling module  may log errors, send notifications, provide warnings, and\/or perform corrective actions. For example, error handling module  may retry compression of a file, attempt restoration of a file from a different source, and\/or retry restoration of a file.","Referring to , there is shown a method  for managing data compression in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. At block , the method  for managing data compression, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, may begin.","At block , the method  may receive a data operation request. The data operation request may include a request for a backup, a data copy request, expiration or deletion of data, a request to move data, a request to archive data, or other requests.","At block , the method  may review a data management policy. One or more components or processes of a data protection system may identify one or more attributes associated with data of the data operation request.","At block , the method  may determine whether a compression algorithm has been associated with a data type. By way of non-limiting example, a data operation request may contain one or more image files, such as GIF files. The method  may determine, in this example, whether a compression algorithm is associated with GIF files. If a compression algorithm has been associated with one or more data types of the data operation request, the method  may continue at block . If a compression algorithm has not been associated with one or more data types of the data operation request, the method  may continue at block .","At block , the method  may determine whether a data management policy permits lossy compression. One or more components or processes of a data protection system may determine whether lossy compression may be utilized. If a data management policy permits lossy compression, the method  may continue at block . If a data management policy does not permit lossy compression the method  may continue at block .","At block , the method  may determine whether another compression algorithm is to be used for one or more portions of a data operation request. According to one or more embodiments, a default compression algorithm may be used. According to some embodiments, a user may be prompted to specify or associate a compression algorithm. If another compression algorithm is to be used the method  may continue at block . If another compression algorithm is not to be used the method  may end at block .","At block , the compression level may be identified. The identification may be based at least in part on one or more identified attributes which may include a data type, a data operation type, a data age, data ownership, a purpose of a data operation (e.g., archive backup, legal backup, etc.), or other attributes. The compression level may be identified by method  in accordance with a data management policy. For example, the policy may specify a maximum loss of fidelity that is allowable for a particular type of data for a particular backup (e.g., medical data of a certain type backed up for diagnostic purposes may be allowed a 10:1 compression ratio, artistic image files may not be allowed a loss of fidelity, thus compression of artistic data may use lossless compression algorithms).","At block , compression for one or more portions of a data operation request may be configured.","At block , the method  may end.","Referring to , there is shown a method  for retrieving compressed data in a data protection system in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. At block , the method  for retrieving compressed data in a data protection system, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, may begin.","At block , a data restoration request may be received.","At block , one or more sources of data for the restoration request and one or more corresponding attributes of each source may be identified. Attributes may include, but are not limited to: a data location, a data storage type, a compression level, a fidelity level, a creation date, and a modification date.","At block , the method  may determine a restoration data source. According to one or more embodiments, a user interface may be presented prompting a user with one or more data restoration source choices and one or more corresponding data source attributes. According to some embodiments, the method  may identify a data restoration source based upon one or more specified criteria. Specified criteria may include a minimum allowable fidelity level, a maximum allowable restoration time, or other criteria.","At block , the requested data may be restored.","At block , the method  may end.","At this point it should be noted that managing data compression in accordance with the present disclosure as described above typically involves the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software. For example, specific electronic components may be employed in a server or similar or related circuitry for implementing the functions associated with managing data compression in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. Alternatively, one or more processors operating in accordance with stored instructions may implement the functions associated with managing data compression in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. If such is the case, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such instructions may be stored on one or more processor readable carriers (e.g., a magnetic disk or other storage medium), or transmitted to one or more processors via one or more signals embodied in one or more carrier waves.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
