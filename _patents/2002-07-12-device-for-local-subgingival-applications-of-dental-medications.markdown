title: Device for local sub-gingival applications of dental medications
abstract: A device for use at least in conjunction with powdered, time-released, periodontal medication, with a view to improving at least upon problems associated with conditional applicators for such medications. Such a device may be in the shape of a hollow, half-cone with a tubular holding element attached to the top of the cone for rotational adjustments. The thin conical shape at the apex of the assisting device penetrates under the gum-line (into the gingival crevice) naturally. The device expands and maintains a sub-gingival space between the gingiva (gum-line) and the tooth. This allows the syringe tip to expulse the medication into the gingival crevice via at least three techniques.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to dental equipment and, more particularly, to dental implements that are configured for accessing gingival crevices.","Periodontal disease and its treatment require an anatomic understanding of an important dental structure (i.e., physiological feature) known as the gingival crevice. This \u201cgingival crevice\u201d can be likened to how a turtleneck sweater fits around a person's neck. If one places a hand between one's neck and the turtleneck sweater, the intervening space could be likened to a gingival crevice. On one side of the hand, the neck could represent the white outer (enamel) surface of a tooth, or even the lower yellow part of the tooth's root surface. On the other side of the hand, the inside collar of the turtleneck sweater could represent the inside lining of the gum tissue surrounding a tooth. Again, the intervening space between the neck and turtleneck sweater would correspond to a gingival crevice.","It is well known that, immediately upon the completion of a dental cleaning, a distinct biological process begins. Saliva in the mouth coats the clean tooth, providing a sticky coating that attaches to the tooth structure. Bacteria in the mouth are then able to attach to the sticky coating and begin multiplying exponentially. During the bacterial lifecycle, the bacteria produce enzymes and toxins that are capable of entering the gingival crevice. Once inside the crevice, the bacteria release these enzymes and toxins which are able to create microscopic ulcers on the inside tissue wall of the gingival crevice. This can result in bleeding inside the gingival crevice, thus eventually allowing the bacteria to enter the microscopic holes created in the tissues of the gingival crevice. Once inside the gum tissue, the bacteria can destroy deeper structures such as connective tissues and blood vessels and could progress even deeper, perhaps eventually reaching and even destroying the bone that holds the teeth in place.","In the past, dental treatment has relied on the use of mechanical instruments to scrape the root and tooth structures that lie inside the gingival crevice in order to control the aforementioned disease process. There have even been attempts in the past to assist in the control of periodontal disease by using liquid or gel medications that are applied by thin metal or plastic syringe tips placed into the gingival crevice. Recently, however, the first \u201cnew generation\u201d of time released sub-gingival powdered medications has been released commercially, as of the year 2001 (namely, the \u201cARESTIN\u201d medication developed by Orapharma, Inc., of Warminster, Pa.). It is recognized that the administration of these and future medications will likely be dependent upon a syringe-like cartridge for application.","A current, conventional syringe tip is 1.5 mm wide on its outside tip diameter and will not easily begin to submerge into the gingival crevice; gingival crevices generally allow for the safe sub-gingival passage of structures that are, at a maximum, \u00bd mm wide. Another difficulty with this type of syringe\/cartridge applicator is that it is rigid and cannot easily be angulated or rotated to reach many areas of the mouth. Therefore, a need has been recognized in connection with assisting in the application of medications to be placed inside the gingival crevice.","It is typical for the cell lining of the gingival crevice to adhere to the tooth's enamel or root surface. Ideally, then, the gingival crevice should be opened at its entry along the gum-line and then penetrated and expanded with deeper progression into the crevice. Maintaining this newly opened space is crucial in order to allow the medication to be applied in proper bulk and dosage. This means that the medication will easily enter the gingival crevice and fill up the potential space created by the assisting device.","Therefore, a need has been recognized in connection with providing an assisting device that may be reliably placed by a dentist. The device should preferably be constructed with enough strength and rigidity to withstand the biological resistances found in the tissue wall making up the gingival crevice. The device should also be readily adaptable to the medication applicator and yet be adjustable for individual patients. The device, also should not cause injury to the gingival crevice and should be comfortable for the patient.","A large need has thus been recognized in connection with providing an optimized, applicator-assisted device for delivering powdered medication.","In the context described hereinabove, the emergence of a time-released powdered medication since 2001 has increased the use of non-surgical treatment for periodontal diseases. Conventional plastic syringe tips used for the application of this (and future) medications is fraught with the following technical and biological problems:\n\n","Needs have thus also been recognized in connection with overcoming the above-listed problems and with providing a medication-assisting device that can be used in conjunction with an application syringe tip (or future applicator tips) of current and future medications.","It is believed that the items broadly contemplated herein can play a significant role in the future application of medications, time-released powdered or otherwise, that are placed locally into the gingival crevice. The newer time-released medications will most likely continue to be packaged and applied by a cartridge\/syringe applicator similar to one mentioned heretofore. Therefore, it is believed that embodiments of the present invention will be well-suited to overcome the existing problems discussed heretofore.","In this vein, broadly contemplated herein is a device for assisting in the placement of sub-gingival, locally placed dental medications. It allows for locating and aligning a medication applicator during the initial entry into the gingival crevice. The assisting device then allows for the complete passage of dental medications into the deeper regions of the gingival crevice. This is followed by the safe removal of the assisting device upon completion of the applied medication.","In summary, there is broadly contemplated, in accordance with at least one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, instrumentation for assisting in the administration of dental medication, the instrumentation comprising: a forward portion adapted for insertion into a gingival crevice; and a control portion adapted for facilitating maneuverability of the forward portion.","Further, there is broadly contemplated, in accordance with at least one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method of administering dental medication, the method comprising the steps of: providing at least one cartridge adapted to administer medication to a gingival crevice; and providing instrumentation comprising: a forward portion adapted for insertion into a gingival crevice; and a control portion adapted for facilitating maneuverability of the forward portion; the forward portion being adapted to accommodate the at least one cartridge.","With reference to FIGS. .A\u2013.D, an assisting device in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention can best be visualized by starting with the structure of a hollow geometric cone . If such a cone  is then cut in half from top to bottom as seen in  and .B, and then further cuts are made as shown in  and .D, then a minimum diameter or radius of the modified structure  will be towards what was the apex of the cone. Preferably, the larger semi-circular portion at the top of the modified cone structure  will have a point Z that will serve as a locus of connection to a hollow tubular structure. The lowermost portion of the modified cone structure , as shown in  will preferably be thin enough and small enough to enter the 0.5 mm (or so) natural opening of a human gingival crevice. The problem  discussed previously is thus solved.","On the other hand, a hollow tubular structure , as shown in , will preferably serve as a holding element for the basic body () of an assisting device having the previously described \u201cmodified cone\u201d shape, with the result being a unified structure  as shown in . This will further permit rotation of the assisting device , thereby achieving easier entry into the gingival crevice at any position of the mouth. This thus solves problems  and  discussed previously.","Once the assisting device  enters a gingival crevice it will preferably serve to penetrate, expand and maintain the newly opened space. This thus solves problem  discussed previously.","Once inside a gingival crevice, assisting device  will preferably be operable via any conceivably suitable technique (three of which are explained herebelow) for applying medication to a fully opened gingival crevice. This solves problem  discussed previously.","In a \u201cleveraged opening\u201d technique, as illustrated in FIGS. .A\u2013.A, that portion of the assisting device  that is concave preferably faces the tooth as it enters the gingival crevice. This can be seen clearly in  and .A. As shown there, obtuse angle DFH forms a fulcrum at point F. This fulcrum permits the assisting device  to be pushed as a lever toward the tooth via the hollow tubular holding portion of the assisting device. In turn, the apex of the assisting device  is preferably moved in an opposite direction away from the root of the tooth, as seen in  and .A. The rotational movement around the fulcrum points F and G allows the medication syringe tip to enter further past and reaching near the end of the assisting device, . This allows a syringe tip to apply the medication past the assisting device and into the opened apex of the gingival crevice.","In a \u201cshoehorn technique\u201d (see FIGS. .\u2013.C), the assisting device  is made to slide easily into a gingival crevice and travel to the bottom of the crevice. The assisting device  is again preferably rocked back and forth at the fulcrum Points, F and G, stretching the gingival crevice away from the tooth and root. The assisting device  is then preferably removed from the crevice until only about 20% of the device remains in the crevice. At this point, the syringe tip applicator slides easily between the assisting device and the tooth, carefully entering the crevice. Once the syringe tip is about 1.5 mm inside the crevice it is possible to remove the assisting device. The syringe tip is now free to penetrate further into the gingival crevice and to apply the medication.","In a \u201ctime retraction\u201d technique, the assisting device  is preferably placed fully into a gingival crevice. The device  is then preferably allowed to remain in the gingival crevice for 15 to 20 seconds while rocking the device periodically at the fulcrum Points F and G. This will stretch the inner walls of the gingival crevice away from the tooth. At the appropriate time, the assisting device is removed and the syringe tip applicator is placed into the space created by the assisting device. The syringe tip applicator can now penetrate further and the medication can be applied.","The disclosure now turns to a more detailed discussion of the functioning of an assisting device and handle assembly as a unified, functional unit and of the three prior discussed techniques for applying medications into local sites of the sub-gingival crevice that lie around teeth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 1.0","b":"100"},"As shown in FIG .A, by utilizing the plane ABC, one can visualize where the cone will be cut in half from top to bottom.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 1.B","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 1.C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 1.D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 2.0","b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2.A","b":["102","100","102","100","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0065"},"figref":"FIG. 3.0"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 3.A","b":["108","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 3.B","b":["108","106","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 3.C","b":["110","104","104","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 4.O","b":["112","114","112","114","116","118","120"]},"In accordance with a \u201cleveraged opening technique\u201d, . shows the assisting device  entering the gingival crevice  at an angle that allows parallel surfaces F-H and G-I (see ), to contact the tooth structure () and begin sliding into the crevice .
