{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT","Additional Attributes and Descriptors In The Description and The Description Scheme","Expression of the Additional Attributes"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/232,377, filed Sep. 14, 2000.","The present invention relates to a system for managing audiovisual information.","Video cassette recorders (VCRs) may record video programs in response to pressing a record button or may be programmed to record video programs based on the time of day. However, the viewer must program the VCR based on information from a television guide to identify relevant programs to record. After recording, the viewer scans through the entire video tape to select relevant portions of the program for viewing using the functionality provided by the VCR, such as fast forward and fast reverse. Unfortunately, the searching and viewing is based on a linear search, which may require significant time to locate the desired portions of the program(s) and fast forward to the desired portion of the tape. In addition, it is time consuming to program the VCR in light of the television guide to record desired programs. Also, unless the viewer recognizes the programs from the television guide as desirable it is unlikely that the viewer will select such programs to be recorded.","RePlayTV and TiVo have developed hard disk based systems that receive, record, and play television broadcasts in a manner similar to a VCR. The systems may be programmed with the viewer's viewing preferences. The systems use a telephone line interface to receive scheduling information similar to that available from a television guide. Based upon the system programming and the scheduling information, the system automatically records programs that may be of potential interest to the viewer. Unfortunately, viewing the recorded programs occurs in a linear manner and may require substantial time. In addition, each system must be programmed for an individual's preference, likely in a different manner.","Freeman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,861,881, disclose an interactive computer system where subscribers can receive individualized content.","With all the aforementioned systems, each individual viewer is required to program the device according to his particular viewing preferences. Unfortunately, each different type of device has different capabilities and limitations which limit the selections of the viewer. In addition, each device includes a different interface which the viewer may be unfamiliar with. Further, if the operator's manual is inadvertently misplaced it may be difficult for the viewer to efficiently program the device.","Many households today have many sources of audio and video information, such as multiple television sets, multiple VCR's, a home stereo, a home entertainment center, cable television, satellite television, internet broadcasts, world wide web, data services, specialized Internet services, portable radio devices, and a stereo in each of their vehicles. For each of these devices, a different interface is normally used to obtain, select, record, and play the video and\/or audio content. For example, a VCR permits the selection of the recording times but the user has to correlate the television guide with the desired recording times. Another example is the user selecting a preferred set of preselected radio stations for his home stereo and also presumably selecting the same set of preselected stations for each of the user's vehicles. If another household member desires a different set of preselected stereo selections, the programming of each audio device would need to be reprogrammed at substantial inconvenience.","The present inventors came to the realization that users of visual information and listeners to audio information, such as for example radio, audio tapes, video tapes, movies, and news, desire to be entertained and informed in more than merely one uniform manner. In other words, the audiovisual information presented to a particular user should be in a format and include content suited to their particular viewing preferences. In addition, the format should be dependent on the content of the particular audiovisual information. The amount of information presented to a user or a listener should be limited to only the amount of detail desired by the particular user at the particular time. For example with the ever increasing demands on the user's time, the user may desire to watch only 10 minutes of or merely the highlights of a basketball game. In addition, the present inventors came to the realization that the necessity of programming multiple audio and visual devices with their particular viewing preferences is a burdensome task, especially when presented with unfamiliar recording devices when traveling. When traveling, users desire to easily configure unfamiliar devices, such as audiovisual devices in a hotel room, with their viewing and listening preferences in a efficient manner.","The present inventors came to the further realization that a convenient technique of merely recording the desired audio and video information is not sufficient because the presentation of the information should be in a manner that is time efficient, especially in light of the limited time frequently available for the presentation of such information. In addition, the user should be able to access only that portion of all of the available information that the user is interested in, while skipping the remainder of the information.","A user is not capable of watching or otherwise listening to the vast potential amount of information available through all, or even a small portion of, the sources of audio and video information. In addition, with the increasing information potentially available, the user is not likely even aware of the potential content of information that he may be interested in. In light of the vast amount of audio, image, and video information, the present inventors came to the realization that a system that records and presents to the user audio and video information based upon the user's prior viewing and listening habits, preferences, and personal characteristics, generally referred to as user information, is desirable. In addition, the system may present such information based on the capabilities of the system devices. This permits the system to record desirable information and to customize itself automatically to the user and\/or listener. It is to be understood that user, viewer, and\/or listener terms may be used interchangeability for any type of content. Also, the user information should be portable between and usable by different devices so that other devices may likewise be configured automatically to the particular user's preferences upon receiving the viewing information.","In light of the foregoing realizations and motivations, the present inventors analyzed a typical audio and video presentation environment to determine the significant portions of the typical audiovisual environment. First, referring to  the video, image, and\/or audio information  is provided or otherwise made available to a user and\/or a (device) system. Second, the video, image, and\/or audio information is presented to the user from the system  (device), such as a television set or a radio. Third, the user interacts both with the system (device)  to view the information  in a desirable manner and has preferences to define which audio, image, and\/or video information is obtained in accordance with the user information . After the proper identification of the different major aspects of an audiovisual system the present inventors then realized that information is needed to describe the informational content of each portion of the audiovisual system .","With three portions of the audiovisual presentation system  identified, the functionality of each portion is identified together with its interrelationship to the other portions. To define the necessary interrelationships, a set of description schemes containing data describing each portion is defined. The description schemes include data that is auxiliary to the programs , the system , and the user , to store a set of information, ranging from human readable text to encoded data, that can be used in enabling browsing, filtering, searching, archiving, and personalization. By providing a separate description scheme describing the program(s) , the user , and the system , the three portions (program, user, and system) may be combined together to provide an interactivity not previously achievable. In addition, different programs , different users , and different systems  may be combined together in any combination, while still maintaining fall compatibility and functionality. It is to be understood that the description scheme may contain the data itself or include links to the data, as desired.","A program description scheme  related to the video, still image, and\/or audio information  preferably includes two sets of information, namely, program views and program profiles. The program views define logical structures of the frames of a video that define how the video frames are potentially to be viewed suitable for efficient browsing. For example the program views may contain a set of fields that contain data for the identification of key frames, segment definitions between shots, highlight definitions, video summary definitions, different lengths of highlights, thumbnail set of frames, individual shots or scenes, representative frame of the video, grouping of different events, and a close-up view. The program view descriptions may contain thumbnail, slide, key frame, highlights, and close-up views so that users can filter and search not only at the program level but also within a particular program. The description scheme also enables users to access information in varying detail amounts by supporting, for example, a key frame view as a part of a program view providing multiple levels of summary ranging from coarse to fine. The program profiles define distinctive characteristics of the content of the program, such as actors, stars, rating, director, release date, time stamps, keyword identification, trigger profile, still profile, event profile, character profile, object profile, color profile, texture profile, shape profile, motion profile, and categories. The program profiles are especially suitable to facilitate filtering and searching of the audio and video information. The description scheme enables users to have the provision of discovering interesting programs that they may be unaware of by providing a user description scheme. The user description scheme provides information to a software agent that in turn performs a search and filtering on behalf of the user by possibly using the system description scheme and the program description scheme information. It is to be understood that in one of the embodiments of the invention merely the program description scheme is included.","Program views contained in the program description scheme are a feature that supports a functionality such as close-up view. In the close-up view, a certain image object, e.g., a famous basketball player such as Michael Jordan, can be viewed up close by playing back a close-up sequence that is separate from the original program. An alternative view can be incorporated in a straightforward manner. Character profile on the other hand may contain spatio-temporal position and size of a rectangular region around the character of interest. This region can be enlarged by the presentation engine, or the presentation engine may darken outside the region to focus the user's attention to the characters spanning a certain number of frames. Information within the program description scheme may contain data about the initial size or location of the region, movement of the region from one frame to another, and duration and terms of the number of frames featuring the region. The character profile also provides provision for including text annotation and audio annotation about the character as well as web page information, and any other suitable information. Such character profiles may include the audio annotation which is separate from and in addition to the associated audio track of the video.","The program description scheme may likewise contain similar information regarding audio (such as radio broadcasts) and images (such as analog or digital photographs or a frame of a video).","The user description scheme  preferably includes the user's personal preferences, and information regarding the user's viewing history such as for example browsing history, filtering history, searching history, and device setting history. The user's personal preferences includes information regarding particular programs and categorizations of programs that the user prefers to view. The user description scheme may also include personal information about the particular user, such as demographic and geographic information, e.g. zip code and age. The explicit definition of the particular programs or attributes related thereto permits the system  to select those programs from the information contained within the available program description schemes  that may be of interest to the user. Frequently, the user does not desire to learn to program the device nor desire to explicitly program the device. In addition, the user description scheme  may not be sufficiently robust to include explicit definitions describing all desirable programs for a particular user. In such a case, the capability of the user description scheme  to adapt to the viewing habits of the user to accommodate different viewing characteristics not explicitly provided for or otherwise difficult to describe is useful. In such a case, the user description scheme  may be augmented or any technique can be used to compare the information contained in the user description scheme  to the available information contained in the program description scheme  to make selections. The user description scheme provides a technique for holding user preferences ranging from program categories to program views, as well as usage history. User description scheme information is persistent but can be updated by the user or by an intelligent software agent on behalf of the user at any arbitrary time. It may also be disabled by the user, at any time, if the user decides to do so. In addition, the user description scheme is modular and portable so that users can carry or port it from one device to another, such as with a handheld electronic device or smart card or transported over a network connecting multiple devices. When user description scheme is standardized among different manufacturers or products, user preferences become portable. For example, a user can personalize the television receiver in a hotel room permitting users to access information they prefer at any time and anywhere. In a sense, the user description scheme is persistent and timeless based. In addition, selected information within the program description scheme may be encrypted since at least part of the information may be deemed to be private (e.g., demographics). A user description scheme may be associated with an audiovisual program broadcast and compared with a particular user's description scheme of the receiver to readily determine whether or not the program's intended audience profile matches that of the user. It is to be understood that in one of the embodiments of the invention merely the user description scheme is included.","The system description scheme  preferably manages the individual programs and other data. The management may include maintaining lists of programs, categories, channels, users, videos, audio, and images. The management may include the capabilities of a device for providing the audio, video, and\/or images. Such capabilities may include, for example, screen size, stereo, AC3, DTS, color, black\/white, etc. The management may also include relationships between any one or more of the user, the audio, and the images in relation to one or more of a program description scheme(s) and a user description scheme(s). In a similar manner the management may include relationships between one or more of the program description scheme(s) and user description scheme(s). It is to be understood that in one of the embodiments of the invention merely the system description scheme is included.","The descriptors of the program description scheme and the user description scheme should overlap, at least partially, so that potential desirability of the program can be determined by comparing descriptors representative of the same information. For example, the program and user description scheme may include the same set of categories and actors. The program description scheme has no knowledge of the user description scheme, and vice versa, so that each description scheme is not dependant on the other for its existence. It is not necessary for the description schemes to be fully populated. It is also beneficial not to include the program description scheme with the user description scheme because there will likely be thousands of programs with associated description schemes which if combined with the user description scheme would result in a unnecessarily large user description scheme. It is desirable to maintain the user description scheme small so that it is more readily portable. Accordingly, a system including only the program description scheme and the user description scheme would be beneficial.","The user description scheme and the system description scheme should include at least partially overlapping fields. With overlapping fields the system can capture the desired information, which would otherwise not be recognized as desirable. The system description scheme preferably includes a list of users and available programs. Based on the master list of available programs, and associated program description scheme, the system can match the desired programs. It is also beneficial not to include the system description scheme with the user description scheme because there will likely be thousands of programs stored in the system description schemes which if combined with the user description scheme would result in a unnecessarily large user description scheme. It is desirable to maintain the user description scheme small so that it is more readily portable. For example, the user description scheme may include radio station preselected frequencies and\/or types of stations, while the system description scheme includes the available stations for radio stations in particular cities. When traveling to a different city the user description scheme together with the system description scheme will permit reprogramming the radio stations. Accordingly, a system including only the system description scheme and the user description scheme would be beneficial.","The program description scheme and the system description scheme should include at least partially overlapping fields. With the overlapping fields, the system description scheme will be capable of storing the information contained within the program description scheme, so that the information is properly indexed. With proper indexing, the system is capable of matching such information with the user information, if available, for obtaining and recording suitable programs. If the program description scheme and the system description scheme were not overlapping then no information would be extracted from the programs and stored. System capabilities specified within the system description scheme of a particular viewing system can be correlated with a program description scheme to determine the views that can be supported by the viewing system. For instance, if the viewing device is not capable of playing back video, its system description scheme may describe its viewing capabilities as limited to keyframe view and slide view only. Program description scheme of a particular program and system description scheme of the viewing system are utilized to present the appropriate views to the viewing system. Thus, a server of programs serves the appropriate views according to a particular viewing system's capabilities, which may be communicated over a network or communication channel connecting the server with user's viewing device. It is preferred to maintain the program description scheme separate from the system description scheme because the content providers repackage the content and description schemes in different styles, times, and formats. Preferably, the program description scheme is associated with the program, even if displayed at a different time. Accordingly, a system including only the system description scheme and the program description scheme would be beneficial.","By preferably maintaining the independence of each of the three description schemes while having fields that correlate the same information, the programs , the users , and the system  may be interchanged with one another while maintaining the functionality of the entire system . Referring to , the audio, visual, or audiovisual program , is received by the system . The program  may originate at any suitable source, such as for example broadcast television, cable television, satellite television, digital television, Internet broadcasts, world wide web, digital video discs, still images, video cameras, laser discs, magnetic media, computer hard drive, video tape, audio tape, data services, radio broadcasts, and microwave communications. The program description stream may originate from any suitable source, such as for example PSIP\/DVB-SI information in digital television broadcasts, specialized digital television data services, specialized Internet services, world wide web, data files, data over the telephone, and memory, such as computer memory. The program, user, and\/or system description scheme may be transported over a network (communication channel). For example, the system description scheme may be transported to the source to provide the source with views or other capabilities that the device is capable of using. In response, the source provides the device with image, audio, and\/or video content customized or otherwise suitable for the particular device. The system  may include any device(s) suitable to receive any one or more of such programs  An audiovisual program analysis module  performs an analysis of the received programs  to extract and provide program related information (descriptors) to the description scheme (DS) generation module  The program related information may be extracted from the data stream including the program  or obtained from any other source, such as for example data transferred over a telephone line, data already transferred to the system  in the past, or data from an associated file. The program related information preferably includes data defining both the program views and the program profiles available for the particular program  The analysis module  performs an analysis of the programs  using information obtained from (i) automatic audio-video analysis methods on the basis of low-level features that are extracted from the program(s), (ii) event detection techniques, (iii) data that is available (or extractable) from data sources or electronic program guides (EPGs, DVB-SI, and PSIP), and (iv) user information obtained from the user description scheme  to provide data defining the program description scheme.","The selection of a particular program analysis technique depends on the amount of readily available data and the user preferences. For example, if a user prefers to watch a 5 minute video highlight of a particular program, such as a basketball game, the analysis module  may invoke a knowledge based system  () to determine the highlights that form the best 5 minute summary. The knowledge based system  may invoke a commercial filter  to remove commercials and a slow motion detector  to assist in creating the video summary. The analysis module  may also invoke other modules to bring information together (e.g., textual information) to author particular program views. For example, if the program  is a home video where there is no further information available then the analysis module  may create a key-frame summary by identifying key-frames of a multi-level summary and passing the information to be used to generate the program views, and in particular a key frame view, to the description scheme. Referring also to , the analysis module  may also include other sub-modules, such as for example, a de-mux\/decoder , a data and service content analyzer , a text processing and text summary generator , a close caption analyzer , a title frame generator , an analysis manager , an audiovisual analysis and feature extractor , an event detector , a key-frame summarizer , and a highlight summarizer .","The generation module  receives the system information , for the system description scheme. The system information  preferably includes data for the system description scheme  generated by the generation module  The generation module  also receives user information  including data for the user description scheme. The user information  preferably includes data for the user description scheme generated within the generation module  The user input  may include, for example, meta information to be included in the program and system description scheme. The user description scheme (or corresponding information) is provided to the analysis module  for selective analysis of the program(s)  For example, the user description scheme may be suitable for triggering the highlight generation functionality for a particular program and thus generating the preferred views and storing associated data in the program description scheme. The generation module  and the analysis module  provide data to a data storage unit  The storage unit  may be any storage device, such as memory or magnetic media.","A search, filtering, and browsing (SFB) module  implements the description scheme technique by parsing and extracting information contained within the description scheme. The SFB module  may perform filtering, searching, and browsing of the programs , on the basis of the information contained in the description schemes. An intelligent software agent is preferably included within the SFB module  that gathers and provides user specific information to the generation module  to be used in authoring and updating the user description scheme (through the generation module ). In this manner, desirable content may be provided to the user though a display . The selections of the desired program(s) to be retrieved, stored, and\/or viewed may be programmed, at least in part, through a graphical user interface . The graphical user interface may also include or be connected to a presentation engine for presenting the information to the user through the graphical user interface.","The intelligent management and consumption of audiovisual information using the multi-part description stream device provides a next-generation device suitable for the modem era of information overload. The device responds to changing lifestyles of individuals and families, and allows everyone to obtain the information they desire anytime and anywhere they want.","An example of the use of the device may be as follows. A user comes home from work late Friday evening being happy the work week is finally over. The user desires to catch up with the events of the world and then watch ABC's 20\/20 show later that evening. It is now 9 PM and the 20\/20 show will start in an hour at 10 PM. The user is interested in the sporting events of the week, and all the news about the Microsoft case with the Department of Justice. The user description scheme may include a profile indicating a desire that the particular user wants to obtain all available information regarding the Microsoft trial and selected sporting events for particular teams. In addition, the system description scheme and program description scheme provide information regarding the content of the available information that may selectively be obtained and recorded. The system, in an autonomous manner, periodically obtains and records the audiovisual information that may be of interest to the user during the past week based on the three description schemes. The device most likely has recorded more than one hour of audiovisual information so the information needs to be condensed in some manner. The user starts interacting with the system with a pointer or voice commands to indicate a desire to view recorded sporting programs. On the display, the user is presented with a list of recorded sporting events including Basketball and Soccer. Apparently the user's favorite Football team did not play that week because it was not recorded. The user is interested in basketball games and indicates a desire to view games. A set of title frames is presented on the display that captures an important moment of each game. The user selects the Chicago Bulls game and indicates a desire to view a 5 minute highlight of the game. The system automatically generates highlights. The highlights may be generated by audio or video analysis, or the program description scheme includes data indicating the frames that are presented for a 5 minute highlight. The system may have also recorded web-based textual information regarding the particular Chicago-Bulls game which may be selected by the user for viewing. If desired, the summarized information may be recorded onto a storage device, such as a DVD with a label. The stored information may also include an index code so that it can be located at a later time. After viewing the sporting events the user may decide to read the news about the Microsoft trial. It is now 9:50 PM and the user is done viewing the news. In fact, the user has selected to delete all the recorded news items after viewing them. The user then remembers to do one last thing before 10 PM in the evening. The next day, the user desires to watch the VHS tape that he received from his brother that day, containing footage about his brother's new baby girl and his vacation to Peru last summer. The user wants to watch the whole 2-hour tape but he is anxious to see what the baby looks like and also the new stadium built in Lima, which was not there last time he visited Peru. The user plans to take a quick look at a visual summary of the tape, browse, and perhaps watch a few segments for a couple of minutes, before the user takes his daughter to her piano lesson at 10 AM the next morning. The user plugs in the tape into his VCR, that is connected to the system, and invokes the summarization functionality of the system to scan the tape and prepare a summary. The user can then view the summary the next morning to quickly discover the baby's looks, and playback segments between the key-frames of the summary to catch a glimpse of the crying baby. The system may also record the tape content onto the system hard drive (or storage device) so the video summary can be viewed quickly. It is now 10:10 PM, and it seems that the user is 10 minutes late for viewing 20\/20. Fortunately, the system, based on the three description schemes, has already been recording 20\/20 since 10 PM. Now the user can start watching the recorded portion of 20\/20 as the recording of 20\/20 proceeds. The user will be done viewing 20\/20 at 11:10 PM.","The average consumer has an ever increasing number of multimedia devices, such as a home audio system, a car stereo, several home television sets, web browsers, etc. The user currently has to customize each of the devices for optimal viewing and\/or listening preferences. By storing the user preferences on a removable storage device, such as a smart card, the user may insert the card including the user preferences into such media devices for automatic customization. This results in the desired programs being automatically recorded on the VCR, and setting of the radio stations for the car stereo and home audio system. In this manner the user only has to specify his preferences at most once, on a single device and subsequently, the descriptors are automatically uploaded into devices by the removable storage device. The user description scheme may also be loaded into other devices using a wired or wireless network connection, e.g. that of a home network. Alternatively, the system can store the user history and create entries in the user description scheme based on the's audio and video viewing habits. In this manner, the user would never need to program the viewing information to obtain desired information. In a sense, the user descriptor scheme enables modeling of the user by providing a central storage for the user's listening, viewing, browsing preferences, and user's behavior. This enables devices to be quickly personalized, and enables other components, such as intelligent agents, to communicate on the basis of a standardized description format, and to make smart inferences regarding the user's preferences.","Many different realizations and applications can be readily derived from  by appropriately organizing and utilizing their different parts, or by adding peripherals and extensions as needed. In its most general form,  depicts an audiovisual searching, filtering, browsing, and\/or recording appliance that is personalizable. The list of more specific applications\/implementations given below is not exhaustive but covers a range.","The user description scheme is a major enabler for personalizable audiovisual appliances. If the structure (syntax and semantics) of the description schemes is known amongst multiple appliances, the user (user) can carry (or otherwise transfer) the information contained within his user description scheme from one appliance to another, perhaps via a smart card\u2014where these appliances support smart card interface\u2014in order to personalize them. Personalization can range from device settings, such as display contrast and volume control, to settings of television channels, radio stations, web stations, web sites, geographic information, and demographic information such as age, zip code etc. Appliances that can be personalized may access content from different sources. They may be connected to the web, terrestrial or cable broadcast, etc., and they may also access multiple or different types of single media such as video, music, etc.","For example, one can personalize the car stereo using a smart card plugged out of the home system and plugged into the car stereo system to be able to tune to favorite stations at certain times. As another example, one can also personalize television viewing, for example, by plugging the smart card into a remote control that in turn will autonomously command the television receiving system to present the user information about current and future programs that fits the user's preferences. Different members of the household can instantly personalize the viewing experience by inserting their own smart card into the family remote. In the absence of such a remote, this same type of personalization can be achieved by plugging in the smart card directly to the television system. The remote may likewise control audio systems. In another implementation, the television receiving system holds user description schemes for multiple users (users) in local storage and identify different users (or group of users) by using an appropriate input interface. For example an interface using user-voice identification technology. It is noted that in a networked system the user description scheme may be transported over the network.","The user description scheme is generated by direct user input, and by using a software that watches the user to determine his\/her usage pattern and usage history. User description scheme can be updated in a dynamic fashion by the user or automatically. A well defined and structured description scheme design allows different devices to interoperate with each other. A modular design also provides portability.","The description scheme adds new functionality to those of the current VCR. An advanced VCR system can learn from the user via direct input of preferences, or by watching the usage pattern and history of the user. The user description scheme holds user's preferences users and usage history. An intelligent agent can then consult with the user description scheme and obtain information that it needs for acting on behalf of the user. Through the intelligent agent, the system acts on behalf of the user to discover programs that fit the taste of the user, alert the user about such programs, and\/or record them autonomously. An agent can also manage the storage in the system according to the user description scheme, i.e., prioritizing the deletion of programs (or alerting the user for transfer to a removable media), or determining their compression factor (which directly impacts their visual quality) according to user's preferences and history.","The program description scheme and the system description scheme work in collaboration with the user description scheme in achieving some tasks. In addition, the program description scheme and system description scheme in an advanced VCR or other system will enable the user to browse, search, and filter audiovisual programs. Browsing in the system offers capabilities that are well beyond fast forwarding and rewinding. For instance, the user can view a thumbnail view of different categories of programs stored in the system. The user then may choose frame view, shot view, key frame view, or highlight view, depending on their availability and user's preference. These views can be readily invoked using the relevant information in the program description scheme, especially in program views. The user at any time can start viewing the program either in parts, or in its entirety.","In this application, the program description scheme may be readily available from many services such as: (i) from broadcast (carried by EPG defined as a part of ATSC-PSIP (ATSC-Program Service Integration Protocol) in USA or DVB-SI (Digital Video Broadcast-Service Information) in Europe); (ii) from specialized data services (in addition to PSIP\/DVB-SI); (iii) from specialized web sites; (iv) from the media storage unit containing the audiovisual content (e.g., DVD); (v) from advanced cameras (discussed later), and\/or may be generated (i.e., for programs that are being stored) by the analysis module  or by user input .","Contents of digital still and video cameras can be stored and managed by a system that implements the description schemes, e.g., a system as shown in . Advanced cameras can store a program description scheme, for instance, in addition to the audiovisual content itself. The program description scheme can be generated either in part or in its entirety on the camera itself via an appropriate user input interface (e.g., speech, visual menu drive, etc.). Users can input to the camera the program description scheme information, especially those high-level (or semantic) information that may otherwise be difficult to automatically extract by the system. Some camera settings and parameters (e.g., date and time), as well as quantities computed in the camera (e.g., color histogram to be included in the color profile), can also be used in generating the program description scheme. Once the camera is connected, the system can browse the camera content, or transfer the camera content and its description scheme to the local storage for future use. It is also possible to update or add information to the description scheme generated in the camera.","The IEEE 1394 and Havi standard specifications enable this type of \u201caudiovisual content\u201d centric communication among devices. The description scheme API's can be used in the context of Havi to browse and\/or search the contents of a camera or a DVD which also contain a description scheme associated with their content, i.e., doing more than merely invoking the PLAY API to play back and linearly view the media. The description schemes may be used in archiving audiovisual programs in a database. The search engine uses the information contained in the program description scheme to retrieve programs on the basis of their content. The program description scheme can also be used in navigating through the contents of the database or the query results. The user description scheme can be used in prioritizing the results of the user query during presentation. It is possible of course to make the program description scheme more comprehensive depending on the nature of the particular application.","The description scheme fulfills the user's desire to have applications that pay attention and are responsive to their viewing and usage habits, preferences, and personal demographics. The proposed user description scheme directly addresses this desire in its selection of fields and interrelationship to other description schemes. Because the description schemes are modular in nature, the user can port his user description scheme from one device to another in order to \u201cpersonalize\u201d the device.","The proposed description schemes can be incorporated into current products similar to those from TiVo and Replay TV in order to extend their entertainment informational value. In particular, the description scheme will enable audiovisual browsing and searching of programs and enable filtering within a particular program by supporting multiple program views such as the highlight view. In addition, the description scheme will handle programs coming from sources other than television broadcasts for which TiVo and Replay TV are not designed to handle. In addition, by standardization of TiVo and Replay TV type of devices, other products may be interconnected to such devices to extend their capabilities, such as devices supporting an MPEG 7 description. MPEG-7 is the Moving Pictures Experts Group-7, acting to standardize descriptions and description schemes for audiovisual information. The device may also be extended to be personalized by multiple users, as desired.","Because the description scheme is defined, the intelligent software agents can communicate among themselves to make intelligent inferences regarding the user's preferences. In addition, the development and upgrade of intelligent software agents for browsing and filtering applications can be simplified based on the standardized user description scheme.","The description scheme is multi-modal in the following sense that it holds both high level (semantic) and low level features and\/or descriptors. For example, the high and low level descriptors are actor name and motion model parameters, respectively. High level descriptors are easily readable by humans while low level descriptors are more easily read by machines and less understandable by humans. The program description scheme can be readily harmonized with existing EPG, PSIP, and DVB-SI information facilitating search and filtering of broadcast programs. Existing services can be extended in the future by incorporating additional information using the compliant description scheme.","For example, one case may include audiovisual programs that are prerecorded on a media such as a digital video disc where the digital video disc also contains a description scheme that has the same syntax and semantics of the description scheme that the FSB module uses. If the FSB module uses a different description scheme, a transcoder (converter) of the description scheme may be employed. The user may want to browse and view the content of the digital video disc. In this case, the user may not need to invoke the analysis module to author a program description. However, the user may want to invoke his or her user description scheme in filtering, searching and browsing the digital video disc content. Other sources of program information may likewise be used in the same manner.","It is to be understood that any of the techniques described herein with relation to video are equally applicable to images (such as still image or a frame of a video) and audio (such as radio).","An example of an audiovisual interface is shown in  which is suitable for the preferred audiovisual description scheme. Referring to , by selecting the thumbnail function as a function of category provides a display with a set of categories on the left hand side. Selecting a particular category, such as news, provides a set of thumbnail views of different programs that are currently available for viewing. In addition, the different programs may also include programs that will be available at a different time for viewing. The thumbnail views are short video segments that provide an indication of the content of the respective actual program that it corresponds with. Referring to , a thumbnail view of available programs in terms of channels may be displayed, if desired. Referring to , a text view of available programs in terms of channels may be displayed, if desired. Referring to , a frame view of particular programs may be displayed, if desired. A representative frame is displayed in the center of the display with a set of representative frames of different programs in the left hand column. The frequency of the number of frames may be selected, as desired. Also a set of frames are displayed on the lower portion of the display representative of different frames during the particular selected program. Referring to , a shot view of particular programs may be displayed, as desired. A representative frame of a shot is displayed in the center of the display with a set of representative frames of different programs in the left hand column. Also a set of shots are displayed on the lower portion of the display representative of different shots (segments of a program, typically sequential in nature) during the particular selected program. Referring to , a key frame view of particular programs may be displayed, as desired. A representative frame is displayed in the center of the display with a set of representative frames of different programs in the left hand column. Also a set of key frame views are displayed on the lower portion of the display representative of different key frame portions during the particular selected program. The number of key frames in each key frame view can be adjusted by selecting the level. Referring to , a highlight view may likewise be displayed, as desired. Referring to , an event view may likewise be displayed, as desired. Referring to , a character\/object view may likewise be displayed, as desired.","The present inventors came to the realization that the program description scheme may be further modified to provide additional capabilities. Referring to , the modified program description scheme  includes four separate types of information, namely, a syntactic structure description scheme , a semantic structure description scheme , a visualization description scheme , and a meta information description scheme . It is to be understood that in any particular system one or more of the description schemes may be included, as desired.","Referring to , the visualization description scheme  enables fast and effective browsing of video program (and audio programs) by allowing access to the necessary data, preferably in a one-step process. The visualization description scheme  provides for several different presentations of the video content (or audio), such as for example, a thumbnail view description scheme , a key frame view description scheme , a highlight view description scheme , an event view description scheme , a close-up view description scheme , and an alternative view description scheme . Other presentation techniques and description schemes may be added, as desired. The thumbnail view description scheme  preferably includes an image  or reference to an image representative of the video content and a time reference  to the video. The key frame view description scheme  preferably includes a level indicator  and a time reference . The level indicator  accommodates the presentation of a different number of key frames for the same video portion depending on the user's preference. The highlight view description scheme  includes a length indicator  and a time reference . The length indicator  accommodates the presentation of a different highlight duration of a video depending on the user's preference. The event view description scheme  preferably includes an event indicator  for the selection of the desired event and a time reference . The close-up view description scheme  preferably includes a target indicator  and a time reference . The alternate view description scheme preferably includes a source indicator . To increase performance of the system it is preferred to specify the data which is needed to render such views in a centralized and straightforward manner. By doing so, it is then feasible to access the data in a simple one-step process without complex parsing of the video.","Referring to , the meta information description scheme  generally includes various descriptors which carry general information about a video (or audio) program such as the title, category, keywords, etc. Additional descriptors, such as those previously described, may be included, as desired.","Referring again to , the syntactic structure description scheme  specifies the physical structure of a video program (or audio), e.g., a table of contents. The physical features, may include for example, color, texture, motion, etc. The syntactic structure description scheme  preferably includes three modules, namely a segment description scheme , a region description scheme , and a segment\/region relation graph description scheme . The segment description scheme  may be used to define relationships between different portions of the video consisting of multiple frames of the video. A segment description scheme  may contain another segment description scheme  and\/or shot description scheme to form a segment tree. Such a segment tree may be used to defined a temporal structure of a video program. Multiple segment trees may be created and thereby create multiple table of contents. For example, a video program may be segmented into story units, scenes, and shots, from which the segment description scheme  may contain such information as a table of contents. The shot description scheme may contain a number of key frame description schemes, a mosaic description scheme(s), a camera motion description scheme(s), etc. The key frame description scheme may contain a still image description scheme which may in turn contains color and texture descriptors. It is noted that various low level descriptors may be included in the still image description scheme under the segment description scheme. Also, the visual descriptors may be included in the region description scheme which is not necessarily under a still image description scheme. On example of a segment description scheme  is shown in .","Referring to , the region description scheme  defines the interrelationships between groups of pixels of the same and\/or different frames of the video. The region description scheme  may also contain geometrical features, color, texture features, motion features, etc.","Referring to , the segment\/region relation graph description scheme  defines the interrelationships between a plurality of regions (or region description schemes), a plurality of segments (or segment description schemes), and\/or a plurality of regions (or description schemes) and segments (or description schemes).","Referring again to , the semantic structure description scheme  is used to specify semantic features of a video program (or audio), e.g. semantic events. In a similar manner to the syntactic structure description scheme, the semantic structure description scheme  preferably includes three modules, namely an event description scheme , an object description scheme , and an event\/objection relation graph description scheme . The event description scheme  may be used to form relationships between different events of the video normally consisting of multiple frames of the video. An event description scheme  may contain another event description scheme  to form a segment tree. Such an event segment tree may be used to define a semantic index table for a video program. Multiple event trees may be created and thereby creating multiple index tables. For example, a video program may include multiple events, such as a basketball dunk, a fast break, and a free throw, and the event description scheme may contain such information as an index table. The event description scheme may also contain references which link the event to the corresponding segments and\/or regions specified in the syntactic structure description scheme. On example of an event description scheme is shown in .","Referring to , the object description scheme  defines the interrelationships between groups of pixels of the same and\/or different frames of the video representative of objects. The object description scheme  may contain another object description scheme and thereby form an object tree. Such an object tree may be used to define an object index table for a video program. The object description scheme may also contain references which link the object to the corresponding segments and\/or regions specified in the syntactic structure description scheme.","Referring to , the event\/object relation graph description scheme  defines the interrelationships between a plurality of events (or event description schemes), a plurality of objects (or object description schemes), and\/or a plurality of events (or description schemes) and objects (or description schemes).","After further consideration, the present inventors came the realization that the particular design of the user preference description scheme is important to implement portability, while permitting adaptive updating, of the user preference description scheme. Moreover, the user preference description scheme should be readily usable by the system while likewise being suitable for modification based on the user's historical usage patterns. It is possible to collectively track all users of a particular device to build a database for the historical viewing preferences of the users of the device, and thereafter process the data dynamically to determine which content the users would likely desire. However, this implementation would require the storage of a large amount of data and the associated dynamic processing requirements to determine the user preferences. It is to be understood that the user preference description scheme may be used alone or in combination with other description scheme.","Referring to , to achieve portability and potentially decreased processing requirements the user preference description scheme  should be divided into at least two separate description schemes, namely, a usage preference description scheme  and a usage history description scheme . The usage preference description scheme , described in detail later, includes a description scheme of the user's audio and\/or video consumption preferences. The usage preference description scheme  describes one or more of the following, depending on the particular implementation, (a) browsing preferences, (b) filtering preferences, (c) searching preferences, and (d) device preferences of the user. The type of preferences shown in the usage preference description scheme  are generally immediately usable by the system for selecting and otherwise using the available audio and\/or video content. In other words, the usage preference description scheme  includes data describing audio and\/or video consumption of the user. The usage history description scheme , described in detail later, includes a description scheme of the user's historical audio and\/or video activity, such as browsing, device settings, viewing, and selection. The usage history description scheme  describes one or more of the following, depending on the particular implementation, (a) browsing history,(b) filtering history,(c) searching history, and (d) device usage history. The type of preferences shown in the usage history description scheme  are not generally immediately usable by the system for selecting and otherwise using the available audio and\/or video content. The data contained in the usage history description scheme  may be considered generally \u201cunprocessed\u201d, at least in comparison to the data contained in the usage preferences description scheme  because it generally contains the historical usage data of the audio and\/or video content of the viewer.","In general, capturing the user's usage history facilitates \u201cautomatic\u201d composition of user preferences by a machine, as desired. When updating the user preference description scheme  it is desirable that the usage history description scheme  be relatively symmetric to the usage preference description scheme . The symmetry permits more effective updating because less interpretation between the two description schemes is necessary in order to determine what data should be included in the preferences. Numerous algorithms can then be applied in utilization of the history information in deriving user preferences. For instance, statistics can be computed from the history and utilized for this purpose.","After consideration of the usage preference description  and the usage history description , the present inventors came to the realization that in the home environment many different users with different viewing and usage preferences may use the same device. For example, with a male adult preferring sports, a female adult preferring afternoon talk shows, and a three year old child preferring children's programming, the total information contained in the usage preference description  and the usage history description  will not be individually suitable for any particular user. The resulting composite data and its usage by the device is frustrating to the users because the device will not properly select and present audio and\/or video content that is tailored to any particular user. To alleviate this limitation, the user preference description  may also include a user identification (user identifier) description . The user identification description  includes an identification of the particular user that is using the device. By incorporating a user identification description  more than one user may use the device while maintaining a different or a unique set of data within the usage preference description  and the usage history description . Accordingly, the user identification description  associates the appropriate usage preference description(s)  and usage history description(s)  for the particular user identified by the user identification description . With multiple user identification descriptions , multiple entries within a single user identification description  identifying different users, and\/or including the user identification description within the usage preference description  and\/or usage history description  to provide the association therebetween, multiple users can readily use the same device while maintaining their individuality. Also, without the user identification description in the preferences and\/or history, the user may more readily customize content anonymously. In addition, the user's user identification description  may be used to identify multiple different sets of usage preference descriptions \u2014usage history descriptions , from which the user may select for present interaction with the device depending on usage conditions. The use of multiple user identification descriptions for the same user is useful when the user uses dultiple different types of devices, such as a television, a home stereo, a business television, a hotel television, and a vehicle audio player, and maintains multiple different sets of preference descriptions. Further, the identification may likewise be used to identify groups of individuals, such as for example, a family. In addition, devices that are used on a temporary basis, such as those in hotel rooms or rental cars, the user identification requirements may be overridden by employing a temporary session user identification assigned by such devices. In applications where privacy concerns may be resolved or are otherwise not a concern, the user identification description  may also contain demographic information of the user. In this manner, as the usage history description  increases during use over time, this demographic data and\/or data regarding usage patterns may be made available to other sources. The data may be used for any purpose, such as for example, providing targeted advertising or programming on the device based on such data.","Referring to , periodically an agent  processes the usage history description(s)  for a particular user to \u201cautomatically\u201d determine the particular user's preferences. In this manner, the user's usage preference description  is updated to reflect data stored in the usage history description . This processing by the agent  is preferably performed on a periodic basis so that during normal operation the usage history description  does not need to be processed, or otherwise queried, to determine the user's current browsing, filtering, searching, and device preferences. The usage preference description  is relatively compact and suitable for storage on a portable storage device, such as a smart card, for use by other devices as previously described.","Frequently, the user may be traveling away from home with his smart card containing his usage preference description . During such traveling the user will likely be browsing, filtering, searching, and setting device preferences of audio and\/or video content on devices into which he provided his usage preference description . However, in some circumstances the audio and\/or video content browsed, filtered, searched, and device preferences of the user may not be typically what he is normally interested in. In addition, for a single device the user may desire more than one profile depending on the season, such as football season, basketball season, baseball season, fall, winter, summer, and spring. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate for the device to create a usage history description  and thereafter have the agent  \u201cautomatically\u201d update the user's usage preference description . This will in effect corrupt the user's usage preference description . Accordingly, the device should include an option that disables the agent  from updating the usage preference description . Alternatively, the usage preference description  may include one or more fields or data structures that indicate whether or not the user desires the usage preference description  (or portions thereof) to be updated.","Referring to , the device may use the program descriptions provided by any suitable source describing the current and\/or future audio and\/or video content available from which a filtering agent  selects the appropriate content for the particular user(s). The content is selected based upon the usage preference description for a particular user identification(s) to determine a list of preferred audio and\/or video programs.","As it may be observed, with a relatively compact user preference description  the user's preferences are readily movable to different devices, such as a personal video recorder, a TiVO player, a RePlay Networks player, a car audio player, or other audio and\/or video appliance. Yet, the user preference description  may be updated in accordance with the user's browsing, filtering, searching, and device preferences.","Referring to , the usage preference description  preferably includes three different categories of descriptions, depending on the particular implementation. The preferred descriptions include (a) browsing preferences description , (b) filtering and search preferences description,  and (c) device preferences description . The browsing preferences description  relates to the viewing preferences of audio and\/or video programs. The filtering and search preferences description  relates to audio and\/or video program level preferences. The program level preferences are not necessarily used at the same time as the (browsing) viewing preferences. For example, preferred programs can be determined as a result of filtering program descriptions according to user's filtering preferences. A particular preferred program may subsequently be viewed in accordance with user's browsing preferences. Accordingly, efficient implementation may be achieved if the browsing preferences description  is separate, at least logically, from the filtering and search preferences description . The device preferences description  relates to the preferences for setting up the device in relation to the type of content being presented, e.g. romance, drama, action, violence, evening, morning, day, weekend, weekday, and\/or the available presentation devices. For example, presentation devices may include stereo sound, mono sound, surround sound, multiple potential displays, multiple different sets of audio speakers, AC-3, and Dolby Digital. It may likewise be observed that the device preferences description  is likewise separate, at least logically, from the browsing description  and filtering\/search preferences description .","The browsing preferences description  contains descriptors that describe preferences of the user for browsing multimedia (audio and\/or video) information. In the case of video, for example, the browsing preferences may include user's preference for continuous playback of the entire program versus visualizing a short summary of the program. Various summary types may be described in the program descriptions describing multiple different views of programs where these descriptions are utilized by the device to facilitate rapid non-linear browsing, viewing, and navigation. Parameters of the various summary types should also be specified, i.e., number of hierarchy levels when the keyframe summary is preferred, or the time duration of the video highlight when highlight summary is preferred. In addition, browsing preferences may also include descriptors describing parental control settings. A switch descriptor (set by the user) should also be included to specify whether or not the preferences can be modified without consulting the user first. This prevents inadvertent changing or updating of the preferences by the device. In addition, it is desirable that the browsing preferences are media content dependent. For example, a user may prefer 15 minute video highlight of a basketball game or may prefer to see only the 3-point shots. The same user may prefer a keyframe summary with two levels of hierarchy for home videos.","The filtering and search preferences description  preferably has four descriptions defined therein, depending on the particular embodiment. The keyword preferences description  is used to specify favorite topics that may not be captured in the title, category, etc., information. This permits the acceptance of a query for matching entries in any of the available data fields. The content preferences description  is used to facilitate capturing, for instance, favorite actors, directors. The creation preferences description  is used to specify capturing, for instance, titles of favorite shows. The classification preferences description  is used to specify descriptions, for instance, a favorite program category. A switch descriptor, activated by the user, may be included to specify whether or not the preferences may be modified without consulting the user, as previously described.","The device preferences description  contains descriptors describing preferred audio and\/or video rendering settings, such as volume, balance, bass, treble, brightness, contrast, closed captioning, AC-3, Dolby digital, which display device of several, type of display device, etc. The settings of the device relate to how the user browses and consumes the audio and\/or video content. It is desirable to be able to specify the device setting preferences in a media type and content-dependent manner. For example the preferred volume settings for an action movie may be higher than a drama, or the preferred settings of bass for classical music and rock music may be different. A switch descriptor, activated by the user, may be included to specify whether or not the preferences may be modified without consulting the user, as previously described.","Referring to , the usage preferences description may be used in cooperation with an MPEG-7 compliant data stream and\/or device. MPEG-7 descriptions are described in ISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC29\/WG11 \u201cMPEG-7 Media\/Meta DSs (V0.2), August 1999, incorporated by reference herein. It is preferable that media content descriptions are consistent with descriptions of preferences of users consuming the media. Consistency can be achieved by using common descriptors in media and user preference descriptions or by specifying a correspondence between user preferences and media descriptors. Browsing preferences descriptions are preferably consistent with media descriptions describing different views and summaries of the media. The content preferences description  is preferably consistent with, e.g., a subset of the content description of the media  specified in MPEG-7 by content description scheme. The classification preferences description  is preferably consistent with, e.g., a subset of the classification description  defined in MPEG-7 as classification description scheme. The creation preferences description  is preferably consistent with, e.g., a subset of the creation description  specified in MPEG-7 by creation description scheme. The keyword preferences description  is preferably a string supporting multiple languages and consistent with corresponding media content description schemes. Consistency between media and user preference descriptions is depicted or shown in  by couble arrows in the case of content, creation, and classification preferences.","Referring to , the usage history description  preferably includes three different categories of descriptions, depending on the particular implementation. The preferred descriptions include (a) browsing history description , (b) filtering and search history description , and (c) device usage history description , as previously described in relation to the usage preference description . The filtering and search history description  preferably has four descriptions defined therein, depending on the particular embodiment, namely, a keyword usage history description , a content usage history description , a creation preferences description , and a classification usage history description , as previously described with respect to the preferences. The usage history description  may contain additional descriptors therein (or description if desired) that describe the time and\/or time duration of information contained therein. The time refers to the duration of consuming a particular audio and\/or video program. The duration of time that a particular program has been viewed provides information that may be used to determine user preferences. For example, if a user only watches a show for 5 minutes then it may not be a suitable preference for inclusion the usage preference description . In addition, the present inventors came to the realization that an even more accurate measure of the user's preference of a particular audio and\/or video program is the time viewed in light of the total duration of the program. This accounts for the relative viewing duration of a program. For example watching 30 minutes of a 4 hour show may be of less relevance than watching 30 minutes of a 30 minute show to determine preference data for inclusion in the usage preference description .","Referring to , an exemplary example of an audio and\/or video program receiver with persistent storage is illustrated. As shown, audio\/video program descriptions are available from the broadcast or other source, such as a telephone line. The user preference description facilitate personalization of the browsing, filtering and search, and device settings. In this embodiment, the user preferences are stored at the user's terminal with provision for transporting it to other systems, for example via a smart card. Alternatively, the user preferences may be stored in a server and the content adaptation can be performed according to user descriptions at the server and then the preferred content is transmitted to the user. The user may directly provide the user preferences, if desired. The user preferences and\/or user history may likewise be provided to a service provider. The system may employ an application that records user's usage history in the form of usage history description, as previously defined. The usage history description is then utilized by another application, e.g., a smart agent, to automatically map usage history to user preferences.","The present inventors came to the realization that additional functionality for the system may be achieved by the incorporation of particular types of information in the descriptions and description schemes. A description scheme is a data model of descriptions. It specifies the descriptors and their syntax as they are used in the description. In what follows, use the terms description and description scheme may be used interchangeably since they both correspond to describing media and user preferences. An explanation of the additional attributes and descriptors in the descriptions will be provided, followed by an example of portions of example descriptions.","After further consideration, there is a need for many users to maintain multiple separate user preference descriptions. Multiple user preference descriptions may correspond to, for example, different locations (e.g., at home, at the office, away from home, stationary versus traveling in a vehicle), different situations, different times (e.g., different days, different seasons), different emotional states of the user (e.g., happy mood versus tired or sad), and\/or persistence (e.g., temporary usage versus permanent usage). Further, the user preference descriptions may include differentiation for different terminals with different primary functionalities (e.g., a personal video recorder versus a cell phone). In addition, available communication channel bandwidth at different locations or situations may use different preferences. Also, the preference of a user for the length of an audiovisual summary of a video program for downloading may be different. The user in different usage conditions may use the user identification description scheme as a basis to distinguish between different devices and\/or services. An example of different conditions may include a television broadcast receiver and a cellular telephone.","In addition to maintaining multiple user preferences for a particular user based on the aforementioned conditions, the present inventors also came to the realization that the different locations, different situations, different emotional states, different seasons, and\/or different terminals (etc.), may likewise be used as the basis for distinguishing between the user preference descriptions.","One technique to permit a particular user to have multiple preference descriptions and distinguishing them from one another is by using different usernames or by using a versioning mechanism, such as a version descriptor in the identification description scheme, as described later.","As previously described, the system may include multiple user preference descriptions for a particular user. With multiple descriptions, the system may express the different user preferences with different granularity, e.g., a greater or lesser amount of detail. The increased granularity (sparseness) may be merely the result of applying a filter to the user preference description that further reduces the amount of data. In other words, the structure of the usage preference description may be identical with the difference being the result of the filter further reducing the data. In another embodiment, the variable granularity results in a different size of the data contained in the user preferences, which may be based upon, if desired, the location and\/or application of the user. User preferences with increased granularity may be especially suitable for storage on portable memory devices with limited memory capability. Likewise, the granularity may be applied to the usage history.","Another aspect of the present invention permits the user preferences (and history) to be based upon the media type, media source, or content (e.g., music versus video, radio versus television broadcast, and\/or sports video versus home video). These preferences relate to the audio and\/or video itself, as opposed to a third party characterization of the desirability of the multimedia. The inclusion of this information permits a reduction in the computational processing requirements depending on the media type, media source, and\/or content of the media.","Another feature that may be included in the system is a protection attribute for each, or a selected set of, component of the user descriptions. The protection attributes specifies the access right of a system or service provider, typically a party other than the user himself, to the user's descriptions or any component thereof. In one embodiment, the protection attributes may be specified by a binary value that indicates the user's desire to permit others access to such data. One technique to implement the protection attribute is to include a protection attribute as a primitive attribute that is contained by all relevant parts of the user description scheme.","Descriptors and description schemes for browsing preferences may be aligned with particular types of multimedia summary description schemes that are contained in ISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC29\/WG11 N3246, \u201cMPEG-7 Generic AV Description Schemes, Working Draft v2.0\u201d, Noordwijkerhout, March 2000. This allows the user to specify the type of a particular visual summary of an audiovisual program, and the duration of a summary that is in the form of a visual highlight. However, after further consideration the present inventors have determined that specification of the preferred minimum and maximum amount of data permitted in an audiovisual summary significantly enhances the system capability. Such a provision provides, for example, the capability of the user effectively browsing audiovisual summaries of content over channels with limited bandwidth and using terminals with different limitations. With a terminal connected to a bandwidth limited channel, the user may specify preference for a relatively short highlight of the program, while with a terminal that is connected to a higher bandwidth channel, the user may specify preference for a longer highlight of the program. Such a set of channels may be mobile channels and cable channels. In addition, for terminals that are not capable of displaying frames at a video rate, the user may prefer keyframe summaries consisting of a maximum number of keyframes appropriate for the communication channel bandwidth. To achieve these enhancements, the present inventors propose using descriptors in the browsing preferences description (and description scheme, or other preferences description) specifying the minimum, maximum, and exact number of keyframes, and minimum, maximum, and exact duration of audio and\/or visual highlights.","As described, the description scheme is adaptable to express the preferred minimum and maximum amount of visual material to adapt to different viewing preferences as well as terminal and communication channel bandwidth limitations. This implementation may be achieved by the following descriptors included in the browsing preferences description scheme: MaxNumOfKeyframes, MinNumOfKeyframes, NumOfKeyframes, MaxSummaryDuration, MinSummaryDuration, and SummaryDuration. The MaxNumOfKeyframes and MinNumofKeyframes preference descriptors specify, respectively, the maximum and minimum number of keyframes in the keyframe-summary of a video program. Depending on the known bandwidth conditions of a known connection that the user uses regularly, he or she may specify these descriptors. The MaxSummaryDuration and MinSummaryDuration descriptors specify, respectively, the maximum and minimum temporal duration of an audiovisual highlight summary. Again, depending on user's taste, terminal, and channel limitations, the user may specify these descriptors. The MaxSummaryDuration and MinSummaryDuration descriptors apply to preferences for audio signals as well as where audio highlights may have been generated by audio skimming methods. User's browsing preference descriptions may be correlated with media descriptions by a filtering agent  in  in order to determine media descriptions that contain summary descriptions that match user's preference descriptions and provide the user the associated summarized media in the preferred type of summary.","An additional descriptor that may be introduced is an abstraction fidelity descriptor for universal multimedia access application, where fidelity of a summary abstraction of a program is described. This can correspond to the variation fidelity descriptor defined in ISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC29 WG11 N3246, \u201cMPEG-7 Multimedia Description Schemes, Working Draft v2.0\u201d, Noordwijkerhout, March 2000. This provides an alternative to the explicit specification of the duration and bounds on the number of keyframes. A Segment Theme descriptor(s) may describe the preferred theme, or point of view, of a segment, e.g., a video or audio clip, annotated with its theme or emphasis point. For example, the theme may specify characteristics of the content of the theme. Such characterization may include a goal from your favorite team, 3-point shots from your favorite player, etc. Specifying these descriptor(s) and also ranking them enables a client application or a server to provide to the user segments according to preferred themes (and\/or their ranking) matching to the their labels or descriptors at the segment level, or provide users with pre-assembled highlights composed of segments with labels matching the SegmentTheme preference.","Existing filtering and search user preference descriptions are directed to techniques of using the audiovisual content in an effective manner by finding, selecting and consuming the desired audiovisual material, while focusing on the content of the audiovisual materials. While such descriptions are beneficial, the present inventors came to the further realization that the identification of the source of the material, in contrast to merely its content, provides beneficial information for the processing and presentation of the audiovisual materials. For example, the source of the content may be from terrestrial sources, digital video disc, cable television, analog broadcast television, digital broadcast television, analog radio broadcasts, and digital radio broadcasts. The inclusion of this information permits the user to select among these different sources and increase effectiveness by narrowing down the choices to those sources that are available to the user, such as terrestrial broadcast which is more widely available than satellite broadcast. For example, user may describe user's preference for \u201cStar Trek\u201d episodes that are available from terrestrial broadcast channels only.","This source distinction and identification may be performed by including a source preferences description scheme under the filtering and search preferences description scheme (or other description scheme).

This provides robustness against changes in the preference value descriptor automatically, for example, by an agent.","The filtering and search preferences description may also contain a description of a preferred review to express user's desire for searching for programs that are favorably reviewed by specific individuals. For example, preference for movies reviewed by movie critics Siskel and Ebert and found to be \u201ctwo-thumbs-up\u201d may be described and included in the filtering and search preferences description. An overview of the entire description scheme is shown in . With the ever increasing amount of available media, such as audio, image, and videos, it becomes increasingly more difficult for a user to select desirable media for subsequent consumption. The user may manually peruse program listings to select the desired material. However, the manual selection of media from an exhaustive program listing is time consuming and inefficient.","As previously discussed, a description scheme, such as those for the user, programs, and system, provides a structure within which is captured information regarding (1) the user's preferences, (2) the system, and (3) the programs themselves. By processing the information contained within the user's usage description scheme and the program description scheme of available programs, the system may determine those programs that are most likely desirable to the particular user. The processing by the system for such information may be referred to as an agent.","Existing agents are focused on correlating a limited number of user preference descriptors with a limited number of program descriptors. The designer of such agents manually determines, and hard codes into the agent, predetermined interrelationships which are likely to result in identifying desired programs. As such, the mapping between the user preference descriptors and the program descriptors includes a static model because such designers are under the belief that the domain of data fields is a fixed predetermined set, and therefore the relationships between the potential combinations of relevant data is likewise a fixed predetermined set. For example, the \u201cactor\u201d in the user preference and the \u201cactor\u201d in the program descriptor may be a relevant potential combination. The traditional focus for designing such static agents avoids the problematical dilemma of how to interpret and process an arbitrarily complex set of preferences.","Maintaining the traditional focus of avoiding an arbitrarily complex set of user preferences, commercial products such as TiVO and Replay TV, permit the specification of a first preference, such as a particular actor. The user may further attempt a more specific search by searching for a first preference, a second preference, and additional preferences. While this results in identifying the desired programs, it is a time consuming and frustrating process for the user. Like the static agents, the TiVO and Replay TV devices have a limited set of permitted search queries.","While such static models of the interrelationships is readily easy to implement, it results in a system that is unable to process interrelationships that are not foreseen by the agent designer. The present inventors came to the realization that all of the potentially desirable interrelationships, especially for an arbitrarily complex set of preference criteria, can not be effectively programmed using the traditional static model.","Referring to , a filter agent  receives or otherwise has access to at least one program description  and at least one user preference description . Each program description  may also, if desired, include meta-data associated with the actual consumable program media. Also, the user preference description  contains selection criteria for the information contained within the meta-data. The output of the filter agent  is a subset of the received program descriptions  that have been selected, and tailored if needed, in accordance with the user preference description .","Referring to , the filter agent  receives the user preference description  and interprets the information contained within the user preference description  at block  using information from a mapping table . The filter agent  also builds a model, such as a combinatorial model, of the user criteria indicating the desired user criteria at block  using information from the mapping table . The resulting model or otherwise set of criteria, is then applied against the available program descriptions  at block  to select the desired programs. Each of the selected programs include a rich set of associated data which may then be applied against user criteria at block  to further refine the data by extracting desirable sub-portions of each program. Each of the selected programs may further be cloned at block  together with the desired sub-portion of each program, and the resulting tailored instances are output from the filter agent .","Referring to , a Program Description may be composed of a hierarchy of individual descriptions. The hierarchy implies relationships amongst the individual description elements including composition, type-of, and other relationships. The particular structure of the input Program Descriptions vary, and are typically generated and provided by a commercial provider. The output Program Descriptions may be, for example, copies of the selected input instances, portions of the selected input instances, or are modified clones of the input instances. In the case of modified clones, the clones should describe a subset of the program media that meets the user's preferences, and exclude the portion that the user does not desire, or is not feasible to process for other reasons, such as bandwidth. It is to be understood that the output may omit cloning, if desired.","Referring , the User Preference Description may include primitive elements that describe individual or multiple preferences. The individual preferences may be generally defined in terms of \u201cname:value\u201d pairs. The name component is one of a set of Preference Names. The domain of the value depends on the name, such as codes and free form text.","The individual preference may be a single preference test (or multiple preference). It is to be understood that the individual preferences are not limited to tests. For example, the User Preferences may describe the desired configuration for presentation, such as volume or any other functionality. Each preference test describes some aspect or attribute of the Program Description that is to be evaluated. If desired, the preference test may be limited to the smallest granularity of a test that may be executed on the Program Description. A common preference test is a comparison of a Program Description element's value to the preference value. It is also to be understood that the preference tests need not be directly associated with the value of a corresponding element, if any, of the Program Description. For example, a single User Preference element, indicating a desired number of key-frames to be shown, may be tested against the count of elements in the Program Description representing (or describing) a key-frame. In general, the pair (title: title_value) will compare the title element value of the Program Description to title_value.","After further consideration, the present inventors came to the realization that the individual preferences may include composite relationships. Moreover, the relationships may include duplicate fields, such as several instances of \u201cname\u201d in either the user preferences and\/or the Program Descriptions. With the inclusion of composite relationships it becomes difficult to determine an appropriate technique for queries, where duplicate individual preferences are at the same or different hierarchy levels. In addition, it is difficult to determine how to interpret queries that provide multiple matching results (such as several instances of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d) or inconsistent matching entries (such as several instances of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and a lack of an instance of \u201cComedy\u201d). For example, referring to , if the user uses a query involving multiple preference names, and the query results in several potential matches, it is difficult to determine if an appropriate program has been located or which portion of an appropriate program is suitable. As shown in , the preference with name A is composed of one instance of name B and two instances of name C, each of which may include the same or different names.","Referring to  an example of a portion of a User Preference Description is illustrated. This portion of a user preference description illustrates a hierarchy of a \u201ccreator\u201d that has the \u201crole\u201d of \u201cauthor\u201d with the name of \u201cThomas\u201d \u201cAquinas\u201d. In addition, the hierarchy may be used as the path to define the interrelationships.","The normal behavior of a location path is to retrieve the single data from this node in the program. One potential enhancement is to allow this data to be manipulated and combined with other related nodes to form a composite value.","One example is when evaluating a media review rating, three numerical values may be provided, namely, RatingValue, WorstRating, and BestRating. A composite value for media review rating may be calculated as ((RatingValue)\u2212(WorstRating))\/((BestRating)\u2212(WorstRating)).","Another example may include the test of Keyword preferences against the Title or Description fields by concatenating these two fields. A composite value might be calculated as (CreationDescription\/TextAnnotation) & (Title\/TitleText). It is noted that these two fields use relative paths from the parent \u201cCreation\u201d element.","Yet another example may include a single preference data manipulated to adjust its value numerically, or its text may be translated into a target language.","The composite values provide defaults for any of the calculated elements. This is useful for defining the default range of a media review rating. It is also useful for inserting identity values (e.g. 1, 0, \u201c \u201d) when the absence of an element should not make the test fail.","The Preference Description may make user of built-in composite values. An example of built-in composite value may be based on the environment of the viewer. For instance, a portion of a Preference Description may define time of day ranges when the user wants the associated preferences to be evaluated. The target location could be defined as a composite value of built-in type \u201cTimeOfDay\u201d.","Referring to , the present inventors have determined that a mapping table of the User Preferences and the input Program Descriptions provides a robust comparison of the user preferences and the input Program Descriptions. It is to be understood that the mapping table may be any type of data structure, as desired. The first column (\u201cname\u201d) of the mapping table includes the name of one or more of the user preferences.  illustrates the inclusion of the user preferences of . Each node, generally referred to by name, of an individual preference to be tested has an ancestry path associated with it. The second column (\u201clocation\u201d) of the mapping table includes the name of one or more of the input Program Descriptions. Alternatively, portions of the path or even single elements of the path may be specified in the table, if desired. For example,the Creator\/Individual\/FamilyName preference in  has a path of \/FilteringAndSearchPreferences\/CreationPreferences\/Creator\/Individual\/FamilyName. This path is decomposed and resolved, piece by piece, using the \u201cLocation\u201d column (e.g., field) in the Mapping Table. The result of decomposing and resolving the user preference path results in a corresponding path within the Program Description resolved from entries in column two. For example, the resulting location path for this test may be \u201c\/Program\/CreationMetaInformation\/Creation\/Creator\/Individual\/FamilyName\u201d.","Common names, such as \u201cCountry\u201d used at multiple locations, may be distinguished by including all or part of the ancestry path. For example, the following two preference tests have the same \u201cleaf\u201d name, but it may be desirable to have different tests for each. This may be done by specifying more of the ancestry in the Name field (column 1) of the mapping table: \u201c\/FilteringAndSearchPreferences\/CreationPreferences\/CreationLocation\/Country\u201d, and \u201c\/FilteringAndSearchPreferences\/ClassificationPreferences\/Country\u201d. To distinguish between the two, the following names may be used: \u201c\/CreationLocation\/Country\u201d and \u201c\/ClassificationPreferences\/Country\u201d. In addition the preference tests may be associated with multiple entries in the Mapping Table. This permits a single test to be performed on more than one location in the Program Description.","The Location field may include various wildcards to expand or restrict the target paths to be evaluated in the Program Description. For example, a \u201c*\u201d wildcard implies that there may be multiple instances of the given location under one parent, e.g., \/Creation\/*Creator implies that there may be multiple Creators under the Creation parent. A \u201c#xxx\u201d wildcard restricts the target path to the xxx instance of the given location under its parent, e.g., \/Creation\/#002Creator restricts the target path to the second instance of Creator under Creation. A double forward slash \u201c\/\/\u201d indicates a node of the target path which may be used as a base path for groups of tests which must be constrained to evaluate from the same common location. In particular, this is useful for Constrained-AND operations, described later. The preference paths may be used to build target locations in the program. These preference paths may also allow preference paths to be interpreted as locations. Composite values may be defined for these preference path locations.","Syntax for a default preference and a default location may be provided. This allows updates in the preference or program definition to be handled by the filter agent without requiring changes to the mapping table.","The default mapping elements may be specified for a limited set of preference branches to bound the default mapping to a safe portion of the user preferences.","For instance, the default element \u201cFilteringAndSearchPreferences\/CreationPreferences\/UserDefinedPreference\/.*\u201d may place a default mapping that can only map to elements in the program beneath the \u201cProgram\/CreationMetaInformation\/Creation\u201d branch.","The third column \u201cTestOp\u201d of the Mapping Table includes what comparison to perform between the corresponding user preference path (column 1) and (resolved) input Program Description location (column 2). In this manner, the Mapping Table provides a convenient manner of identifying the interrelationships between the corresponding data from the user preferences and input Program Descriptions. For instance, the \u201cFamilyName\u201d preference in  has a test operator of substring-case-insensitive when compared with \u201c\/*FamilyName\u201d. Test operators may yield a discrete result, such as true or false, they may yield a range of values, or any other desired data. In particular results that span a range of values provide the advantage that filtered programs may be sorted according to the resultant \u201csimilarity\u201d value. This provides the user with a ranked output that they may select from. Also, user preferences may be \u201csoftened\u201d to pass programs that are near matches to the specific preference criteria. This fuzzy approach may allow the user preference description to more clearly model the user's intended criteria. In cases where the entry is always a parent (composed of children preference tests) the test operator may be NA (not applicable). An exemplary set of test operators are illustrated in .","After the individual preferences are interpreted into individual preference tests, these tests may be combined into a single test that models the user's preferences. The preferred technique includes combining the individual preference tests according to their hierarchy. Each parent test becomes the combination of its children tests, and this continues up to the root preference, yielding in effect one composite test. The combination of \u201cchildren\u201d tests within a single \u201cparent\u201d may be broken down into the combination of similar tests and the combination of dissimilar tests. Similar tests may have the same name or otherwise be associated in the Mapping Table such as by being on the same row. Also, dissimilar tests may have different entries in the Mapping Table.","It is to be understood that the concept of inter group and intra group interrelations relates to any comparison between different sets of data, whether or not they include a hierarchical scheme. As an example, intragroup may be used to define a group of similar tests. Also, any scheme may be implemented to form comparisons or groupings for the testing of data.","If desired, the mapping table, which may be any type of data structure or otherwise to simply express the desired operations to be performed, may be expanded to include additional functionality. For example, specific groupings of user preference may be denoted, to specify additional operations to be performed on the elements of the group that are separate from the inter group and intra group operations. These specific groupings may provide additional flexibility for combining individual preference tests. The combinatorial operations applied to these groups may be performed before, after or instead of the general inter group and intra group combinatorial operations.","For instance, entries in the mapping table may be explicitly linked together with a shared index, and a specific combinatorial operator may be mapped to each indexed group. The UserPreferences elements may likewise be explicitly linked together with a shared index. The latter two groups and operators present an alternative method to generate the arbitrarily complex combinations, without using one of the four methods for generating all typical permutations, shown in . A preferred sequence for performing the various combinatorial operations might be intra group operation, followed by indexed group operation, followed by inter group operation.","In addition to explicitly defined indexed groups, other groupings may be built-in. For instance, a program description may have attributes associated with it. The user preferences that are mapped to this program description and its associated attributes may be grouped together in a so-called attribute group, and a specific combinatorial operator may be mapped to this attribute group. For example, the program description element, TitleText, may have a language attribute associated with it. A user preference, KeywordPreferences, may be mapped to TitleText and a separate user preference may be mapped to the language attribute of TitleText. These two user preferences may be grouped together into the following attribute group, and the results to these two tests may be combined in an attribute group combinatorial operation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0217","num":"0222"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Location","AttrGroupOperation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["KeywordPreferences@xml.","Title\/TitleText@xml.","AND"]},{"entry":["lang","lang",{}]},{"entry":["KeywordPreferences","Title\/TitleText","AND"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0223"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Location","MultiMapGroupOperation"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["PersonName","Creator\/GivenName","OR"]},{"entry":["PersonName","Creator\/FamilyName","OR"]},{"entry":["PersonName","Creator\/ProfessionalName","OR"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Referring to , exemplary examples of combinatorial operators are listed. Several of the combinatorial operators (notably SAND, SUM, FREQ, and RATIO) provide \u201csoft\u201d combinations that can be used to yield non-zero results, even when some of the individual preference tests in the combination are zero. These soft combinations are useful when a group of program descriptions are to be evaluated, but one or more nodes in the group does not exist. In this manner, the result will be a diminished, but non-zero value.","For example, the SAND operator provides a soft AND combination of its constituent elements by applying a transformation to the input values before they are combined. This may transform a zero input to a non-zero value. Additionally, the combination operation may be a non-linear function that will increase or decrease the result, related to a strict AND combination.","Another set of combinatorial operators are soft maximum and soft minimum operators. In the typical maximum or minimum operation, only one of the combined individual preference tests determines the combined result value. In contrast, the soft minimum operator and soft maximum operator allows other non-contributing individual preference test results to adjust the final combined result. Typically, the adjustment is a minor amount, e.g., +\u221210 percent. The purpose of the soft maximum\/minimum operators is shown in the example where a user prefers program which contain A or B. IF a program with A and a program with A and B were available, the typical maximum operator would rank both programs equally, whereas the soft maximum operator would rank the program containing A and B above the program containing only A. A similar result occurs from the soft minimum.","Another combinatorial operator is an average, which averages a set of scores resulting from a plurality of tests.","One combination for dissimilar preference tests is under a single parent. Each entry in the Mapping table has a field that defines how this type of preference test should be combined with different type preference tests under the same parent. This type of test may be referred to as inter group combinatorial operator (InterOperator).","Referring to , this example illustrates a parent test with four dissimilar \u201cleaf\u201d test children. Two of the leaf tests have InterOperator AND. These two tests are evaluated independently, then their results are AND'd together. The other two leaf tests have InterOperator OR. These two tests are evaluated independently, then their results and the AND'd sub-result are all OR'd together to form the parent test result.","The rules for combining dissimilar tests (with the operator mappings of OR and AND) may be:\n\n","In many cases, preference tests of the same type under a single parent will have a specific desired combination for those preferences before they are combined with the other different children of that parent. Each entry in the Mapping Table has a field that defines how this type of preference test should be combined with similar type preference tests under the same parent. This may be referred to as the intra group combinatorial operator (IntraOperator). Referring to , the parent test has four dissimilar children and four pairs of similar children. The similar children are first combined into intra groups using either respective IntraOperator. Then the intra group results are combined with the other groups and tests using their respective InterOperator.","The rules for combining similar and dissimilar tests (with the operator mappings of OR and AND) may be, for example:\n\n","The general case of intra group combinations shown in  has the special default case shown in . This simplified approach supports the most common intra group operation, OR'ing and the most common inter group operation, AND'ing. One of the advantages of the approach of  is that the most common operations are supported with reduced constructs, and other combinations are supported by duplicating the hierarchy as necessary. The default mapping allows field updates to the User Preferences Description schema without requiring a change to the application or Mapping Table.","An example of a default mapping may include defining a parent (e.g., node) in the user preference that maps to a parent (e.g., node) in the Program Description and setting a \u201cdefault\u201d comparison between the two. In the event that an additional child user preference is added to the parent in the hierarchal tree then this child is automatically mapped to a corresponding child of the parent in the hierarchal tree of the Program Description. Preferably the two children have the same name to simplify identification.","The example illustrated in  show the four permutations for combining two leaf tests that may be of type A or B, namely, AND dissimilar types, OR similar types, OR dissimilar types, and AND similar types. In addition, these leaf tests could also be parent tests themselves, composed of their own sub-hierarchy. The simplified approach relies on there being a layer (below the topmost layer) that has IntraOperator AND, while the rest of the hierarchy further down uses IntraOperator OR. This supports combining similar or dissimilar tests by merely going up in the hierarchy a sufficient number of levels.","The location mappings described in the Mapping Table yield global paths that start from the root node in the Program Description (\u201c\/Program\u201d). Some preference tests may require support for a relative path. A special form of the InterOperator AND is defined which constrains a group of tests to be performed on the same element or parent element in the Program Description. This is defined as a Constrained-AND (CAND) combinatorial operator.","The constrained operation has a base path and multiple tests. The base path defines the starting node for all the predicate tests to be performed from. In the general example illustrated in , the parent of the three Constrained-AND tests is \u201cP\u201d. The mapped location for \u201cP\u201d in the Program Description is the base path, which resolves to \u201cr\/s\/t\/p\u201d. Therefore, for each instance of \u201cr\/s\/t\/p\u201d in the Program Description, the children elements \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\/z\u201d are tested by \u201cX\u201d, and the two \u201cY\u201d tests.","A user trying to find programs on stuffed pasta might create the following profile fragment:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0253"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"343pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<Creation>"},{"entry":"\u2003<CreationDescription xml:lang=en>Victoria Secrets models women's underwear<\/CreationDescrition>"},{"entry":"\u2003<CreationDescription xml:lang=es>El Secreto de Victoria se demuestra los calzones de mujer<\/CreationDescrition>"},{"entry":"<\/Creation>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The example shown in  depicts the Constrained-AND operator used for the Creator preference. A special syntax in the Mapping Table indicates that the base path is \u201c\/Program\/CreationMetaInformation\/Creation\/\/Creator\u201d. Therefore, the predicate tests are performed against the node instances of \u201cCreator\u201d. The first Program Description examples passes this Constrained-AND test, while the second fails. Notice that the second Program Description would have passed a test that was composed of regular AND operators and their global paths.","As shown in , if all the CAND's were all regular AND's, then the User Preference would be asking:\n\n","As shown in , with the defined CAND's, the User Preference is asking:\n\n","Referring to , a general example demonstrates Inter Operators, Intra Operators, and Constrained Operators. The rules for combining the tests may be, for example:\n\n","An illustrative example of one embodiment of the technique described herein includes the example illustrated in  together with the resulting Mapping Table illustrated in . It is noted that the default for InterOp\/IntraOp operations are AND\/OR. It is also noted that the preferences just below the highest level (CreationPreferences, ClassificationPreferences, SummaryPreferences) are AND\/AND. Also some of the composite preferences such as Creator have child preferences that are CAND\/OR. Further, the multiple Filtering And Search Preferences may be distinguished by Preference Type attributes. The IntraOp for multiple Filtering And Search Preferences and multiple Browsing Preferences is specified.","The multiple User Preference elements may contain a ranking attribute. Such ranking attributes may be applied at each comparison test and each combinatorial operation, to yield a composite ranking score, this may be utilized to provide a sorted test result for the user.","Referring to , the user preference hierarchy of (name:value) pairs may be supplemented with attributes regarding the intended combination of individual preference tests. As shown in , the supplementation may indicate that the two tests of type A should be AND'd together and this result OR'd with the other tests under this parent. The primary advantage of this supplemental enhancement is that the user preference description may override the default behavior for specific tests. This makes interpretation of the user preference description more flexible so that it may be tailored to the user's specific preference criteria.","The discrete implementation of the filter agent will yield as output a group of program descriptions that are merely members of the input set. The output group may actually just be a list of the input Program Descriptions that passed the selections. However, there can be components of the User Preference Descriptions that are well suited to extract a subset of the whole Program Description that yields an output more tailored to the user's preference criteria. For instance, the user may request a maximum number of key frames in order to prevent overloading the bandwidth capabilities of their system.","The process of cloning the selected input Program Descriptions and modifying them to include a particular desired subset by the user may achieve enhanced benefits. The modified Program Description is a clone of the input because it refers to the same base set of Program Media. However, it is modified to refer to the subset of the Program Media that is desired by the particular user. In some cases this may result in smaller quantity of the program being available. In other cases, this may result in different summaries of the program, though it refers to the full program.","The cloned Program Description provides a more succinct representation of what the user prefers. In this manner, it may not be necessary to annotate or provide additional identifiers to describe what the user actually desires.","In a modular implementation, the filter agent may not be closely coupled with the media manager and the presentation processes. In this case, the cloned Program Description offers a standardized format for describing the desired program, without having to create a new syntax or an application programming interface (API).","The cloned Program Description may also be used to create a \u201cpull\u201d for Program Media that will yield only the desired portions of the media. This provides a convenient technique for a media provider to provide to the user only that specific media that is desired.","A service provider may likewise provide service to the user according to the user's preference where service includes a modified cloned program description. The cloned description may be a subset of the complete \u201crich\u201d program description that is usually maintained by the service provider. The clone may contain varying levels of \u201crichness\u201d. This permits the provider to offer various service levels to its clients.","The cloned Program Description also allows the customer and\/or service provider to tailor the amount of material that will be transmitted to the customer. This enables the quantity of material to be matched to the available memory in the client device and the available bandwidth of the delivery channel.","The cloned program descriptions may provide a memory efficient way of storing descriptions of selected programs in the client's local storage.","One technique to achieve cloning is cloning by \u201caddition\u201d, as illustrated in . The core elements of a Program Description are identified and copied into the clone. These items typically include the root \u201c\/Program\u201d element, the \u201c\/MediaInformation\u201d, etc. To this core set, the extractor adds the desired components for the user. Also, some adjustment may be necessary to resolve interdependencies of the extracted elements. For example, the Program Description may contain elements or groups of elements that are extensions or refinements of other elements in the Program Description. These extension elements may refer to the base elements without actually duplicating the base elements. In this instance, if the extractor should extract the extension elements but not the base elements then all the base elements must be inserted into the closed Program Description to make it accurate.","Another technique to achieve cloning is cloning by \u201cdeletion\u201d, as illustrated in . The entire input Program Description is cloned for the output. The extractor then builds a list of the desired components that are to be retained in the output. Then, optional elements are identified in the clone. If these optional elements are not included in the list of elements to be retained, then they are deleted. Thereafter, some adjustments may be necessary to resolve interdependencies of the extracted elements, as previously described. One advantage of cloning by deletion over cloning by addition is that it is less susceptible to changes in the Program Description. Items that are not explicitly listed as being optional will be passed on. In effect, this method errs on the side of passing too much data, while cloning by addition errs on the side of passing too little.","A vast amount of audiovisual material exists from which the user may select appropriate audiovisual materials that may be of interest. However, there needs to be developed effective techniques to determine which audiovisual materials are most likely appropriate for a particular user. Typically these techniques include the use of an agent that compares in some manner the user's preferences to the audiovisual content. Existing agents typically offer rudimentary preference weighting techniques based upon preference items such as title, keyword, author, and cast. The weighting scheme determines to what extent a particular set of user preferences matches the description of the different audiovisual materials, such as a binary yes\/no determination. After determining the extent to which the user preferences matches a particular audiovisual material an overall score is calculated. After computing the overall score for each of the audiovisual materials they may be ranked in order from which the user may select desirable material. However, the use of such a technique makes it difficult to distinguish between programs that are strongly desired versus fringe programs that the user may be rarely interested in. An effective agent should include a technique for identifying priority interests and a mechanism for sorting the priority interests. In essence, the audiovisual content should be distinguished in a meaningful manner.","Referring to , the input to a filter agent  may include program descriptions  relating to one or more audio, video, or audiovisual (collectively referred to as audiovisual without limitation) materials . The filter agent  also receives user preference descriptions , typically from a user agent , which may be hierarchical if desired. The filter agent  based upon the user preference descriptions  and the program descriptions  provides selected audiovisual materials , which may be rated if desired. The selected audiovisual materials may be provided to a user agent  and then to the user, if desired. The user agent  may create the user preference profile. Alternatively, the user or other party may utilize an authoring tool or automatic profile generator to create the user preference profile.","Referring to , a collection of related preferences may form a single preference template  (e.g., comedies with Eddie Murphy). The user agent  may create a group of one or more preference templates  that are evaluated to present the user with filtered and ranked programs. Each component of a preference template that may carry a preference value (PV) attribute may be referred to as a preference element (or node) . A container (or parent)  preference element has children preference elements . A parent may also have an individual preference test. Leaf preference elements  are those that do not have children and may refer to an individual preference test (e.g., genre is comedy).","Referring to , the values defined by the preference value may take one or more values, such as for example, nominal value , neutral value , maximum value , and minimum value . It is to be understood that the preference values may take on other values. The neutral value  is preferably zero or some other predefined value representative of a neutral preference or indifference to programs with the associated preference. Typically, preference values with a neutral value (or null set) are not included in the resulting classification or scoring of the associated audiovisual content. The nominal value  preferably has a value other than zero, or some other predefined value, representative of a desire or disdain for programs with the associated preference. In essence, the nominal value  indicates which programs are desirable by the user and which programs are not desired by the user. In this manner, programs which are desirable are more likely provided to the user, while programs that contain disdained content will be more likely not provided to the user. The nominal value  may be a constant value or otherwise a range of values to indicate a relative desire or disdain for particular content. Preferably, the user agent  or filter agent  provides a default value for the nominal values , so that the user does not have to explicitly define each of the nominal values. The user may define any of the nominal values , as desired. Preferably, there is not a predefined maximum value  or minimum value . Conceptually, a maximum value may represent that the user agent wants programs with a particular preference to always be selected and ranked highest. Similarly, a minimum value might represent that the user agent wants programs with a particular preference to always be rejected. In both of these cases the user agent may effectively simulate the maximum and minimum concept by selecting the value appropriately (e.g., +\/\u22121,000,000).","The user preference description may include a hierarchy of preferences, many of which include preference value attributes. When each \u201cindividual preference\u201d is evaluated against the corresponding information from the program descriptions a score is calculated for that individual preference. In one embodiment, the hierarchy of preferences for an individual hierarchy may be evaluated by creating a composite score from the aggregation of individual scores within the hierarchy. The resulting composite score is then compared against other composite scores for other program descriptions to determine a relative ranking. The composite score for a particular program description may be determined free from consideration of other program descriptions, if desired.","While a composite score provides a relatively good measure for the desirability for any particular media, especially when compared against other composite scores, the present inventor determined that the resulting relative composite scores may be misleading of the desirability of the content. For example, a particular audiovisual program may have only a limited occurrence of a particular event or item, in which case the composite score will likely consider that limited occurrence as being fully present in the program. However, a different audiovisual program may have frequent occurrences of a particular event or item, in which case the composite score will likely merely consider that frequent occurrence in the same manner as the limited occurrence. Accordingly, it may be preferable to rank programs at an intermediate level, described later. Also, it is not preferable to combine the preference values into a single composite preference value. Instead, each score, which is evaluated using its associated preference value, is combined into a composite score. When examining a user preference, it may be useful to combine one or more of the preference values, but this is actually combining the resultant scores when the preference is found to match a corresponding program description attribute. Also, it is likewise preferable not to compare a score against a preference value. Rather, the score is the result of the actual test considered with the preference value, and this score should be compared against other scores or against implementation-fixed thresholds.","There are preferably at least two distinct processes occurring when the filter agent  processes a user preference . One process is the filtering of programs (pass or reject). The other process is the scoring and ranking of the selected programs into an ordered list (e.g., from most preferred to least preferred). The ranking values may be any type of indication, as desired. These two processes may be implemented by a variety of functions (e.g. filtering-function \u03b5 {Boolean-AND, Boolean-OR, etc. }, ranking-function \u03b5 {MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, etc.}). These two processes may be distinct, such as, filter then rank, or rank then filter, or they may be integrated, namely, simultaneously filter and rank. In the hierarchical combination of user preferences, each combinatorial operator (AND, OR, etc) preferably implements some form of a filtering function and a ranking function. There may be a family of varieties of the AND and OR operators (or other operators) which implement different filtering and ranking functions.","Programs may be ranked according to their respective scores, which is a relative relationship. The preference values and scores may be scaled without changing the result of the filter agent . The definition of a zero neutral value (or other value) sets a point for the filtering of programs based on score results. Depending on the filtering function, programs with a score above zero (or other value) may be passed and programs with zero or a negative score (or other value) may be rejected. The definition of the nominal value does not set an absolute significance for preference values and scores. The nominal value merely sets the default value that may then be compared (relatively) to other preference values and scores.","The preference values may likewise be more than simply a number to provide further refinement of the selection process. The preference values may take the form of relativistic operations that compare different portions of the user preferences and multiple program descriptions at a level less than the entire program description. In this manner, portions of the program descriptions may be compared to one another which provides significantly improved results. A set of scenarios are provided to illustrate exemplary comparisons that may be implemented by the filter agent .","Each comparison may vary according to any suitable criteria, such as, for example, the following criteria:\n\n","Referring to , the test case for each example may be evaluated as follows:\n\n","Referring to , a single (or multiple) branch combining sibling leaf elements (or other elements) using an OR'ing combination is illustrated.

In order to provide a usable technique to select desirable multimedia, typically the system limits the set of choices available to the user by constructing and maintaining a user profile, which provides a compact description of a user's interests and personal preferences. This user profile is subsequently used to (a) filter input content, so that programs or items that the user has shown interest in are presented to the user, and\/or (b) request from a content distribution service the programs of interest. If desired, the user profile may be specified directly by the user, who explicitly states the descriptions of the programs he\/she is interested in. Alternatively, user profiles can be automatically generated and updated to match content consumption behavior of users by recording and subsequently analyzing usage history information. Furthermore, content providers (broadcasters and advertisers) can use the usage history information to accurately determine consumer response to, and ratings of, specific programs; to provide personalized content to individuals based on their preferences; and develop various content access, billing, and compensation models for consumers and content creators\/owners.","Existing systems for selecting multimedia content focus on collecting a limited amount of information as part of the usage history. The list of available actions and content description items provided by these systems is not suitable for extension as new requirements and applications arise. Furthermore, there is a lack of standardized formats for representation of (multimedia) usage history information; hence the usage history data collected by a certain type of device or service cannot often be utilized directly by others. Additionally, usage history has traditionally been considered only as a tool for generating user preferences and profiles. Further, existing systems provide no technique to record usage history in terms of both individual user actions and detailed categorized lists.","After consideration of the existing limitations with respect to the selection of multimedia content the present inventors developed a system for collecting and describing usage history information of one or more users in a much improved manner. The improved system allows non-intrusive observation of user actions over a period of time, enabling collection of consumption-related data without explicit user input. The period of time may be specified, modified, or otherwise dynamic, as desired. The collected usage history provides a list of the actions carried out by the user over a period of time, if desired, as well as statistical information with respect to the content descriptions, if desired. The content descriptions for the system may be custom for the particular system, standard multimedia descriptions, and may be in any format desired. In particular, descriptions may be in the form of a standard description (such as those defined by the MPEG-7, TV-Anytime Forum, ATSC-PSIP or DVB-SI) that accompanies the input content. The descriptions may also be provided as an auxiliary service, such as electronic program guides provided by cable services and Internet sites like Gist.com and TVGuide.com.","The collected usage history information is preferably expressed in a compact, structured, and consistent format. These properties permit efficient and effective exchange of usage history information between various devices, platforms, applications, service providers, equipment and such, thereby increasing the likelihood of interoperability between these entities.","The preferred implementation uses a description scheme\/XML-based approach for describing the content usage history of a user over a period of time. The description schemes define a syntax and semantics for specifying usage history descriptions; i.e. description schemes for usage histories include a sets of rules to which an individual usage history description should comply. Descriptors are generally referred to as attributes of these descriptions. The use of a common set of description schemes and descriptors also enables interoperability; that is, different devices and systems are able to interpret usage histories that comply with the description schemes. At the same time, description schemes do not need to prescribe completely how an application should use the information embedded in the description, for instance, applications are free to process a usage history description in various ways to generate a user profile. In all these aspects, the proposed system is different from existing systems, due mainly to the way of describing program and usage history information, and to the fact that it provides an exchangeable representation for interoperability. Further, the program descriptions may generate usage histories that are rather rich in content and structure. Furthermore, many different types of information can be associated with individual user actions, thereby allowing different implementations to include, configure, and customize the usage history data according to their needs without sacrificing interoperability.","The present inventors determined that the system should include the concept of a \u201cUserAction,\u201d which provides a compact yet generic and flexible representation mechanism for collecting usage history information. The list of UserAction types supported by the proposed system may be defined in terms of a thesaurus, and can thus be extended relatively easily. The thesaurus can include a diverse set of items and cover a multitude of different applications. Thus the system may track a diverse set of user activities such as retail purchases, requests for pay-per-view programming, and the like. This approach provides a significance improvement over previously introduced methods which permit a very limited number of actions to be represented, and which cannot be easily extended to address various requirements.","The time information associated with each user action may be defined in terms of the general time, which denotes the time of occurrence in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC); media time, which denotes the time information that is encoded with a piece of multimedia content; or both. This functionality allows the time information that is associated with such actions as \u201cfast forward\u201d or \u201crewind\u201d to be provided accurately.","The proposed framework facilitates the handling of a variety of multimedia content types, such as audio and video data, web pages, or content that is locally available to the consumer on his\/her electronic equipment (e.g. a DVD player or Personal Video Recorder (PVR)). This functionality may be enabled by allowing any type of action and all major content categorization methods to be represented in the history.","The system likewise facilitates the referencing functionality to allow different information sources to be associated with a particular action. This aspect of the proposed system allows the reference to a specific part of relevant content descriptions (such as the description of a segment that the user reviews in slow motion). Furthermore, content material related to an action (such as the content of a hyperlink that the user follows; the web site of a product that the user purchases; the electronic program guide which provides a listing of the programs available for the given time period; etc.) can be explicitly specified by virtue of this property.","The system also allows usage history information to be captured at different levels of detail. For example, a usage history description can contain a detailed list of all the actions the user has performed over a period of time; or basic statistical information according to certain categorizations of content, such as language, country of origin, ratings, actors, etc.; or both. This flexibility enables even systems with limited resources (e.g. in terms of available storage space) to generate standardized, exchangeable usage histories.","The structure of the usage history description scheme may be such that the captured usage history information can be arranged and presented in multiple different ways, in whatever form is most useful and efficient for the application that makes use of the history. For example, the usage history can be organized according to the type of user action (e.g. all \u201crecord\u201d actions), program genre (e.g. usage history for sports programs), or even specific programs (e.g. usage history for the program \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d)","The design may respect a user's privacy by allowing a user to hide his\/her identity from being revealed to third parties when the usage history is circulated or distributed.","The description scheme-XML based framework enables the usage history descriptions to co-exist with other description schemes (e.g., those that are included in MPEG-7, for example, Usage Preferences Description Schemes) in the very same framework. These description schemes allow functionalities to the user so that the user can consume the content in ways that fits to his\/her preferences, e.g., by consuming programs that are requested on the basis of a recurring preferred theme in the usage history.","The collected usage history information may be personalized at multiple levels of granularity; i.e. it may be defined for multiple users (such as an entire family), or for a single user. This feature expedites many applications; for example, more detailed program rating information can be collected; parents can track their children's viewing habits and more easily control their access to objectionable content; the collected information can be used to generate more personalized programming; etc.","The system is preferably free from relying on explicit user input; rather, it preferably functions in the background and collects data without prompting the user to fill out questionnaires or to respond to questions, which are often considered intrusive by users.","While explicit user input about viewing habits are not required (as noted previously), the system may support a configuration layer or tool that the user can manipulate to define the types of activity and\/or content information which he\/she would not want the system to monitor or track. The configuration utility allows the user to provide the system with a list of activities approved for collection, which implies that the user has the ultimate control over the type and extent of the information collected.","The preferred context of the system is depicted in . The usage history process  has access to rich multimedia content descriptions, which may be available directly from broadcasters , electronic program guide providers , or other services or providers. These descriptions may contain meta data associated with the consumable media. A user's actions are monitored and linked to the content descriptions by the usage history module . The generated usage history information, typically from the usage history module , may be utilized by a local profiling agent  to generate user preferences , which may in turn be used by a filtering agent  to assist the viewer in making program selections. Alternatively, the usage history information may be exchanged with a service provider , or be transferred to other devices or equipment, where it can be processed in various ways. Since the usage history is preferably expressed in a standardized format, exchange of this information is expedited and carried out without the need for further translation or modification. Using the configuration utility  the user can control the types of activities and\/or content that are monitored, and modify the settings of the usage history and\/or client appliance settings . The configuration utility  enables the user to have control over the information collected about him\/her.","Referring to , the preferred structure of the proposed system for collection and representation of usage history information is shown. The usage history process  has access to descriptions of the multimedia content that is consumed by the user. These content descriptions are typically generated by one or more commercial providers, and may be transmitted with, or separately from, the media content. The usage history process also may possess the ability to monitor the actions that the user performs on a variety of devices, such as A\/V equipment, computer terminals, set-top boxes, personal digital recorders, and the like. The monitored actions can correspond to switching between channels; changing the audio\/video settings of a device; recording a program; following a hyperlink; and so on. The set of actions monitored and logged by the usage history module is specified by the user through the configuration layer , which restricts the usage history module to collect information about authorized activities only. When approved user activity is detected, usage history process  records, for the given action, the time of occurrence; the duration (if applicable); the unique identification of the program or multimedia content that the action is associated with; and\/or additional content description information, in the UserActionHistory component . Additionally, usage history information can be represented as a categorized table using the UserChoiceHistory component . To achieve this, the content descriptions may be analyzed, and a predefined subset of these descriptions are recorded, preferably in tabulated format. The number of times a program or multimedia content of certain type (e.g. movies of \u201cWestern\u201d genre; films that star \u201cKevin Costner,\u201d etc.) is consumed by the user is tracked by the UserChoiceHistory , which acts as a collection of categorized counters. In general, the usage history  and the configuration layer  are typically processes, whereas the other items typically only contain data.","Referring to , the description schemes may be arranged as follows:\n\n","The UsageHistory Description Scheme  serves as a container description scheme for the UserActionHistory Description Scheme  and the UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme , and describes the consumption history information for a given period of time. The UserActionHistory Description Scheme  contains a list of the different types of actions performed by the user during this period of time. The UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme  contains the history of user choices with respect to the descriptions associated with the consumed content.  illustrates an entity-relationship diagram of the structure and interactions of these description schemes","The UserActionHistory Description Scheme  contains multiple user action lists, each of which may provide a temporally ordered log of a specific type of action (such as \u201crecord\u201d or \u201cplay\u201d). Associated with every action are a program identifier that uniquely identifies the program or content for which the action is defined, and also one or more action data items, which can refer to any desired piece of the content description.","The UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme  provides a counter-like functionality for categorizing each content item based on its description data. The principal purpose of this component of the UsageHistory description scheme  is to provide an alternative history representation that specifies general statistical information about the consumed content. The statistical information may be constantly or periodically updated with the descriptions that accompany the content consumed by the user. This representation is especially useful for long observation periods, when the storage requirements for logging of all user actions and (if desired) associated meta data may become inhibiting for some systems. The UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme  may include multiple parts, such as for example, five different parts:","The Classification history , may provide a history of the user's choices with respect to classification descriptions of content; such as genre, language, and country of origin;","The Creation history , may provide a history of the user's choices with respect to creation descriptions of content, such as title , location , creator , date , and actor\/director.","The Source history , may provide a history of the user's choices with respect to source (such as its publisher or distributor) and format (such as coding type) descriptions of the content.","The Summarization history , may provide the summarization-associated viewing\/consumption history for a user.","The Keyword history , may provide a history of the keywords the user has used while viewing\/consuming content.","The UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme  preferably shares a similar structure with UsagePreferences description scheme in MPEG-7 described in MPEG-7, ISO\/IEC CD 15938-5 Information Technology\u2014Multimedia Content Description Interface\u2014Part 5 Multimedia Description Schemes, N3705, La Baule, France, October 2000, incorporated by reference herein. The principal motivation for the similarity is to simplify mapping of the available history information to the standardized user preference description. However, this similarity is not intended to constrain the set of applications for user choice history, since the information in the description is generic and flexible enough to be utilized in any way desirable. Moreover, the UserChoiceHistory may be structured in any suitable manner.","It should be understood that the UsageHistory Description Scheme  serves as a structure to link all the pieces of information together. Various scenarios in different application environments exist in which not all the various parts of the UsageHistory Description Scheme  are provided together in one description, but in other cases they may be. For example, in some cases only the UserActionHistory Description Scheme may be instantiated, or parts thereof, whereas in other only UserChoiceHistory Description Scheme might be utilized to describe the usage history, or parts thereof. Also, different descriptions may share description parts through the use of identifiers and identifier references. Different parts of the scheme proposed may exist standalone descriptions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0437","num":"0491"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Name","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"UsageHistory DS Semantics"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["UsageHistoryType","Specifies user's multimedia content"]},{"entry":[{},"consumption history."]},{"entry":["UserIdentifier","Identifies the individual for whom the usage"]},{"entry":[{},"history is provided specifies.
