(PBDs), in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers having one monomer unit with a C2-C3 double bond and an aryl group at the C2 position and the second monomer unit with a C2-C3 double bond and a substituted propylene group at the C2 position, and their inclusion in targeted conjugates.","Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, et al., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and numerous synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et al., 1994, 433-465 (1994); Antonow, D. and Thurston, D. E., 2011 111 (4), 2815-2864). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, et al., 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, et al., 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et al., 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et al., 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, et al., 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et al., 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, et al., 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, et al, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et al., 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et al., 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., 25, 437-444 (1972)).

In the B-ring there is either an imine (N\u2550C), a carbinolamine (NH\u2014CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH\u2014CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In . Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDeventer, 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.","It has been previously disclosed that the biological activity of these molecules can be potentiated by joining two PBD units together through their C8\/C\u2032-hydroxyl functionalities via a flexible alkylene linker (Bose, D. S., et al., 114, 4939-4941 (1992); Thurston, D. E., et al., 61, 8141-8147 (1996)). The PBD dimers are thought to form sequence-selective DNA lesions such as the palindromic 5\u2032-Pu-GATC-Py-3\u2032 interstrand cross-link (Smellie, M., et al., 42, 8232-8239 (2003); Martin, C., et al., 44, 4135-4147) which is thought to be mainly responsible for their biological activity.

Briefly, antibodies (4-5 mg\/mL) in PBS containing 50 mM sodium borate at pH 7.4 are reduced with tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) at 37\u00b0 C. The progress of the reaction, which reduces interchain disulfides, is monitored by reaction with 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and allowed to proceed until the desired level of thiols\/mAb is achieved. The reduced antibody is then cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and alkylated with 1.5 equivalents of maleimide drug-linker per antibody thiol. After 1 hour, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. Quenched drug-linker is removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The ADC is then sterile-filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter. Protein concentration can be determined by spectral analysis at 280 nm and 329 nm, respectively, with correction for the contribution of drug absorbance at 280 nm. Size exclusion chromatography can be used to determine the extent of antibody aggregation, and RP-HPLC can be used to determine the levels of remaining NAC-quenched drug-linker.","Antibodies with introduced cysteine residues can be conjugated to Linker-Drug compounds as described in International Patent Publication WO2008\/070593, which is incorporated herein or as follows. Antibodies containing an introduced cysteine residue in the heavy chain are fully reduced by adding 10 equivalents of TCEP and 1 mM EDTA and adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Following a 1 hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the reaction is cooled to 22\u00b0 C. and 30 equivalents of dehydroascorbic acid is added to selectively reoxidize the native disulfides, while leaving the introduced cysteine in the reduced state. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 3.7) and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22\u00b0 C. The pH of the solution is then raised again to 7.4 by addition of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). 3.5 equivalents of the PBD drug linker in DMSO is placed in a suitable container for dilution with propylene glycol prior to addition to the reaction. To maintain solubility of the PBD drug linker, the antibody itself is first diluted with propylene glycol to a final concentration of 33% (e.g., if the antibody solution was in a 60 mL reaction volume, 30 mL of propylene glycol was added). This same volume of propylene glycol (30 mL in this example) is added to the PBD drug linker as a diluent. After mixing, the solution of PBD drug linker in propylene glycol is added to the antibody solution to effect the conjugation; the final concentration of propylene glycol is 50%. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and then quenched by addition of 5 equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine. The ADC is purified by ultrafiltration through a 30 kD membrane. (Note that the concentration of propylene glycol used in the reaction can be reduced for any particular PBD, as its sole purpose is to maintain solubility of the drug linker in the aqueous media.)","For halo-acetamide-based Linker-Drug compounds, conjugation can be performed generally as follows. To a solution of reduced and reoxidized antibodies (having introduced cysteines in the heavy chain) in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTPA is added 0.5 volumes of propylene glycol. A 10 mM solution of acetamide-based Linker-Drug compound in dimethylacetamide is prepared immediately prior to conjugation. An equivalent amount of propylene glycol as added to the antibody solution is added to a 6-fold molar excess of the Linker-Drug compound. The dilute Linker-Drug solution is added to the antibody solution and the pH is adjusted to 8-8.5 using 1 M Tris (pH 9). The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The conjugation is verified by reducing and denaturing reversed phase PLRP-S chromatography. Excess Linker-Drug compound is removed with Quadrasil MP resin and the buffer is exchanged into 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 5% propylene glycol using a PD-10 desalting column.","Illustrative Synthesis Schemes for Drug Linkers","The following schemes are illustrative of routes for synthesising drug linkers\u2014the PBD dimer is shown with specific substituents, and dimer links, but these may be varied within the scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0451","num":"0654"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00089","num":"00089"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00089","he":"166.54mm","wi":"158.07mm","file":"US09399073-20160726-C00089.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The glucuronide linker intermediate S1 (reference: Jeffrey et al., 2006, 17, 831-840) can be treated with diphosgene in dichlroromethane at \u221278\u00b0 C. to afford the glucuronide chloroformate, which is then reacted with the PBD dimer S2 dissolved in CHClby dropwise addition.
