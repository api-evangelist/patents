An example of the physical contact includes tapping by a pointing device such as a touch pen, a finger or the like. The touch panel D acquires various types of user's operations based on the detected physical contact. In this embodiment, the display area Da displays a web page, for example.","The receiving unit  is a part that receives a web page to be displayed in the display area Da of the touch panel D. The web page is transmitted from the web server  to the terminal  in response to a request from the terminal . The request for a web page is transmitted from the terminal  to the web server  based on selection of a link contained in a web page being displayed or another specified operation. The functions of detecting and transmitting a request for a web page may be implemented by the receiving unit  or another functional unit which is not shown. The receiving unit  transmits the received web page to the display control unit .","The display control unit  is a means of controlling display so that the web page that is input from the receiving unit  is displayed on the touch panel D. The web page is thereby displayed in the display area Da of the touch panel D.","The detecting unit  is a part that detects a user's operation on a first web page that is displayed in the display area Da based on physical contact with the display area Da. Note that, in this embodiment, the first web page is a web page that is being displayed in the display area Da, on which various types of user's operations are made. The user's operations on the web page include selection of an object displayed on the web page, changing of the display size of the web page, and scrolling of the web page.","The selection of an object displayed on the web page is detected when physical contact by a user's finger or another device is detected without accompanying a change in contact position in a specified detectable region that is set for the object in the display area Da, for example. Further, the detecting unit  acquires the coordinates of the selected position at the time of detecting the selection. The coordinates of the selected position may be any of the coordinates in the coordinate system that is set in the display area Da, the coordinates in the coordinate system that is set in a display range of the first web page and the coordinates in the coordinate system that is set in a region in which an object is displayed, for example.","Further, the detecting unit  can detect information such as which one of a plurality of specified regions that are set in a region where selection of an object is detectable. The detection processing is described with reference to .  is a diagram showing an example of setting of a range where selection of an object Athat is displayed in the display area Da is detectable. In the object A, a region M in which selection is detectable when displayed by being contained in a web page is set. In this embodiment, the region M in which selection is detectable is divided into a left-hand region Mand a right-hand region Mon the border of the near center in the horizontal direction of the object, for example. The detecting unit  can detect information such as which of the left-hand region Mand the right-hand region Mthe selected position belongs to based on the coordinates of the selected position. The detecting unit  can thereby detect that selection has been made in a region which is deviated to the left or right of the region M in which selection of the object is detectable. Note that, although the detecting unit  detects that selection has been made in a region which is deviated to the left or right of the region M in which selection is detectable, it is not limited thereto, and the detecting unit  may detect the up or down deviation of the selected position or detect both of the left or right deviation and the up or down deviation. The detecting unit  transmits information about the type of operation such as selection and at least one of the coordinates of the selected position and information about the deviation of the selected position to the operation information transmitting unit . Note that the coordinates of the selected position and the information about the display position of the object may be transmitted to the web server  through the operation information transmitting unit , and the web server  may perform the detection of the deviation of the selected position.","The coordinates of the selected position and various events on the touch panel D can be acquired by API (Application Programming Interface) specific to the terminal  or JavaScript (registered trademark), for example.","The changing of the display size of a web page is detected when a specified operation for changing the display size of a web page by a user's finger or another device is detected. For example, the scaling-up of the display size is detected when a user brings two fingers into contact with the touch panel D and moves the two fingers in the direction of separating the contact positions from each other, and the scaling-down of the display size is detected when a user moves the two fingers in the direction of making the contact positions closer to each other. The detecting unit  transmits information about the type of operation such as the scaling-up or scaling-up of the display size to the operation information transmitting unit . Note that a plurality of time-series coordinate values at the time when a specified operation is performed may be transmitted to the web server , and the web server  may detect that changing of the display size has been made.","The scrolling of a web page is detected when physical contact by a user's finger or another device is detected accompanying the movement of the contact position in a specified detectable region that is set for the object in the display area Da, for example. Further, information indicating the moving speed of the contact position may be detected at the same time. The detecting unit  transmits information about the detected scrolling to the operation information transmitting unit . Note that a plurality of time-series coordinate values at the time when the scrolling is performed may be transmitted to the web server , and the web server  may detect that scrolling has been made.","The operation information transmitting unit  is a part that transmits operation information indicating the user's operation that is detected by the detecting unit  to the web server . Hereinafter, the functional units of the web server  are described in detail with reference back to .","The acquiring unit  is a part that acquires operation information indicating the user's operation on the first web page that is displayed in the display area Da of the terminal  which is transmitted from the terminal . The acquiring unit  stores the acquired operation information into the storing unit . The storing unit  is a storing means that stores the operation information. Note that the acquiring unit  can acquire the operation information for each user of the terminal  and store the acquired operation information into the storing unit  for each user. In this case, the storing unit  stores the operation information for each user of the terminal .","The adjusting unit  is a part that adjusts the second web page which is a display target in the display area Da based on the operation information stored in the storing unit . Note that the adjusting unit  performs adjustment of the second web page for each user of the terminal .","Note that, in this embodiment, the second web page is a web page that is transmitted to the terminal  in response to a request from the terminal  and displayed in the display area Da of the terminal . The second web page is a web page that is different from the first web page, for example. As an example of such a case, it is assumed where, in the state where a link to the second web page is contained in the first web page and the first web page is displayed in the display area Da, the second web page is to be displayed in the display area Da by the selection of the link. Further, the second web page may be a web page that contains the same object as the first web page, for example. As an example of such a case, it is assumed where, after the first web page is displayed in the display area Da, a request for the web page is transmitted from the terminal  to the web server , and the web page is to be displayed again in the display area Da.","The adjusting unit  adjusts the layout of objects contained in the second web page based on the information related to the selected position of the object in the operation information. The layout processing is specifically described with reference to .  is a diagram showing an example of the case where the second web page before adjustment is displayed in the display area Da.  is a diagram showing an example of the case where the second web page after adjustment is displayed in the display area Da. The second web page contains a plurality of objects to be displayed. The objects include icons C to be operated by a user and images G not to be operated by a user.","For example, when the information about the deviation of the selected position in the region where the selection of an object is detectable is contained in the operation information, the adjusting unit  can place selectable objects which are contained in the second web page in a specified region that is set in accordance with the direction of the deviation in the display area Da. To be more specific, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information about the selection in the region which is deviated to the left or right in the region where the selection of an object is detectable from the storing unit , it places selectable objects which are contained in the second web page in the region which is deviated to the left or right in the display area Da. For example, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information indicating selection in the right-hand region Min the selection of an object shown in , it places the selectable icons C which are contained in the second web page in a right-hand display region Din the display area Da as shown in . On the other hand, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information indicating selection in the left-hand region M, it places the selectable icons C which are contained in the second web page in a left-hand display region Din the display area Da. Note that the adjusting unit  may place selectable objects which are contained in the second web page in a specified region that is deviated to the left-hand display region Dor the right-hand display region Din the display area Da when the number of acquired operation information indicating the deviation to the left or right of the selected position becomes a specified number or more.","Note that, when the information about the deviation of the selected position is not contained in the operation information and the coordinates of the selected position is contained therein, the adjusting unit  may acquire the coordinate information of the display position of the object and determine the deviation of the selected position based on a positional relationship with the coordinates of the selected position.","In the case where there is a deviation in a given direction at the selected position of the object, it is highly likely that a user holds or operates the terminal in the state where a region deviated in the direction of the deviation in the display area is easy to operate. Thus, by placing objects such as icons in the second web page in the specified region that is set according to the direction of the deviation in the display area in accordance with the deviation of the selected position of the object in the first web page, it is possible to provide the web page suitable for the tendency of the user's operation.","Further, the adjusting unit  adjusts the display size of the second web page based on the information related to the changing of the display size of the first web page. For example, in the case where the operation information about the operation to scale up the display size of contents such as objects contained in the first web page is acquired from the terminal , it is highly likely that a user of the terminal  has a preference for display with a larger display size. Thus, in this case, it is preferred to provide the second web page with an enlarged display size to the terminal .","Specifically, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information about the operation to scale up the display size from the storing unit , it makes adjustment so that the display contents in the second web page are scaled up to a specified display size. On the other hand, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information about the operation to scale down the display size from the storing unit , it makes adjustment so that the display contents in the second web page are scaled down to a specified display size.","Note that the adjusting unit  may adjust the display size of some of the selectable objects in the second web page, for example, rather than adjusting the display size of all of the display contents in the second web page. Specifically, the adjusting unit  may make adjustment to scale up only a part for which a link to another web page is set in the second web page. It is thereby possible to provide a web page that allows easy selection. Further, when the adjusting unit  acquires the operation information about the operation to scale up image objects in the first web page, it may make adjustment to scale up image objects in the second web page. Further, in such a case, the adjusting unit  may make adjustment to scale down the display size of selectable objects in the second web page.","Further, the web server  may include the web page storing unit . The web page storing unit  is a storing means that stores different display modes related to the second web page in association with the conditions related to the operation information.  is a diagram showing the configuration of the web page storing unit  and an example of data stored therein. In , the display modes related to the second web page, such as pattern 1, pattern 2 and pattern 3, are stored in association with the conditions related to the operation information such as \u201cright-hand operation tendency\u201d, \u201cleft-hand operation tendency\u201d and \u201cfrequent scaling operation\u201d. The condition related to the operation information \u201cright-hand operation tendency\u201d is the condition that applies when more than a specified number of operation information about the selection in a region deviated to the right of an object in the first web page are acquired. Further, the condition related to the operation information \u201cleft-hand operation tendency\u201d is the condition that applies when more than a specified number of operation information about the selection in a region deviated to the left of an object in the first web page are acquired. Furthermore, the condition related to the operation information \u201cfrequent scaling operation\u201d is the condition that applies when more than a specified number of operation information about the scaling of the display size in the first web page are acquired.","The display mode related to the second web page \u201cpattern 1\u201d is the display mode where selectable objects such as icons C are placed in a specified region that is deviated to the right in the display area Da as shown in , for example. Further, the display mode related to the second web page \u201cpattern 2\u201d is the display mode where selectable objects such as icons C are placed in a specified region that is deviated to the left in the display area Da. Furthermore, the display mode related to the second web page \u201cpattern 3\u201d is the display mode where adjustment is made to scale up the display contents to a specified display size.","In the case where the web server  includes the web page storing unit  described above, the adjusting unit  determines whether one or more operation information acquired from the storing unit  matches the condition related to the operation information in the web page storing unit  and, when the matching condition exists, it can extract the display mode related to the second web page which is associated with the condition and set the second web page in the extracted display mode as the adjusted second web page.","Further, when the information related to the scrolling of the first web page is contained in the operation information, the adjusting unit  can adjust an attribute value related to the amount of movement of the display contents with respect to the scrolling in the second web page. To be more specific, when more than a specified number of operation information about the scrolling are acquired or when the operation information indicating more than a specified speed of a contact position between a region where physical contact with the touch panel D is detectable and a user's finger is acquired or the like, for example, the adjusting unit  can adjust the attribute value to increase the amount of movement of the display area at the time of scrolling the second web page. Further, when the operation information related to the scrolling by less than a specified amount of movement of a contact position between the tough panel and a user's finger is acquired, for example, the adjusting unit  can adjust the attribute value to decrease the amount of movement of the display area at the time of scrolling the second web page.","The adjusting unit  transmits the second web page that is adjusted as described above to the transmitting unit .

The terminal A according to the second embodiment can be implemented as the web management device according to the present invention.","The terminal A has a touch panel D and includes a web page acquiring unit A, a display control unit A, a detecting unit A, an acquiring unit A (acquiring means), a storing unit A (storing means), and an adjusting unit A (adjusting means) as functional components.","The web page acquiring unit A is a part that acquires a first web page to be displayed in the display area Da. The web page acquiring unit A may acquire the first web page from a web server with which communication can be performed through a network or may acquire the prestored one.

It is thus possible to provide the web page suitable for the tendency of the user's operation.","A third embodiment is an embodiment for describing in detail the processing of acquiring position information to be used for acquisition of the operation information in the first embodiment and the second embodiment.","The function and configuration of the web system  according to the third embodiment are described hereinafter with reference to . The web system  is a computer system that provides a web page to a user and compiles the modes of user's operations on the web page. The web system  includes a web server B that provides a web page and a terminal B that is owned by a user. The web server B and the terminal B can communicate with each other through a communication network N that is the Internet, a wireless LAN, a mobile communication network or the like. In the web system shown in , one web server  and three terminals B are connected with one another through the network N, and the web system according to the third embodiment also has a configuration in which the web server B and the terminals B are connected through the network N. Note that the number of terminals B in the system is arbitrary.","The web server B is described first. As shown in , the web server B includes a generating unit B (generating means), a page transmitting unit B (transmitting means), a position receiving unit B (acquiring means), a storing unit B (storing means), and an analyzing unit B (adjusting means) as functional components. Note that only the functional units related to the acquisition and compilation of position information are shown in .","The web server B has the hardware configuration as shown in , just like the web server  according to the first embodiment.","Referring back to , the generating unit B is a means of generating a web page to be transmitted to the terminal B. The generating unit B generates a web page in accordance with a request signal transmitted from the terminal B in response to a user's operation and outputs the generated web page to the page transmitting unit B.","The structure of the web page that is generated by the generating unit B is described hereinafter. In this embodiment, the web page at least contains one or more image objects (banners) in which a link to another web page is embedded. Each image object is identified by an identifier called an image ID. In each image object, a detectable range for acquiring the position of tapping (clocking) on the image object when displayed on the terminal B is set. The position is indicated by two-dimensional coordinates (xy coordinates; referred to hereinafter simply as \u201ccoordinates\u201d). Note that the detectable range may be set not for all of the image objects but for some of the image objects. Examples of the image objects and a method of setting the detectable range include the following three patterns.","[Pattern 1]","A detectable range R shown in  is composed of an image object A and a margin region M on the periphery (in the vicinity) of the object A. A link is embedded in the image object A but not embedded in the margin region M. Thus, when tapping is made within the range of the image object A, switching to a linked web page is performed, and detection of the coordinates of the tapping is also performed. On the other hand, when tapping is made within the margin region M, page switching is not performed, and only detection of the coordinates of the tapping is performed.","[Pattern 2]","A detectable range R shown in  is composed of an image object A and a margin region M on the periphery of the object A. A link is embedded in both of the image object A and the margin region M. Thus, when tapping is made within the range of the detectable range R, switching to a linked web page is always performed, and detection of the coordinates of the tapping is also performed. In this manner, when a link is embedded also in the margin region M, switching of a web page is made even when tapping is done not on the object but on the periphery of the object, which enhances the convenience of the web page.","It should be noted that the same mode is implemented when preparing an image object having a margin on its outer edge and setting only the range of the image object as a detectable range. In this case, a code can be written using the onClick event of JavaScript (trademark or registered trademark).","[Pattern 3]","A detectable range R shown in  is composed of an image object A, a first margin region M adjacent to the object A, and a second margin region M located on the outside of the first margin region M. A link is embedded in the image object A and the first margin region M but not embedded in the second margin region M. Thus, when tapping is made within the range of the image object A or the first margin region M, switching to a linked web page is performed, and detection of the coordinates of the tapping is also performed. On the other hand, when tapping is made within the second margin region M, page switching is not performed, and only detection of the coordinates of the tapping is performed.","In this manner, the margin region is provided in the vicinity of the image object because a user tends to tap the outside of the image object. Setting not only the image object but also its proximity as the detectable range allows more taps to be recognized, which captures the tendency in more detail.","Note that the width of each margin region is arbitrary in any of the above patterns 1 to 3. For example, the width can be 25 pixels (in this case, margin regions with a width of 50 pixels in total are generated in the above pattern 3). Further, the width of margin regions may be different at the top, bottom, left and right of the image object A. Further, a margin region may be put on the outside of the image object and further a margin may be provided on the outer edge of the image object.","In this embodiment, the web page in which the image object and the detectable range are embedded is generated using JavaScript (trademark or registered trademark). In the code of the web page, the detectable range is defined using information about the image object (image ID, coordinates of starting point, coordinates of endpoint, width, height etc) and the width of the margin region. Further, the coordinates of tapping that occurs within the web page is acquired through the event object. Then, the coordinates of tapping and the detectable range are compared to thereby determine whether the tapping is made within the detectable range or not.","The code of the web page further includes a function for transmitting position information in which the coordinates indicating the position of tapping made in the detectable range and the image ID of the image object contained in the detectable range are associated to the web server B. In the case of switching pages when tapping is made in the margin region outside the image object as in the above patterns 2 and 3, the window.location.href method is also included in the code of the web page. It is possible to execute the transmission of the position information to the web server B and the switching of pages.","Referring back to , the page transmitting unit B is a means of transmitting the web page that is input from the generating unit B to the terminal B from which a request has been made.","The position receiving unit B is a means of receiving the position information indicating the position of tapping that has been made within the detectable range of the web page from the terminal B that displays the web page transmitted by the page transmitting unit B. The structure of the position information is as described above. The position receiving unit B stores the received position information into the storing unit B. Note that the position receiving unit B can store the position information into the storing unit B for each user of the terminal B.","The storing unit B is a means of storing the position information that is input from the position receiving unit B. Each time a user taps the detectable range of the web page through the terminal B, the position receiving unit B receives the position information corresponding to the operation and stores it into the storing unit B. Consequently, the position information is accumulated in the storing unit B. Note that the storing unit B can store the position information in association with the identifier of a user of the terminal B.","The analyzing unit B is a means of compiling the position information stored in the storing unit B and outputting a compilation result. The compilation and output process may be performed in response to an operation of an administrator of the web server B or performed on a regular basis by batch processing or the like. The position information compiled and output by the analyzing unit B can be used for acquisition of the operation information. Note that, when the position information is stored in the storing unit B in association with the identifier of a user, the analyzing unit B can compile the position information for each user and output the compilation result for each user.","The function of the analyzing unit B is described using the example of .  is a diagram showing a compilation result for the detectable range R shown in . The analyzing unit B reads all of the position information containing the image ID of the image object A from the storing unit B. The analyzing unit B then displays graphics indicating the image object A and the detectable range R on the monitor and provides gradations in the graphics based on the coordinates of each position information. At this time, the analyzing unit B provides gradations so that the color is darker in the part which is tapped more frequently.","With such display, an administrator of the web server B can grasp the tendency of tapping on the image object A at a glance. The example of  shows that a user has a high tendency to tap the lower right of the image object A (the character string \u201c500 points!\u201d and its vicinity), and therefore it is estimated that there are many right-handed users. Further, because tapping is made also on the left side of the image object A (the character strings \u201cToolbar\u201d and \u201cYou will receive\u201d and their vicinity), it is estimated that there are a certain number of left-handed users as well. In addition, seeing the lower left and the left side of the image object A, there is also a tendency that the outside of the image object A is tapped. It is thus estimated that there are a certain number of users who feel uncomfortable when the characters get hidden by the finger at the time of tapping, and it can be predicted that Click Through Rate (CTR) will increase when a wider margin is provided for the image object A.","It should be noted that a method of representing a compilation result is not limited to the example of . For example, an image object may be divided into a plurality of blocks, and the frequency of tapping may be displayed for each block. Further, a method of outputting a compilation result is not limited to screen display. For example, the analyzing unit B may output a compilation result by an arbitrary way such as printing, storing into a database or transmission to another computer system.","Another example of a method of compiling selected positions (position information) in the analyzing unit B is described with reference to . Specifically, in the case where a character is contained in the image object, a virtual region may be set in the image object for each of regions in which a character, a phase composed of a plurality of characters, or a sentence is displayed, and a position (selected position) where tapping is made may be represented by an identifier indicating the virtual region.","In this case, the analyzing unit B sets virtual regions Mto Mfor each of phrases contained in the image object A as shown in . Specifically, the virtual regions Mto Minclude phrases \u201cToolbar\u201d, \u201cWith new installation\u201d, \u201cYou will receive\u201d and \u201c500 points!\u201d, respectively. First, the analyzing unit B reads all of the position information containing the image ID of the image object A from the storing unit B and determines the virtual regions Mto Mto which the read position information belongs. The selected position by a user is thereby represented by the identifier of the virtual region. The analyzing unit B then displays graphics indicating the image object A and the virtual regions Mto Mon the monitor, provides colors with a darkness in accordance with the number of position information belonging to each of the virtual regions Mto Min the virtual regions Mto Mand displays them.  is a display example of the selected position (position information) compiled in this manner.","With such display, an administrator of the web server B can grasp the tendency of tapping on the image object A at a glance. According to the example of , it is easily found that a region which is tapped most frequently by a user is the virtual region M. Further, a method of outputting a compilation result is not limited to screen display as shown in . For example, as shown in , the analyzing unit B may output the number of tappings in each virtual region to a table and present the table to the administrator. The web server B can acquire the operation information in the first embodiment based on the operation information compiled in this manner.","The terminal B is described hereinbelow. As shown in , the terminal B has a touch panel D and includes a page acquiring unit B, a display control unit B, a position acquiring unit B, and a position transmitting unit B as functional components. One example of the terminal B is a tablet machine; however, the type of the terminal is not particularly limited as long as it is a communication device having the touch panel D. The terminal may be mobile or stationary.","The touch panel D is an input device that has a display area Da and displays various kinds of information on the display area Da and further detects physical contact with the display area Da. An example of the physical contact includes tapping by a pointing device such as a touch pen, a finger or the like.","The page acquiring unit B is a means of requesting a web page to be displayed on the touch panel D to the web server B and receiving a web page transmitted from the web server B in response to the request. When processing for acquiring a web page is performed in the terminal B in response to a user's operation, the page acquiring unit B generates and transmits a request signal for requesting the web page. The page acquiring unit B then receives a web page generated and transmitted by the web server B in response to the request signal. In the received web page, a detectable range for each image object is set as described above. The page acquiring unit B outputs the received web page to the display control unit B.","The display control unit B is a means of controlling display so that the web page that is input from the page acquiring unit B is displayed on the touch panel D. The web page is thereby displayed in the display area Da of the touch panel D.","The position acquiring unit B is a means of acquiring the position of physical contact with the web page that is displayed in the display area Da. When tapping is made on the display area Da, the position acquiring unit B detects the event through the touch pane D and acquires the coordinates indicating the position of the tapping. The position acquiring unit B then compares the acquired coordinates with the detectable range of the displayed web page.","If the tapping is made in a specific detectable range, the position acquiring unit B determines that the image object existing in the detectable range is selected and sets the acquired coordinates as the coordinates of the selected position. The position acquiring unit B then generates position information by associating the image ID of the selected image object with the coordinates of the selected position and outputs the position information to the position transmitting unit B. On the other hand, if the position of the tapping is outside any detectable range, the position acquiring unit B ends the process without generating position information.","The position acquiring unit B executes the above processing each time tapping is performed on the web page. At least some of functions of the position acquiring unit B are implemented as a result that JavaScript (trademark or registered trademark) embedded in the web page is read by the CPU  and executed.","Note that, when tapping is performed in the detectable range, and a link is embedded in the position of the tapping, the page acquiring unit B transmits a request signal requesting a web page corresponding to the link to the web server B.","The position transmitting unit B is a means of transmitting the position information that is input from the position acquiring unit B to the web server B. The transmitted position information is stored into the storing unit B of the web server B as described above.","Hereinafter, the operation of the web system  shown in  is described and a web management method according to this embodiment is further described with reference to .","When a user who desires to view a certain web page performs a specified operation on the terminal B, the page acquiring unit B generates a request signal requesting the web page (Step S) and transmits the signal to the web server B (Step S).","In the web server B, the generating unit B generates a web page in which the image object, the detectable range and the like are embedded based on the request signal (Step S, generating step). Then, the page transmitting unit B transmits the web page to the terminal B as a response to the request signal (Step S, transmitting step).","In the terminal B, the page acquiring unit B receives the web page, and the display control unit B displays the page in the display area Da of the touch panel D (Step S). After that, when tapping is performed within the detectable range of the web page, the position acquiring unit B generates position information indicating the selected position of the image object corresponding to the range (Step S). Then, the position transmitting unit B transmits the position information to the web server B (Step S).","In the web server B, the position receiving unit B receives the position information (receiving step) and stores it into the storing unit B (Step S, storing step).","If tapping is made repeatedly within any detectable range for one displayed web page, the processing of Steps S to S is executed a plurality of times accordingly. Further, when a specified link is selected by tapping on the displayed web page, the processing of Steps S to S is performed again. Consequently, the position information is accumulated in the storing unit B.","After the position information is accumulated in this manner, the analyzing unit B compiles the position information based on an administrator's operation or an instruction of batch processing and outputs a compilation result (Step S, output step).","A web management program for causing a computer to function as the web server B is described hereinafter with reference to .","A web management program PB includes a main module PB, a generating module PB, a page transmitting module PB, a position receiving module PB, a storing module PB, and an analyzing module B.","The main module PB is a part that exercises control over the web management.

Further, the web management program P may be provided as a computer data signal superimposed onto a carrier wave over a communication network.","As described above, according to this embodiment, the detectable range for detecting the position of physical contact with an image object is embedded in a web page, transmitted to the terminal B and displayed. After that, when physical contact occurs within the detectable range, the contact position is transmitted as position information from the terminal B to the web server B and stored. Then, the obtained position information is compiled and output.","According to related art, which banner or text is clicked or which icon is selected has been only analyzed. On the other hand, according to this embodiment, information about not only which image object is selected but also which position is touched on the selected image object is collected, and therefore the mode of operation on the image object can be acquired in detail. As a result, it is possible to accurately grasp the mode of operation on the web page in the terminal B that receives a touch input (for example, tapping). It is thereby possible to change the shape, size, design, layout and the like of the image object based on the grasped mode of operation and provide a more user-friendly web page to a user.","Further, because the setting of the detectable range and the generation of the position information can be made using the JavaScript or HTML specification, it is possible to build the web system  in a short period of time.","Further, in this embodiment, because the selected position is represented by two-dimensional coordinates, it is possible to grasp the mode of operation on the image object in detail.","A web system  according to a second embodiment is described hereinafter with reference to . The second embodiment is different from the third embodiment in that the functions related to the detectable range are implemented using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) specification only without using JavaScript (trademark or registered trademark). Thus, the web system  includes a web server C. As shown in , the web server C is different from the web server B in that it includes a generating unit C in place of the generating unit B. The configurations of the terminal B and the communication network N and the functional components of the web server other than the generating unit C are the same as those of the first embodiment, and therefore description of those is omitted, and only differences from the first embodiment are described hereinbelow.","The generating unit C generates a web page in accordance with a request signal transmitted from the terminal B in response to a user's operation and outputs the generated web page to the page transmitting unit B.  shows an example of the web page generated by the generating unit C. The image object A\u2032 shown in  has a margin outside a graphic part, and the boundary between the graphic part and the margin is indicated by a dotted line in . A link is embedded in the image object A\u2032. The whole range of the image object A\u2032 is set as a detectable range R. In this manner, a margin part needs to be an image object in this embodiment.","The image object A\u2032 is implemented as a button using an image. The button can be implemented by the code \u201c<input type=\u201cimage\u201d . . . \u201d. Accordingly, by the HTML specification, when the image object is tapped, the coordinates indicating the position of the tapping can be acquired.","As described above, by implementing the functions related to the detectable range by using the HTML specification only, the present invention can be applied to the environment where the use of JavaScript (trademark or registered trademark) is restricted or inhibited. In this embodiment, the same effects as in the third embodiment can be obtained as a matter of course.","A terminal D according to a fifth embodiment is described hereinafter with reference to . The terminal D in the fifth embodiment can serve as the web management device according to the present invention.","The terminal D has a touch panel D and includes a generating unit D (generating means), a storing unit D (storing means), an analyzing unit D (adjusting means), a display control unit D, and a position acquiring unit D (acquiring unit) as functional components.","The generating unit D generates a web page to be displayed in the display area Da of the touch panel D. The generation process of a web page is the same as the generation process in the generating unit B according to the third embodiment.

Specifically, the position acquiring unit D acquires the position of physical contact with the web page displayed in the display area Da and stores position information indicating the position into the storing unit D.","The storing unit D and the analyzing unit D have the same functions as the storing unit B and the analyzing unit B in , respectively.","As described above, according to this embodiment, the detectable range for detecting the position of physical contact with an image object is embedded in a web page and displayed in the display area Da. After that, when physical contact occurs within the detectable range, the contact position is stored as position information into the storing unit D. Then, the obtained position information is compiled and output.","The embodiments of the present invention are described in detail above. However, the present invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments, and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.","Although the detectable range is set for an image object (banner) in the third to fifth embodiments described above, the detectable range may be set for another object. For example, the detectable range may be set for another type of image object such as an icon or a user interface component such as a button. Further, it is not essential to embed a link to another web page in an object. For example, the detectable range may be set for an object that performs a specified operation without switching a web page when clicked.","Although the selected position is represented by the two-dimensional coordinates in the third to fifth embodiments described above, a method of representing the selected position is not limited thereto. For example, the detectable range may be virtually divided into a plurality of blocks, a block ID (identifier) that identifies a block may be assigned to each block, and the selected position may be indicated by the block ID.","In this case, the two-dimensional coordinates indicating the position of tapping and the range of each block are compared, and a code to decide the block ID of the position is embedded in a web page. Further, the position information contains the image ID and the block ID. In this case also, the analysis of the position information can be made in the same manner as in the above-described embodiments, and therefore an administrator of the web server can grasp the mode of operation for each block. Note that a method of setting blocks is arbitrary. For example, the detectable range may be divided equally or blocks may be partitioned for design parts (for example, one phase or one set of graphics) according to the design of the image object.","By representing the selected position with the block ID, the tendency of the mode of operation can be easily grasped. For example, the phenomenon that tapping is unevenly distributed in a specific region, graphic or phrase can be easily grasped.","Although the analyzing units B and D compile the position information as it is in the above-described embodiments, a compilation method is not limited thereto.

The web server further includes a user database that stores user information that can be identified by a user ID. Then, the outputting means associates the position information stored in the storing means with the user information in the user base to thereby perform compilation for each user attribute.","By performing compilation in consideration of user attributes, it is possible to achieve complex or multifaceted analysis of the mode of terminal operation with user attributes taken into account.","Although the system on the server side is composed of one web server B or C in the third and fourth embodiments described above, the functions of the web server may be distributed among a plurality of servers. For example, it is not always necessary to incorporate the storing unit B and the analyzing unit B into the web server B, and a server for transmitting a page and a server for performing compilation (a server including the storing unit B and the analyzing unit B) may be separated.","Although the touch panel D is described as the input device of the terminal , A, B and D, the type of the input device is not limited thereto.","Hereinafter, the technical ideas extracted from the embodiments of the web management device according to the present invention described above are listed below, pursuant to a description form of claims. The technical ideas according to the present invention can be understood at different levels and as various variations from the superordinate concept to the subordinate concept, and therefore the following description does not limit the present invention.","(Item 1) A web server capable of communicating with a terminal including an input device for displaying a web page containing an object in a display area and detecting physical contact with the display area, comprising:","a generating means for generating the web page with an embedded detectable range for acquiring a position of physical contact with the object displayed in the display area;","a transmitting means for transmitting the web page generated by the generating means to the terminal;","a receiving means for receiving position information indicating a selected position from the terminal having displayed the web page transmitted by the transmitting means in the display area and acquired a position of physical contact made within the detectable range of the web page as the selected position of the object corresponding to the range;","a storing means for storing the position information received by the receiving means; and","an outputting means for compiling the position information stored in the storing means and outputting a compilation result.","In the web server according to the above Item 1, the detectable range for detecting the position of physical contact with an image object is embedded in a web page, transmitted to the terminal and displayed thereon. After that, when physical contact occurs within the detectable range, the contact position is transmitted as the selected position (position information) of the object from the terminal to the web server and stored therein. Then, the obtained information is compiled and output. In this manner, by collecting not only information that an object is selected but also information as to at which position the selection of the object is made, the mode of operation on the object in the web page can be acquired in detail. As a result, it is possible to accurately grasp the mode of operation on the web page in the terminal that receives a touch input.","(Item 2) A web server capable of communicating with a terminal including an input device for displaying a web page in a display area and detecting physical contact with the display area, comprising:","an acquiring means for acquiring operation information indicating an operation from the terminal having detected the operation by a user on a first web page displayed in the display area based on physical contact with the display area;","a storing means for storing the operation information acquired by the acquiring means;","an adjusting means for adjusting a second web page to be displayed in the display area based on the operation information stored in the storing means; and","a transmitting means for transmitting the second web page adjusted by the adjusting means to the terminal.","In the web server according to the above Item 2, the operation information indicating an operation by a user on the terminal is acquired, and a web page to be displayed in the display area of the terminal is adjusted based on the acquired operation information. The adjusted web page is then transmitted to the terminal. Because the web page is adjusted in this manner, the tendency of the user's operation is reflected on the web page. It is thus possible to provide the web page suitable for the tendency of the user's operation.","As described above, according to the embodiments, because not only information that an object is selected but also information as to at which position the selection of the object is made is collected, it is possible to provide a web management device that can accurately grasp the mode of operation on a web page in a terminal that receives a touch input and provide a user interface suitable for the tendency of the user's operation.","D . . . touch panel, Da . . . display area, M\u02dcM. . . virtual region, P, PB . . . web management program, P, PB . . . main module, P . . . acquiring module, PB . . . generating module, P . . . storing module, PB . . . page transmitting module, P . . . adjusting module, PB . . . position receiving module, P . . . web page storing module, PB . . . storing module, P . . . transmitting module, PB . . . analyzing module, ,  . . . web system, , B, C . . . web server, , A . . . acquiring unit, B, C, D . . . generating unit, , A . . . storing unit, B . . . page transmitting unit, , A . . . adjusting unit, B . . . position receiving unit,  . . . web page storing unit, B, D . . . storing unit,  . . . transmitting unit, B, D . . . analyzing unit, , A, B, D . . . terminal,  . . . receiving unit, A . . . web page acquiring unit, B . . . page acquiring unit, , A, B, D . . . display control unit, , A . . . detecting unit, B, D . . . position acquiring unit,  . . . operation information transmitting unit, B . . . position transmitting unit"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 23"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
