{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to EP 11 195 595.1 filed 23 Dec. 2011, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a method and system for creating a HTML\/CSS representation of a geometric symbol.","Almost all modern enterprises use software tools for defining their internal and external processes. Such processes may for example relate to the various steps necessary for the assembly of a car but also to other tasks of an enterprise such as monitoring sales. To be able to define, monitor and evaluate a certain process or even the performance of the overall enterprise, a type of software referred to as Business Process Management (BPM) Tool is commonly used. One example of such a BPM Tool is the software ARIS available from applicant.","However, before implementing and using such a process it has to be defined. In order to simplify its definition, the various steps of a process to be developed are typically displayed in graphical form, e.g., using a flow diagram as illustrated in the screenshot of . Such flow diagrams can be created in various ways, e.g. manually or by drawing on a computer using a professional drawing program. However, such an approach is rather complex and inflexible. A more convenient option of creating such a flow diagram is using a web browser, e.g, by building a corresponding HTML file.","There are several ways to employ a web browser for creating flow diagrams which are briefly outlined in the following:","A first option is to use a third party plug-in such as Adobe Flash. However, such a plug-in typically requires a lot of computing power and may not be available on all platforms.","Another option is using bitmap based graphics, wherein a bitmap represents a symbol based on web graphic formats like PNG or JPEG. Such a technology is used in products like Signavio or BPMN Community. However, bitmap based formats cannot be scaled without losing quality. This is illustrated in : Symbols  and  are bitmap graphic based symbols which are displayed at original size. Symbols  and  show the same symbols, however scaled by a factor of 2. As can be seen, the scaling results in visible artifacts and thus in reduced quality.","Another approach is known as 9 slice scaling graphics. This technology is for example used by IBM Blueworks Live. The idea behind this approach is to split each graphic or symbol into 9 slices, i.e., different graphics so that the various region of the overall graphic can be independently scaled. As shown in , the regions , ,  and  will never be scaled regardless of whether the graphic  will be stretched horizontally or vertically. If the graphic  is horizontally scaled, only the regions  and  will be stretched. If the graphic  is vertically scaled, the regions  and  will be stretched. The region  will always be stretched. This approach has the benefit that graphics that have a plain solid colored region in the center can be scaled without losing quality. However, this approach does not work with arbitrary shapes.","Another well-known approach is using vector based graphics, wherein a graphic is formatted in a web browser supported format like SVG or VML. This is another technology used by the BPM Tools of Signavio. Vector based graphics can be indefinitely scaled without degrading quality. However, vector formats like SVG and VML need a high amount of memory and a lot of processing power to render large and complex SVG and VML structures.","A further option is to draw a symbol in the web browser by using the HTML5 Canvas API (Application Programming Interface). This technology is for example used by Lucidchart or WebSphere Business Compass. As illustrated in , the HTML5 Canvas API allows to draw any kind of symbol  onto a canvas  in the web browser. Most common web browsers today already support a GPU (Graphics Processor Unit) acceleration for the HTML5 Canvas API but the performance to calculate the symbol geometry and to draw a symbol is still unsatisfactory.","A more recent approach is to use HTML5 and CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets), which is also a technology used by IBM Blueworks Live. Following this approach, a symbol is represented by various nested HTML elements which are styled with CSSs. This technique can be combined with any of the other approaches described above, in particular the 9 slice scaling graphics. Most common web browsers support a GPU accelerated CSS rendering leading to an acceptable performance of representing a symbol as a HTML fragment styled with CSS compared to the other solutions. However, it is rather difficult for human persons to create a complex symbol based on a HTML fragment and to style it with CSS. In addition, some common web browsers fail to support the complete CSS standard so that different CSS notations are necessary to obtain the same or similar results.","It is therefore the technical problem underlying the present invention to provide a solution that reduces the necessary effort for programming such graphics, in particular in view of the different web browsers, and to make such code more reliable and stable.","In one embodiment this problem is solved by a method for creating a HTML\/CSS representation of a geometric symbol, wherein the method comprises:\n\n","By using a definition of the geometric symbol written in a format that is easier to understand than a convoluted combination of HTML\/CSS the effort needed for creating such a symbol can be greatly reduced. Writing code in an appropriate language (e.g., XML or JSON) is easier than writing code directly in a combination of HTML and CSS. This is particularly the case if a certain geometric symbol has a complex structure and comprises several shapes, such as a square with several circles, wherein each circle has different line colors and color gradients.","In one exemplary embodiment, the method further comprises the creation of at least one web browser specific attribute CSS class for each of the geometric shapes.","Thereby geometric shapes may be separated by putting them into different CSS classes. By creating not only a CSS shape class, but also a CSS attribute class it is possible to separate the shape and specific attributes of the geometric symbol. Therefore, less code is needed, since equal geometric shapes can use the same CSS code. Only the respective attributes, e.g., color or size may be stored separately in the attribute CSS classes. The CSS files can then be combined to build a common HTML\/CSS representation of the geometric symbol.","As already mentioned above, different web browsers support HTML and CSS in different ways so that the respective HTML and CSS files must fulfill certain requirements depending on the web browser. The invention allows building of web browser specific CSS classes so as to optimize the display of the symbols. However, a web browser specific class may also be compatible to several (e.g., the most common) web browsers. For instance, if two or more web browsers support some CSS code in the same way, they may be grouped to form a first web browser specific CSS class, while for other web browsers a second CSS class is generated.","Preferably, the method comprises the additional step of determining the level of CSS support of the web browser and the step of adjusting the creation of the web browser specific CSS classes accordingly.","As mentioned above, there is a wide variety of different standards and versions of standards which makes the correct display of information more complex. Moreover, different web browsers typically interpret commands in a different way which may also lead to different results. Thus, by determining the level of CSS support of the web browser and consequently by adjusting the creation of web browser specific CSS classes accordingly, it is possible to tune the resulting HTML\/CSS representation such that it can be optimally processed and displayed by the respective web browser. As mentioned above, it may be the case that several web browsers support certain CSS code in a similar way, which would result in web browser specific classes suited for several web browsers.","It is preferred that the web browser specific shape CSS class is created from a generic shape CSS class.","The creation of a generic shape CSS class can serve as basis for the generation of various web browser specific shape CSS classes. Thus, it is not necessary to re-create the basic information required for creating the web browser specific shape CSS classes but the existing generic shape CSS class can be re-used. This feature further increases the efficiency of the generation of the HTML\/CSS representation.","It is also preferred that the step of creating the at least one web browser specific attribute CSS class further comprises the step of determining equal attributes for each of the shapes and the step of merging the equal attributes into a generic attribute CSS class.","This feature may even further reduce the amount of the code. Even different geometric shapes (e.g., circle, triangle and square) may share at least some attributes (e.g., color of the lines or line width etc.). By grouping these attributes in a single CSS class the code needs to be present only once and may be called several times. Consequently, the amount of code can be reduced compared to the standard solution which does not teach such a determination and merging step.","Preferably, the web browser specific attribute CSS class is created from the generic attribute CSS class.","This feature allows to start from the generic class and to produce multiple different web browser specific classes without the need to re-create the basic information necessary to generate web browser specific attribute CSS classes. This aspect is similar to the above discussed generation of web browser specific shape CSS classes and has similar advantages.","It is preferred that the step of generating the HTML\/CSS representation comprises the generation of the HTML\/CSS representations for a set of pre-defined web browsers and storing the set of HTML\/CSS representations into a single file.","As mentioned before, different web browsers may interpret code differently. This may lead to different visual representations of a symbol even though the same code is used. To overcome such problems a set of web browsers may be pre-defined in order to create a number of HTML\/CSS representations at once. As a result, the web browser can select the correct version of the HTML\/CSS representation, e.g., based on a tag comprised in the file and therefore display the symbol as originally intended by the creator of the symbol.","Preferably, the symbol definition is provided in a XML-compatible format.","The XML standard serves as a basis for nearly all web based standards, e.g., HTML or CSS. Thus, by using such basic and well-known standard the creation of complex symbols can be improved. Moreover, the XML is human readable and easily understandable, in particular when compared to complex programming languages. Consequently, symbols defined in XML (or a similar language) can not only be easier understood but also be quickly modified and even without any knowledge of complex programming languages.","In a preferred embodiment, the HTML\/CSS representation comprises a HTML file which comprises the web browser specific CSS classes.","It may be desired to pre-produce a symbol for a wide variety of web browsers. In this case, one option is to build a single HTML\/CSS representation, e.g., a file, which comprises symbols according to the web browser specific classes. The web browser could then determine which of a number of symbols to use in order to correctly display the symbol. In particular, the user may not have to determine which version of the file to use. This could be done by the web browser, e.g., based on a tag comprised in the code of the respective HTML\/CSS representations.","The invention may also be implemented by a computer program comprising instructions for causing at least one computer to perform a method according to any of the above described embodiments.","The invention may also be realized by a system for creating a HTML\/CSS representation of a geometric symbol, wherein the system comprises:\n\n","Further dependent claims are described in the detailed description of the invention.","As already mentioned in the introduction, one of the main disadvantages of the known HTML\/CSS approach is the complexity of a HTML fragment and the one or more CSS styles. This is particularly problematic if these fragments and styles are created manually. In any case, the code has to be correct so that the created symbol will be correctly rendered in the different web browsers. The idea of the present invention is to represent a graphical symbol as a HTML fragment and to style it with CSS in a more efficient way than known from prior art. This is achieved by creating the symbol in a simpler, human understandable and generic language such as XML, SVG or comparable languages and to transform it into an HTML\/CSS representation in an efficient manner. The user does not need to have any knowledge about HTML and CSS.","For reasons of simplicity, the description mostly refers to a single symbol in a file that is to be processed. However, it is clear that also any number of symbols could be comprised within a single input file which is then generated into a HTML\/CSS representation. This allows to generate even more complex HTML\/CSS representations based on a single input file which is written in human-readable language. Different symbols comprised in a single file could also make use of the various features and embodiments described herein, e.g., the merging of shapes and\/or attributes.","With reference to to several basic CSS based geometric shapes are exemplarily shown. It is to be understood that the following list of geometric shapes is by no means intended to restrict the number of possible geometric shapes. They are intended to provide an overview over some common geometric shapes and CSS representations thereof.

Further, CSS supports shadows and transparency. In addition, it is also possible to fill the various geometric shapes with different color gradients as well as with images. Generally, the invention may use all features that are provided by CSS, even if they are not explicitly mentioned herein. This makes it possible to create very complex symbols.","While the above shapes are quite simple,  illustrates an example for a complex symbol and the HTML\/CSS code necessary for creating that symbol. As can be seen, the required code is quite complex and therefore error-prone. In more detail, the example of  is composed of the following 3 shapes: A rounded rectangle which is the base shape of the symbol, the triangle in the middle of the symbol and a shape used to display the glass effect of the symbol. Writing manually a CSS\/HTML definition for the symbol will end up in at least 3 <div> elements (one for each shape) and 3 more complex CSS style definitions defining the appearance for each shape (e.g., size, colors, shadows).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0085"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<html>"]},{"entry":[{},"<head>"]},{"entry":[{},"<title>>Test<\/title>"]},{"entry":[{},"<style>"]},{"entry":[{},".ExampleSymbol {"]},{"entry":[{},"padding:0px;"]},{"entry":[{},"width: 176px;"]},{"entry":[{},"height: 176px;"]},{"entry":[{},"background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%,"]},{"entry":[{},"from(#2D9DCD), to(#00B6F1), color-stop(.5,#004DE4));"]},{"entry":[{},"display: inline-block;"]},{"entry":[{},"color: #fff;"]},{"entry":[{},"text-decoration: none;"]},{"entry":[{},"-moz-border-radius: 30px;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-border-radius: 30px;"]},{"entry":[{},"-moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);"]},{"entry":[{},"text-shadow: 0 \u22121px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);"]},{"entry":[{},"border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.25);"]},{"entry":[{},"position: relative;"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},".glossy {"]},{"entry":[{},"background: -webkit-gradient(linear, 0% 0%, 0% 100%,"]},{"entry":[{},"from(rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)), to(rgba(255, 255,"]},{"entry":[{},"255, 0.2)));"]},{"entry":[{},"height: 90px;"]},{"entry":[{},"width: 176px;"]},{"entry":[{},"position: relative;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-border-top-right-radius: 38px;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-border-top-left-radius: 38px;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 120px 20px;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 100px 20px;"]},{"entry":[{},"z-index: 3;"]},{"entry":[{},"-webkit-box-shadow: inset 0px 2px 1px #fff;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-top-right-radius: 38px 38px;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-top-left-radius: 38px 38px;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-bottom-right-radius: 120px 20px;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-bottom-left-radius: 100px 20px;"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},".right-triangle {"]},{"entry":[{},"width: 0;"]},{"entry":[{},"height: 0;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-left: 60px solid white;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-top: 30px solid transparent;"]},{"entry":[{},"border-bottom: 30px solid transparent;"]},{"entry":[{},"position: relative;"]},{"entry":[{},"left:65px;"]},{"entry":[{},"top:55px;"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/style>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/head>"]},{"entry":[{},"<body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<div class=\u201cExampleSymbol\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<div class=\u201cglossy\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<div class=\u201cright-triangle\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/body>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/html>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The invention provides a framework which allows a human person or even a computer system to describe symbols such as shown in  in a humanized language which, according to an embodiment of the present invention, may then be transformed by the transformation framework into a cross-browser HTML 5\/CSS 3 code. This results in the general ability of the code to support all common web browsers.","In one embodiment, the present invention may be divided in three parts, which will be described in more detail in the following: the transformation framework, the definition language and the symbol editor. However, this does not imply that all parts are essential to realize the invention.","The transformation framework may be considered as core of the invention. In one embodiment, the transformation framework could be implemented as a piece of computer code implementing the main logic and a language processor adapted to transform a given humanized definition language into a cross-browser HTML 5\/CSS 3 code. However, other versions of the standards may also be used.","A preferred embodiment of the transformation framework will now be described with reference to . However, not all of the following steps may be necessary in all embodiments of the present invention.","In step , the XML symbol definition is processed from a file and then parsed into an in-memory data structure representing the defined model. The in-memory data structure may be a binary representation of the XML code. In step , the symbol is broken down into its individual geometric shapes. In step , the geometric shapes used to form the symbol are determined. As example, it may be determined that the XML symbol comprises squares, triangles and circles.","In step , a HTML <div> element is created which will represent the whole symbol. Further, for each shape a nested <div> element is created. In HTML a <div> tag defines a division or section in an HTML document. For the <div> elements only the size and the position are defined directly in the <div> element. All other styling information is assigned using one or more CSS classes.","In step , for each (different) geometric shape (e.g. rectangle, triangle or circle) a generic CSS class is created and assigned to the corresponding <div> element. If the symbol definition comprises a certain geometric shape more than once there is still only one CSS class created for this geometric shape. For example, if a XML symbol comprises two squares, only one CSS class for squares will be created. This class is also referred to as CSS shape class. This approach reduces the amount of code of the generated CSS class. The generic CSS class contains only CSS styles which can be interpreted by all supported browsers. In general, the CSS support of different web browsers is well documented so that it is easy to create a kind of knowledge base for the framework. This could be a XML document containing for each supported web browser and one or more versions corresponding to the CSS support, information on how to display the different shape types and the supported effects in that web browser.","In step , the target platform (e.g., the specific web browser type) for the symbol is determined. In step , the supported CSS level as well as the web browser specific CSS support is determined.","In step , a specific CSS generation engine is instantiated to generate the web browser specific CSS code based on the information determined in the previous step. As mentioned above, different web browsers may interpret commands in a different way which could result in a different display of the geometric shape or even in errors when displaying the geometric shape. It is therefore desirable to adjust the creation of the CSS shape classes to one or more specific web browsers. In step , a web browser specific shape CSS class is generated for each geometric shape. In step , the generated CSS classes are assigned to the corresponding <div> elements.","In step , the defined shape attributes are analyzed to determine shapes with the same attribute type and value. In step , the frameworks merges as many as possible of the attribute types\/values into one CSS attribute class which can be assigned later to several shapes. In other words, if several shapes use at least in part the same attribute type with the same value, this style information will be put in the same CSS attribute class, step . For instance, the transformation framework could find two rectangles which both have the same border color, the same border width and the same opacity. In this case, this style information is put in one CSS attribute class which is then assigned to the <div> elements of both rectangles.","In step  the CSS code is again broken down into two parts: in a generic CSS code which can be interpreted by all supported web browsers and in one part which depends on the target web browser. In step , the (target) web browser specific CSS code for the shape attributes defining the style of the geometric shape is created. In step , the generated shape CSS classes are assigned to the corresponding <div> elements.","Finally, in step , the generated HTML symbol code (HTML and CSS) is written out as the final HTML\/CSS representation.","The definition language as it may be used herein in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may be XML or DOM (Document Object Model) based. Other implementations of the symbol language, e.g., based on JSON are also possible. Such a description allows a human person or system to describe in a humanized way a complex figure or symbol. In this context, the term \u201chumanized\u201d means that the language makes use of common, well known and speaking terms to describe a complex figure or symbol. The definition language may also allow to make use of common vector graphic languages which may be XML or text-based. Such text-based-vector languages may be SVG, VML or EPS. In a so-called mixed-mode, the definition document may comprise embedded parts describing parts of the symbol by one or more of those text-based vector languages. The usage of those text-based vector languages is restricted by the possibilities to describe shapes using the HTML\/CSS definition language.","The following reference gives an overview of an example definition language which is based on XML. It should be mentioned that the below definitions are by no means intended to limit the invention to these definitions. It is also possible to extend the language with new elements and attributes as desired and required by the person skilled in the art.","Symbol-Element:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0100"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<symbol>"]},{"entry":[{},"Content:

The symbol editor can be a GUI (Graphical User Interface) which allows the user to draw complex symbols without any knowledge about the symbol definition language. The symbol editor will create as output a symbol definition (e.g., in XML-compatible language) which can then be transformed into a HTML\/CSS figure by utilizing the transformation framework. However, in one embodiment the symbol may also be defined using any other suitable means, e.g., a text based editor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0126"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 7"],"b":["1200","1210","1210","1220","1230","1220","1240","1250","1260","1270","1220","1220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1300","1300","1310","1320"]},"The symbol interpreter  is responsible for parsing the symbol definition  and for creating an in-memory structure  representing the symbol. As mentioned above, the in-memory structure may be binary. The generated data structure  is the input for the main transformation algorithm which is implemented in the symbol generator . The symbol generator  implements the algorithm to transform a symbol from a human readable definition (e.g., XML) into a HTML and CSS based representation. The symbol generator  is also responsible for optimizing the CSS structure  and HTML structure  and to make it cross browser compliant.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the transformation framework is not part of the running system making use of the output generated by the transformation framework. The transformation framework is only used for a one-time generation of the HTML symbol description. This scenario is illustrated in  which shows the transformation framework as a decoupled system. Therein, an external system  uses the HTML\/CSS representations ,  of symbols which it retrieves, e.g., over a network. The network may be any type of network known in the art. In particular, it could be a wired network or a wireless network or a combination thereof. The transformation of the symbol definition occurs at a remote location and in accordance with the embodiments described above. In more detail, the transformation framework  comprises the symbol interpreter  and the symbol generator . The symbol interpreter  generates a symbol data structure  based on symbol definition , which is then processed by symbol generator  to produce a cross browser compatible HMTL\/CSS representation , . In this scenario, the already generated symbols (e.g., HTML and CSS files, which is the output of the symbol generator) may be located on a web server and are requested by a HTTP request from the client. The generator is not used during runtime.","In one embodiment, the code might run either on a server (e.g., web\/application server) or a client side (e.g., web browser). In a client-server web scenario as illustrated in , the transformation framework  is an integrated component of the system. This means, the system makes use of the transformation framework  during the application runtime. In this scenario the transformation framework  can be integrated either on the server  or on the client (web browser) side . The figures below illustrate an embodiment of this scenario. The client  and server  may communicate via a network  utilizing various types of communication means. For instance, the client  and server  may communicate via the World Wide Web, wherein the client  runs a web browser  and communicates with the web server  on the server side  which provides the transformation framework . In the depicted embodiment, the web server  which comprises the transformation framework  sends the HTML\/CSS representation  via the network  to the web browser .","In this scenario it is also possible to use hard or soft permutations (however, the hard and\/or soft permutations could also be used in any other embodiment of the present invention). In the hard permutations scenario the transformation creates different HTML\/CSS files for each supported web browser. On runtime the web browser type is determined and the corresponding symbol file is then sent to the client. In the soft permutations scenario the transformation framework will create only one HTML\/CSS file, i.e., one HTML file and one CSS file. which will work on each supported web browser. However, it is also conceivable that only a single file may be created. In the soft permutations case the generated file will be much larger and needs much more time to be transferred to the client. If hard permutations are used, the web browser type and CSS support might be determined during runtime.","This is also illustrated by , wherein via a web browser  on the client side  a HTML symbol is requested  from the server . The request is retrieved by transformation framework  which then processes the request. In step , the transformation framework  processes and analyzes the symbol definition. Subsequently, the type of the requesting web browser and the CSS support are determined, step . To this end, the web browser may use the HTTP protocol to request data like HTML pages or CSS files from the server. The header of a HTTP request message contains a field named \u201cuser agent\u201d (see http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc1945#section-10.15) used by the communication partners to characterize the client and to optionally select suitable content. Thereafter, the CSS configuration engine can be configured, step , which then generates optimized HTML\/CSS symbol code, step . As a result, the generated HTML\/CSS code is written out, step  and finally the transformation framework  may provide (directly or indirectly) the web browser  with the request response, step , i.e., with the requested HTML\/CSS representation of the symbol.","However, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention it is also possible to perform the transformation on the client side, which is illustrated in . Therein, a server , e.g., a web server  may send a symbol definition , e.g., via the World Wide Web  (or any other suitable communications means known to the person skilled in the art) to a client . This client could comprise a web browser  which runs the transformation framework . However, the transformation  framework may not be directly integrated into the web browser. In this case, the web browser would call the transformation framework . The transformation framework  then generates the HTML\/CSS representation  of the symbol definition  received from the web server . Finally, the web browser  may utilize the generated HTML\/CSS representation in order to display the retrieved symbol definition. In this way, the amount of data to be transmitted can be kept relatively low since the web browser  creates the HTML\/CSS representation itself. It is not necessary to transmit a set of HTML\/CSS representations from which the web browser then has to select a suitable HTML\/CSS representation.","The following section provides some examples of symbols which can be created with the transformation framework in accordance with any of the embodiments of the present invention as described above.","The shape of  comprises three triangles ,  and .

For instance, a HTML document containing 3000 symbols such as  could be displayed almost without delay in a common web browser running on standard hardware. This makes it possible to use this technology to represent big and complex models in the most common web browsers.","It will be appreciated that as used herein, the terms system, subsystem, service, module, programmed logic circuitry, and the like may be implemented as any suitable combination of software, hardware, firmware, and\/or the like.
