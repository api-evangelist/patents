title: Rapid modulation scheme determination for linear digital signals
abstract: Various embodiments associated with modulation scheme determination for an unknown signal with noise are described. An unknown signal can have an unknown modulation scheme to a system. In order to determine a modulation scheme to use with the unknown signal, the unknown signal can be compared to a plurality of known signals, with an individual known signal being associated with a particular modulation scheme. A rapid classification method can be used that is less computationally intensive than an average likelihood ratio test method based on the distances between unknown symbols and constellation alphabets of a set of known modulation schemes. Signal to noise ratios before and after classification can be used to check an accuracy of classification and distribution of signal symbols can be used to verify a classification result.

In a singular environment, enemy combatants can each broadcast different signals. It may be possible for one combatant to intercept the signal of another combatant. The intercepting combatant may not know the modulation scheme of an intercepted signal. Without the modulation scheme, it may be difficult to put the intercepted signal to use.","A system comprising a computation component, a determination component, a designation component, and a processor is described. The computation component is configured to compute a first value from comparison of a first known signal format with an unknown signal, where a modulation scheme of the unknown signal is unknown to the system, where a modulation scheme of the first known signal format is known to the system, and where the unknown signal includes a noise. The computation component is also configured to compute a second value from comparison of a second known signal format with the unknown signal, where a modulation scheme of the second signal format is known to the system. The determination component is configured to determine a preferred value from a value set, where the value set comprises the first value and the second value. The designation component is configured to designate a modulation scheme of the known signal associated with the preferred value as a modulation scheme for the unknown signal. The processor is configured to execute at least one command in relation to the computation component, the determination component, the designation component, or a combination thereof.","In addition, a system comprising a calculation component, an identification component, a distribution component, a comparison component, a selection component, and a non-transitory computer-readable medium is described. The calculation component is configured to calculate a first error from comparison of a signal with a noise against a first known signal, where a modulation of the signal is unknown to the system. The calculation component is also configured to calculate a second error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a second known signal. The identification component is configured to make an identification that the first known signal and second known signal share common alphabets, where the identification is made through comparison of the first error and the second error. The distribution component is configured to determine a first constellation distribution difference of the signal against the first known signal as well as determine a second constellation distribution difference of the signal against the second known signal. The comparison component is configured to determine a lower difference between the first constellation distribution difference and the second constellation distribution difference. The selection component is configured to select a modulation scheme of the known signal with the lower difference for demodulation of the signal with the noise. The non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to retain at least one instruction in relation to the calculation component, the identification component, the distribution component, the comparison component, the selection component, or a combination thereof.","Furthermore, a non-transitory computer-readable medium configured to store computer-executable instructions that when executed by a processor cause the processor to perform a method is described. The method comprises receiving a signal with a noise, where a classification of the signal is unknown to a system. The method also comprises calculating a first error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a first known signal as well as calculating a second error from comparison of the signal with the noise against a second known signal. In addition, the method comprises determining a smallest error from an error set, where the error set comprises the first error and the second error and designating a modulation scheme associated with the known signal with the smallest error as a modulation scheme for the signal. Furthermore the method comprises causing the signal to be demodulated through use of the modulation scheme for the signal and causing the signal to be outputted after demodulation.","Cognitive radio based adaptive demodulation can be an effective technique for maximizing a communication data rate within a given bandwidth. Automatic modulation classification is a tool that employs selecting a correct demodulation scheme proactively (e.g., automatically) without hand shaking between a transmitter and receiver. A rapid processing method can be used in real-time communication to make communication faster.","With digitizing communications closer to the antenna, radios with programmable modulation schemes and transmission rates can be a practical wireless communication platform. The radio transmission environment can be exploited and a system can choose a best modulation scheme to maximize the channel capacity in real-time. In cognitive radio, the signal data can be transmitted frame by frame. The modulation scheme in an individual data frame can be determined depending upon a channel noise level estimated before the transmission. An adaptive modulation scheme can maintain a bit-error rate (BER) below a certain threshold to ensure the quality of service in data transmission. To do this, pilot symbol can be used in transmitted data frame to indicate a modulation scheme for proper demodulation of the receiver. Automatic modulation classification algorithms can function to recognize the modulation scheme change automatically without redundant pilot symbols. A modulation estimator can operate in parallel with a programmable demodulator in the receiver. A change in the modulation scheme of a transmitter among individual data frames can be detected and the demodulator can change the demodulation scheme accordingly. The objective of the automatic modulation recognition can be to identify the modulation scheme of a transmitted signal with a high probability of success within a short observation time.","A fast and simplified modulation classification method can be used to recognize digital modulation schemes including phase-shift-keying (PSK) modulation and quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) for adaptive demodulation of the cognitive radios.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","200","100"]},"Classification among L number of linear modulation schemes can be described by choosing the maximum signal to noise ratio (SNR) or minimum noise variance among L hypotheses, denoted by H, H, . . . , and H.
