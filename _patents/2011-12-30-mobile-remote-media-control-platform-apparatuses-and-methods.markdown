The respective owners of such intellectual property have no objection to the facsimile reproduction of the disclosure by anyone as it appears in published Patent Office file\/records, but otherwise reserve all rights.","The present innovations are directed generally to media control, and more particularly, to MOBILE REMOTE MEDIA CONTROL PLATFORM APPARATUSES AND SYSTEMS.","A home TV user may view TV programs from a plurality of channels. The user may operate a handheld remote TV controller sold with the TV set to select TV channels. For example, the user may push buttons on the remote controller to switch channels, turn up\/down audio volume, power on\/off the TV. Merchants advertise their products to attract consumers. Thus the TV audiences may interact with the TV and select a desired channel without physically touching it via operating the remote TV controller.","The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and\/or detailed. As such, a detailed discussion of reference number  would be found and\/or introduced in . Reference number  is introduced in , etc.","The MOBILE REMOTE MEDIA CONTROL PLATFORM APPARATUSES AND SYSTEMS provides a client-server interactive platform whereby a user may operate a general purpose personal mobile device (e.g., a smart phone, etc.) to receive a list of TV programs schedules and submit a selection of TV channel via the personal mobile device. In one implementation, the user may operate the personal mobile device as a TV remote controller. In one implementation, the MR-Control may receive the user's selection of a channel and determine what media contents the user has elected to watch. In one implementation, the user's channel selection and viewing status may be populated to a social media platform, and the MR-Control may obtain user response with regard to a TV program from the social media to perform analytics for TV program feedback review.","For example, in one implementation, a user may plug a MR-Control accessory (e.g.,  in ) into his mobile device, such as a smartphone (e.g., an Apple iPhone, BlackBerry, Google Android, Palm, HTC Evo, Samsung Galaxy, etc.), laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer (e.g., Apple iTouch, iPad, etc.), and\/or the like, to facilitate communication between the mobile device and a home TV set. In an alternative implementation, the MR-Control accessory may be a standalone table top unit which may not need to be attached to a user mobile device. For example, the table top unit may communicate with a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a cell phone or mobile device and\/or the like via wired or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). In further implementations, the table top unit may monitor audience activities as further illustrated in , E-H. Further implementations of the table top unit are illustrated in . Within implementations, a MR-Control server may obtain real-time TV program listing, including the TV program schedule, advertisement schedule, and\/or the like, from a TV network. The user may then obtain the list of TV program schedules from the MR-Control, e.g., as shown at  in . The user may then submit a channel selection, e.g., tap on the touch screen of the mobile device as shown at  in . In one implementation, upon receiving the user channel selection, the MR-Control server may retrieve data record from a media content database and check program table to determine what's the TV program on air. For example, if the user selects the channel \u201cCBS,\u201d the MR-Control may ascertain \u201cCBS\u201d has \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on air based on the timestamp when the user submits the selection. In one implementation, the MR-Control may further retrieve a program table to obtain information with regard to the advertisement streamed during the intervals of the TV play \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and\/or the product placement advertisements tagged in the TV play \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on \u201cCBS.\u201d","In another implementation, the MR-Control may parse commercial ad information retrieved at and generate prompt questions, surveys, and\/or the like . For example, if the MR-Control determines the user is supposed to watch a series of \u201cAudi\u201d commercial during the show \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d the MR-Control may prompt a survey including questions with regard to automobile purchasing. In another implementation, the MR-Control may keep a record of advertisements that has played on channels the user has recently selected (e.g., for a period of past 2 weeks, etc.), and generate prompt questions based on such advertisements. In one implementation, the user may submit responses to such questions.","In a further implementation, when a user is provided a question with regard to an embedded advertisement in the TV show (e.g., \u201care you interested in the red bag the character is carrying?\u201d etc.), the user may submit a request to learn more and\/or purchase the product. In that case, the MR-Control may provide a merchant URL to the user and\/or redirect the user to the merchant site.","In one implementation, MR-Control may monitor whether the user is \u201cactually\u201d attending and watching the selected TV channel. For example, the user's mobile device may capture, aggregate and packetize atmospherics data (e.g., taking photos of the user, recoding audio clips, obtaining GPS information, etc.) and submit to the MR-Control, which may in turn decode the atmospherics data to analyze ad effect and audience perception, as further illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["105","105","105","105"],"i":["a ","c ","b "]},"Within implementations, the MR-Control platform  may interact with user mobile devices, e.g., PDAs, smart phones, etc., for targeted mobile advertisement delivery . For example, in one implementation, MR-Control platform may obtain a TV viewing status information from a user's mobile device, and determine the TV program content the user is\/has been watching based on TV schedules, as further discussed in . When MR-Control determines the user selected channel contains a TV ad of \u201cGeico\u201d , MR-Control may deliver promotions, rewards, coupons, questionnaires, etc., related to \u201cGeico\u201d as a targeted ad to the user mobile device.","In one implementation, MR-Control platform  may obtain data related to user interactive activities with regard to mobile ads, TV viewing, Internet  (including online browsing, purchasing, etc.), social media, and\/or the like to analyze ad effects, TV rating so that to determine delivery and performance of an advertisement campaign. Within implementations, the ad campaign planning , ad performance and ad delivery , may be separately executed by the MR-Control platform  for each media type, e.g., TV, print, Internet, social media, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["115","120","115","130"]},"In one implementation, upon instantiating the downloaded MR-Control client component, the user may receive a schedule listing of TV programs, and may select a channel that the user is interested. For example, the user may tap on the listed item to select \u201cCH2: CBS The Big Bang Theory .\u201d In one implementation, the MR-Control plug-in accessory  may receive the indication of user channel selection and transmit such indication to the home TV set , and the TV  may switch to the channel \u201cCBS \u201d accordingly.","In a further implementation, the user's selection of channel \u201cCBS \u201d may be transmitted to a MR-Control, which may in turn automatically populate a message on social media, e.g., a Facebook status update showing the user \u201cis watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS .\u201d In an alternative implementation, the user may elect to manually enter and populate the social media feeds via the MR-Control client component instantiated on his personal mobile device.","For another example, the social message, e.g., a Tweet message, may contextually tag the text on key terms to indicate what the user is watching, e.g., the Tweet hashtags \u201c#The Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201c#CBS,\u201d etc. In one implementation, the hashtags may link to profile information of a TV show, including its scheduled airing time, crew information, description, and\/or the like. In further implementations, the Tweet hashtags may be employed for social content data taxonomy engine, as further illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["115","105"]},"As shown in one example in , the personal mobile device  may automatically snap a photo and\/or a video clip of the audience scene including the audience  watching the TV program . For example, the MR-Control may be configured to snap a photo or video clip periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes, etc.). The MR-Control may then packetize the obtained photo\/video clip as audience atmospherics data  for audience attendance analysis.","In further implementations, MR-Control may include various data into the atmospherics data packets. For example, MR-Control may \u201clisten\u201d and record an audio clip of the audience scene. For another example, MR-Control may prompt the user to indicate how many audience are present to watch the on-going TV program. For another example, MR-Control may monitor whether the user is engaging in other application activities on the personal mobile device , e.g., email(s), Facebook, browser activities, gaming applications, etc. For another example, MR-Control may include GPS information of the personal mobile device  into the atmospherics data.","In one implementation, MR-Control may be configured to automatically create photo\/video\/audio captures. In another implementation, MR-Control may prompt the user to manually enter desired information, such as how many individuals are present to watch the TV program, and\/or request the user position the built-in camera of the mobile device to snap photos\/video clips. In one implementation, MR-Control may provide promotion incentives for the user to cooperate with such requests, e.g., lottery opportunities, etc.","In one implementation, MR-Control may analyze the obtained audience atmospherics data . For example, as shown in , MR-Control may identify the number of audience  at an associated timestamp from an audience scene photo\/video  via face recognition software, e.g., Apple iPhoto face recognition, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIGS. 2 and 7B"],"b":["115","130","145","123","150","145","155","123"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1D","FIGS. 5A-5F"],"b":["150","180","185"]},"In one implementation, MR-Control may generate a media analytics report  based on the obtained social media user comments to reflect audience reaction to the show \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d For example, in one implementation, the report may comprise statistical data with regard to audience age, demographics, occupation, etc. Further examples of media analytics report are discussed in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["233","220","250","270","219","280","250","213"],"i":"a"},"In one embodiment, the MR-Control may receive a list of real time TV program . For example, in one implementation, the TV program  data may comprise information such as channel information, media program information of each channel, program schedule information, and\/or the like.

Upon receiving a user request, the MR-Control server  may determine whether the user has registered with MR-Control . For example, in one implementation, the user may be a new user to the MR-Control application service, who may just download and install the mobile application but has not registered. If the user is not registered , the user may be requested to submit registration information, such as user name, phone number, email address, residential address, and\/or the like for registration . The MR-Control may also obtain a physical address, a hardware ID of the user mobile device, etc., for registration purposes.","In one implementation, upon registration, the MR-Control server  may obtain and store a user application ID, and\/or a session ID  to start the MR-Control service session. In one implementation, the MR-Control server  may obtain a real-time TV program listing , e.g., from a TV network, a TV broadcasting service, etc. In one implementation, the MR-Control server  may obtain the TV schedule updates on a periodical basis (e.g., daily, etc.), and store the TV schedule information at a TV schedule database. In one implementation, the user may receive a list of TV programs  via the MR-Control application, e.g., see  in .","In one implementation, the user mobile device may send a user event message  to the MR-Control server , and the MR-Control server may monitor user event messages  from the user device. As discussed in  and will be further discussed in , the received user event at  may comprise a variety of events\/messages, such as, but not limited to user TV event (e.g., in ), user device application event (e.g.,  in ), atmospherics data (e.g.,  in ), social content (e.g., in ), response to ads\/surveys (e.g.,  in ), and\/or the like.

In one implementation, the MR-Control retrieve a list of unprocessed TV message records (e.g., grouped per user profile)  from the raw data store . For every two consecutively received messages , the MR-Control may calculate the elapsed time in-between , and determine whether the elapse time is greater than a pre-determined surfing threshold (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.). For example, when the elapsed time is shorter than the surfing threshold, indicating the user may be frequently switching channels to browse the program, the MR-Control may not consider the channel selection message as effective TV viewing, and may filter such message records from TV viewing analysis .","In another implementation, when the elapsed time is greater than the surfing threshold , suggesting the user may at least spend an amount of time staying on the selected channel, the MR-Control may further determine whether the elapsed time is greater than a capping threshold . For example, when the elapsed time is too long, greater than the capping threshold (e.g., 2 hours, 3 hours, etc.), it may suggest a user may just let the TV on without watching. In such cases, MR-Control may apply capping edit rules to compute a \u201creal\u201d watching time . For example, if the elapsed time between a first TV channel switch and a second channel switch is 5 hours, the MR-Control may not log 5 hours as the watching time for the first selected channel, as the capping threshold is 2 hours. The MR-Control may in turn determine the watching time of the first selected channel as capped by a STB\/TV off event (e.g., when a STB\/TV off event is received during the elapsed time, the watching time may not exceed the timestamp of the STB\/TV off event), TV program end time (e.g., when the playing TV program on the first selected channel ends during the elapsed time, the watching time is calculated as the time elapse between the first TV channel event and the TV program end time), and\/or the like, e.g., at . In further implementations, the MR-Control may apply cutoff thresholds based on historical heuristics via statistical analysis . For example, the MR-Control may determine the watching time based on individual habits, e.g., a user has been observed to stay on the same channel for at most 1 hour, etc. For another example, the cut-off threshold may be analyzed by channel, e.g., 1 hour on CBS, 2 hours on ABC family, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, when the elapsed time does not exceed a capping threshold at , and\/or when the watching time has been re-calculated based on capping rules at , the MR-Control may retrieve TV program information on the user selected channel , and generate a user channel selection log file . For example, the log file may comprise fields such as user ID, channel ID, channel selection time, user watching time, channel program name, channel program ID, and\/or the like. Such generated log files may be fed to a user TV viewing data engine  for audience analytics . For example, the audience analytics database may be utilized to analyze TV viewing rates of a TV program, product\/brand impression of advertised products during the user watching time, and\/or the like. Exemplary audience analytics reports are discussed at .","the MR-Control server  may retrieve TV program information to determine the TV program played on the user selected channel . For example, the MR-Control may query on a TV program table (e.g., obtained at  at ) based on an instant timestamp and the user selected channel. The MR-Control may log the user channel selection with the timestamp  in a database, e.g., at in .","In one implementation, MR-Control may generate TV viewing data for the retrieve TV program . In one implementation, MR-Control may associate the user selection to the TV viewing rate of the retrieved TV program, and may refine the TV viewing rate with atmospherics analytics at . For example, in one implementation, the MR-Control may monitor groups of audience's channel selection, wherein the audience groups may be defined based on age, geography, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the MR-Control may generate an audience summary via a dashboard, e.g., see .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 2E","b":["289","289","296","296"],"i":["a","a","a","b"]},"In another implementation, the MR-Control may incorporate the received device application status (e.g., ) for user activity analytics. For example, the MR-Control may capture active application s running on the device from the received device application data, and determine user activities when viewing , e.g., emailing, browsing Internet content, texting, video gaming, and\/or the like. Such indicated user activity data may be incorporated into audience attendance estimation .","In one implementation, the artifact may comprise a visual data file , such as a video file (e.g., \u201cwmv,\u201d \u201cmp4,\u201d \u201cavi,\u201d \u201crm,\u201d etc.), an image file (e.g., \u201cJPEG,\u201d \u201cbmp,\u201d \u201ctiff,\u201d \u201cgif,\u201d etc.), and\/or the like. In one implementation, the MR-Control may determine graphical content  of the visual file. For example, the MR-Control may perform image analysis to determine whether the photo image, and\/or video frames comprise a scene of audience, and\/or a TV screen. In one implementation, a mobile application at the user mobile device, e.g., iPhone, etc., may perform face recognition at a photo taken at an iPhone, and integrate such data in the atmospherics data package, e.g., an iPhoto including two faces, etc. In another implementation, the MR-Control server may perform facial recognition to determine audience presence . In other implementations, the MR-Control server may perform image analysis to determine user activities in the photo image, e.g., reading a book, doing housework, and\/or the like. In further implementations, a MR-Control panelist may review the photo image and determine audience status.","In another implementation, the MR-Control may determine whether a TV screen image matches the TV program associated with the user channel selection , e.g., the user may switch to watch recorded program (e.g., TiVo, DVD player, etc.) instead of live TV program on the channel, and in such cases, the MR-Control may not receive an indication of such change. For example, in one implementation, MR-Control may perform image analysis to determine whether the received image photo (and\/or a video frame grab) contains a TV screen shot , e.g., by detecting edges of a rectangular shaped object on the image, etc. For another example, the MR-Control may store a plurality of sample screen shots from the TV program played at the user submitted channel, and may compare the received image photo with each of the stored sample screen shots. In further implementations, a MR-Control panelist may assist in reviewing and determining whether the user TV screen matches the played TV program. In one implementation, if the MR-Control determines the user is absent from a TV set, or engaging in other activities from the graphic analysis, MR-Control may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.","In another implementation, if the received atmospherics data comprises an audio artifact (e.g., with a file extension of \u201cway,\u201d \u201cmp3,\u201d \u201cape,\u201d \u201cm4a,\u201d etc.), the MR-Control may perform audio analysis to determine a content of the audio . For example, the MR-Control may analyze the frequency range of the audio content to determine the sound source, e.g., whether it is human voice, ambient noise, media broadcasting, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, if the audio content comprises human voice (e.g., within the frequency range 60\u02dc7000 Hz), the MR-Control may determine whether the human voice is from the audience or broadcasting media. For example, the MR-Control may perform voice recognition to determine whether the human voice matches with any of the characters in the TV program on air on the user submitted channel, e.g., at .. If not, the MR-Control may determine such human voices may indicate audience presence , e.g., whether more than one user is present with the TV set.","In further implementations, if the audio file comprises human voice, the MR-Control may extract verbal content from the audio file to determine whether an audience conversation, or a human conversation from media playing, is related to the TV program on air on the user submitted channel .. For example, the MR-Control may adopt speech recognition software (e.g., Nuance, IBM WebSphere Voice, etc.) to extract key terms from the conversation, and compare whether the key terms are related to key words stored with the TV program in the database. For example, if MR-Control extracts key terms \u201cquantum mechanics,\u201d \u201cphysics,\u201d \u201cbig bang,\u201d etc., from the human conversation in the received atmospherics audio artifact, and the user submitted channel CBS is playing \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d MR-Control may determine the audience is watching the show on air. In such cases, the MR-Control may not need to distinguish whether the human conversation in the audio file is from the audience or TV, but focus on mining the content of the conversation.","In another implementation, if the MR-Control determines the audio artifact comprises ambient noise, MR-Control may determine an environment of the audience . For example, if the background is overly noisy, the user may not be watching the TV program.","In another implementation, if the MR-Control determines the audio artifact comprises media sound (e.g., music, etc.), the MR-Control may determine whether the audio media content matches the TV program on air on the user submitted channel via a media recognition software (e.g., a Shazam alike music recognition kit, etc.). For example, if the user selected channel CBS has \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d scheduled at the moment, but the MR-Control determines a Lady Gaga song in the received audio atmospherics, this may indicate the user is not watching the TV program. In one implementation, if the MR-Control determines the user is distracted from the TV program based on the audio content, MR-Control may generate negative heuristics with regard to TV viewing data of the TV program on air.","In an alternative implementation, the MR-Control client component, which may be instantiated on a user mobile device (e.g., a downloadable application such as, but not limited to an iPhone application, an Android application, etc.) and\/or a table top standalone unit, may obtain atmospherics data to determine the program the user is watching without user indication of the channel. For example, the MR-Control component may obtain audio recording, video recording, signatures image captures, and\/or the like of the audience watching environment, and submit the obtained data to MR-Control server. In one implementation, the MR-Control server may analyze the obtained data to determine what the audience is watching in a similar manner as illustrated at ,  in , but without the user's channel selection indication.","In one implementation, the MR-Control may perform an audio\/video recognition procedure to identify a TV program, e.g., via digital signatures embedded in the program, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the MR-Control may extract key terms from the audio\/video captures, and form a query on a database of TV programs to find a match. For example, in one implementation, the MR-Control may extract textual terms from the obtained audio media program excerpts, such as \u201cbig bang,\u201d \u201cquantum physics,\u201d \u201cSheldon,\u201d etc., and may form a query in a database of TV programs which may return a result indicating the obtained audio media program excerpt may be related to the TV show \u201cBig Bang Theory.\u201d","In an alternative implementation, rather than uploading sampling and\/or the entirety of the captured audio\/video median content, the MR-Control may analyze the recorded audio\/video content to generate a unique signature and\/or a unique hash, which may be used for further matching. For example, the unique signature\/hash may take a form similar to a sequence of 0-1 representation of a sampling of the recorded media content. In one implementation, the signature\/hash generation may be performed at a user device (e.g., the user's mobile phone, the table top unit, etc.), which may upload the generated signature\/hash sequence to the MR-Control server. In another implementation, the user device may upload media content sampling, clips or the captured entirety to the MR-Control server, which may then perform the signature generation. Within implementations, software tools\/components such as, but not limited to i-brainz, and\/or the like may be adopted to generate audio signature\/hash.","In further implementations, such \u201clisten-in\u201d activities may be performed on a standalone table unit, which may communicate with a user computer via a wireless network, and\/or transmit the \u201clisten-in\u201d results to the MR-Control server.","In further implementations, lighting sensor data may indicate the lighting condition of the user environment to determine the viewing status. GPS information contained in the atmospherics data may indicate whether the user is located with the home TV , e.g., by comparing the instant GPS location with a registered user residential address, etc.","In one implementation, MR-Control may analyze the variety of atmospherics data to determine whether the user should be accorded as a \u201cviewer\u201d of the real-time TV program on air. In one implementation, as shown in , the MR-Control server may adopt a procedure to generate a progressive weighted sum of atmospherics scores to determine whether the user is \u201cwatching\u201d or \u201cnot watching.\u201d When the weighted sum of different atmospherics scores exceeds a predetermined threshold, the user may be considered \u201cnot watching,\u201d and the MR-Control may not need to proceed with further atmospherics analysis to improve efficiency of the atmospherics analytics.","For example, at in  (e.g., comparing received user GPS information with the user's registered residential address in ), the MR-Control may determine an address type , and may assign a weight to the GPS atmospherics factor based on the address type from an atmospherics GPS weight table .

In one implementations, such taxonomy rules may be stored in a repository , and the original social text data and social graph, tagged social data may be stored at . Further implementations and applications of the taxonomy rules are discussed in .","In one implementation, the social media measurement reports may provide a user feedback measurement report to a user via UI integration and data visualization. Within implementations, the reporting portal may leverage the web based visual components (e.g. word cloud, traffic light components etc) provided by the social media analytics platform  for analysis that deliver insights purely on social media data. In further implementations, for insights generated on combined data set from social and other data sources (e.g., via data mesh-up  between the structured data analytics platform and unstructured data analytics platform , etc.) the taxonomy management console may be integrated to an integrated reporting portal to ensure the clients have the self service capability of defining the taxonomy and building the reports.

Further implementations of the ad identification are discussed in .","In further implementations, the MR-Control may track a user's browsing history by monitoring a stream of \u201cclicks\u201d the user has submitted on his mobile device. For example, the MR-Control may monitor user's \u201cclicks\u201d to determine a type of the click, e.g., usage of media playing, visits of a different URL link, posting of social media contents, usage of an application, and\/or the like. Using an app. The MR-Control may then determine advertisement exposure associated with each \u201cclick\u201d (e.g., via ad image identification illustrated in ).","In another implementation, the received data may comprise application information from the user device . The proxy server may ascertain an application inventory list of the user device , and\/or application group sharing information . For example, one or more users who are Facebook friends, may form a group to share their interested TV watch list and viewing status via MR-Control, and such information may be captured by the proxy server.","In another implementation, the received data may comprise indication of media usage , e.g., channel selection, atmospherics data, etc., the MR-Control may determine whether the TV program on the selected channel has been listened, watched, and\/or streamed .

In one implementation, the MR-Control may create a unified dataset that profiles audiences for TV and online media consumption, wherein each viewing source (e.g., individual TV set, household TV set, etc.) with viewing and ad exposure information for TV and online is associated with a unique identifier. For example, MR-Control may adopt direct linkage by getting TV and online data for the same household (e.g., via ISP, cable provider, etc.). For another example, the MR-Control may segment TV and online data, and link using segments (e.g., segmented by program category, zip code, air time, etc.). For another example, the MR-Control may devise and distribute survey questions about TV viewing and linking with the respondents' online surfing data. In one embodiment, the MR-Control may obtain media consumption data from a variety of channels, such as, but not limited to geographically dispersed TV viewing data sets (e.g., CANOE), persons tracking with EPGs or embedded in TV software or cell phones, metering data from STB, individual smartphone (e.g., Apple iPhone, etc.) based tracking (e.g., social content, persons' watching activities, etc.), and\/or the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0265","num":"0264"},"figref":["FIG. 7F","FIG. 7E"],"b":["740","772","771"]},"For digital advertising (online and mobile), MR-Control may classify the advertisements via a hybrid manual\/automatic process. For example, MR-Control may adopt a mobile or PC-based system (using a software meter, VPN, and\/or Proxy Server, among other technologies) to pass along to a staging server the URL of the ad, along with the actual file (typically a .gif, .jpg, or .png). For example, upon receiving ad data including URLs and associated digital files (e.g., media program excerpt files, etc.) via a network connection , the MR-Control server  may compare the received advertisement data with ad profiles in a database . The filename, file size, and other data may be compared against an ad database, and if the ad has already been classified, then the new ad exposure event is transmitted to a classification engine  classified based on classification rules in the database. Classification rules may include brand and product mentions, as well as ad size and other descriptors. If a match is not found, then the ad is put in a queue for manual classification by a MR-Control representative. For example, the MR-Control representative may identify the object (e.g., a product, a brand name, etc.) that is advertised within the ad.","In one implementation, the advertisement may be identified via graphical content match, as discussed in . In an alternative implementation, the ad identification may be performed via an automated system, by which ads that do not match any items in the ad database may be examined automatically by a computer program for clues as to the proper classification. For example, when an ad that mentions Acura in the ad image, the MR-Control may automatically classify the ad as an Acura advertisement. Within implementations, the MR-Control may perform character recognition procedures (e.g., optical character recognition, etc.) to obtain key terms from advertisement images for advertising exposure identification. Such ad identification may be used for advertising effectiveness measurement.

An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the operation of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational operators such as decoders or mathematical operations. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be circuit flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the MR-Control may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate MR-Control controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the MR-Control.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the MR-Control controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the operation of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; however, such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  may include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage.

These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the MR-Control controller.

The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may facilitate the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the MR-Control controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the MR-Control controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like.

The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the MR-Control controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like.

Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the MR-Control. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the MR-Control as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","Computer interfaces in some respects are similar to automobile operation interfaces.

Cryptographic processor interfaces may allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like.

The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the MR-Control database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like.

Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of capabilities encapsulated within a given object. If the MR-Control database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the MR-Control database  may be integrated into another component such as the MR-Control component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures.

To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.","The configuration of the MR-Control controller may depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), Jini local and remote application program interfaces, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.","For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\nw3c-post http:\/\/ . . . Value1\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., JSON, SOAP, and\/or like parsers) that may be employed to parse (e.g., communications) data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration may depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","For example, in some implementations, the MR-Control controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) socket server via the information sherver, which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data, e.g., data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication, the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device, parse the received JSON-encoded text data to extract information from the JSON-encoded text data into PHP script variables, and store the data (e.g., client identifying information, etc.) and\/or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d).
