No. 60\/269,478, filed Feb. 20, 2001; each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to high energy, non-aqueous electrolyte based electrochemical energy storage devices such as high energy density batteries or high power electrochemical capacitors which are non-flammable. More particularly, this invention relates to non-flammable high energy, non-aqueous electrolyte based electrochemical energy storage devices containing an electrolyte solution including alkyl phosphate, which afford protection of the electrodes from the electrolyte at wide temperature ranges, and reduce ignition risks.","2. Discussion of the Prior Art","High voltage and high energy density rechargeable batteries based on non-aqueous electrolyte solutions are widely used as electric sources for various types of consumer electronic appliances, such as camcorders, notebook computers, and cell phones, because of their high voltage and high energy density as well as their reliability such as storage characteristics. This type of battery conventionally employs the complexed oxides of lithium and a transition metal as positive electrode, such as LiCoO, LiNiO, LiMnO, and variations of the previous oxides with different dopants and different stoichiometry, and additionally includes lithium metal, lithium alloys and\/or carbonaceous materials as a negative electrode. Chosen over the lithium metal and lithium alloys are carbonaceous negative electrode materials, which are in general partially or fully graphitized and specially modified natural graphite. When a carbonaceous negative electrode is used, this battery is often referred to as a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, because no pure lithium metal is present in the negative electrode. During charge and discharge processes, the lithium ions are intercalated into and de-intercalated from the carbonaceous negative electrode, respectively. The advantages of using these negative electrodes is that problems associated with growth of lithium metal dendrites is avoided. Such dendrites are often observed in lithium or lithium alloy negative electrodes, and is known to cause short-circuiting of the cells.","Battery manufacturers have been trying to replace the widely used electrolyte solvent ethylene carbonate (EC) with propylene carbonate (PC), because the latter is cheaper and also improves low-temperature performance. However, the high power negative electrode material graphite is known to disintegrate in presence of PC (a process called \u201cexfoliation\u201d), and accordingly destroys battery performance.","It is recognized that the Li-ion cells work well in the carbonate solvent systems. This is due to the protection film formation on the carbon electrodes in the carbonate solvent system, as described in Koshina et al., \u201cRelationship between Electrolyte and Graphite Electrode in Lithium Ion Batteries,\u201d 1, Big Island of Hawaii, 5-7 Jan. 1998, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Upon the first charge of the lithium ion cell, the electrolyte decomposes at both anode and cathode, and the consequent decomposition product forms a dense film covering the aforementioned electrode surface. This film is permeable only to migrating lithium ions, but insulating to electrons. Therefore, the stability of this protection film constitutes the foundation on which the lithium ion battery functions. The ability of this film to resist dissolution into the carbonate-based solvents at different temperatures is a key-factor to the capacity retention and life cycle of the cell under different application environments. The carbonate-based electrolyte works well in a temperature range from \u221220 to 50\u00b0 C. Recent studies of the liquidus temperature ranges of the binary carbonate systems, such as Ding et al., \u201cLiquid-Solid Phase Diagrams of Binary Carbonates for Lithium Batteries,\u201d J. 147 (5), 1688 (2000), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, have shown that, the electrolyte freezes at temperatures below \u221220\u00b0 C. To extend the temperature range to lower temperatures, it has been suggested, as described in Plichta et al., \u201cLow Temperature Electrolyte for Lithium and Lithium-Ion Batteries,\u201d 38, p. 444, Cherry Hill, N.J., 8-11 Jun. 1998, and Smart et al., \u201cDevelopment of High Conductivity Lithium-ion Electrolytes for Low Temperature Cell Applications,\u201d 38, p. 452, Cherry Hill, N.J., 8-11 Jun. 1998 (each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) to employ ternary solvent systems. As shown by Plichta et al., this approach works for a pure Li metal anode but it does not work properly for carbonaceous anode due to the high cell impedance involved at sub-ambient temperatures. This is because the film formed on the pure Li metal is different from that formed on the carbon surfaces.","Capacity loss as a result of high temperature storage and capacity fading when the cell is cycled at elevated temperatures are also problems in known Li-ion batteries. The protection layer that is believed to be formed in a mixture of one or two cyclic carbonates and one or more linear carbonates containing a lithium salt becomes eventually unstable at elevated temperatures, such that new films must be formed in each charging cycle, causing progressively fading capacity.","It is therefore desirable to have an electrolyte that can react with electrodes upon charge and form a better protection layer on either the anode or the cathode than those are formed by the mixture of cyclic and linear carbonates. It is more advantageous to have an electrolyte that can form better protection layers on both electrodes simultaneously. An electrolyte co-solvent, such as an organofluorine-containing compound, which has a C\u2014F covalent bond that is both chemically and electrochemically inert and that will stay in the protection film after the compound is electrochemically decomposed on either electrodes, can potentially provide the best reaction product for the protection film on electrodes in highly oxidative and reductive reaction environment of Li batteries and Li-ion batteries, because organofluorine compounds are more resistant to salvation by carbonate solvent systems, in addition to its chemical\/electrochemical stability.","The efforts of searching for such an electrolyte along this line of thought have been reported by others. For example, Nakano et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,730, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, provided a fluorine-containing dioxolane compound is provided to improve charge and discharge cycle life of lithium rechargeable batteries or electric double layer capacitors. Besenhard et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,916,708, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, provided partially fluorinated ethers that can enhance the safety of rechargeable lithium cells. Yokoyama et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,010,806, herein incorporated by reference in is entirety, provided fluoromethyl ethylene carbonate, which is excellent in voltage and charge and discharge cycle characteristics. These fluorinated compounds are very specific in that both the location and the degree of fluorination must be elaborately chosen so that the properties of the formed protection films can afford the expected properties. However, each of these systems exhibit problems related to flammability and ignition of the electrolyte solution.","Alkyl phosphates as a class of compound have been considered as flame retardants for lithium\/lithium ion cells as is disclosed by Yokoyama et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,684 and Narang et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,600, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. However, as will be described herein, the resulting electrolytes and electrolyte cells nevertheless are, in fact, flammable. Yokoyama et al. attempts to solve the flammability problem by providing a self-extinguishing electrolyte, which does initially ignite. Therefore, although the risk of flammability is reduced by the electrolyte of Yokoyama et al., there is nevertheless, ignition and the potential for flare-ups.","The present invention pertains to non-aqueous electrolyte system for a lithium or lithium ion battery, based on a lithium metal, lithium-alloy or a carbonaceous material as the anode, and a lithiated metal oxide as cathode. More specifically, this invention pertains to a series of electrolyte co-solvents, which are based on fluorinated alkyl phosphates in the general structural formula I: \n\n\nwherein R, R, and Rmay be the same or different, are normal or branched alkyl groups of carbon numbers between 1 and 5.\n","Still more specifically, it is preferred that at least one of the three alkyl groups is fluorinated, with the locations of the fluorination being at least \u03b2-positioned away from the phosphorus atom and the fluorination degree being high enough to provide an effective protecting film on both the anode and the cathode.","Still more specifically, the fluorination degree, as defined by a F\/H ratio, which is the ratio between the number of alkyl fluorine atoms and the remaining alkyl hydrogen atoms, can be at least higher than 0.25 so that protecting film formed on anode will be both stable and effective.","Fluorination in compliance with the above specifics can form protection layers on not only the anode but also the cathode. Consequently, the problems relating to storage life and capacity fading at elevated temperature in Li-ion batteries have been minimized.","Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a series of new fluorinated alkyl phosphates as co-solvents for non-aqueous electrolytes, which is preferred for non-aqueous electrolyte rechargeable batteries. It is another object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous electrolyte system based on the solution of a lithium salt dissolved in one or more cyclic carbonate, and one or more linear carbonate and one or more afore-mentioned phosphates. It is further an object of the present invention to provide a rechargeable lithium battery or lithium ion battery systems using the afore-mentioned electrolyte systems, which afford improved capacity utilization, high capacity retention, improved rate capability, long storage life and low capacity retention at elevated temperatures, as well as non-flammability.","In this invention, a series of fluorinated compounds based on alkyl phosphates are provided which are fluorinated at specific alkyl locations with specific degree of fluorination. Further provided are non-aqueous electrolytes consisting of the afore-mentioned fluorinated alkyl phosphate as a co-solvent in a mixture of cyclic and linear alkyl carbonates with a lithium salt. The electrolyte fabricated in accordance with the present invention can form more stable protection films on both the anode and the cathode of both the lithium and lithium-ion cell simultaneously. As a result, the lithium and lithium-ion cells using such electrolytes exhibit improved charge\/discharge capacity, improved charge\/discharge cycle life and improved rate capabilities, at room temperatures and above, as compared to the cells without the co-solvents. The lithium and lithium-ion cells using such electrolytes further showed substantial improvement in safety with respect to applications at elevated temperature and abuse as well as accidents.","While introducing flame retarding ability to the lithium cells, the present invention improves the cell performance simultaneously by tailoring the structure of the phosphates as not demonstrated by conventional batteries. The present applicants have discovered that fluorinated alkyl phosphates, wherein both the location of fluorination on the alky substituents and fluorine\/hydrogen ratio are as described in this invention, will work in the high voltage lithium\/lithium ion cells using highly oxidative cathode and highly reductive anode, and especially in lithium ion cells where highly sensitive carbonaceous material is used as anode.","Additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts in the several views.","The present invention provides specific fluorinated alkyl phosphates of the general formula I, \n\n\nwherein R, R, and Rmay be the same or different, are normal or branched alkyl groups of carbon numbers between 1 and 5. Specific fluorination of the alkyls R, R, and Ris preferred to realize the full extent of the benefits of the invention, with respect to both the fluorination location and the degree of fluorination.\n","It is preferred that at least one of these three alkyl groups is fluorinated, with the locations of the fluorination being at least \u03b2-positioned away from phosphorus and the F\/H ratio being at least 0.25, preferably greater than 0.25. More preferably, at least two of these three alkyl groups are fluorinated, with the degree of fluorination being at least \u00be of the total substitutable alkyl protons.","As used herein \u201cPOF\u201d\u00b0is used to designate the fluorinated alkyl phosphates in compliance with the above specifics. Examples of fluorinated alkyl phosphate according to the present invention include, but are not limited to tris(trifluoroethyl)phosphate (POF-I), bis(trifluoroethyl)methyl phosphate (POF-II), diethyltrifluoroethyl phosphate (POF-III), and tris(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propyl)phosphate (POF-IV).","The synthesis of a fluorinated alkyl phosphate in accordance with the present invention is explained as follows, which are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.","The present invention further provides non-aqueous electrolytes consisting of a fluorinated alkyl phosphate as a co-solvent and a mixture of cyclic carbonates of general formula II and linear carbonates of general formula III: \n\n\n","Preferably, the mixture of either ethylene carbonate (Ris ethylene in formula II) or propylene carbonate (Ris methylethylene in formula II) with either dimethylcarbonate (Rand Rare methyl in formula III), diethylcarbonate (Rand Rare ethyl in formula III) or ethylmethylcarbonate (Rand Rare methyl and ethyl, respectively, in formula III) is used to constitute the carbonate solvent system, and a lithium salt, is dissolved into the solvent system, and one or more of fluorinated alkyl phosphates of general formula I is used as co-solvent, with the weight parts ranging between 5% to 80%.","The solutes used in the present invention may be lithium salts, such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF), lithium imide (LiN(SOCF)), lithium trifluorosulfonate (LiCFSO), lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF), and lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF). LiPFis preferred.","Control examples of alkyl phosphates without fluorination, i.e. trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and triethyl phosphate (TEP), are used as comparison to electrolytes of the present invention. As is described below, the alkyl phosphate in accordance with the present invention achieves the advantages of the invention, including improved charge\/discharge capacity, cycle life, rate capability, storage life, and non-flammability.

The solution was shaken occasionally to accelerate the salt dissolution.","Carbonaceous anode and Lithium metal oxide cathode material were coated onto copper and aluminum substrates, so that the unit area capacity was 0.93 mAh\/cm. The electrodes were cut into discs of 1.27 cm(anode) and 0.97 cm(cathode) for use. Celgard 2400 was used in all cases as separator.","Three configuration of the electrode configuration for cyclic voltammetry tests (CV) is shown in FIG. . The CV tests were conducted at slow scan (<0.1 mV\/s) to study the electrochemical reactions of the electrolyte on either anode or cathode working electrode. The potential of the working electrode was controlled and the current monitored by an EG&G potentiostat Model 273, and the potential ranges studied are between open circuit potential (OCV) and 0.1 V (vs. Li\/Li) for the anode, and between OCV and 4.3 V for the cathode.","Full lithium ion cells vial cell, whose structure is shown in , or button cell design (structure shown in ) were used to study cycling behavior of the non-aqueous electrolyte system in the full cell after the electrolyte was vacuum-filled onto the electrodes\/separator in a separate chamber.

For an electrolyte solution containing POF-I, where F\/H ratio is 1.5, from 5 weight percent up to 40 weight percent, the CE at the first cycle was always lower than 100%, suggesting that POF-I reacts with the carbon anode to form a film of decomposition product on electrode surface. The CE that increased to 100% in the subsequent cycles suggests that a film is formed and is protecting the carbon anode. In longer term cell performance as well as storage, the advantage of possessing such films will be shown.","The CE for an electrolyte containing POF-II, having a F\/H ratio is 0.86, shows similar behavior as the interaction of POF-I on its anode. Both POF-I and POF-II in a very broad range of weight percentages (5%-approximately 40%) show this ability to form the stable protecting film on a carbonaceous anode (Table 1).","POF-III, having a F\/H ratio of 0.25, forms a far less effective protecting film on the anode, as Table 1 shows. At weight percentages close to or below 20%, a stable film fails to form, and electrolyte decomposition accompanied with electrode exfoliation occurs, as indicated by the lack of Li-intercalation in subsequent cycles. Electrolyte systems containing less POF-III, e.g., 5-10%, do support Li-intercalation, but the film is not stable in longer term, as it will be shown in cell cycling results.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"CE (%)",{}]},{"entry":[{},"of the","CE (%) at the"]},{"entry":[{},"1","2nd-4th cycles"]},{"entry":["Electrolyte Systems","cycle","cycles"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1)","86","100 (2), 100 (3),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"99 (4)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 5% POF-I","84","99 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 10% POF-I","89","99 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 15% POF-I","88","98 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 20% POF-I","92","100 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 M LiPF\/EC-EMC-POF-I (1:1:1)","95","97 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC-POF-I (20:40:40)","92","99 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC-POF-II (20:40:40)","89","100 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 10% POF-III","88","96 (2), 100 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 m LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 20% POF-III","110","No Li+-intercalation"]},{"entry":[{},{},"since 2cycle."]},{"entry":["1 M LiPF\/EC-EMC (1:1) + 5% TEP","102","110 (2), 110 (3)"]},{"entry":["1 M LiPF\/EC-EMC-TEP (1:1:1)","\u02dc200","No Li+-intercalation"]},{"entry":[{},{},"since 1st cycle."]},{"entry":["1 M LiPF\/EC-EMC-TMP (1:1:1)",">200","No Li+-intercalation"]},{"entry":[{},{},"since 1st cycle."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The control phosphates, i.e. triethyl phosphate (TEP) and trimethyl phosphate (TMP), which are non-fluorinated and whose F\/H ratios are both 0, show poor film-forming ability on carbonaceous anodes.

Obviously, the reason for the alkyl phosphates of this invention to remain stable on the cathode is the specific fluorination at these certain locations and to certain degree.","From the above examples and their comparative examples, we demonstrated that the compounds according to the present invention are stable with not only the highly reductive carbonaceous anode material at potentials near Li\/Libut also with the highly oxidative cathode materials at potentials above 4.3 V versus Li\/Li. To further demonstrate the utility of the present invention, a full cell was used to demonstrate the stability and other benefits of using compounds of the present invention.","The full cells tested were made of the anode and the cathode as indicated by Example 6.

The test was improved by minimizing the exposure of sample to air and also eliminating the wetting ability factor. Thus, an oval-instead of linear-shaped wick was used, and self-extinguishing time (SET) instead of burning distance was recorded for each pre-weighed sample. Such an oval-wick (e.g. a cotton swab) of approximately 1.0 cm in length and about 0.5 cm in diameter at the widest part in center can absorb 0.05-0.10 g electrolyte, and a good linear relationship was found between the extinguishing time and sample weight. To define a new quantity to describe the electrolyte flammability, the extinguishing time was normalized against sample weight. Compared with the above \u201cburning rate\u201d measurement, the present inventors found that this quantification makes better distinction for the electrolytes whose flammability has been greatly reduced to that of nearly non-flammable, i.e., the new method is more suitable for samples of low flammability, while the burning rate measurement is more appropriate for flammable samples.","Based on the new quantification, the electrolytes tested were classified into 3 categories: (1) non-flammable (SET<6, resulting in flame extinction within 0.5 s and more accurate time-reading is insignificant); (2) flammable (SET>20, wherein the flame lasted longer than 2 s and the linear carbonates were completely combusted); and (3) retarded (the cases lying between flammable and non-flammable).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"]},"Self-extinguishing time normalized against liquid mass (SET) was used to quantify the flammability of the electrolytes. It was obtained by igniting pre-weighed electrolyte solutions either soaked in a porous wick or contained in a stainless steel can, followed by recording the time it took for the flame to extinguish. There is good consistence between these two means to immobilize the electrolyte solutions. For electrolyte samples nearly non-flammable the wick material (glass wool or cotton fiber) makes little difference in the result, however, for samples that are very flammable (e.g., control electrolyte), an inert wick such as glass wool is preferred.  shows that at higher than 20% of alkyl phosphate of the present invention, the electrolytes are non-flammable. However, in order to ensure complete non-flammability, a weight percentage of greater than about 27% is preferred. The additional alkyl phosphate is preferred to a percentage of greater than 20%, because, as shown in , the curve representing the flammability of the electrolyte solution continues to drop until an alkyl phosphate according to the invention percentage of about 27% is reached. At a concentration of about 27%, alkyl phosphate according to the present invention, the resulting electrolyte solution has a SET of about zero.","As comparison, various commercially available flame-retardants, TEP and TMP are shown. The flame-retarding ability of the invention (POF-I and POF-II) is obviously superior to that of TMP and TEP. At concentrations above 20% by weight the electrolytes are rendered non-flammable, while concentrations above about 27% are preferred to produce completely non-flammable electrolytes. Stability data also shows even levels of 50% POF-I, the electrolyte maintains its performance in lithium ion batteries.","On Graphite-Protection in Presence of Propylene Carbonate (PC)","Another achievement of this invention is that high content of POF-I (>20%) not only renders non-flammability to the electrolyte, but also protects the graphite structure in presence of PC-rich electrolyte, thus making it possible to replace EC with PC. Again, an even higher POF concentration (e.g. greater than about 27%) increases the non-flammability and graphite protection provided by the electrolyte formulation.  show the effect of POF-contents on stability of graphite structure in PC-containing electrolytes. From the description above, and the conventional art, it is known that graphite electrodes cannot be practically used with electrolytes containing a significant portion of PC, as the graphite cannot be cycled. However, as indicated in , the addition of about 20% POF-I, permits the cycling of a graphite electrode.","Finally,  shows how differing percentages of POF-I protect the graphite electrode. Specifically, at 5%, although the discharge capacity is substantially uniform, the capacity level is not high enough to be practical. Although once 10% POF-I is used, the capacity becomes much higher, the capacity level shows a marked decrease as the cycle numbers increase; this trend will continue as the number of cycles continues. As the POF % breaks the 20% barrier (i.e. 20% and 40%), a high and relatively constant discharge capacity can be seen. This indicates that the addition of greater than 20% POF-I, preferably greater than about 27%, the graphite is completely cycled such that additional cycles do not exhibit a decrease in capacity.","Although described with reference to preferred embodiments, it should readily understood that various changes and\/or modifications could be made to the invention without departing from the spirit thereof.
