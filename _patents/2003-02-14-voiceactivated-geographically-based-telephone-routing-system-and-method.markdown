title: Voice-activated geographically based telephone routing system and method
abstract: A method and system for determining, through voice recognition, the geographic location of the initiator of a telephone call. The initiator dials a specified telephone number and is connected to a computer system. The telephone number dialed is used in a system that requires knowledge of the initiator's location to determine the recipient of the call. The system asks the initiator one of a series of questions, those questions designed by the user of the system (client) to determine which one of a plurality of recipients should receive the call. The initiator's verbal response to each question is digitized using speech recognition technology. The system uses each digitized response to either assign a location designator to the call or ask more definitive questions. At the point where the answers have satisfied the client's location determination, the point of call origination is determined and a locational designator is assigned to the initiator. The locational designator generated by the system can be correlated to a number of geographic designations, such as postal indicators (e.g., zip code, zip +4, postal code), major and minor civil divisions, latitude and longitude, geographic boundaries, political boundaries or client-defined geography such as service areas, sales territories, or delivery territories. The locational designator of the initiator is used in place of the ANI in location-based call routing systems. As a result of such correlation, this invention is particularly useful for cellular telephones, non stationary communications devices, emergency services, dealer locator systems, and delivery services, or any application where the initiator is connected to one of a plurality of recipients based on matching the initiator's location to client-defined criteria, including wherein a recipient's number is a local telephone number. The locational designator may be defined by a point, a line, a geographic area, an intersection, or by client-defined criteria.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09\/059,857, filed Apr. 14, 1998, now abandoned.","This invention relates to systems for locating the geographic origination of the initiator of a telephone call and more particularly to one that uses voice recognition to determine the locational designator of the caller without the need to correlate the initiator's telephone number to other databases.","In the field of telephone call processing, current art provides a process that allows a client (user of the invention) to use a single telephone number to connect initiators who dial that telephone number to one of a plurality of recipients. The selection of recipient is based on the geographic origination of the call and client-defined criteria. Some examples of location based routing with pluralities of recipients include \u201c800\u201d-type numbers (for example 800, 888, 877, 866, and 900 applications, among others), applications where the recipient pays for the call, dealer locator systems, local routing based on a published local number, and emergency numbers, such as \u201c911\u201d in the U.S. These are but a few examples of location-based routing.","The initiator's telephone number is identified using Automatic Number Identification (ANI). The ANI is often correlated to a unique geographic reference, such as Vertical\/Horizontal (VH) coordinates, latitude\/longitude (lat\/lon), ZIP+4, or a locational designator for example. A predefined method is used, such as an on-line computation or a database lookup, to match the ANI and\/or its locational designator to one of a plurality of a client's recipients corresponding to one of a plurality of territorial designators, and the call is sent to the appropriate recipient telephone number.","ANI-based systems, such as the one described above, work correctly when the call is placed from a fixed location telephone, and the ANI that is forwarded matches the initiator's telephone number. Local telephone companies operating in areas without equal-access do not provide ANI; as a result the ANI is often 0000000000, as compared with a normal ANI of 4076823022. Local phone companies have begun offering to their customers \u201cANI blockage\u201d or \u201cno ANI forwarded\u201d packages. Calls placed from cellular phones present another set of problems in terms of locating the point of origin of the call.","When using a cellular telephone, the ANI reported is often not the ANI of the cellular phone, but that of a standard land line where the cellular phone connects. This connection point is called a trunk line. The phone number that is reported is called the pseudo-ANI. The particular cellular company to which the caller subscribes assigns a pseudo-ANI to this trunk line. The trunk line's pseudo-ANI is then used for call processing, instead of the telephone number of the cellular phone. When calling from a given cellular phone, the pseudo-ANI that forwarded is the same for any cellular telephone caller for the trunk line, regardless of the physical location of the caller.","Another problem arises in trying to determine the geographic location from where a cellular caller initiates. If an initiator dials an 800 number from home using a standard telephone, the initiator's locational designator will always be the same. With a cellular phone, however, if an initiator were to place two calls 5 minutes apart while driving on an interstate, for example, it is highly possible that the second call would have a locational designator 4-6 miles away from the locational designator of the first call. A third call could give yet a different locational designator.","An additional problem exists when people place calls from cellular phones to 800 numbers. The recipient of the call, who also pays for the call, does not receive an accurate ANI that can be used to identify who made the call. Often, there is not a way to get back in touch with a caller. As the use of cellular phones increases, the impact of \u2018unknown\u2019 calls from cellular phones can be significant to a business relying on 800 type numbers.","The lack of an effective system for locating cellular-telephone callers is a grave concern, particularly in emergency situations, criminal acts on people, and any situation where a person does not know where he or she is located. This is also a problem in systems such as dealer locator systems, where the location of the caller must be known before the call can connect to the final destination.","Therefore, in view of the above, a need exists to find a different method to determine the exact location of a call initiator. This method is based on using the initiator's verbal response to a series of computer-generated questions, digitizing the answers to those questions using voice recognition technology, and using those answers to further process the call. It is important to remember that there is a difference between Voice Response Units, which are typically used to speak back information to the caller, and Voice Recognition, which digitizes the caller's vocal input and uses that digitized input to perform additional processing.","The known prior art includes many U.S. patents, but none employs voice recognition in a system and method for routing telephone calls like the present invention. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,588,048, issued to Neville on Dec. 24, 1996 (reissued on Feb. 23, 1999 as RE36,111) teaches a system wherein a latitude and longitude can be assigned to an ANI for use in routing calls from ANIs in geographical territories to preselected locations. U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,267, issued to Riskin on Jul. 12, 1988, teaches a geocoding system that uses a \u201clogic tree\u201d concept and vertical-horizontal coordinates for locational purposes, but it does not use voice recognition and thus would not be useable with cellular telephones as in the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,633, issued to Tejada, et al. on Aug. 4, 1992, teaches a merchant and card authorization system which uses voice request. U.S. Pat. No. 5,247,571, issued to Kay, et al. on Sep. 21, 1993, teaches an area wide Centrex system for connecting members of a group. U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,390, issued to Yoshie, et al. on Oct. 20, 1992, teaches a method of providing a network service through a series of modules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,295 issued to Furman on Nov. 7, 1995, covers a voice mail system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,506,897, issued to Moore, et al. on Apr. 9, 1996, employs location determining means, but does not use voice recognition. U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,520 issued to Barzegar, et al. on Sep. 24, 1996, involves a wireless system for obtaining location information which utilizes GPS and cellular communication in determining location of mobile vehicles, but it does not employ voice recognition. U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,149 issued to Langsenkamp on Dec. 28, 1999 provides a means for a callee to provide the callee's location to the system, but does not provide a means for caller communication of location information. Furthermore, Langsenkamp's teachings all deal with outbound call processing. U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,069 issued to Takaki on Feb. 22, 2000 teaches how to locate a caller when the caller can locate visual reference point, but does not teach a means of locating a caller on a highway between cities or connecting a caller to one of a plurality of locations based on the caller's location. U.S. Pat. No. 6,119,013 issued to Maloney on Sep. 12, 2000 teaches a means for locating a caller measuring the signals between the cell phone and the recipient cellular towers, but likewise does not teach routing the call to one of a plurality of locations based on that information. U.S. Pat. No. 5,959,580 issued to Maloney on Sep. 28, 1999 teaches how to locate callers using voice processing but does not teach using the location information to route the call to one of a plurality of destinations based on the location information. U.S. Pat. No. 5,901,214 issued to Shaffer et al on May 4, 1999 teaches the use of a 10-digit phone number and a Voice Response Unit but does not teach about non-ANI applications, nor does it teach processing of voice data beyond simple prompts, nor does it teach a method to process the data if a spatial key cannot be determined.","The primary object of the present invention is to provide a method for determining the geographic origination by locational designator of the initiator of a telephone call, especially one using a cellular, or non-stationary, or mobile telephone or communication device, for use in a system that requires knowledge of the initiator's location to determine the recipient of the call from a plurality of possible recipients, including wherein a recipient's number is a local telephone number.","Another object of the present invention is to provide such a system wherein the locational designator of the initiator can be collated to other desired territorial designators or client-defined geographical territories.","The invention described and disclosed herein comprises a method and system to determine the locational designator of the initiator of a telephone call, using verbal responses to computer generated questions. The sequence of questions is determined by a company who desires to use the system to rout telephone calls from a common number to one of a plurality of company dealers, the company hereafter referred to as the client. The questions can be assembled using predefined modules, functions or procedures, or by using client-defined criteria to tailor the questioning to the specific need of the client. As presented herein, the modules, functions or procedures are representative and not indicative of the scope of all possible module, functions or procedures. The questions are designed to ultimately elicit a response from the initiator providing the most-specific locational designator necessary for the client's application. The responses to these questions are digitized and matched against a set of possible answers. The response represents an answer set, and can contain-one or several entries. Once the answer set contains only enough information to determine the locational designator, the locational designator of that entry is used for further processing. If the answer set contains multiple entries, another decision tree with more questions is accessed. Each subsequent decision tree contains questions, the answers to which reduce the number of entries in the answer set to eliminate all but the information necessary to determine a locational designator. At whatever point along the decision tree the answer set satisfies client criteria, a locational designator is determined. Once the locational designator has been determined, client-defined criteria is used to determine which one of a plurality of client locations should receive the call. There may be instances where client-defined criteria may dictate that the caller ultimately choose a recipient from a plurality of selected recipients.","The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention.","This invention can be customized based on the need of the client. In many applications, it will be desirable to locate the caller by address. As an alternate configuration, a client may wish to locate a caller by postal areas (such as ZIP or postal codes), governmental geography (city, county, etc.) or within a customized area designed by the client (such as a delivery zone or a sales territory).","While it is obvious that there are many ways to configure the system, this description of the preferred embodiment will assume that the client wishes to configure the system for location by address.","In an alternative embodiment, the client may wish to configure the system to determine the locational designator when the call is placed from a node on a physical network, and the call is connected to a telephone without having originated from a telephone. The call is placed from someone at a computer responding to a \u201ctalk to a dealer now\u201d or similar prompt on a web site. The dealer is selected from one of a plurality of dealers based on proximity of the dealer to the caller or other client-defined criteria. The call is placed and ultimately routed using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, which results in a non-ANI telephone call. An alternative to ANI must be provided to complete the call, and the caller begins a question-and-response session to determine the caller's location. Alternatives are available, including IP address tracing utilities. In any case, the IP address is correlated to an address to obtain the locational designator.","In an alternative embodiment, the client may wish to configure the system to determine the locational designator when the call is placed from a node on a wireless network, and the call is connected to a telephone without having originated from a land-line telephone. Wireless telephones, such as cellular phones, PCS phones and Nextel's Direct Connect\u2122 walkie-talkie are but a few of the examples applicable to this embodiment. None of these devices provide an ANI that is immediately correlatable to a caller's location. In many instances, the logic module for this type of application may be address logic control, but it is certain that alternatives may be deployed dependent on client-defined criteria.","In another alternative embodiment, the client may wish to configure the system to determine the locational designator when the call is placed from a modem. Modems do not typically send ANI, and when used in conjunction with a portable computer, do not provide point-of-origin information. An alternative means must be described to locate the caller using a modem.","In yet another alternative embodiment, the client may wish to configure the system to determine the locational designator when the call is placed from a wireless device other than a cell phone, such as a cellular modem attached to either a portable computer or a Personal Digital Assistant. These wireless devices do not forward ANI, so alternatives must be presented to locate callers using these devices.","In yet another alternative embodiment the client may wish to configure a system to accommodate callers using GeoPositioning Satellite (GPS) devices or other such location-determining devices. In the case where the caller has access to latitude and longitude numbers using a GPS or other device, the caller speaks the latitude and longitude values back to the system. The latitude and longitude coordinates are the locational designator. As is the case in all embodiments, the appropriate destination is determined based on the locational designator and client-defined criteria. One example of an embodiment of this application would be providing GPS devices to individuals in a remote area such as a national park or a national forest, with the latitude and longitude values used to determine which aid station of a plurality of aid stations should assist the caller.","In yet another alternative embodiment, the invention can be used in an application such as road-side services offered by a motor club. Calls to a motor club typically go to a large call center and are handled by a trained operator. Due to their nature of handling calls from mobile customers, a large number of their calls are made from non-stationary phones, such as cellular phones, and require special handling to locate the caller. These calls take substantially longer to handle than normal calls, with most of the extra time being spent trying to define the caller's location. By altering the call flow to include this invention in cases where there is no ANI or the call has been identified as originating from a non-stationary phone, the client can isolate the non-stationary call from the operator until the caller's locational designator has been identified. In this manner, the highly trained operator spends less time trying to determine the appropriate service provider assigned to provide service to the area in which the caller's locational designator is located and more time dispatching service providers. By implementing this invention in the call flow to allow background and automated processing of calls from non-stationary phones, motor clubs and other providers of emergency services can get assistance to their callers in a more timely manner. The system used by the client can now have caller location information available, whether the call originates from a stationary or non-stationary phone.","Yet another alternate embodiment would be one in which the client uses a single telephone number to route a cellular call to one of a plurality of specialty retailers, the retailers located on limited access highways. An example might be a diesel fuel retailer who accepts a certain type of credit card. Client-defined criteria would most likely employ some variant of the \u201climited access\u201d processing module, as well as the client-defined help module. After determining an initiator's location and assigning a locational designator to the initiator, the caller is routed to the appropriate retailer out of a plurality of said retailers based on the callers location on a limited access highway, and the relation of locational designator to client-defined criteria.","Refer now to , which is a drawing of the generic call process  which most embodiments should follow. The steps represented herein are indicative of the types of procedures and information flow required to process a call in most cases. First, it is necessary to DETERMINE THE DIALED NUMBER . There are many ways to accomplish this; among them are DNIS (Dialed Number Identification Service), informational digits (infodigits) included with the call setup, wireless call setup information, internet script actions and so forth. Once the dialed number has been received and determined, the system ACTIVATES THE MASTER LOGIC CONTROL FOR THAT NUMBER . The master logic control is opened at the beginning of every call and closed at the end of every call, meaning that there is an instance of the master logic control for each call. After the master logic control has been activated, the system ASKS THE CALLER A QUESTION DETERMINED BY THE MASTER LOGIC . The next step in the process should be ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE  where the answer is validated for accuracy. Next, the system checks for the condition HAS THE LOCATIONAL DESIGNATOR BEEN DETERMINED ? If it has not been determined, the process loops back through ASK CALLER QUESTION  for further processing. This check allows the caller the earliest opportunity to connect with the recipient. At the point where the LOCATIONAL DESIGNATOR HAS BEEN DETERMINED , the system RETRIEVES THE RECIPIENT INFORMATION  based on the locational designator and the dialed number. Recipient information is typically composed of the phone number of the recipient, but may include other data such as address, hours of operation or other informational messages, as deemed necessary by the client, and may be spoken by the system to the caller. Once the recipient information has been retrieved, the caller is connected to the recipient . This the generic embodiment that serves as a template for the majority of embodiments.","In the preferred master logic control, which involves address-level logic control, the first question is designed to provide the client an opportunity to assign a locational designator at the first response. Thus the first question is always designed to offer the caller the opportunity to identify exactly his or her location. For example, if the system is configured by the client to locate callers based on address, the first question could be \u201cDO YOU KNOW YOUR EXACT ADDRESS?\u201d. If the caller answers in the affirmative, the caller is asked to speak the address from which he or she is calling. If the answer set described above contains a single item, the locational designator of the item can be assigned to the call.","Referring to , the method of this invention is best illustrated and described by a series of modules within an overall master system as shown. The address logic control  determines the sequence of questions, based on client-defined criteria. First, the caller is asked if he knows the address from where he is calling . If the caller knows the address, the rest of the call is processed through the \u201cPROCESS ADDRESS\u201d module , during which process the locational designator (in this case the latitude and longitude) is attached to the call. If the caller does not know the address, he is asked if he knows the road he is on . If the caller does not know the street, the call is sent to whatever help system that the client has predetermined for such an event . If the caller knows the street, he is asked if it is a limited-access highway . If the caller is calling from a limited access highway, he is asked the name of the highway  and whether he is calling from between two cities or within a city . Based on the response to the question , the system determines which cities the caller is between  or the two exits he is between . If the caller is not calling from a limited access highway, he is asked the name of the street he is on  and if he is near either a building or landmark . If the answer is yes, the street and building are matched against possible locational designators and the appropriate locational designator is attached . If the answer is no, he is asked for the nearest intersection, which is matched against possible locational designators and the appropriate locational designator is attached .","The call, with its attached locational designator, is now sent to the client's processing center, where the specific locational designator is applied  against the client-defined criteria  to determine which of a plurality of client locations to route the call .","Referring now to , a caller dials the client's specialized telephone number, and the call enters the process address module . The system asks the caller \u201cDO YOU KNOW THE EXACT ADDRESS THAT YOU ARE CALLING FROM?\u201d  and sends the response to ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE . ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE makes certain that the answer provided by the caller can be used properly digitized for use by the rest of the system. Once the answer has been identified, the system checks the value returned by the AFFIRMATIVE field . If the value is YES, the call is sent to the module \u201cEXACT ADDRESS PROCESSING\u201d . If the value is NO, then the call is sent to the module \u201cROAD IDENTIFICATION\u201d . Upon completion of either of these modules, the call exits through the return  and returns to , where the specific locational designator is applied against the client-defined criteria  to determine which of a plurality of client locations to route the call .","Referring now to , in \u201cSTART EXACT ADDRESS PROCESSING\u201d , the system now asks the caller \u201cPLEASE TELL ME YOUR EXACT ADDRESS\u201d  and sends the response to ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE . ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE makes certain that the answer provided by the caller can be used properly digitized for use by the rest of the system. At the point where an intelligible answer has been provided, the digitized answer  is stored into the variable DA (for Digitized Answer ). DA is then matched against Table 1 (tblADDRESS) containing the following fields: ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP, LAT, LON, U1, U2 and U3. As shown in Table 1 below, which is a infinitesimal portion of such a table. The table may reside in a larger database, it may be a stand-alone table, it may reside in an array in the computer's memory or, if size permits and the data rarely changes, be embedded directly into the application. If the answer was found 35 the field U1 will return a value of \u201cYES\u201d if the address exists only once in the table; i.e., the address is unique to the table. The field U2 is used when U1 returns a value of NO, meaning the address is not unique. A value of YES in the U2 field indicates that the address, combined with the city, is unique. The field U3 is used when both U1 and U2 are NO. If the address, city and state are unique, U3 will return a value of YES and the address exists. Each entry in the table represents a singular occurrence of address, latitude and longitude. The number of entries in the table should be sufficient to match all of the addresses in the client's area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"273pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"tblADDRESS"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ADDRESS","CITY","ST","ZIP","LAT","LON","U1","U2","U3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["12 Water St","Columbus","OH","43202","41.578789","\u221280.879879","NO","YES","YES"]},{"entry":["12 Water St","Jacksonville","FL","32111","30.668852","\u221273.958744","NO","NO","YES"]},{"entry":["12 Water St","Jacksonville","NC","28905","33.558743","\u221270.854999","NO","NO","YES"]},{"entry":["123 Main St","Miami","FL","33049","26.123456","\u221278.123987","NO","YES","YES"]},{"entry":["123 Main St","Orlando","FL","32809","28.658336","\u221274.874685","NO","YES","YES"]},{"entry":["129 Elm St","Orlando","FL","32810","28.658019","\u221273.945874","YES","YES","YES"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In this table, the address, combined with city and state, is the locational designator.

Other locational designators can be can be generated by a client to match whatever postal geography a postal service may define. This is an example of a case when the locational designator would not ultimately translate to latitude and longitude.","Referring to , at the start of the \u201cDEFINE ADDRESS\u201d module , the system now prompts the caller \u201cTHE ADDRESS YOU GAVE EXISTS IN MORE THAN ONE CITY. PLEASE TELL ME THE CITY YOU ARE CALLING FROM\u201d , and sends the response to ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE . ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE makes certain that the answer provided by the caller can be used properly digitized for use by the rest of the system. Once the caller has provided the name of a city , the system searches a database of addresses, for instance like Table 1 (tblADDRESS) for the row containing the address given in  and the city given in . Once the system finds that row, it looks at the column U2. If the value in U2 is YES , the address and city are unique, and the locational designator is attached to the call . For example, referring to Table 1 (tblADDRESS), if the caller gave an address of 12 Water Street, and a city of Jacksonville, the value for U2 would be NO, indicating that the address and city occur in more than one state. If, however, the address and city were 123 Main Street and Miami, U2 would be YES, indicating that this address and city combination is unique. If the value for U2 is yes, the lat\/lon is attached and the call exits through module , and returns to , applying the lat\/lon to the client's criteria . If, however the value for U2 is NO, the call is sent to the \u201cdefine address 2\u201d module .","Referring now to , at the start of the \u201cDEFINE ADDRESS 2\u201d module , should the tests for address and city in  and  fail to return a unique value, the call goes here. The system now prompts the caller \u201cTHE ADDRESS AND CITY YOU GAVE EXIST IN MORE THAN ONE STATE. PLEASE TELL ME THE STATE YOU ARE CALLING FROM\u201d  and sends the response to ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE . ANSWER QUALITY ASSURANCE makes certain that the answer provided by the caller can be used properly digitized for use by the rest of the system. Once the caller has provided the name of a state , the system searches the Table 1 tblADDRESS for row containing the address given in , the city given in , and the state given in . Once the system finds that row, it looks at the column U3. If the value in U3 is YES , the address and city are unique, and the locational designator is attached to the call .
