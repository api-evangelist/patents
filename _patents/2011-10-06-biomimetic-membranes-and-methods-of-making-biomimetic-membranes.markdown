{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example","Example","SUMMARY"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Nos. 61\/390,041, filed Oct. 5, 2010, entitled BIOMIMETIC MEMBRANES FOR WATER DESALINATION, and 61\/466,634, filed Mar. 23, 2011, entitled BIOMIMETIC MEMBRANES FOR WATER DESALINATION, both TO which priority is claimed and whose disclosures are incorporated by reference in their entireties.","The United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC04-94AL85000 between the United States Department of Energy and Sandia Corporation, for the operation of the Sandia National Laboratories.","This invention relates generally to membranes, and more particularly to porous membranes having controlled nano-pore architecture and a controlled chemistry formed by an ALD\/MLD process.","Traditional membranes are used in a wide variety of liquid and gas separation and ion transport technologies. In many circumstances, these membranes lack pore uniformity and robustness under operating conditions that can lead to a decrease in performance. Traditional membranes overcome these limitations by using thick membrane materials that impede transport and\/or selective permeation that result in decreased performance and increased operating costs.","In one area of traditional polymeric membrane technology, relevant to separating solvents from dissolved salts, the active-site architecture responsible for ion rejection consists of a thick, greater than 100 nm, and compressible polymer coating having non-robust and non-uniform pore architectures. The non-uniformity means that many pores are non-functional. The thickness of the membranes causes resistance to transport. Due to this resistance, the membrane requires high applied pressure to concentrate salty solution on one side of the membrane and force purified solvent to the other side. This thin-film composite membrane design for liquid deionization has remained unchanged for over 30 years.","Considerable research has been undertaken to improve the polymer-based thin-film composites. This research has resulted in incremental progress only, motivating a search for alternative materials demonstrating both high flux and selectivity. Zeolite-based membranes have been considered, but these show high resistance to flow. Membranes composed of stacked, oriented-carbon nanotubes demonstrate high permeabilities around 5.5 cm\/hr per bar of applied pressure, more than an order-of-magnitude improvement over thin-film composites, but fail in terms of salt rejection in solutions of relevant ionic strength and are complicated to fabricate.","Several problems existing in the prior art membranes have been solved in cellular membranes. Combined high flux and selectivity of cellular membranes is achieved by membrane-bound ion and molecular channels, whose pore size and chemistry is defined with sub-nanometer precision through protein folding. The thickness of these cellular membranes is limited to that of the cellular membrane bilayer, which is only about 4 nm thick. Functional biological channels are uniform and robust under physiologically relevant operating conditions. However, cellular membranes cannot withstand large pressure differences across the membrane, which are common in the operating conditions of desalination membranes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100","sup":"9 "},"What is needed to achieve low resistance, highly selective permeation is a selectively permeable membrane that mimics a cellular membrane, which is porous, reliable, robust, and that can be made thin with uniform small-diameter pores having a desired chemistry. A porous membrane demonstrating these qualities would have numerous applications that would benefit from reduced operation costs and improved performance.","The present disclosure is directed to a porous membrane that has a tuned nanochannel architecture and chemistry for selective, low resistance permeability and\/or adsorptivity.","In an embodiment, a membrane is disclosed that includes a support. The support includes at least one pore having a pore length. The at least one pore is further limited by either the at least one pore having a first pore diameter from a pore opening to a first pore depth and a second pore diameter from the first pore depth to the pore length, the first pore diameter reduced from the second pore diameter by atomic layer deposition or molecular layer deposition of a material; or the at least one pore has a first pore chemistry from the pore opening to a first pore depth, and a second surface chemistry from the first pore depth to the pore length, and wherein the first pore chemistry is formed by atomic layer deposition.","In another embodiment, a membrane is disclosed that includes a nanoporous structure including at least one nanopore having a nanopore diameter of less than about 100 nm and a nanopore length, a coating deposited upon the nanoporous structure that reduces the nanopore diameter to a second nanopore diameter less than the first nanopore diameter for a portion of the pore length less than the pore length, and a polymer film coating the nanopore, the polymer film having a thickness of less than 100 nm.","In another embodiment, a method of making a membrane is disclosed that includes providing a support comprising at least one pore having a pore diameter, and using an atomic layer deposition process or a molecular layer deposition process to deposit a material or deposition to reduce the pore diameter.","In another embodiment, a method of making a membrane is disclosed that includes providing a support including at least one pore having an inside pore surface having a surface chemistry, using an atomic layer deposition process or a molecular layer deposition process, or a molecular layer deposition process to modify a portion of the inside pore surface with an alternate chemistry.","Our analysis shows that the cellular protein channels that catalyze pure water transport lack binding sites for ions, but still contain hydrophilic functional groups that form \u2018binding sites\u2019 that stabilize water as well as greasy hydrophobic functional groups that avoid trapping water or ions. Overall the channel provides a thin water conduction pathway of only about 4 nm in length with pore diameter near the size of the permeating molecule, ranging between 0.3 nm and 0.5 nm.","Understanding and harnessing these biomimetic principles has led to the present disclosure directed to robust solid-state membranes. In contrast to the traditional design of membranes for nano-filtration and reverse osmosis applications, the present disclosure is directed to a stable, patterned, and oriented porous architecture. The disclosed nanoporous membrane design mimics cell membranes that contain nano-channels oriented in the membrane-spanning direction and composed of proteins that catalyze higher water flux than conventional reverse osmosis (RO) membrane technology and perfect ion rejection, all at small driving pressures. These membranes have high flux and selective permeability for liquids, gases, cations or anions, as well as adsorptivity for ions and gases.","The present disclosure is directed to porous membranes that are selectively permeable, wherein selectively permeable means the membrane selectively repels, passes and\/or traps gasses, liquids and\/or specific components of gas mixtures and liquid solutions. Individual pores in the porous membranes have nearly uniform and constant pore architecture that provides uniform functionality. The pores of the membrane can be made thin to shorten diffusion lengths across the membrane and the pores can have a small diameter to reject larger molecules and shorten diffusion lengths to the interior pore walls.","The present membranes may be applied to a wide variety of commercial membrane applications. The applications may be categorized into liquid and gas separation. Separation of liquids and gases or specific components in a liquid solution or gas mixture can occur by rejection, permeation, or trapping.","In liquid separation, a membrane is formed having a pore diameter and chemistry tuned to separate specific components in a liquid, or to be permeable or non-permeable to a liquid solution. In liquid separation, the membrane length and pore width may also be tuned to shorten diffusion distances across the membrane or to shorten diffusion distances to the interior pore walls. The membrane may be tuned to be permeable to a single solvent component in a mixture or be tuned to reject a single solvent component from others in a liquid mixture. For liquid separation, the membrane may be tuned to separate solvent molecules from the dissolved solutes, including electrolytes and molecular ions. The membrane may be tuned to transport the solvent molecules and reject the solutes. The membrane may be tuned to transport solute molecules, including electrolytes, and reject solvent molecules. The membrane may be tuned to separate solutes in the solution. For example, the membrane may be tuned to transport specific solute molecules, such as dissolved ions. The membrane may be tuned to transport several components of the solution, such as cations or anions, or specific molecules in solution such as single-stranded DNA molecules. The tunable chemistry and architecture of the present invention allows the porous membranes to be constructed to transport specific solution components across the membrane, and on or off the pore walls, with high permeability and low resistance.","Applications for liquid separation include, but are not limited to liquid purification by reverse or forward osmosis, power generation by forward osmosis; liquid purification by dialysis; liquid purification by electrodeionization, power generation by reversed electrodeionization; liquid purification by capacitive deionization, power generation by capacitive energy storage; molecule separation, trapping, and modification (e.g. DNA), and power generation by electrochemical transduction in fuel cells.","In gas separation, a gas can be separated from a liquid or specific components of a gas mixture can be separated by rejection, permeation, and trapping. In gas separation, a membrane is formed having a membrane pore structure and chemistry tuned to separate specific components of the gas mixture, or to be permeable or non-permeable to a gas mixture. The membrane pore diameter may be tuned to be permeable to gas molecules not larger than the pore diameter. The membrane pore length may be tuned to minimize gas diffusion distances to enhance permeation rates. This form of separation by size can be termed molecular sieving. In another form of gas separation, a membrane pore architecture and chemistry may be tuned to separate a specific gas component in a mixture by size and chemistry. For example, a membrane pore may be tuned with a hydrophilic pore chemistry and a pore diameter at least as large as the diameter of a carbon dioxide molecule to separate COfrom a mixture by selective permeation. In another example, a membrane pore may be tuned with a polymer film containing a film pore diameter at least as large as the diameter of a bicarbonate ion and contain a hydrophilic chemistry to separate COby trapping the gas as dissolved bicarbonate ion. Applications for gas separation include, but are not limited to gas purification, capture, and separation.","In an embodiment, a membrane may include a nanoporous material with uniform pore size formed by an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. The pore architecture and chemistry of the nanoporous material may be further tuned so as to mimic the architecture and chemistry of a biological analogue, thereby achieving the selective chemical and permeation properties that are possessed by its biological analogue.","The present disclosure is also directed to a synthetic manufacturing process including ALD\/MLD that permits fabrication of highly uniform and robust nanoporous membranes with tailor-made pore geometries and interior pore surface chemistry. Molecular layer deposition (MLD) refers to an ALD process wherein large, organic or organic-inorganic hybrid reactants are used, and the building blocks of the deposition are organic or organic-inorganic molecules. Multi-scale modeling based on quantum descriptions of atomic interactions permit accurate assessments of pore structure versus function relationships. Thus, combined experimental and multi-scale modeling can determine how structure correlates with function in nanopores, which then can be used to guide design and synthesis of membranes for specific applications.","The present disclosure is directed to biomimetic membranes and methods of manufacturing such membranes that include structural features that mimic the structures of cellular channels and produce membrane designs capable of high selectivity and high permeability or adsorptivity. The membrane structure, material and chemistry can be selected to perform liquid separations, gas separation and capture, ion transport and adsorption for a variety of applications.","These applications include, but are not limited to liquid purification by reverse osmosis, forward osmosis, dialysis, electrodeionization, and capacitive deionization; molecule separation, trapping, and modification (e.g. DNA); gas purification, separation and capture; energy storage by supercapacitors; power generation by osmotic forces and fuel cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":"100"},"According to a first step , a porous membrane  including a support  is provided.

In another embodiment, the support  may be formed having pores of a select porosity and\/or may be made porous by a pore forming process, such as, but not limited to, drilling one or more pores by a focused ion beam.","The support  may be flexible or rigid. The flexibility of the support  may be provided by the material, such as a flexible polymer, or by the structure of the support, such as a thin, flexible metal. In an embodiment, a flexible support may be used in a membrane for reverse osmosis electrolyte applications.","In this exemplary embodiment, the support  is formed of anodized alumina.

The pore diameter d then increases to a second pore diameter dabout 100 nm for the remainder of the pore length L\u2033. Throughout this disclosure, pore diameter d refers to the average pore diameter located at the top surface  of the porous support  unless otherwise specified.

In another embodiment, the pore diameter d may be less than about 20 nm. In an embodiment of an application for liquid separation, the pore diameter d may be less than 200 nm. Limiting the pore diameter d to less than 200 nm improves the alignment of nanopores of self-assembled material that may be formed in the pores in a later step. Alignment of the nanopores in the membrane-spanning direction may provide less resistance to transport.","In an embodiment for DNA separation, the pore diameter d should be greater than or equal to about 1.5 nm for single-stranded DNA or greater than or equal to about 2 nm for double-stranded DNA.

In another embodiment, the thickness T may be greater than about 10 mm.","In an embodiment, a membrane may be formed from the support followed by further tuning of the pore architecture and\/or chemistry as provided by any one or more of the following additional steps.","Referring again to , a nanoporous structure  may be formed upon the support  in a second step. The nanoporous structure  provides a plurality of substantially identical nanopores  for the subsequent tuning and chemistry modifications. The nanopore structure  is formed by an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. The nanopore structure  forms uniform nm-sized pores, providing a plurality of substantially identical nanopores  for the subsequent pore tuning and modification steps that define the architecture and chemistry of an active region.","The nanoporous structure  is formed of a self-assembled material.

In an embodiment, the nanopore structure  is formed of a self-assembled material in order to align pores for efficient flux through the nanopores . The orientation of the self-assembly process of the self-assembled material may be guided by the orientation of the pores  of the support , whereby the nanopores  in the nanoporous structure  have the same orientation as that of the pores  of the support . In another embodiment, a self-assembled material may be used that forms less aligned nanopores, but the decrease in alignment causes an increase in resistance to flux across the membrane. In an embodiment, the nanopores  may be formed with a non-uniform through-pore architecture. For example, to slow transport, the nanopores  may be formed with a \u201ckinked\u201d or zig-zag structure.","In this exemplary embodiment, the nanoporous structure  is formed of mesoporous silica, which has an active \u2014OH surface chemistry A.

In another embodiment, the nanopore diameter d\u2032 may be less than about 100 nm. In another embodiment, the nanopore diameter d\u2032 may be between about 0.3 nm and about 100 nm. In an embodiment, the nanopore diameter d\u2032 may be between about 0.5 nm and about 20 nm. In another embodiment, the nanopore diameter d\u2032 may be between about 1 nm and about 10 nm.

In this exemplary embodiment, the top and inside pore surfaces ,  are prepared for reactions of subsequent atomic and molecular layer deposition processes (ALD\/MLD).","In an embodiment, activation allows for subsequent tuning of the pore  to a specified depth L\u2032\u2033 by deposition of a coating by ALD as described in further detail in step 4 below. In another embodiment, activation allows for subsequent tuning of the pore  to a specified depth by modifying the surface chemistry by ALD or another surface modification technique with an alternate chemistry as described in further detail in step 5 below. In yet another embodiment, activation allows for subsequent deposition of a film  () by MLD to a specified depth L\u2032\u2033 as described in further detail in step 6 below.","The first step of activation, as shown in , is passivating the top and inside pore surfaces ,  of the nanopore structure . In this exemplary embodiment, the surfaces ,  are passivated by reacting the surfaces with an organo-silane to form passive, more hydrophobic, \u2014CN (nitrile) surface chemistry.

During passivation, any surface groups that are active to the subsequent ALD\/MLD reactions, such as \u2014OH groups that may be present on the nanopore structure  after formation, are replaced with the groups that are inert to the subsequent ALD\/MLD reactions unless specifically activated.

In another embodiment, pore activation depth L\u2032\u2033 may be between about 0.04 nm and about 10 nm. In another embodiment, pore activation depth L\u2032\u2033 may be between about 0.1 and about 5 nm. In another embodiment, pore activation depth L\u2032\u2033 may be between about 1 nm and about 3 nm.","In this exemplary embodiment, the passivated surface is activated using an Oplasma treatment including a remote oxygen plasma treatment. Remote Oplasma is used to limit the depth of activation to a desired pore depth. In another embodiment, plasma or any other short life-time radical formation process may be used. Activation replaces the inert groups, i.e. \u2014CN groups, with groups that are active to subsequent ALD\/MLD reactions, i.e. \u2014OH groups, which may be referred to as active chemistry sites or active sites. The subsequent ALD\/MLD reactions, which are limited to a depth of the activation by Oplasma may be referred to as \u201cplasma limited ALD\/MLD.\u201d In an embodiment, active sites possess a chemistry that is active to subsequent ALD\/MLD reactions, thereby allowing ALD\/MLD to take place in these sites. In an embodiment, the active sites can be selected from, but are not limited to, amine groups, acid chloride groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups and sulfonate groups. In another embodiment, activation may be used to replace the passivated surface with surface chemistry groups that provide other functions, such as, but not limited to adsorption, catalytic, or other reactive functions.","In an embodiment, a porous membrane having a select nanopore diameter d\u2032 and active surface chemistry is complete after step 3. In another application, the porous membranes structure and\/or chemistry may be further tuned by altering the structure and\/or chemistry of the membrane, and in particular, of the nanopore structure by one or more of the following additional steps to form a porous membrane.","A coating step  () may then be performed as a fourth step. As shown in , a coating  is deposited on the top surface  () and inside pore surface  of the nanopore structure  that has been activated to reduce the nanopore diameter to reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033. In this exemplary embodiment, the coating  is applied to the activated surfaces formed after step 3. In such a manner, passivation limits the deposition of the coating  to the activated surfaces, or in other words, limits the depth in the nanopore  to which the coating deposition occurs.","The coating  reduces or narrows the nanopore diameter d\u2032 to a reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033. In this exemplary embodiment, the reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033 is about 1.5 nm. In another embodiment, the reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033 may be less than the nanopore diameter d\u2032. In another embodiment, the reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033 may be less than about 100 nm. In another embodiment, the reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033 may be less than about 20 nm. In another embodiment, the reduce nanopore diameter d\u2033 may be less than about 1 nm. In yet another embodiment, the reduce nanopore diameter d\u2033 may be reduced to about 0.2 nm. In another embodiment, the coating step should not be used to form a reduced nanopore diameter d\u2033 less than the diameter of the desired permeating component because then no permeation of that component can occur.","In this exemplary embodiment, the coating  reduces the nanopore diameter to the pore coating depth L\u2032\u2033 of equal to or less than about 5 nm. In another embodiment, the coating  reduces the nanopore diameter d\u2032 to a pore coating depth of equal to or less than about 10 nm. In another embodiment, the coating  reduces the nanopore diameter d\u2032 to a pore coating depth of equal to or less than about 100 nm. In another embodiment, the coating  may reduce the nanopore diameter over the entire nanopore length L\u2032 (). In another embodiment, the coating  may reduce the nanopore diameter d\u2032 up to or less than the nanopore length L\u2032. In another embodiment, the coating  may be formed at various depths of the nanopore  (). In an embodiment for gas and\/or liquid separation, the coating depth L\u2032\u2033 may be up to or less than 10 nm so as to reduce resistance to flux.","In this exemplary embodiment, the coating  has a thickness t upon the nanopore surface of about 1 nm. The thickness t is controlled by the number of deposition cycles in the ALD\/MLD process as described below. In another embodiment, the coating  may have a thickness t of between about 0.1 nm and about 100 nm. In another embodiment, the coating  may have a thickness t of between about 0.3 nm and about 100 nm. In another embodiment, the thickness t may be less than about 100 nm. In yet another embodiment, the thickness t may be an amount that results in closing the nanopore diameter d\u2032 to about 0.2 nm. For example, closing the nanopore diameter d\u2032 to about 0.2 nm would allow only small molecules like helium and hydrogen to permeate, but not larger molecules.","In this exemplary embodiment, the coating  is formed of silica having an active surface chemistry of \u2014OH functional groups.

Carbon may be used by first applying a polymer, which is subsequently carbonized. The metal oxide may be selected from the group including, but not limited to niobium oxide, manganese oxide, or ruthenium oxide. When an electrically conductive coating is used, application of a voltage to the membrane wall material will then attract oppositely charged ions and result in storage of capacitive energy. In this embodiment, the high surface area and low flow resistance afforded by the oriented, porous architecture will lead to higher total capacitance and lower heat generation on switching. In this embodiment, the pores are permeable to electrolyte solution and also tuned to minimize diffusion distances and maximize mass transport of charge to the conductive walls formed by the coating. An electrically conductive coating may be used to provide electrical access to chemical reactions occurring at the membrane surface. This process, termed electrocatalysis, is enhanced by the present invention by increasing the surface area available for reaction and for charge transport through the device, which is a rate-limiting step in present fuel cell technologies.","Furthermore, deposition of thin layers of conductive material can be achieved by ALD\/MLD, thus confining the reactions to thin layers to increase reaction cycles. Additional increases in the amount of adsorbed charge may be obtained via subsequent functionalization of the present embodiment with ion-selective polymer.","In this exemplary embodiment, the coating  is deposited by an atomic layer deposition\/molecular layer deposition method (ALD\/MLD). The thickness t of the coating  is determined by the number of cycles of the ALD\/MLD process. ALD\/MLD is used with two or more reactants or optional catalyst(s) to form the deposition, and the reactants are introduced to the sample surface sequentially in a one-at-a-time manner, in a layer-by-layer deposition, introduction of each reactant is followed by a purge or rinse step to remove unreacted reactant and the reaction byproducts.","A fifth chemical modification step  () may then be performed.

The poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) is a programmable polymer that can change properties with temperature, such as switching from hydrophobic to hydrophilic with temperature. In the hydrophilic state, the polymer may adsorb or capture COin its water soluble form, and in the hydrophobic state, the polymer may release CO. In another embodiment, the polymer film  may be another polymer that switches between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states.","In another embodiment, the polymer film  may have an active or inert surface chemistry.

In an embodiment, the polymer film  may include alternating hydrophilic (polar or charged) and hydrophobic (aromatic or hydrocarbon) chemistries.","The polymer film  has a film pore size \u03c3. The film pore size \u03c3 is determined by the MLD polymerization process for the particular polymer. In this exemplary embodiment, the film pore size \u03c3 is about 0.28 nm.

In another embodiment, the polymer film  may be attached to any another active chemistry surface formed by any of the steps described above. In another embodiment, a different polymer film may be attached to any of the active chemistries of any of the active surfaces formed by any of the steps described above.","In this exemplary embodiment, the polymer film  fills the nanopores  () to a depth of about 5 nm. The polymer film  is deposited by MLD by initially attaching to the active chemistry and is then further deposited by MLD by polymerizing upon itself. In another embodiment, the polymer film  may be deposited to the pore depth of the active chemistry formed by ALD of any of the steps described above.","In this exemplary embodiment, the polymer film , and its architecture and chemistry, is selected to reject ions. More generally, the architecture and chemistry of the polymer film is selected to reject or transport select ions or molecules. In an embodiment, the polymer film , and its inherent pore size, may be selected to provide a barrier to permeation of molecules or ions of a specified size. In another embodiment, the polymer film  may be selected to select for ions of a specified charge (ions or cations, but not both) for transport. In another embodiment, the polymer film  may be selected to adsorb molecules, such as CO.","Anion and cation selective polymer films have applications in but not limited to electrodeionization and its reverse process, which is electricity generation from salt concentration gradients, ion transport in fuel cells, and selective ion transport in liquid purification. In these applications, the polymer film reduces energy loss by decreasing the resistance to ion transport. In a related embodiment, the polymer film may be selected for separation of a solvent from a solution by rejecting dissolved solutes.

In another aspect of fuel cell application, the polymer film provides permeability to electrolyte solutions and mass transport of ions such as H, Li, and OH.","The advantage of depositing the polymer by MLD as opposed to traditional film formation approaches is that the polymer film can be made thin, less than 100 nm, to decrease transport distance, and to have uniform pore structure. In addition, the polymer films formed by MLD have a robust structure that resists deformation under applied pressure and temperature.","In an embodiment, a porous membrane is formed after step 6.

In an embodiment, the porous carbon structure  can allow application of a voltage to the membrane wall material that will then attract oppositely charged ions and result in storage of capacitive energy. In such a manner, the membrane may be used as a supercapacitor to store energy. The porous carbon structure  also provides natural adsorptivity by chemical interactions. The uniform and robust pores of the porous carbon structure  formed by a polymer formed by MLD renders substantially all pores accessible to electrolyte solutions, thus facilitating mass transfer of ions onto the conductive carbon material of the porous carbon structure . In other words, the uniformly open pore structure of the porous carbon structure  provides pathways to allow electrolyte transport in addition to a large active surface area.","The porous carbon structure  fills the nanopores  () to a depth L\u2032\u2033 or to the approximate depth of the polymer film  (). High porosity in the carbon can be obtained by minimizing the number of ALD\/MLD cycles used to lay down a polymer film, which is subsequently carbonized. The high porosity renders the pores more accessible to electrolyte solutions, thus facilitating mass transfer of ions onto the conductive carbon material.","In another embodiment, the support and\/or nanopore structure may be removed by a chemical, thermal or mechanical process to provide a free-standing porous carbon structure formed by the carbonization of a polymer film formed by MLD.","An eighth step  () performing a chemical modification may be performed on the carbon structure  (). In this embodiment, the surface chemistry of the porous carbon structure  is modified. The porous carbon structure  may be modified by ALD or another chemical treatment.

In another embodiment, any one of the surface chemistries as discussed above may be used to modify the carbon structure .","A ninth step  () of chemical modification may be performed on the polymer film  (). In this embodiment, the surface chemistry of the polymer film  is modified. The polymer film  may be modified by ALD or another chemical treatment.

In another embodiment, any one of the surface chemistries as discussed above may be used to modify the polymer .","An example of a liquid separation membrane is provided below.","A pervasive and growing problem afflicting nearly half of the world's population is inadequate access to clean, fresh water. Scarcity of clean water underlies death, disease, and international tension. Furthermore, energy and water are inextricably linked, with the production of one requiring use of the other. For example, vast amounts of water used in mining, drilling, oil and coal refining, biofuels production, and in cooling systems for nuclear and conventional electricity generation drive water use and further stress clean water supplies.","The best current solution to water purification relies on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes that remove salts and larger components from water with applied pressure. A survey by the U.S. National Research Council in 2004 revealed that more than half of the 15,000 desalination plants operating around the world utilize RO technology.","In the U.S., RO membranes contribute to 96% of online desalination capacity. Since desalination by reverse osmosis is more efficient than the alternative evaporation technology, nearly all new plants going into production are built on RO technology. Despite its success and widespread use, water desalination by RO is associated with tremendous energy costs. Expensive electrical energy accounts for the largest component of the operating cost for seawater desalination facilities. Using the Perth, desalination plant as an example, more than half the energy budget is used to establish the pressure drop needed to push water through the semi-permeable membrane that blocks dissolved salts. This energy requirement is far higher than the minimal thermodynamic cost associated with concentrating salt solutions because current membranes have low permeability to water and thus resist flow. Considering the cost of electricity needed to establish pressure gradients across the RO membrane, membrane resistance to flow carries a price tag of approximately $1.6 M per year for a modestly sized 100 million liter (ML) per day RO facility.","This example is directed to a liquid separation membrane that may be used in a reverse osmosis (RO) process to purify a liquid or a forward osmosis process that can be used to generate power. The membrane may be used in liquids having salt concentrations that may fall in the brackish range of 0.1 g\/L-16 g\/L. With additional tuning, the membranes may be used for separating solutions with higher salt concentrations. The presently disclosed membrane is able to maintain high salt rejection at low flux rates, providing a breakthrough in this application. In particular, the present membrane can operate at pressures as low as about 5.5 bar and still maintain high salt rejection ratios. Specifically, at these low pressures of around 5.5 bar, the membrane can achieve a 10-fold improvement in membrane permeability to water flow compared to commercial membranes.","If the small-scale membrane were embedded in a large-scale format, the improved performance would translate into a projected savings of 88% of the cost due to the membrane resistance to flow. Given the current cost of electrical energy, this enhancement in membrane performance may make it economically feasible to install brackish water desalination plants to lower the water cost in areas that were not possible to reach using prior technology.","In an embodiment, a desalination membrane is disclosed that includes fabricating a nanoporous material with uniform pore size of 2.6 nm, followed by reducing the diameter of the pore entrance vicinity by a plasma-defined atomic layer deposition process, and modifying the pore surface chemistry so that the pores possess the architectures found in natural aquaporins. These architectures may include: C\u2550O, N\u2014H dipoles, inter-strand H-bonds, short hydrophobic regions within the pore, pore diameters as small as 0.3 nm, and lack of dense arrays of dipoles that could form ion binding sites. The pore architectures are uniform and robust to applied pressures used in desalination. By doing so, high water flux and high salt rejection may be achieved.","According to the present example a porous, uniform and robust biomimetic membrane was formed by the following steps. A support of a 13 mm, anodized alumina disc was provided. The disc had 20 nm through pores that occupied more than 50% of the disc surface area. A nanoporous structure of self-assembled mesoporous silica was coated on the support. The self-assembled mesoporous silica had regular oriented 2.6 nm diameter nanopores.","The nanoporous structure was formed by dissolving 0.90 g of Brij\u00ae 56 surfactant in 15 mL ethanol, followed by addition of 2.8 g of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and 1.25 mL of 0.07 M HCl aqueous solution. The solution was stirred vigorously for 75 minutes then diluted with ethanol to 65 mL. The anodized alumina discs were then dip-coated using this solution twice, and the dip-coated samples were calcined at 450\u00b0 C. for 3 hours to remove surfactant.","The nanoporous structure was then passivated to a depth of about 5 nm. It was passivated by reacting with an organo-silane, followed by treatment with remote oxygen plasma to activate the first 5 nm of the pore depth through formation of \u2014OH groups. Functionalization proceeded via deposition of silanes to form a silica coating in the first 5 nm of the nanopores by plasma-assisted ALD. The coating reduced the nanopore diameter to about 1.5 nm.","In order to provide anchoring functionality for the MLD reactions, amine groups were added to the silica surface in a modification step by immersing samples in a toluene aminopropyl triethylsilicate (APS) (33% w\/w) and triethylamine (3% w\/w) for 2 hours. The residual APS was removed under vacuum at 100\u00b0 C., and confirmed with FTIR ().","The pore size and surface chemistry were further tuned using an MLD process using terephthaloyl chloride and parabenzenediamine molecules as precursors and triethylamine as a catalyst. The layer-by-layer deposition of the MLD process formed uniform pores of a specific pore size to the activation depth in the nanopore. The molecular channels in the resulting peptide network had a sub-nm diameter with exposed \u2014N\u2014H, \u2014C\u2550O, and hydrophobic aromatic groups, deliberately designed to mimic the channel chemistry found in cellular water-selective channel proteins.","MLD was carried out at 120\u00b0 C. in an \u212b-dep MLD system. Terephthaloyl chloride (TC, heated at 120\u00b0 C.), and parabenzenediamine (PA, heated 120\u00b0 C.) were used as the precursors and triethylamine (TEA) as a catalyst. Each MLD cycle consisted of the following four steps: 1.) 20 seconds exposure of TC and TEA; 2.) Argon purge at a flow rate of 10 sccm for 10 seconds; 3.) 20 seconds exposure of PA and TEA. 4.) Argon purge at a flow rate of 10 sccm for 10 seconds. These steps were repeated to achieve surface polymer growth, progressively shrinking the film pore diameter.","After the MLD deposition, water permeance and salt rejection properties were measured using a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) water pump, with a constant input feed at 5 g\/L NaCl solution and varied imposed membrane pressure drops. In a head-to-head comparison with the FILMTEC\u2122 SW30HR polyamide thin film composite membranes from DOW designed for water desalination, the ALD\/MLD membranes outperform the commercial membranes at multiple pressures. At high pressures (300 psi), the MLD membrane produced purified water within drinking water standards, but with four times the water flux compared to the commercial membrane. As pressure decreases, the MLD membrane performs well in both water flux and salt rejection. Because of the nanoporous framework and in contrast to prior polymer coating technology, the MLD membrane still retains a linear flux relationship and nearly constant salt rejection with decreasing pressure, making it able to operate with high efficiency at pressures as low as 80 psi, thus substantially outperforming the commercial membrane.","The salt rejection and membrane flux were characterized for varied surface chemistries and pore sizes. In this example, the salt rejection of porous MLD membranes increases substantially after MLD modification with alternating amine and hydrophobic chemistries. After 32 MLD cycles, these membranes show 85-95% salt rejection and more than triple the water flux of a polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) membrane designed for seawater desalination. In addition, the MLD membrane retains its high salt rejection properties at low-pressure ranges (<100 psi), suggesting a novel rejection mechanism able to operate efficiently at low applied pressure.","Fourier transform infra-red spectra of the treated mesoporous silica samples confirmed modification of the pore surface by the MLD cycles.

Before MLD modification, the pore size was 2.6 nm and the pore surface was covered by hydroxyl groups. The water flux was 9.8 cc\/hr and small salt rejection of 4.7% was observed. After two MLD cycles, the water flux was reduced slightly but the salt rejection increased from 4.7% to 18%, suggesting that the polypeptide\/amide surface chemistry has a substantial impact on the salt rejection properties. After 4 MLD cycles, water flux was reduced to 4.1 cc\/hr and the salt rejection approached 40%. At this moment the estimated pore size was about 2.0 nm according to gas permeance data. After 8 cycles, the water flux further reduced to 2.8 cc\/hr, and the salt rejection increased to 53%, where the estimated pore size was about 1.2 nm. After 16 cycles, water flux was 2.2 cc\/hr, and the salt rejection increased substantially to 78%, where the estimated average pore size was about 2-3 \u212b, but the relatively low He\/N2 selectivity of 16 suggests that there may be open defects in the membrane at this point. After 32 cycles, the water flux slightly decreased to 2.0 cc\/hr, while the salt rejection increased to 86%. The estimated average pore size was still around 2-3 \u212b, but the higher He\/N2 selectivity indicates a lower defect level. The water flux did not diminish much even though the thickness of the MLD layer doubled. This suggests that after 32 cycles the MLD membrane is thin enough that membrane thickness is not the limiting factor for water transport.","Four more samples were prepared with 32 MLD cycles. The water flux was measured to be 2.00, 2.10, 2.00, and 2.18 cc\/hr and the salt rejections were all in the range of 85%-95%.  shows a performance comparison between this MLD membrane and a sample FILMTEC\u2122 SW30HR membrane tested under the same conditions. Compared to thin film composite (TFC) membrane, the MLD membrane has around four times the water flux at 300 psi, and the ratio increases with decreasing pressure. The salt rejection ratio for the MLD membrane is slightly lower than the commercial DOW membrane at the high pressure for which the SW30HR membrane was designed. At 150 psi, the MLD membrane does well in both water flux and salt rejection. In addition, the MLD membrane still retains a linear flux relationship and nearly constant salt rejection with decreasing pressure, making it able to operate highly efficiently as low as 80 psi (at only 26 psi of resistive loss), where it achieves a permeability of I=3.05 cm\/h\u00b7bar and 87%-95% salt rejection\u2014for a standard resistance of \u03b5=0.16 bar\u00b7h\/cm.","Water flow and salt rejection ratios were measured for our nanoporous biomimetic polypeptide membrane and the FILMTEC SW30HRLE thin film composite membrane under equivalent conditions for a variety of imposed membrane pressure drops.

Compared with \u2018straight through\u2019 proteinaceous nanopores of comparable dimensions, kinked nanopores exhibit up to fivefold reduction in translocation velocity, which has been identified as one of the critical issues in DNA sequencing. Additionally, the present example discloses an efficient two-step approach to create a nanopore array exhibiting nearly perfect selectivity for ssDNA over dsDNA.","The kinked nanopores reduce the translocation velocity up to fivefold compared with comparably sized straight-through pores. Reducing DNA translocation speed during detection is important for polymer identification and sequencing in nanopores. The present example shows that a kinked nanopore array system fabricated by self-assembly can slow down DNA translocation speed through its unique pore morphology alone.","Nanopore-Array Fabrication","Free-standing arrays of silica nanopores spanning circular apertures having approximate 50-100 nm diameter, defined in silicon nitride by focused ion-beam (FIB) lithography, were fabricated by evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), employing non-ionic surfactant Brij\u00ae 56 as a structure-directing agent. EISA starts with a homogenous alcohol-water solution of hydrophilic silicic acid precursors plus surfactant. Evaporation accompanying dip-, spin- or aerosol coating progressively concentrates the depositing film in non-volatile silica and surfactant components, resulting in self-assembly of micelles and further self-organization into periodic three-dimensional, silica-surfactant mesophases oriented with respect to the substrate and vapor interfaces. Originally developed to coat solid substrates, EISA is used in this example to form free-standing films spanning approximately 50-100 nm diameter pores through spin-coating or aerosol deposition.","Using cationic and non-ionic surfactants and block copolymers, a variety of cubic and bi-continuous thin-film mesophases may be formed (for example, three-dimensional hexagonal P6\/mmc, micellar cubic (face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic, bcc) and bicontinuous cubic (double gyroid and so on). These structures are of interest for membranes because they have the potential to create the three-dimensional pore connectivity needed for transmembrane permeation. In an embodiment, Brij\u00ae 56 under acidic conditions may be used to direct the formation of supported cubic nanoporous silica membranes characterized by an Im3m body-centered symmetry and a Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore diameter of approximately 2.6 nm. Here, to achieve thinner films more commensurate with the dimensions of natural membrane systems, the same composition was diluted eightfold in ethanol, yielding the final Si:Brij\u00ae56:EtOH:HCl:HO molar ratio 1.28:0.07:248:0.09:71. As shown by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cross-sectional image shown in , spin-coating this composition at 1,000 r.p.m. followed by calcination at 400\u00b0 C. results in highly ordered films only about 30 nm thick. With regard to DNA translocation, thin films are important because: (1) a shorter contour length increases the likelihood that the channel is continuous and spans the membrane; (2) decreased thickness provides a greater field strength within the membrane, thereby imparting greater momentum to the DNA in overcoming the potential of mean force needed to translocate the pore; (3) modification of the pore surface by post-grafting or atomic-layer deposition (ALD) becomes more efficient when the contour length of the channel is shorter.","Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) was used to characterize the structure of the periodic thin-film mesophase. In GISAXS, an X-ray beam is incident on a sample at an angle greater than the critical angle of the film but less than that of the substrate (typically about 0.2\u00b0), maximizing the scattering volume of the beam within the film. Use of a two-dimensional detector enables collection of both in- and out-of-plane scattering data for comparison of the pattern to a hypothesized nanostructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0165","num":"0164"},"figref":["FIG. 17A","FIG. 17B","FIG. 17B"],"sub":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0166","num":"0165"},"figref":"FIGS. 17C and 17D","sub":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0166"},"figref":["FIGS. 16A and 16B","FIGS. 17A-D","FIG. 17B","FIG. 16A"],"sub":["3","2 "]},"Considering the inaccuracy of BJH methods in estimating pore dimensions in such a small pore-size range and the fact that cubic or three-dimensional hexagonal networks derived from micellar mesophases such as those in our ultrathin films are expected to have undulating pore diameters along the pore pathway, an electrochemical approach was used to create a Pt replica of the nanopore network as a means to better estimate pore size and to examine the pore connectivity across the film.  shows a TEM cross-sectional image of the resulting Pt replica formed within the original Fmmm silica framework structure along [110]. The presence of a well-defined Pt network indicates pore connectivity with a tortuous shape for the pore pathway that transverses the film. High-resolution TEM of the Pt replica () shows crystalline lattice fringes of Pt with alternating wide and narrow regions corresponding to templated pores and the necking between them, respectively, giving estimated dimensions of about 4 nm for the pore diameter and about 2.6 nm for interpore necks. This suggests that pore-to-pore connectivity provides the transport-limiting barrier to DNA translocation. Therefore, we assign 2.6 nm as the \u2018effective pore diameter\u2019 to refer to the transport-limiting pore dimension. Additionally, the cross-sectional TEM image of the Pt replica in  suggests preferential pore-to-pore connectivity in the through-thickness direction, whereas pore connectivity within the plane is limited.","As shown in , spin-coating exactly the same composition as in , and 2 over an approximate 80 nm diameter aperture (formed in silicon nitride by FIB as shown schematically in ) results in an array of ordered nanopores freely suspended over the aperture.  shows integration of the free-standing nanopore array in a home-built electrochemical cell for carrying out DNA-translocation experiments. As discussed above, our self-assembled nanopores are in a similar size range as those reported in previous studies of DNA translocation. However, the mesophase symmetry of our ultrathin film structure requires that there are no straight-through pores spanning the membrane, allowing us to isolate and understand the influence of nanopore tortuosity on DNA translocation.","Atomic-Layer Deposition (ALD)","To reduce the effective nanopore dimension below 2.6 nm and to modify the pore surface chemistry, thermal ALD of titania or an aminosilane was performed. ALD is a self-limiting, highly conformal, layer-by-layer deposition process composed of two half-cycles, hydrolysis and condensation. For a hydroxylated surface like that of a silica nanopore, condensation is achieved by exposure to a halide or alkoxide precursor, resulting in Si\u2014O\u2014M bond formation and concomitant reduction in the pore diameter. To trigger another layer of deposition, water is introduced to the system, resulting in hydrolysis of surface bonds.  shows refractive-index data measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry for thin nanoporous silica films before and after one and two layers of thermal TiOALD, and the corresponding volume percentage and thickness of TiOcalculated from this data using a Bruggeman effective-medium approximation (calculated using n=1.46 and n=2.00), in combination with Brunauer-Emmett-Teller film surface areas obtained from Nadsorption data (290 mgfor the film before ALD, and 286 mgafter one layer of ALD). Although the estimated volume fraction of TiOis dependent on the value of the refractive index for TiOused in the effective-medium approximation calculations, variation of nover the range of 1.90-2.10 (typical for non-crystalline titania) modifies the volume fraction by only about 10%. The calculated thicknesses of 1.7 \u212b for the first ALD layer and 1.5 \u212b for the second layer are consistent with the expected thickness per deposition step of about 1.6 \u212b, indicating that one and two layers of TiOALD deposition inside the silica nanoporous film result in pore-diameter reductions of approximately 3.4 \u212b and 6.4 \u212b respectively. Thin film with a 2.6 nm \u2018effective pore diameter\u2019 was determined by the BJH calculation in combination with high-resolution TEM of the Pt replica, the approximate pore diameters after one and two layers of TiOALD are 2.3 nm and 2.0 nm respectively. Also, the BJH pore diameters calculated from the Nadsorption isotherm before and after one layer of ALD show about 3 \u212b decrease of pore diameter, which is close to that calculated from the refractive-index data (); although the BJH method can be subject to large errors in the determination of absolute pore size, errors in relative measurements are expected to be significantly lower.","ALD was also used to form a coherent aminopropyl silane monolayer using the molecular precursor aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS). Successive cycles of APTMS and HO favor condensation reactions between alkoxysilane groups on APTMS and silanol groups on the pore surface or between alkoxysilane groups of nearby APTMS, resulting in an aminopropyl silane monolayer as opposed to a multilayer. The Fourier-transform infrared spectrum after one cycle of APTMS\/HO shows that two new vibrational bands appear, attributable to N\u2014H bending (scissoring) of primary amines (around 1,650 cmand C\u2014H stretching of alkyl chains (around 2,900 cm) respectively, consistent with the formation of an APTMS monolayer.","DNA Translocation","A representative ionic-current-versus-time trace for voltage-driven dsDNA translocation through a 2.6-nm-diameter silica nanopore array is shown in . In this experiment, 2,700-base-pair (2.7-kbp) dsDNA was introduced to the cis side of the cell and a potential of +200 mV was applied to the trans side. A series of current-blockage events is observed. Reversing the voltage bias or replacing dsDNA with blank buffer solution suppressed all current-blockage events, implying that the observed blockages are caused by dsDNA translocation. The background current (\u02dc23,000 pA) represents the collective ion current through all the nanopores on the aperture (estimated to be \u02dc80 pores in this case). Correspondingly, it is greater than that of a single-nanopore system and scales with the size of the aperture and number of pores in the array. However, the current-blockage amplitude (200 pA at 200 mV) per event is comparable to that reported previously for single nanopores. Each current blockage represents a single event of one dsDNA molecule passing through an individual pore, and the overall current-blockage frequency is the sum of the dsDNA translocation events on all nanopores supported over the FIBed aperture. Because the translocation time r (<1 ms) is short compared with the event frequency (0.5-1 s\/event), the probability of two events coinciding is very rare, implying that in our array dsDNA translocation characteristics of individual pores can still be detected and interpreted as for single-nanopore systems.  shows that the most probable dsDNA translocation time r in 2.6 nm pores is 0.7 ms, corresponding to a velocity of 1.3 mm scalculated from v=Lr, in which Lis the polymer length, almost an order of magnitude less than that reported elsewhere using larger solid-state nanopores. One cycle of TiOALD reduces the pore diameter by approximately 0.3 nm (to about 2.3 nm) and further reduces the velocity by about a factor of three (about 0.45 mm s) (). This large dependence of velocity on pore size is consistent with a strong polymer-pore interaction (see further discussion below).  shows that the translocation time r scales linearly with polymer length I. If hydrodynamic friction within the pore dominates the transport dynamics, the constant driving force F experienced by the polymer within the pore (F=2 eV\/a, where e is the elementary charge, V is the potential difference and a(=0.4 nm) is the spacing between nucleotides) is balanced by the hydrodynamic friction within the pore=\u03bev, where, ignoring an specific DNA-pore interactions \u03bev=2\u03c0\u03b7Lrv\/R r (where R is the pore radius, r is the dsDNA cross-sectional radius, \u03b7 is the solvent viscosity, Lis the pore length and v is the linear velocity of the polymer inside the pore). This implies the translocation velocity v to be constant with polymer length, as we observe. Additionally, because ALD deposition is conformal and changes the pore size but not its shape, we can use the force balance to estimate the velocity ratio v\/vin reducing the pore radius from Rto Rat a constant driving potential. Reducing 2R from approximately 2.6 to approximately 2.3 nm () should reduce v by a factor of about two. Experimentally, a factor of three was observed, suggesting additional frictional forces arising from specific polymer-pore interactions or, more likely, the tortuous pore shape defined by the micellar mesophase. A second cycle of TiOALD reduces the pore diameter to 1.9-2.0 nm, below that of dsDNA, and, as expected, we observe no measurable dsDNA translocation (for driving potentials less than 500 mV where we expect there to be no denaturization). A final dynamical feature of our nanopore system is the approximate quadratic relationship between velocity and voltage ().","The transport characteristics of the kinked-nanopore arrays described above are distinct from those of other solid-state nanopores and more similar to protein nanopores. For example, it has been observe that the translocation time in 10-nm-diameter solid-state nanopores to vary with dsDNA length as a power law, t=Iwhich they attribute to the condition where hydrodynamic drag imposed by the untranslocated polymer on the cis side dominates the friction within the pore. In fact, they conclude that the essential difference between solid-state and protein pores is that, for sufficiently shallow solid-state pores, the effect of friction within the pore is negligible. In comparison, for ssDNA translocation through \u03b1-haemolysin the translocation time was found to vary linearly with polymer length, consistent with pore-friction-dominated translocation owing to the small 1.4 nm diameter pores plus possible specific DNA-pore interactions.","To more closely emulate the behavior of protein pores in our solid-state system, we modified the 2.6 nm silica nanopores with APTMS (see the schematic in the inset of ). On the basis of ellipsometric measurements of the thickness of the corresponding film deposited by ALD on a solid silica support, we estimate that one layer of APTMS reduces the pore diameter to about 1.4 nm, comparable to that of \u03b1-haemolysin. Additionally, the partial positive surface charge of the aminopropyl groups (NH) introduces an attractive electrostatic DNA-pore interaction, a factor that has been reported to enhance DNA translocation.","For the APTMS-modified nanopore array, no current blockages were observed for 2.7-kbp dsDNA. For pure poly(dA)current-blockage events were observed, and the corresponding translocation times and current blockages are shown in the histograms in . When poly(dA)was added to 2.7-kbp dsDNA, current blockages were again observed and the duration and current-blockage histograms were similar to those of pure poly(dA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis verified dsDNA translocation in the original nanopore array with about 2.6 nm pore diameter, but rejection in the APTMS-modified nanopore array with about 1.4 nm pore diameter; ssDNA translocation was verified in both cases, consistent with the observation of translocation events from current. These results strongly suggest: (1) with APTMS-modified nanopores, separation of ssDNA from dsDNA is achieved and can be sensed electronically; (2) pore-size reduction by ALD occurs uniformly for all pores, allowing selectivity to be developed in an array format. Recently, great effort has been made to distinguish single- and double-stranded nucleic acid molecules using solid-state nanopores. The results, showing nearly perfect selectivity for ssDNA over dsDNA in ALD-modified nanopores, could expand the range of potential applications of synthetic solid-state nanopores in biotechnology by tuning the pore size to be between the diameters of dsDNA and ssDNA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0178","num":"0177"},"figref":"FIG. 22C","sub":["100 ","DNA","DNA","pore ","100 "]},"The present example shows a simple self-assembly procedure to create a free-standing nanopore array and its further physical and chemical modification by ALD. Compared with lithography or etching, which yield individual, shallow, straight-through nanopores, self-assembly provides a new means to direct the size, shape and tortuosity of an array of solid-state nanopores. Subsequent conformal ALD of an oxide or silane reduces uniformly the diameters of all pores, enabling, for example, the array to be tuned to transport ssDNA efficiently and reject dsDNA. Compared with protein pores of comparable pore diameters, the greater pore length combined with the kinked pore shape, derived from mixed distorted bcc (with Fmmm symmetry) and hexagonally close-packed mesophases, increases the frictional force and reduces the translocation velocity by a factor of up to five. The present example demonstrates how pore size and shape combine to influence translocation and to address the important issue of reducing translocation speed. The qualitative DNA translocation characteristics developed in our nanopore array, for example the linear dependence of translocation time on polymer molecular weight and quadratic dependence of translocation velocity on voltage, can be understood on the basis of a one-dimensional diffusion model, where factors contributing to the frictional force, namely, pore diameter, length, shape and specific interactions, are coalesced into a single barrier potential. The integration of the disclosed kinked-nanopore array into a three-electrode \u2018chem-FET\u2019 architecture, could combine reduced translocation velocities with increased signal-to-noise ratio.","In summary, the present disclosure presents a membrane that can be tuned to successfully mimic an aquaporin channel. Using the ALD\/MLD process described above, uniformly coated membranes having a thin, less than the characteristic 100 nm thickness of traditional desalination membranes, may be formed for a variety of applications and conditions. The membranes have a uniform pore size of a diameter that can be determined by the ALD\/MLD process. The pore structure of the membranes is robust, or in other words, does not distort under pressure, in contrast to traditional membranes that lose performance under pressure. The high flux rates achieved show that the majority of pores are functionally active and remain very good water conductors over a wide range of pressure.","This disclosure demonstrates the fabrication of high flux desalination membranes with substantial salt rejection capabilities based on a hybrid inorganic\/organic framework. The combination of self-assembled mesoporous silica and subsequent MLD tuning has permitted synthesis of an oriented nanoporous geometry with which it is possible to mimic essential features of natural water channels. That the membranes demonstrated an immediate improvement in salt rejection after 2 MLD cycles shows that the mixed amide\/hydrophobic surface chemistry contributes to ion exclusion. Further cycles substantially increase the salt rejection, likely through a combination of narrowing the channel diameter and defect healing. When the average channel size is narrowed to atomic dimensions, 2-3 \u212b in diameter, 85-95% salt rejection is achieved."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are hereby incorporated into the specification, illustrate one or more embodiments of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.
