title: Broad temperature WDM transmitters and receivers for coarse wavelength division multiplexed (CWDM) fiber communication systems
abstract: A wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) module for transmitting and/or receiving multiple signals simultaneously includes an array of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and/or photodetectors, respectively. In the transmitter case, different VCSELs are operated at different wavelengths that change depending on a value of a condition such as temperature and/or one or more other parameters. Multiple VCSELs are assigned to each channel of the WDM. The currently active VCSEL is switched to a different VCSEL assigned to a same channel and preferably having an operating wavelength that is closer to the signal wavelength at the current measured or estimated temperature and/or other parameter value. Multiple photodetectors are assigned to each channel of the WDM, and currently active detector is switched to the second detector within the same channel. A tuning layer and a resonant waveguide grating coupler are preferably integrated into the resonant structure of the VCSEL array and wavelength specific detector array.

Field of the Invention","The invention relates to wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) receivers and transmitters, particularly having high wavelength stability over a broad temperature range for CWDM fiber communication systems and bi-directional data communication systems.","2. Description of the Related Art","Current optical communication systems employ semiconductor devices to both emit and detect light signals. Whether these signals are coupled into silica fibers or used in free-space optical networks, their stability is important to increased system performance, when wavelength multiplexing is employed. One of the main sources of instability in semiconductor devices is temperature fluctuation. For example, semiconductor lasers used as light emitters have temperature sensitive emission wavelengths. Changes in wavelength as a function of temperature become a serious problem as multiple signals, each with a different wavelength, are fed simultaneously into an optical fiber as in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and in Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) systems. To address this problem, many WDM systems employ thermoelectric coolers (TECs) to maintain a constant operating temperature. While this solution is effective, it is most often used in high-dollar applications where the semiconductor laser represents a small cost in the overall optical communication systems. Where cost is a major motivation, as in Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) applications, tunable laser sources and a variety of tunable vertical-cavity, surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) provide a more affordable solution. However, these alternatives are problematic due to issues with device performance or complicated device fabrication, resulting in increased cost.","Thermoelectric coolers are solid-state heat pumps which operate on the Peltier effect. A schematic illustration of a commercially available TEC with two stages is shown in . In the Peltier effect, heat transfer occurs when electric current is passed through two dissimilar conductors. Thus, as a voltage is applied to two conductors a temperature difference is generated, which results in heat transfer from one material to another. Typically, a TEC consists of an array of p- and n-type semiconductor elements, packaged between two ceramic plates, that serve as the two conductors. As a bias is applied between the two materials, a decrease in temperature results in one material as it absorbs heat from the environment (for example, a semiconductor laser bonded to the TEC). The heat is carried away from the laser through the TEC by electron transport and released to a heat sink as the electrons move from a high-energy to a low-energy state. It follows that the heat pumping capacity of the TEC is proportional to the current and the number of elements within the ceramic package.","Currently, wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM and CWDM) transmitter and receiver modules achieve tolerance to temperature changes utilizing thermoelectric coolers (TEC) that control the temperature of the optoelectronic device, and therefore the wavelengths of the WDM channels. Stabilization of wavelengths in the optoelectronic components allows interconnect operation over a limited temperature range, but this comes at a price. TECs, their control electronics, and the packaging required to incorporate them, add significantly to the cost of WDM modules and complicate heat dissipation problem. In addition, TECs are sizeable resulting in large form-factors and bulky optical systems. As the temperature range that a TEC can maintain is limited, multiple stage TECs are required to achieve extended ranges. This addition however, adds significantly to the module's costs. Since each stage can maintain about a 30\u00b0 C. temperature difference, a module with a temperature range exceeding 60\u00b0 C. would require a three stage thermoelectric cooler.","A thermoelectric cooler requires a large amount of power to maintain a specified operating temperature for the optoelectronics. Power requirements scale with the number of stages, so maintaining temperatures over a broad range consumes a prohibitive amount of power for many applications. In addition, TECs have a slow response time, making them susceptible to problems in applications where temperatures change rapidly, as is the case for surveillance satellites in missile defense systems. Therefore, in applications where power, cost, heat removal or size is a limiting factor, TECs are not an ideal solution.","Another possible solution to the temperature-induced instability in semiconductor lasers is the use of tunable semiconductor lasers. Using electronics, and a monitoring photodetector, a control circuit is used to maintain a constant wavelength laser output. Tunable sources come in several varieties including edge-emitting, distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, conventional VCSELs, and VCSELs with micromechanical mirrors. Although each of these tunable sources has been successfully fabricated, drawbacks exist. In some cases, tunable sources utilized in conjunction with TECs add complexity to an already expensive solution. Others have varying device performance over the tunable range, or have complicated and costly fabrication procedures. Each type of tunable laser will be described in the following sections.","Edge-emitting lasers, as their name implies, emit light from the edge of the structure. These laser structures are conventionally used in many semiconductor laser applications. One type of edge emitting laser employs surface gratings, distributed over a large portion of the structure, to select the emission wavelength of the device. This type of edge emitting laser is referred to as a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. DBR lasers are fabricated in several ways, depending on desired device characteristics. For a large wavelength tuning range the laser is divided into several sections including a gain section, filter section, and grating section. Injecting current into different portions of the laser, such as the grating section, changes the refractive index of that portion. Thus, the emission wavelength is dependent on the current injected into the grating section. Using this configuration, and the InGaAsP\/lnP material system, a DBR laser is tunable over 74 nm in the 1550 nm wavelength range (see, e.g., M. Oberg, S. Nilsson, K. Streubel, J. Wallin, L. Backbom, and T. Kling a, \u201c74 nm Wavelength Tuning Range of an InGaAsP\/InP Vertical Grating Assisted Co-directional Coupler Laser with Rear Sampled Grating Reflector,\u201d IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, vol. 5, pp. 735-738, 1993, which is hereby incorporated by reference). While this tunability is highly desirable, device fabrication is very expensive due to the high cost of grating fabrication and five epitaxial growth steps. In addition, this DBR laser is used in conjunction with a TEC to achieve the desired device performance. Thus, for applications where cost is a motivating factor, this presents an undesirable option.","Unlike their edge-emitting counterparts, VCSELs emit light normal to the surface of the semiconductor wafer. This offers many important advantages, which explains the increased interest in VCSELs in both research and industry environments.  depicts a typical VCSEL structure. A VCSEL's structure includes a bottom, highly-reflective mirror consisting of alternating layers of high and low-index semiconductor materials, known as a DBR . The DBR  is shown on a GaAs substrate . Next, a semiconductor cavity, including n-contact layer , a second AlGaAs\/GaAs DBR layer , a quantum well active region , a third AlGaAs\/GaAs DBR layer , and a p-contact layer , is included. Finally, the structure is completed with a top, highly-reflective AlGaAs\/GaAs DBR . The emission wavelength of the VCSEL is determined by several factors including cavity length, device current, and device temperature.","Typically, VCSELs are operated at a fixed current giving relatively stable output characteristics. By intentionally altering the temperature and\/or the drive current, the wavelength of the device can be altered. Unfortunately, this method of tuning has serious drawbacks as VCSEL output power decreases with increasing temperature.  is typical of VCSEL device performance and illustrates the temperature dependence of output power. Four plots are shown for VCSEL output power as a function of drive current including for 10\u00b0 C., 30\u00b0 C., 50\u00b0 C., and 70\u00b0 C., representing a range of temperatures for a typical VCSEL. Emission wavelengths typically vary approximately 10 nm over a 200 degree change in temperature (see, e.g., B. Tell, K. F. Brown-Goebeler, R. E. Leibenguth, F. M. Baez, and Y. H. Lee, \u201cTemperature Dependence of GaAs-AlGaAs Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers,\u201d Applied Physics Letters, vol. 60, pp. 683-685, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference). Unfortunately, the method of implementing temperature changes for VCSEL tuning requires multiple cascaded TECs whose disadvantages were previously discussed. Ultimately, the tunability range is quite small and results in poor performance.","The tunability of conventional VCSELs can be improved by altering design and fabrication processes. Employing a micromechanical (MEMS) mirror for one of the DBRs, the tunable range can be extended far past normal VCSEL operation (see, e.g., C. J. Chang-Hasnain, \u201cTunable VCSEL,\u201d IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, vol. 6, pp. 978-987, 2000, which is hereby incorporated by reference). The principal behind this extended operation range is as follows. The MEMS mirror can be positioned by applying electrostatic forces through external bias sources. Slight movements of the mirror result in changes in cavity length, and alter the emission wavelength of the VCSEL.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["20","16","22","23","24","2","4","10","20","20"]},"A wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) module for transmitting and\/or receiving multiple signals simultaneously includes an array of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and\/or photodetectors, respectively. In the transmitter case, different VCSELs are operated at different wavelengths that change depending on a value of a condition such as temperature and\/or one or more other parameters. Multiple VCSELs are assigned to each channel of the WDM. When the wavelength of a currently active VCSEL varies a certain amount from the desired signal wavelength, the currently active VCSEL is switched to a different VCSEL preferably having an operating wavelength that is closer to the signal wavelength at that temperature and\/or other parameter value.

The transmitter array advantageously has at least one active VCSEL at each WDM channel aligned within the operating range of the module even when large changes in the temperature and\/or other condition occurs. Advantageously, temperature control circuitry and thermoelectric coolers may be excluded from the design such that the temperature of the module may vary significantly, while the operating WDM wavelengths are maintained within desired ranges. A resonant cavity photodetector or other photodetector array may be configured in similar fashion as a receiver. A tuning layer and a resonant waveguide grating coupler are preferably integrated into the resonant structure of the VCSEL and\/or photodetector array.","The invention will now be illustrated in one or more preferred and alternative embodiments with reference to additional figures, and particularly .

Each reference is, in addition to those references cited above and below, and including that which is described as the invention summary and as background including , hereby incorporated by reference into the detailed description of the preferred embodiments, as disclosing alternative embodiments of elements or features of the preferred embodiments not otherwise set forth in detail herein. A single one or a combination of two or more of these references and\/or features may be consulted to obtain a variation of the preferred embodiments described in the detailed description. The references include:\n\n","With the former description of tunable laser sources in mind, similar arguments can be made regarding the performance of photodetectors or receivers. Using the above mentioned solutions, large and costly modules can be developed. With the addition of multiple devices, running in parallel, a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) system is advantageously implemented in accordance with a preferred embodiment by tuning the parallel devices to operate at different wavelengths. In order to couple lasers to detectors, a signal routing mechanism is used, such as preferably one or more fiber optic cables, to implement an optical network with a usable operating bandwidth. Conventional solutions would be costly, and when run in parallel to implement WDM channels, insertion loss and costs are further increased. Therefore, an alternative design with WDM capabilities, stable operation, a small form-factor, and low cost would be an attractive candidate for wide range of applications.","Rather than stabilizing temperature to keep transmitters and receivers aligned, a method in accordance with a preferred embodiment utilizes an array of VCSELs and\/or detectors where devices in the array operate at different wavelengths. These wavelengths are preferably evenly and closely spaced. As temperatures change, the wavelengths of the devices change, ensuring that one VCSEL or detector at each WDM channel is always aligned over the operating range of the module. Data is then transmitted through the VCSELs and detectors that are aligned at that particular temperature, while the other devices remain inactive. The wavelength spacing of the devices is preferably kept small, limiting component wavelength variation to an acceptable level. This acceptable range of wavelength variation can be as small as desired and is incorporated in the design specifications of the structure. The entire system is calibrated initially for a wide range of temperatures and the wavelength\/temperature data is stored in memory.","In a preferred embodiment, data is directed to appropriate devices by a CMOS chip to which the optoelectronics are flip-chip bonded. A DSP (Digital Signal Processor) can be used for that purpose. The CMOS chip (or DSP) receives temperature data from a low cost thermistor and uses that information to determine which devices are properly aligned at that temperature. The data is then switched to the devices aligned at the correct wavelength. This data switching is performed in the CMOS at high speed and is transparent externally. For the sake of discussion, a wavelength of 1300 nm is used, though the idea is not limited to this wavelength, nor the fabrication method described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"Using a form of receiver called a resonant-cavity photodetector, the implementation of the system becomes somewhat simpler and less costly. A resonant-cavity photodetector comprises a structure very similar to a VCSEL. It includes a quantum well active region placed between two highly reflective mirrors. The response of a resonant-cavity photodetector is limited to a smaller wavelength range than conventional photodetectors due to the resonant cavity (see, e.g., O. Sjolund, D. A. Louderback, E. R. Hegblom, J. Ko, and L. A. Coldren, \u201cMonolithic Integration of Substrate Input\/Output Resonant Photodetectors and Vertical-Cavity Lasers,\u201d IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, vol. 35, pp. 1015-1023, 1999, which is hereby incorporated by reference). While certain photodetector applications would prefer a wide operating range, the implementation of the preferred embodiment works well using the resonant cavity device. The same epitaxy can be used for the fabrication of a VCSEL or a resonant cavity photodetector if properly designed. Thus, a matched photodetector can be grown at the same time as its corresponding transmitter. Since the detection range is limited in a resonant cavity detector, a parallel array of these devices can be fabricated that will be matched only to their respective transmitters and not to other VCSELs in the array.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},"In order to fabricate a WDM VCSEL\/detector array, a method of controlling the wavelength is used. Coarse wavelength adjustments in resonant structures, such as VCSELs or resonant cavity photodetectors, involve the thickness of at least one layer being varied across the chip in a controlled manner. Accurate and repeatable thickness adjustments of a GaAs layer can be performed with anodic oxidation and etching. By adjusting the thickness of a tuning layer in the top DBR near the cavity and subsequently regrowing the rest of the epitaxial structure, the desired wavelength adjustments can be obtained (see, e.g., T. Wipiejewski, J. Ko, B. J. Thibeault, and L. A. Coldren, \u201cMultiple Wavelength Vertical-Cavity Laser Array Employing Molecular Beam Epitaxial Regrowth,\u201d Electronics Letters, vol. 32, pp. 340-342, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference). This work also demonstrates that high quality regrowth on GaAs over these small etch depths is easily obtained. By using a binary etching technique, with each etch varying in depth by a factor of 2, 64 different etch depths can be obtained with only six etches. For a four wavelength WDM module with four temperature compensation ranges, four binary etch steps may be involved for realizing sixteen different wavelengths.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["44","46","30","32","34","32","36","38","40","36","42","44","44","46"],"sub":["1","2","3","4 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":"50"},"The dotted line in  signifies the functions that are contained within a CMOS chip  on which a VCSEL-based transmitter array  is preferably flip-chip bonded. The module utilizes the thermistor  to sense the ambient temperature and relays this analog information to the CMOS . The analog temperature signal is sent through an analog-to-digital converter , so that it can be used to determine which temperature range the module is in, and hence, which VCSELs of the array  should be used for data transmission. This temperature range information is used by a switch  to direct the incoming data to the appropriate VCSELs of the array . The VCSELs that are not designated for that temperature range are left inactive. Depending on the requirements of the particular application, data may be switched between VCSELs in either packets or bits. These requirements will also determine whether VCSELs in adjacent temperature ranges are left biased so that they remain ready for data should the temperature move into their range. The functions of this circuitry can be implemented using a standard Digital Signal Processor chip. A data line  is connected to the switch  via logic  and to the transmitter array  for optically communicating the data coming in through the data line. The data would be incoming instead of outgoing for a photodetector array module, but the general receiver arrangement may be substantially the same as the transmitter illustrated at .","While the previous discussion described a method for fabricating WDM arrays of VCSELs and resonant cavity photodetectors, a major challenge lies in interconnecting the transmitters or the receivers so that the signals can be coupled either out of (VCSEL) or into (detector) the system. Without an advantageous method of coupling light into\/out of these arrays, costly packaging techniques for the system may be involved which could overwhelm the cost benefits of the described method. An advantageous procedure in accordance with a preferred embodiment for interconnecting these devices involves monolithic integration of a waveguide within the structure of the VCSELs and photodetectors.  is a schematic representation of an integrated waveguideNCSEL module in accordance with a preferred embodiment. In , the waveguide  is coupled to all of the VCSELs (labeled as \u03bbat \u03bb, for i,j=1,2,3 and 4) of an exemplary sixteen VCSEL embodiment. The electronic circuitry illustrated at  preferably controls which of the lasers, for a given wavelength, will be used at a given temperature. Due to the structure of the resonant cavity photodetectors, the same schematic representation () can be used to describe a series of detectors. Once again, the electronic circuitry of  preferably controls which of the detectors are active at a given temperature. The VCSELs of  are multiplexed into the waveguide preferably using resonant waveguide grating couplers.","With VCSELs and resonant cavity photodetectors operating in the vertical direction, normal to the plane of the semiconductor substrate, a horizontal waveguide (i.e., in the plane of the substrate) is preferably used to interconnect the wavelength-matched transmitters and receivers. In order to couple vertical light horizontally into and out of the waveguide, a surface-normal grating can be employed to fabricate a waveguide grating coupler. These waveguide grating couplers are gratings etched into the surface of a waveguide that diffract vertically incident light horizontally, coupling it into the waveguide. This vertical-to-horizontal waveguide coupling allows all signal multiplexing\/demultiplexing for a VCSEL\/photodetector array to be done on chip. The performance of the grating coupler is dependent on its placement within the system. If the coupler is placed on the surface of the device, its coupling efficiency into the waveguide is relatively low. However, if the grating coupler is placed within the resonant structure in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the cavity resonance can be used to drastically improve the coupling efficiency. This is accomplished by placing the waveguide grating coupler on the peak of the standing wave, where the grating will interact with a much higher optical field intensity. The waveguide grating coupler can be designed having a different efficiency for VCSEL and detector arrays.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 7","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"i":["a ","b ","a","c ","b"],"b":["3042","55","55","56","55","58","56","58","58","60"]},"The epitaxial structure will initially be grown up to the WDM tuning layer . After binary anodic etches are performed, the structure up to the waveguide layer  will be grown. At this point, the gratings of the waveguide layer  are patterned and etched. Finally, the remaining epitaxial layers  are grown.","The etch depths in the WDM tuning layer  and grating layer  have been greatly exaggerated for illustration. The actual etch depths involved will not generally pose a problem for either regrowth or the structure's operation. The waveguide layer , as well as the layers ,  cladding it, are preferably undoped and will not introduce excessive losses from free carrier absorption. The regrowths also have a fairly large tolerance due to their positioning relatively far from the cavity.","Following epitaxial regrowth, device fabrication is preferably implemented including patterning, etching, and metallization. The preferred processes for VCSEL and resonant cavity photodetector fabrication are similar. The only difference involves an additional oxidation step used to create both a current-guiding aperture and a highly-reflective mirror in the VCSEL structure. The fabrication of the VCSEL structure starts with etching oxidation holes. These holes are etched in a circular pattern through the epitaxial structure. After the holes are etched, the aperture and part of the bottom DBR are oxidized for the VCSELs. For both the VCSEL and the detector, the remaining fabrication steps are identical: a series of three etches down to the waveguide layer, p contact layer, and n contact layer. The etch down to the waveguide layer defines the waveguide. Finally, the metal contacts are deposited.","While exemplary drawings and specific embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated, it is to be understood that that the scope of the present invention is not to be limited to the particular embodiments discussed.
