Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally autonomous soaring for uninhabited air vehicles (UAVs), particularly to improved endurance for autonomous soaring UAVs, and more particularly to using thermals or convective thermals to improve the performance of UAVs.","2. Description of the Related Art","Glider pilots have been using buoyant plumes of air found in the lower atmosphere, normally referred to as thermals, in order to extend the distance that a glider may travel for many years.","Several systems have been developed to assist pilots of gliders or low-powered aircraft to locate such thermals in order to provide improved range, endurance, or cross-country speed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,012,675 describes a system that monitors air humidity to locate \u201cmoist\u201d thermals and U.S. patent application 2004\/0129071 describes a system that employs a database of places on the ground that are likely to generate thermals in conjunction with current weather projections to attempt to estimate positions of thermals for pilots.","Over the past several years, it has also been suggested that UAVs could benefit from using thermals in the same manner as piloted aircraft to improve range, endurance, and speed. For instance, Wharington, et al. in \u201cControl of High Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle\u201d proposes the concept of using thermals to improve the performance of UAVs and discloses a general control scheme that could be applied for the UAV to take advantage of thermals. However, the paper states that a superior control scheme would be necessary for practical application of the concept. Further, Michael J. Allen, the inventor of the present invention, in \u201cAutonomous Soaring for Improved Endurance of a Small Uninhabited Air Vehicle\u201d provides mathematical evidence that UAVs may dramatically improve range and endurance when employing thermals.","However, until the present invention, no known practical control and guidance system has been developed for UAVs to take advantage of the benefits of thermals. Therefore, it is desired to provide a guidance and control system and method for UAVs to locate and use thermals to provide improved range and endurance.","The invention proposed herein comprises a system and method of guidance and control for autonomous UAVs that allow the UAVs to locate and use thermals in order to increase the range and endurance of the UAVs.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a system and method for an autonomous UAV to independently locate thermals in the lower atmosphere.","It is a further object of this invention to provide a system and method for guiding an autonomous UAV to the \u201ccenter\u201d or \u201cstrongest\u201d portion of a located thermal in the lower atmosphere.","This invention meets these and other objectives related to improving guidance and control for an autonomous soaring UAV by providing a method for locating and using thermals to improve endurance of UAVs. The method includes the step of estimating energy rate and energy acceleration from total energy of the air vehicle. This is done by using values for static pressure around the UAV, true air speed of the UAV, and command to the motor. The method also includes the step of identifying the radius, strength and position of a thermal. This is accomplished using the energy rate and location of the UAV. The UAV position error, velocity error, and steady-state turn rate are then obtained using the location of the UAV, and the thermal radius, strength, and position. The method also includes identifying the soaring turn rate command for the UAV using the UAV position error, velocity error, steady-state turn rate, and energy acceleration. Also, a final turn rate or bank angle is identified for the UAV through mode switching using the soaring turn rate, and a waypoint tracking turn rate. Finally, the UAV is controlled to guide it to locate and stay within the thermal.","The following nomenclature will be employed herein to describe the present invention:\n\n","One relatively unexplored way to improve the range, duration, or cross-country speed of an autonomous aircraft is to use buoyant plumes of air found in the lower atmosphere called thermals or convective thermals. Thermals occur when the air near the ground becomes less dense than the surrounding air because of heating or humidity changes at the Earth's surface. Piloted sailplanes rely solely on this free energy to stay aloft for hours at a time and to make cross-country flights. Soaring birds, such as hawks and vultures, have been observed to circle for hours without flapping their wings, and Frigatebirds are known to soar continuously day and night using thermals.","Many UAVs have similar sizes, wing loadings, and mission profiles to soaring birds and sailplanes. Mission profiles that could allow small UAVs to take advantage of thermals include remote sensing, surveillance, atmospheric research, communications, force protection, and Earth science. A study using a simple UAV simulation with thermals calculated from measured surface and balloon data found that a 2-hour nominal-endurance UAV can gain up to 12-hours of flight time using thermals.","The present invention provides a practical method for UAVs to take advantage of thermals in a manner similar to piloted aircrafts and soaring birds. In general, the invention comprises a method for a UAV to locate a thermal and autonomously be guided to the thermal to greatly improve the range and endurance of the aircraft.","The top-level autonomous soaring guidance and control method is shown in . Static and total pressure sensor input (to obtain true air speed) along with the aircraft throttle command were used to determine the rate (first derivative) and acceleration (second derivative) of aircraft total energy in the total energy estimation block . These energy rate and energy acceleration values are used as inputs to the mode switching block  as described further below.","The energy rate from the total energy estimation block  along with the position of the aircraft (latitude and longitude) are then used to identify a thermal that has been encountered by the aircraft . The thermal radius, strength, and position are calculated in block , using these input values.","In the circle guidance block , the thermal radius, strength, and position from block  are used to obtain values for aircraft position error and aircraft velocity error in relation to the identified thermal position. The UAV steady-state turn rate is also obtained in this step.","The aircraft position error, aircraft velocity error, aircraft steady-state turn rate acquired in guidance block , and the energy acceleration obtained from the total energy estimation block  are used to provide a soaring turn rate command in the controller block . The soaring turn rate command is the turn rate that is given to the UAV by the controller to lead the aircraft within the thermal to maximize climb rate while the UAV is in soaring mode.","Finally, the energy rate, energy acceleration, waypoint tracking turn command, and soaring turn rate command are input into the mode switching block . In the mode switching block , mode logic is used to determine when the UAV should be told to switch between searching flight (looking for a thermal) and soaring flight (using a thermal). Energy rate and energy acceleration are used to determine when the aircraft should be in searching mode and follow the waypoint tracking turn command or if the aircraft should be in soaring mode and follow the soaring rate turn command. In this block, when the amount of energy obtained from a thermal decreases to a certain level, the UAV is commanded to switch from soaring flight to searching flight.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","200"],"sub":"static"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0086"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"gV","mn":"2"}},"mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["h","est"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"Equation 1 is solved using gravity, g, and the estimated aircraft altitude, h, from equation 2.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0088"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["h","est"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"msub":{"mi":["p","static"]},"mn":"101325"}},"mn":"0.1903"}}},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"44333.7"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"The total energy calculations are shown in blocks  and .

The soaring controller  architecture is loosely based on a thermal centering method given for glider pilots in \u201cCross Country Soaring\u201d by Reichmann, et al., Soaring Society of America, Inc., Hobbs, N. Mex., ISBN 10883813-01-8, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. The method states three rules;","1. As climb improves, flatten the circle (approx. 15-20\u00b0)","2. As climb deteriorates, steepen the circle (approx. 50\u00b0)","3. If climb remains constant, keep constant bank (approx 25-30\u00b0)","These rules are used as a guideline for the soaring controller design. Energy acceleration feedback is used to implement rules 1 and 2 because the rules given by Reichmann, et al. are to be applied to the \u201cchanges in rate of climb.\u201d Rule 3 is implemented with steady-state turn rate. The soaring controller  inputs consist of normalized energy acceleration, \u00cb, position error, err, velocity error, err, and steady-state turn rate, {dot over (\u03c8)}. The soaring controller  output consists of a turn rate command, {dot over (\u03c8)}, that is sent to the autopilot. The controller gains, k, k, and k, , , and  respectively, are tuned by first setting k and k equal to zero. The energy acceleration gain k is tuned to produce a simulated aircraft response that followed the rules outlined by Reichmann, et al. when subjected to a variety of thermal strengths and sizes. The thermal model given in the reference is implemented into a hardware in the loop simulation for controller  evaluation and gain tuning. The k and k gains are tuned to make the path of the aircraft more circular and to improve the damping of the controller  during soaring flight in a variety of thermal sizes and strengths. The resulting control gains were chosen to be 50, 0.4, and 0.165 for k, k, and krespectively. Limiters , , , and  are used to limit the inputs into the controller  to ensure that one input does not dominate the aircraft's control. The output turn rate command is also limited by a turn rate limiter  to ensure the aircraft doesn't turn too abruptly and a limiter  to ensure the aircraft only turns left during soaring. Alternatively, the turn rate command output of the soaring controller can be used as a bank angle command if desired.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0153"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":"50"},"In general, mode logic is used to determine when to switch between searching flight and soaring flight. The mode logic described in this section is significant because it determines how a thermal is detected. The mode logic is broken into three components. Thermal detection logic  mode switching uses aircraft response to detect thermals upon encountering thermals. An encounter with a thermal by the aircraft produces large changes in energy rate and energy acceleration because of the atmospheric energy imputed to the aircraft as it traverses the thermal. During flight through a thermal, the energy acceleration changes sign and becomes negative when the energy rate peaks. The thermal detection logic is tuned to trigger when the thermal is imputing significant energy to the aircraft and the peak value has been reached. Thus, the thermal detection logic  provides a basic crest determination, above a selected threshold, for the thermal.","The thermal rejection logic  provides a decision to switch from soaring flight to searching flight using energy rate. Thermal rejection  is needed to switch from soaring flight to searching flight when the thermal is no longer providing sufficient energy to the aircraft. Two energy rate based criteria are used by the thermal rejection logic . First, thermals are rejected if the smoothed output of filter  is less than \u22120.5 m\/s. This criteria is met if the aircraft encountered light sink for a period of approximately 5 seconds. The second criteria, based on the output of filter , is triggered if the aircraft has not experienced sufficient energy rate for approximately 10 seconds. Additional criteria, not shown, may be used to disengage from soaring mode. The additional criteria, for example, are upper altitude limit exceeded, lower altitude limit exceeded, lost link, and soaring mode disabled by ground station operator.","The third component is the latch mechanism . The latch mechanism  receives inputs from the thermal detection logic  and the thermal rejection logic  and provides the actual \u201cswitch\u201d command from soaring flight to searching flight and visa-versa to the aircraft.","What is described are specific examples of many possible variations on the same invention and are not intended in a limiting sense. The claimed invention can be practiced using other variations not specifically described above."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, like or corresponding parts are denoted by like or corresponding reference numerals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
