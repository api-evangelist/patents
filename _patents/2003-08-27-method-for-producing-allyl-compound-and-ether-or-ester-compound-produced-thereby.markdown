Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method for producing a new allyl compound different from an allyl starting material compound by reacting the allyl starting material compound with an oxygen nucleophilic agent in the presence of a catalyst, and an ether or ester compound produced thereby.","2. Prior Arts","Various kinds of new allyl compounds can be synthesized by carrying out a catalytic reaction using a transition metal compound and using an allyl compound as a starting material. This reaction proceeds as illustrated in the following reaction formula, wherein an allyl starting material compound having an eliminating group X is \u03c0-coordinated and oxidatively added to a transition metal compound to form a \u03c0-allyl complex having three carbons of the allyl part bonded to a metal and the terminal allyl carbon of the \u03c0-allyl complex is attacked by a nucleophilic agent expressed by Nu\u2014H or Nu.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"28.79mm","wi":"123.53mm","file":"US07119222-20061010-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The synthesizing reaction of an allyl compound is generally fully described in \u201cPalladium Reagents and Catalysts -Innovations in Organic Synthesis-\u201d published by John Wiley & Sons Company, and various products in a form of allylated nucleophilic agent can be obtained by electing a kind of a nucleophilic agent in the reaction. Among them, when the nucleophilic agent is an oxygen nucleophilic agent such as alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids, respective allyl alkyl ether, allyl phenyl ether or allyl carboxylate esters are synthesized, and they are considered to be one of basic reactions useful in synthetic chemistry.","However, as a reaction example of an allyl starting material compound and an oxygen nucleophilic agent, the case in which the oxygen nucleophilic agent is carboxylic acid anion, is generally well known, but there are not so many reaction examples with other oxygen nucleophilic agents due to their low reactivity.","For example, as described in \u201cOrganometallics, 1995, 14, p. 4585\u201d illustrating a reaction example with phenols, a synthesis example of allyl phenyl ethers by a palladium catalyst system having a triaryl type monodentate phosphite ligand such as triphenyl phosphite is well known, but its activity is not sufficient.","Also, reaction examples with alcohols are very limited due to low nucleophilic attacking property of alcohol oxygen. As a reaction example between molecules of alcohol oxygen and an allyl starting material compound, dehydration condensation reaction of an allyl alcohol by a catalyst system using a monodentate phosphite ligand of triphenyl phosphite or triethyl phosphite was reported in \u201cNihon Kagakukai Kouen Yokoushuu, 2001, Vol. 79th, No. 2, p. 1194\u201d and \u201cNihon Gakujutsu Shinkoukai Souzou Kinou Kagaku Dai 116 Iinkai 2002, 6, Godou Bunkakai Shiryou p. 46\u201d. Also, a reaction of alcohols with an allyl alcohol by a catalyst system comprising triphenylphosphite considered to have a highest activity was also reported. However, its catalyst activity is still not high.","As an example of attacking a \u03c0-allyl complex by other alcohol oxygen, there are known some cyclizing reactions wherein the cyclization is carried out intramolecularly by attacking \u03c0-allyl terminal carbon with alcohol oxygen present at such a position as to form a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring in the reaction process. For example, as described in \u201cTetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, p. 5527\u201d, there is known a synthesis example of a morpholine derivative by a palladium catalyst system having triisopropyl phosphite as a monodentate phosphite ligand. Also, a synthesis example of a 5-membered cyclic product by a palladium catalyst system having a bidentate phosphite ligand having cyclic both terminals composed of a pentan-2,5-diyl group was reported in \u201cJ. Am. Chem. Soc., 1998, 120, p. 1732\u201d. However, it is necessary for these reactions that an oxygen nucleophilic agent is present at such a position as to easily form a ring, and they are allylation reaction which can proceed only intramolecularly and which is a special system.","When carrying out allylation reaction using the above-mentioned catalyst on an industrial scale, it is strongly demanded to improve a reactivity in order to reduce an amount of expensive palladium used, which is a noble metal, or to make a reactor size smaller, thereby reducing a manufacturing cost. As a method for improving the reactivity, there is a method for having a counter cation of a nucleophilic agent present in the reaction system. As its effect, a nucleophilic agent forming a pair or a coexistent state with such a counter cation increases its nucleophilic attacking force, thereby improving the reactivity.","As some examples, a reaction of cyclopentadiene monoxide and an acetic acid anion is reported in \u201cOrganic Syntheses, 1998, 67, p114\u201d, and in order to improve the reactivity, a sodium ion is used as a counter cation for acetic anion in this reaction. However, when such an alkali metal is a counter cation, +1 valent charge is concentrated on one small metal ion, and accordingly there is a tendency of forming a strong ion pair with a nucleophilic agent of a counter anion. Consequently, the attacking force of such a nucleophilic agent is not sufficiently high.","For example, it is reported in \u201cTetrahedron Lett., 1998, 39, p5439\u201d that an allyl starting material compound and a formic acid anion are reacted by using a palladium catalyst comprising a triisopropyl phosphite ligand of trialkyl type monodentate phosphite in the presence of ammonium comprising triethylamine having a proton coordinate-bonded, but this reaction is a reaction different from a reaction of an ordinary allyl starting material compound and a nucleophilic agent. That is, the formic acid anion does not form allyl formate by attacking a \u03c0-allyl complex as an intermediate but is coordinated to palladium, and carbon dioxide is eliminated and a hydride formed as this result reacts with the \u03c0-allyl complex to provide a product of a structure having the allyl starting material reduced.","As mentioned above, although it is possible to produce ether compounds or ester compounds important in organic synthesis by their reaction of an allyl starting material compound and its different oxygen nucleophilic agent, a highly active catalyst system which can sufficiently react an oxygen nucleophilic agent having a low reactivity has not been developed, and therefore practical reaction examples are actually limited. Particularly, in the reaction with alcohols, it is impossible to sufficiently proceed the reaction unless a special environment such as the above-mentioned intramolecular cyclization reaction is provided. Therefore, it has been demanded to develop a new catalyst system which achieves a sufficiently high catalyst activity even in the reaction with such an oxygen nucleophilic agent as having a low reactivity.","The present invention has been made for solving the above-mentioned problems. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an allyl compound, which can efficiently produce various allyl compounds by using a new catalyst system achieving an especially high activity to such an oxygen nucleophilic agent as having a low reactivity in the reaction of an allyl starting material compound and an oxygen nucleophilic agent, and to provide an ether compound and an ester compound.","The present inventors have intensively studied to develop a catalyst system capable of efficiently proceeding a reaction among molecules of various allyl starting material compounds and their different oxygen nucleophilic agents, and have discovered that a catalyst system comprising a multidentate phosphite compound and a transition metal compound of Group 8 to Group 10 of the Periodic Table achieves an unexpectedly very high activity as compared with a conventional catalyst system of monodentate phosphine or bidentate phosphine and a catalyst system of triphenyl phosphite known as a prior art. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this discovery.","That is, the essential feature of the present invention resides in a method for producing a new allyl compound having a compositional formula different from that of an allyl starting material compound, which comprises reacting the allyl starting material compound with an oxygen nucleophilic agent in the presence of a catalyst containing at least one transition metal compound containing a transition metal selected from the group consisting of transition metals belonging to Group 8 to Group 10 of the Periodic Table and a multidentate phosphite compound.","Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more details.","A method for producing an allyl compound in accordance with the present invention (hereinafter referred to as \u201cproduction method of the present invention\u201d) produces a new allyl compound having a compositional formula different from an allyl starting material compound by reacting the allyl starting material compound with an oxygen nucleophilic agent in the presence of a catalyst containing the following specific transition metal compound and the following multidentate coordinated phosphite compound.","First, the allyl starting material compound used in the production method of the present invention is explained hereinafter.

When the above illustrated groups have these substituents, the total carbon number including substituents should be within the above-mentioned range.","However, even when an oxygen nucleophilic agent is within the above-mentioned definition, it is necessary to exclude such an oxygen nucleophilic agent as to be the same as substituent (X or its anion X in the above formula (a)) or its proton adduct (X\u2014H), which is eliminated from an allyl starting material compound depending on the reaction, since it provides such a state as not proceeding the reaction apparently or such a state as producing an isomerized material only of the allyl starting material compound as a product. Also, it is necessary to exclude such an oxygen nucleophilic agent as to be completely the same as the allyl starting material compound, and for example, when the oxygen nucleophilic agent and the allyl starting material compound are both allyl alcohols, its product is limited to a diallyl ether having a structure obtained by simple dehydration condensation of the starting material, as previously described with regard to the prior art.

For example, when employing a stirring type completely mixing reactor, the reaction is carried out by a process comprising adding a catalyst solution prepared in a catalyst-preparing tank to a mixture solution of an allyl starting material compound, an oxygen nucleophilic agent and an optionally a solvent, introducing the resultant mixture into the reactor continuously or semi-continuously, retaining the reaction mixture at a reaction temperature with stirring to proceed the allylation reaction of the oxygen nucleophilic agent, and withdrawing a part of the reaction solution continuously or semi-continuously from the reactor. Also, when employing a plug flow type reactor, the reaction is carried out by passing the reaction solution containing the above starting materials and the catalyst through a tubular reactor maintained at a certain reaction temperature. This system is suitable for achieving a high conversion of the starting materials. Further, when employing an insoluble solid catalyst having a catalyst carried thereon, it is suitable to use a solid bed reaction system wherein the reaction is carried out by passing a solution containing starting materials through the reactor having the catalyst loaded, or it is possible to use a suspension bed reaction system wherein the reaction is carried out by stirring and mixing a solution containing starting materials and a particulate insoluble catalyst in a reactor and maintaining the reaction solution in suspension state.","The reaction temperature is not specially limited so long as it is a temperature at which the catalytic reaction proceeds, but when using a noble metal compound such as palladium, the reaction temperature should not be too high. If the reaction temperature is too high, there is a risk that metallization occurs and an effective catalyst concentration is reduced. Also, if the reaction temperature is too high, there is a risk that the phosphite compound is decomposed. Accordingly, a suitable reaction temperature is usually at least 0\u00b0 C., preferably at least 20\u00b0 C., more preferably at least 50\u00b0 C., and usually at most 180\u00b0 C., preferably at most 160\u00b0 C., and more preferably at most 150\u00b0 C.","The atmosphere in a reactor is preferably filled with a gas inert to the reaction system such as argon or nitrogen, in addition to vapors derived from a solvent, a starting material compound, a reaction product, a reaction by-product, a decomposed material of catalyst and the like. Particularly, it is necessary to pay a special attention so that the atmosphere should not be mixed with oxygen for example by air leakage. If the atmosphere is contaminated with oxygen, the catalyst is degraded and the phosphite compound is decomposed by oxidation. Thus, it is quite necessary to avoid the contamination of the atmosphere with oxygen.","The retention time of the reaction solution in the reactor, i.e. the reaction time, is varied depending on an aimed conversion value of the starting material, but it is necessary to prolong the reaction time if a higher conversion is desired under a constant catalyst concentration. On the other hand, if it is desired to reduce the reaction time by maintaining the high conversion, it is necessary to raise a catalyst activity by raising a catalyst concentration, increasing a catalyst amount or raising the reaction temperature. However, in order to avoid degradation of the catalyst or a side reaction by heat history, it is preferable not to employ unnecessarily long reaction time or high temperature.","In this case, it is preferable for improving a reaction activity to have a phosphonium compound and\/or an ammonium compound present in the reaction system.","The phosphonium compound and\/or the ammonium compound used in the present invention are not specially limited so long as they have basically a structure wherein four substituents are bonded to a phosphorus atom or a nitrogen atom. By providing such a structure, there is provided a counter cation forming only an ion pair milder than an alkali metal ion which is often conventionally used, and accordingly an attacking property, i.e. reactivity, of a nucleophilic agent can be raised. This is because in the case of an alkali metal ion, +1 valent charge is concentrated on the surface of a small alkali metal ion, whereas in the case of a phosphonium compound or an ammonium compound, the whole molecule is +1 valent and a phosphorus atom or a nitrogen atom having charges concentrated thereon is concealed by four substituents.","Hereinafter, an explanation is made with regard to each compound.","Phosphonium Compound","A phosphonium compound is not specially limited, provided that it is stable under reaction conditions and is solved in the reaction system and does not poison the catalyst (examples of a compound poisoning a catalyst include a compound containing a conjugated diene, a compound oxidizing or decomposing a phosphite compound such as a peroxide, and the like).

In this case, any one kind of phosphonium compound may be used alone or several kinds of phosphonium compounds may be used by optionally combining and mixing.","A method for introducing the phosphonium compound into the reaction system is not specially limited, but there is a method of positively adding the phosphonium compound to the reaction system or a method of preparing the phosphonium compound in the reaction system. These methods are further explained hereinafter by referring to examples.","First, the method of positively adding the phosphonium compound to the reaction system is a method of feeding the phosphonium compound together with an allyl compound, a nucleophilic agent, a catalyst, a reaction medium and the like to a reactor, and the phosphonium compound may be a new phosphonium compound or a phosphonium compound recycled from the reaction process. In connection with this, it should be noted that since a commercially available phosphonium compound is generally charged with +1 valent charge per one phosphorus atom, it is in a form of salt with its corresponding counter anion, but the counter anion corresponding to phosphonium is preferably a nucleophilic agent reactive with an allyl starting material compound in the reaction system. If the counter anion is not a nucleophilic agent but a phosphonium compound in a form of salt with other counter anion is added, it is desired that the other counter anion does not poison a catalyst and is decomposed by reacting with an allyl compound in the reaction system so that a nucleophilic agent becomes newly a counter anion. Generally known examples of a counter anion of a commercially available phosphonium compound include a halogen atom ion such as chloride, bromide or iodide, and hexafluorophosphate, hexachlorophosphate, hydrogen sulfate, tetrachloroborate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, perchlorate or the like. Among these examples, it is generally considered that there is a high possibility that a halide ion poisons a transition metal catalyst. When using such a halide phosphonium compound, it is preferable to previously remove a halide ion by anion exchange reaction. In this case, it is more preferable to make a nucleophilic agent using a new counter anion in the allylation reaction.","On the other hand, the method of preparing a phosphonium compound in the reaction system includes a method of adding a trivalent phosphorus compound as a starting material for phosphonium. This method uses such a reaction as described in the J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1992, 114, p6858, and this reaction comprises nucleophilicly attacking a terminal allyl carbon of a \u03c0-allyl complex of transition metal by a trivalent phosphorus compound to form a phosphonium compound having an allyl group newly bonded. Actually, when a production process of 1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene by reaction of 3,4-diacetoxy-1-butene as an allyl starting material compound and acetoxide as a nucleophilic agent in the presence of triphenylphosphine in an amount of 200 equivalents to palladium and palladium-bidentate coordinated phosphite catalyst is analyzed by P-NMR spectrum, a signal of triphenylphosphine of \u22126 ppm rapidly disappears at the initial stage of reaction and is converted to signals of a plurality of phosphoniums observed at 17 to 25 ppm. Judging from the chemical shift values, these signals are considered to be due to phosphoniums, and the reason why a plurality of kinds are observed, is due to the formation of isomers such as [PPh(CHCH\u2550CHCHOAc)][OAc], [PPhCH(CHOAc)(CH\u2550CH)][OAc], [PPh(CHCH\u2550CHCH)PPh]2[OAc], [PPhCH(CHPPh)(CH\u2550CH)]2[OAc], or the like. When carrying out such a process, it should be noted that a ligand coordinated to a transition metal compound is eliminated and a catalyst activity is lowered when a coordination power of a trivalent phosphorus compound added as a starting material for phosphonium to a transition metal compound is too high. In such a case, it is necessary to previously convert into a phosphonium compound at the outside of the system before feeding or to wait for slowly converting into a phosphonium compound during carrying out the process.","In view of economic conditions, it is advantageous to use the above phosphonium compound in a small amount. Thus, the phosphonium compound is used to a metal compound as an allylation catalyst (fully described above) at a mol ratio of usually at least 0.1, preferably at least 1, more preferably at least 5, further preferably at least 10, most preferably at least 15, and usually at most 10,000, preferably at most 5,000, more preferably at most 1,000, most preferably at most 500.","Ammonium Compound","An ammonium compound usable in the present invention basically has a structure having four substituents bonded to nitrogen.

In this case, any one kind of ammonium compound may be present alone, or a plurality of kinds of ammonium compounds may be mixed in optional combination.","A method for introducing an ammonium compound into the reaction system is not specially limited, but its examples include a method of positively adding the ammonium compound to the reaction system or a method of preparing the ammonium compound in the reaction system. These methods are further explained by giving concrete examples hereinafter.","First, the method of positively adding the ammonium compound to the reaction system is a method of feeding the ammonium compound together with an allyl compound, a nucleophilic agent, a catalyst, a reaction medium and the like into a reactor, and the ammonium compound may be a new ammonium compound or may be an ammonium compound recycled from the reaction process. In this regard, it should be noted that since a commercially available ammonium compound generally has +1 valent charge per one nitrogen, it takes a form of salt with its corresponding counter anion, but it is preferable that this counter anion corresponding to ammonium is a nucleophilic agent to be reacted with an allyl starting material compound in the reaction system. If the counter anion is not a nucleophilic agent and an ammonium compound in a form of a salt with other counter anion is added, it is desired that the other counter anion does not poison a catalyst and is decomposed by reaction with an allyl compound in the reaction system, and a nucleophilic agent newly becomes a counter anion. Generally known examples of a counter anion of a commercially available ammonium compound include a halide ion such as chloride, bromide or iodide, and hexafluorophosphate, hexachlorophosphate, hydrogen sulfate, tetrachloroborate, trifluoromethane sulfonate, perchlorate and the like. Among them, it is generally considered that there is a high possibility that the halide ion poisons a transition metal catalyst. When such a halogenated ammonium compound is used in the reaction, it is preferable to previously remove it by anionic change reaction or the like. In this case, it is more desirable that a new counter anion is used as a nucleophilic agent to be used for allylation reaction.","On the other hand, examples of the method of preparing an ammonium compound in the reaction system include a method of adding an amine or pyridine compound as a starting material for ammonium. In this method, these compounds showing a basic property causes acid-base reaction with a proton acidic site of a nucleophilic agent in a reactor, and as this result, an ammonium or pyridinium compound having a structure having proton coordinate-bonded to a non-covalent electron pair on nitrogen. When carrying out such a process, it should be noted that when a nucleophilic agent has a proton acidic site, this method can be satisfactorily carried out and achieves a substantial effect particularly in the reaction of an oxygen nucleophilic agent such as phenol or carboxylic acids and a carbon nucleophilic agent such as malonic acid ester derivatives, but when a nucleophilic agent is a nitrogen nucleophilic agent such as amines, a substantial effect can not be achieved since amines are originally basic. Further, it should be noted that when an amine compound added as a starting material for ammonium has an excessively high coordinative power to a transition metal compound, a ligand originally coordinated to a transition metal compound is eliminated and a catalyst activity is lowered. In such a case, it is necessary to previously convert an amine compound into an ammonium compound at the outside of the system before feeding or to wait that an amine compound is gradually converted into an ammonium compound during carrying out the process.","It is advantageous from an economical viewpoint that the above ammonium compound is used in a smaller amount. Thus, the ammonium compound is used in a mol ratio of usually at least 0.1, preferably at least 1, more preferably at least 5, further preferably at least 10, most preferably at least 15, and usually at most 10,000, preferably at most 5,000, more preferably at most 1,000, most preferably at most 500, to a metal compound as an allylation reaction catalyst as fully illustrated above.","Also, many separating operations used in a conventional liquid catalyst recycling process can be employed for separating a catalyst and an allyl compound obtained in the reaction. Examples of the separating operations include distillation operations such as simple distillation, vacuum distillation, thin film distillation, water vapor distillation or the like, and other separating operations such as gas-liquid separation, evaporation, gas stripping, gas absorption and extraction. The separating operation of each component may be carried out respectively in an independent step, or separation of two or more components may be carried out at the same time in a single step.

However, when water or acetic acid by-produced depending on a reaction retains in the reaction system, the molecular weight of the condensation copolymer thus produced does not become large, and it is therefore preferable to proceed the reaction by removing acetic acid or water from the reaction system when it is desired to obtain the condensation copolymer having a larger molecular weight. Acetic acid or water can be removed from the reaction system by distillation under normal pressure or reduced pressure or by adding such a compound like calcium oxide as to form an insoluble salt by reacting with acetic acid or water.","Also, a method for removing a catalyst from the condensation copolymer thus obtained can be effectively carried out by distillation when the condensation copolymer product has a low molecular weight and can be distilled, but the catalyst is usually removed by a fractional precipitation method which comprises adding a poor solvent to the condensation copolymer to precipitate the condensation copolymer and separating a supernatant phase containing the catalyst. In such a case, the catalyst contained in the supernatant phase, the condensation copolymer having a low molecular weight and the starting material can be recycled into a reactor for reuse after removing the poor solvent from the supernatant phase by distillation, which is economically preferable. Also, when employing the fractional precipitation method, the condensation copolymer thus produced contains a poor solvent, and it is therefore necessary to remove the poor solvent by distillation.","The condensation copolymer of the present invention is characterized by having a structure having a double bond in the main chain and a side chain, and can work as a cross-linking agent by being added to other condensation copolymer or polymer to have the double bond reacted or can be used for producing a new polymer having a high function or performance by introducing a new functional group into the double bond of the condensation copolymer.","Hereinafter, the present invention is further fully illustrated by the following Examples, but should not be limited thereto.","Allylphenyl ether synthesis reaction of the present invention was carried out by using allylmethyl carbonate as an allyl starting material compound and phenol as an oxygen nucleophilic agent.","A catalyst solution having a palladium concentration of 15.05 mmol\/l was prepared by adding 0.0149 g (0.0151 mmol) of trisdibenzylideneacetone dipalladium having a palladium content of 21.5 wt % as a transition metal compound and the above (L-26) bidentate phosphite (Example 1) or the above (L-8) bidentate phosphite (Example 2) respectively in an amount of 4 equivalents (0.1204 mmol) to palladium as a multidentate coordinated phosphite compound to a container substituted with argon, adding 2.0 ml of tetrahydrofuran thereto and stirring the resultant mixture at room temperature.
