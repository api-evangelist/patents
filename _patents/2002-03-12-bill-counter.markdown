Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a bill counter having the function to determine whether bills are authentic or not.","Further, the present invention relates to a bill counter, more specifically relates mainly to a bill counter having plural kinds of authenticity\/counterfeit determining means that enables to easily conduct authenticity\/counterfeit determination, without need for an operator to set how to determine with which kind of authenticity\/counterfeit means according to characteristics of objective bills.","2. Description of the Related Art","Bill counters having the function to determine whether bills are authentic or not can roughly be divided into two. The first type of bill counter specifies face value kinds of objective bills, and conducts authenticity\/counterfeit determination according to the specified face value kinds. On the other hand, the second type of bill counter conducts authenticity\/counterfeit determination, without specifying face value kinds, and configured to conduct authenticity\/counterfeit determination according to characteristics not depending upon face value kinds.","Bill counters belonging to the above second type having plural different kinds of authenticity\/counterfeit determining means (detectors) are already disclosed to those skilled in the art, and there are, for example, one bill counter disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,114,804 and another disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 53-44089 A by the same applicant.","These publications disclose means for detecting magnetic ink and means for detecting fluorescent reaction as authenticity\/counterfeit determining means, and in the case wherein the magnetic ink is detected in a bill to be inspected and also fluorescent reaction is not detected, the bill inspected is determined as an authentic bill.","In the first place, the bill counters disclosed in these publications are supposed to be used to handle only U.S. bills, as described in their specifications, therefore, authenticity\/counterfeit means are selected and combined according to the characteristics of the U.S. bills. Namely, they employ the determining method based on the characteristics that the US bills (authentic bills) use magnetic ink, and fluorescent reaction is not detected in them.","While, in the Euro bloc, there is a demand for a bill counter equipped with authenticity\/counterfeit determining function to handle both Euro bills and U.S. dollar bills circulated all over the world. Further, in nations neighboring to the Euro bloc, there is a demand for a bill counter equipped with authenticity\/counterfeit determining function to handle not only the Euro bills and the U.S. dollar bills but also bills of their own nations.","The counterfeit bill preventive countermeasures vary with respective nations, and various countermeasures, for instance, adoption of infrared ray absorbing ink, interweaving of threads and so forth, are taken, therefore, in order to handle these bills, it is naturally required to adopt an infrared ray absorbing ink detector and a thread detector. By loading plural authenticity\/counterfeit determining functions corresponding to these various counterfeit bill preventive countermeasures, it is possible to make a general purpose bill counter that handles bills of many countries.","However, in order to make the most of the above general purpose bill counter, it is necessary for operators to be well informed of the contents of counterfeit preventive countermeasures concerning bills to be inspected, and set detectors according to the counterfeit preventive countermeasures, as a consequence, complicated settings has to be done and it can't easily be used, which has been a problem with the prior art.","While, there is a demand for a bill counter equipped with authenticity\/counterfeit determining function to handle both Euro bills and US dollar bills circulated all over the world, in nations over the world, besides the above, various counterfeit preventive countermeasures, for instance, adoption of infrared ray absorbing ink, interweaving of threads and so forth, are taken in respective nations, therefore, in order to handle these bills under various counterfeit preventive countermeasures, only magnetic ink detection and fluorescent reaction detection mentioned above are not sufficient, but it is naturally required to adopt an infrared ray absorbing ink detector and a thread detector.","By loading authenticity\/counterfeit determining functions corresponding to these various counterfeit bill preventive countermeasures, it is possible to make a general-purpose bill counter that handles bills of many nations. However, in order to make the most of the general purpose bill counter, it is necessary for operators to be well informed of the contents of counterfeit preventive countermeasures concerning bills to be inspected, and set detectors according to the counterfeit preventive countermeasures, as a consequence, complicated settings must be done and it is hard to use, which has been a problem with the prior art.","The present invention has been made in consideration of the above problems with the prior art, accordingly an object of the present invention is to provide a bill counter that does not require designation of detectors effective for authenticity\/counterfeit determination corresponding to counterfeit preventive countermeasures of bills issued by major nations (for example, Euro bills and U.S. dollar bills), and yet enables counting only by designation of kinds of bills issued by the nations concerned.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a bill counter that does not require designation of authenticity\/counterfeit determining means corresponding to counterfeit bill preventive countermeasures.","The present invention relates to a bill counter that does not require designation of detectors effective for authenticity\/counterfeit determination corresponding to counterfeit preventive countermeasures, and yet enables counting only by designation of kinds of

ray radiation light source by the visible light receiving element , and  is a thread detector for detecting thread of bills, and the numeral  is a permission type infrared detector comprising an infrared ray radiation light source and an infrared light receiving element , for detecting the infrared ray amount of bills inspected after infrared ray radiation from the infrared ray radiation

The numeral  is a schematic view showing bills passing through respective detectors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["30","31","32","35"]},"In the present preferred embodiment, for example, when \u201cCF\u201d key  is pressed down and then \u201c7\/UV\u201d key is pressed, the ultraviolet detector gets effective, and in this status when further \u201c8\/MG\u201d key is pressed down, both the ultraviolet detector and the magnetic detector become effective. As a result, the indication lamps UV and MG at the right side of the \u201cCF\u201d key are lit, showing that these detectors are selected.","When the \u201cCF\u201d key  is pressed down, and then \u201c1\u201d key is pressed, U.S. 100 dollar bill is selected, and detector group for the U.S. 100 dollar bill memorized in bill type memory means  to be described later herein is selected. In the case of the present invention, as described later, this one operation enables to select 3 detectors, i.e., magnetic detector, fluorescent reaction detector and ultraviolet detector. As a consequence, operators can conduct authenticity\/counterfeit determination only by selecting the U.S. 100 dollar bill, without knowing the kind of detectors corresponding to the U.S. 100 dollar bills. The codes  and  are counting start keys, and the former one is \u201cAUTO START\u201d key, while the latter is \u201cRESTART\u201d key.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["70","71","72","72","72","73","74","74","74","75","60","80","30","32"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b"]},"The first case is that an operator, who knows well the contents of counterfeit preventive countermeasures of the bills to be inspected, selectively specifies detectors effective for the bills to be inspected. In this case, as mentioned above, for example, when the \u201cCF\u201d key  is pressed down, and then the \u201c8\/MG\u201d key in common use with numeric keys is pressed, authenticity\/counterfeit determination is conducted by the magnetic detector . This is determination mode selection, which is the prior method.","The second case pertains to the present invention, wherein only by selectively specifying the kinds of bills, detectors effective for the selectively designated bills are automatically selected, and in this case, when for example the \u201cCF\u201d key  is pressed down, and then the \u201c1\u201d key among the numeric keys is pressed down, then the U.S. 100 dollar mode gets effective, and in this mode, authenticity\/counterfeit determination is conducted by the magnetic detector , the fluorescent reaction detector  and the ultraviolet detector . Into the bill type memory means , data designating which detectors are effective for at least Euro bills and the U.S. dollar bills is registered in advance. In more concrete, as for Euro bills, 4 kinds of detectors in total, i.e., the magnetic detector, the fluorescent reaction detector, the threads detector and the infrared detector are registered, while as for the U.S. dollar bills, 2 kinds of detectors in total, namely the magnetic detector and the fluorescent reaction detector are registered therein. In addition, with regards to the U.S. dollar bills, it is preferable to sort them by means of face values. In concrete, it is preferable from the current conditions of counterfeit bills of the U.S. dollar bills to sort the U.S. dollar bills into 100 dollar bills and other bills, and as for 100 dollar bills, 3 kinds of detectors in total, i.e., the magnetic detector, the fluorescent reaction detector and the ultraviolet detector should be employed, while as for other bills, 2 kinds of detector in total, i.e., the abovementioned magnetic detector and the fluorescent reaction detector should be employed. The control section  is for conducting the processing items shown in the flow chart in  on the basis of a specified program. For example, a micro computer may be employed. Into the determination condition memory means , as described later herein, the output level of respective detectors in the case of authentic bills is memorized per kind of bill, and this data is compared with the actually detected values, thereby bills are determined whether authentic or not.","Next, in reference to the flow charts in , actions of the bill counter according to the present invention are explained hereinafter. In addition,  show the case wherein bills to be inspected are U.S. 100 dollar bills, however, it goes without saying that acts in the same way as for other bills.","First, by the bill type selecting means , the U.S. 100 dollar bill is selected (Step S). In concrete, after the \u201cCF\u201d key is pressed down, the \u201c1\u201d key is pressed down. When the U.S. 100 dollar bill is selected as shown above, the control section  reads out the selection data of detector group for the U.S. 100 dollar bill contained in the bill type memory means  (Step S). In concrete, the detector group comprising 3 kinds of detectors, i.e., the magnetic detector , the fluorescent reaction detector  and the ultraviolet detector , is selected. On the basis of this data, the control section  conducts setting so as to enable only the output of these 3 kinds of detectors (Step S). In this status, a stack of the U.S. 100 dollar bills as the objective bills is placed onto the bill loading section  (Step S).","Next, the counting start button (\u201cAUTO START\u201d key)  at the operation\/display section  is pressed down (Step S), then if there are bills on the bill loading section (\u2018YES\u2019 in Step S), bills are transferred (Step S), and the objective bills go through the authenticity\/counterfeit determination block  (Step S), and they are determined whether authentic or not, then they are accumulated in a line into the collection section  (Step S).","As the result of authenticity\/counterfeit determination, if a bill is determined as authentic bill (genuine bill) (\u2018YES\u2019 in Step S), the process goes back to the Step S, and the steps from Step S to Step S are repeated so long as there are bills on the bill loading section  or until a bill is determined as a counterfeit bill.","In the meantime, if a bill is determined as a counterfeit bill in the Step S (\u2018NO\u2019 in Step S), an indication that it is a counterfeit bill is displayed on the display section , and the transfer means is suspended (Step S). And \u201c1\u201d is deducted from the number of already counted bills (Step S) and the counterfeit bill at the collecting section is removed (Step S). Thereafter, the process goes back to the Step S, wherein the counting start button is pressed down, and authenticity\/counterfeit determination on the next bill is restarted. In this manner, counting is conducted until there is not a bill any more on the bill loading section , and when there is no bill left there (\u2018NO\u2019 in Step S), the transfer means is suspended (Step S). Therein, if counting is continued on the same kind of bill (\u2018YES\u2019 in Step S), another stack of bills is placed onto the bill loading section  (Step S), and the counting start button is pressed down, and counting is resumed (Step S).","Further, the conditions for authenticity\/counterfeit determination per detector in the Step S are as shown below.\n\n","The above determination conditions are contained in the determination condition memory means .","Since this bill counter enables to handle bills of many nations, the bill counter is equipped with 5 kinds of detectors in total, and though there is an idea that bills of individual nation should be registered in advance too, but in that case, data will occupy many memory areas, and operation will be complicated, therefore, in this bill counter, only limited major kinds of bills are to be registered. As a consequence, with regard to bills that are not registered, it is necessary for an operator to selectively designate detectors effective for the bills to be inspected by himself in the same way as in the conventional operation.","For example, in the case to handle bills of the Czech Republic as one of the neighboring nations of the Euro bloc, it is necessary to selectively designate 3 kinds of detectors, namely a fluorescent reaction detector, the thread detector and an infrared detector, while in the case to handle bills of Hungary as another of Euro bloc neighboring nations, it is required to selectively designate 3 kinds of detectors, namely the magnetic detector, the fluorescent reaction detector and the infrared detector.","In the present invention, data about which detectors are effective to each bill per bill type (per issuing nation) is registered in advance, only selection of bill type is made by an operator thereof, and authenticity\/counterfeit determination is conducted by detectors corresponding to the selected bill. Thereby, operation to set detectors to determine whether authentic or not regarding the selected bills is unnecessary, as a result operation properties are increased, and further operator may conduct authenticity\/counterfeit determination without knowing which detectors are effective for selected bills. Further in the present invention, as the bills per bill type (per issuing nation) to be registered in prior, at least Euro bills and the U.S. dollar bills are included, as a consequence, operation to designate detectors by operator on these kinds of bills is unnecessary, and operation properties are increased.","Still further in the invention, the U.S. dollar bills are sorted into bills with face value 100 dollars and ones with other face values, and authenticity\/counterfeit determination is conducted by detectors with different determination principles to these respective face values, thereby it is possible to cope with the current conditions of counterfeit US dollar bills.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["71","72","73","74","80","20","30","32"]},"Determination condition memory means  is for memorizing output presence or absence conditions per each detector on the firstly fed bill. In concrete presence of magnetic ink detection, absence of thread detection and so forth are memorized therein. The condition match comparison means  conducts comparison on the secondly fed bill and thereafter with the contents memorized in the determination condition memory means , and in the case of discrepancy, informs the control section  to the effect that there is suspicion of counterfeit, and the control section  in response to this information displays the effect on the display section  of the operation\/display section , and also stops the transfer means .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"},"By the way, presence and absence of detection output in the present invention are defined per each kind of detectors as below. In the magnetic ink detection, presence of detection output means literally a case wherein output signal has been positively detected by magnetic components. In the fluorescent reaction detection, presence of detection output means a case wherein ultraviolet ray is radiated from an ultraviolet ray radiation light source onto a bill, and fluorescent reaction from the entire bill surface has been detected by a light receiving element. Namely, fluorescent reaction arising from bill paper quality or a bleaching agent is to be objective.","In the thread detection, presence of detection output means literally a case wherein changes in static electricity capacity or changes in magnetic flux caused by thread have been positively detected. In the infrared ink detection, presence of detection output means a case wherein as a result that infrared ray radiated from an infrared ray radiation light source is infrared ray absorbed by infrared absorbing ink printed on bills, infrared ray has not been detected by a light receiving element.","First, as objective bills, a stack of bills wherein only magnetic ink is adopted as counterfeit preventive countermeasures is placed on the bill loading section  in  (Step S). Then, the determination mode selecting means  shown in  is operated and all the 4 detectors are selected (Step S). By the way, by setting auto selection mode, all the authenticity\/counterfeit determining means may be selected automatically when the bill counter is turned on. In this case, authenticity\/counterfeit determining means that become unnecessary for some kinds of bills may be made invalid by the determination mode selecting means . When the counting start button  shown in  is pressed down (Step S), the lowest one of the bills loaded on the bill loading section  is sent as the first bill to the determination block  (Step S). By the way, in the Step S, if auto start mode is set wherein counting gets started automatically when bills are put on the bill loading section , there is no need to press the counting start button .","In this case, wherein bills are ones adopting only magnetic ink as counterfeit preventive countermeasures, there is not infrared absorbing ink, so even if infrared ray is radiated onto bills, infrared ray is not absorbed, therefore, infrared ray goes through bills, and infrared ray is detected, but according to the above definition, it is handled as no detection output. Only the magnetic detector in the determination block detects and outputs the presence of output, while the fluorescent detector\/thread detector\/infrared detector detect and output the absence of output (Step S). Then, this output result (condition) is memorized into the determination condition memory means  (Step S). Next, the second bill is fed and sent to the determination block  (Step S), and the presence or absence of detection on the bill concerned by the respective detectors is outputted (Step S), and comparison to see whether it matches or not is conducted by the condition match comparison means  (Step S). If it matches herein, on the condition that bills are left on the bill loading section  (Step S), the process goes back to the Step  for processing on the third bill, while if it is determined as not to match, the effect is informed to the control section, and the control section at the information instructs the display section to display to that effect that it is a counterfeit bill and also instructs to stop the transfer means (Step S).","The above is the explanation on the flow of authenticity\/counterfeit determination and counting in the case wherein objective bills are ones adopting only magnetic ink as counterfeit preventive countermeasures, however, it goes without saying that actions are same as for other bills wherein other counterfeit preventive countermeasures are taken.","A bill counter according to the present invention reads the characteristics of counterfeit preventive countermeasures in the firstly fed bill, and automatically conducts authenticity\/counterfeit determination on the basis of the information, as a consequence, it may be used for handling bills of nations over the world, without necessity for an operator to set up authenticity\/counterfeit determination conditions.","Especially in the Euro bloc, they must handle both their own nation's bills and Euro bills as common bills, while the adoption of a bill counter according to the present invention enables to handle these different kinds of bills well only by sorting them into bill kinds, without setting authenticity\/counterfeit determination conditions according to kinds. This is same to banks wherein plural foreign currency bills are handled.","By the way, it is also available to use a stacker sensor  shown in  for resetting bill determination conditions. Namely, while there are bills at the collecting section , the previous bill determination conditions are set to be held, and when there is no bill any more on the collecting section , it is determined that process is complete, and the bill determination conditions are cleared. By arrangement in this manner, even when all the bills are sent from the bill loading section to the collecting section and there is no bill any more, when to further add the same kind of bills and process them, the determination conditions may be held by not taking bills out of the collecting section","As mentioned heretofore, according to the invention described, wherein output presence\/output absence of plural kinds of detectors on the firstly processed bill is detected, and the result is compared with the detection output of the secondly processed bill and thereafter, thereby authenticity\/counterfeit determination is conducted, irrespective of counterfeit preventive countermeasures on objective bills, setting of authenticity\/counterfeit determination conditions per each of counterfeit preventive countermeasures of objective bills by operator is unnecessary, and operating properties are increased.","According to the invention, wherein transfer is suspended when a bill of suspicion of counterfeit is detected, it is possible to easily sort out the bill with suspicion and other bills (bills that have been determined as authentic).","According to the invention, when there is only one objective bill and there is no second bill or thereafter, and comparison of authenticity\/counterfeit determination conditions cannot be made accordingly, and authenticity\/counterfeit determination cannot be conducted automatically, the kind of detector to which the only one objective bill has reacted (i.e., has outputted) is displayed to inform operator, thereby it is possible to make the authenticity\/counterfeit determination further convenient.","Further more specifically, in the present invention, authenticity\/counterfeit determination conditions are automatically set according to a bill to be processed first. Accordingly, in the case when a bill to be processed first happens to be a counterfeit bill, the second authentic bill and thereafter are determined as suspicious as counterfeit bills. Nevertheless, the kind of detector that has had output on the bill processed first is displayed to operator, therefore, on the condition that operator is well informed of authenticity\/counterfeit information about objective bills in advance, it is possible for operator to know that the bill first processed is a counterfeit bill according to the information.","The invention is simplified to be structured with a single authenticity\/counterfeit determining means. If output is detected on the first bill by the single authenticity\/counterfeit determining means, when the similar output is obtained on the second bill and thereafter, it is determined that bills are authentic ones. On the other hand, if output is not detected on the first bill by the single authenticity\/counterfeit determining means, when output is obtained on the second bill and thereafter, it is determined that the bill concerned is a counterfeit bill, however, this may be used rather for finding out the case wherein different kinds of bills are mixed in objective bills."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the accompanying drawings:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A and 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIGS. 8A and 8B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
