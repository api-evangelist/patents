{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/096,414 filed Sep. 12, 2008, entitled \u201cINTELLIGENT SYSTEM MANAGER SYSTEM AND METHOD\u201d which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a system manager system and method, and in particular to a system manager system and method that monitors and controls a platform.","Process, plant and machinery control systems, particularly for naval and commercial shipboard applications, as well as for other mobile and fixed applications, have historically been designed in a centralized fashion with many systems operating independently of one another. This practice results in \u201cstove-piped\u201d systems that operate side-by-side and independently, each being controlled on its own, without significant communication amongst the systems. In stove-piped systems, the various elements generally do not communicate or in the limited instances in which they do communicate, communication is via vendor-proprietary communication protocols which oftentimes leads to troublesome issues when integrating, maintaining and\/or upgrading a system.","In addition, the application engineering effort required to customize these control systems for specific platform applications has traditionally been significant and has required highly skilled engineers to make different software system modifications for each different platform or application target. Where the application is a ship, for example, it is noted that similar ships, even ships of the same type or class designation, built at different times will differ in certain design features, as is the case for similar applications. The resulting differences introduce problems that will require specialized application engineering.","These conventional closed, proprietary systems are usually more costly to develop and to maintain over the product life cycle for the following reasons:\n\n","Accordingly, there is a need for a system and method for intelligently managing a platform.","To this end, an intelligent system manager system for managing and controlling a platform may comprise a management component providing intelligent decision support and managing platform functions responsive to data representative of the platform and equipment thereof, an execution and monitor component for causing execution of commands controlling the platform and equipment thereof and monitoring the execution of the commands and the status of platform sensors and platform equipment, a display component providing information representative of the current state of the platform and receiving input, and a common services component providing processing services to the management component, to the execution and monitor component, and to the display component.","In another aspect, a method for intelligently managing and controlling a platform may comprise:\n\n","In the Drawing, where an element or feature is shown in more than one drawing figure, the same alphanumeric designation may be used to designate such element or feature in each figure, and where a closely related or modified element or partial element is shown in a figure, the same alphanumerical designation primed or designated \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d or the like may be used to designate the modified or partial element or feature. Similarly, similar elements or features may be designated by like alphanumeric designations in different figures of the Drawing and with similar nomenclature in the specification. It is noted that, according to common practice, the various features of the drawing are not to scale, and the dimensions of the various features are arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity, and any value stated in any Figure is given by way of example only.","As a general matter, the item numbers of the blocks (boxes) of the Figures are identified in the description, and the text in the blocks (boxes) of the Figures generally repeats that information for the convenience of a reader looking at the Figures.","In the example context of a ship control system , the ISM-X\u2122 system  provides monitoring A, management  and control B of shipboard hull, mechanical and electrical (HM&E) systems including but not limited to Auxiliary, Damage Control, Power, Propulsion, and Ride Control systems. ISM-X\u2122 system  is capable of autonomous control of HM&E systems, e.g., through suitable control logic and\/or intelligent software applications, or of manual control by ISM-X\u2122 operators , e.g., via a human machine interface (HMI) . ISM-X\u2122 system  also provides external interfaces  for communication with Command and Control (C2) systems , Integrated Bridge Systems (IBS) , Navigation (NAV) Systems  and External Communications (EXCOMMS) systems  to enable remote (e.g., off board) monitoring and control of the HM&E systems, as well as internal communication systems .","The following provides a summary of the ISM-X\u2122 System Architecture, and may be read in conjunction with , , , , and :","The ISM-X\u2122 system  includes two primary elements: a Runtime Application , and a Development Kit  that is utilized to compile Runtime Application . Development Kit  comprises a Systems Control Intelligent Database (SCID) , an automated check list manager , and interfaces to software packages (some or all of which may be Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software packages) for simplified development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) screens , control logic , system simulations , and data historian\/trending functions . Data and\/or information relating to a platform is typically provided by an engineer, designer or other person seeking to design and\/or develop and\/or configure a platform or system, e.g., development kit  is a considered a tool for such person. Development Kit  receives and\/or stores data representing a desired and\/or specified configuration, characteristics and functions for an actual platform , e.g., a ship, vessel, aircraft, installation, building, facility, or other thing or location, including various systems, equipment and machinery thereof. Development Kit  may also receive and\/or store input data, e.g., representative of sensor values and the like, that represent specifications and\/or limits of the conditions and\/or status of the platform  and its systems, equipment and\/or machinery, at which certain actions may be initiated and\/or taken.","As described herein, the Development Kit  tool processes that received and\/or stored data to configure a runtime application  that is representative of an actual configuration, condition and\/or status of a platform  and of its systems, equipment and\/or machinery, in a form that will be useful for processing actual then-present data for monitoring, managing and\/or otherwise operating such platform  when the platform  is built or made. Development kit  is typically utilized by design engineers, systems engineers, and similar persons, to develop a control system ; it does not use inputs of actual sensor values which are received by and utilized by runtime application . Preferably, the data that is representative of an actual configuration, condition and\/or status of a platform  and of its systems, equipment and\/or machinery, is provided by Runtime Application  described herein which may be installed and\/or loaded on the platform . Such data is typically developed, compiled and displayed on a display or other device in a form that a human designer and\/or engineer or other operator can observe, understand, debug, test, and use, in designing and\/or configuring the platform .","Runtime Application  is represented as a component based software system architecture including an Execution and Monitor Component , a Management Component , a Display Component  and a Common Services Component . Runtime Application  receives and\/or stores data representing the configuration, characteristics and functions of an actual platform , e.g., a ship, vessel, aircraft, installation, building, facility, or other thing or location, including various systems, equipment and machinery thereof. This platform-specific representative data is provided for a specific platform  as compiled into a complete runtime application  for that specific platform , typically and preferably from development kit . While running, Runtime Application  receives and\/or stores data, e.g., sensor values, alarm values, operator provided values, and the like, that represent the actual then-present condition and\/or status, or a desired and\/or proposed condition and\/or status, of platform  and its systems, equipment and\/or machinery.","As described herein, Runtime Application  evaluates and\/or processes that received and\/or stored data to generate and provide data that is representative of the actual then-present configuration, condition and\/or status of the platform  and of its systems, equipment and\/or machinery, preferably at a time sufficiently close in time to the reading of the then-present conditions and\/or status so as to be useful for monitoring, managing and controlling the platform  and its systems, equipment and\/or machinery. Such updated then-current data is typically processed and displayed on a display or other device in a form that a human operator can observe, understand and use. For things that may change quickly, e.g., in a matter of seconds or minutes, the updated then-current output data is preferably provided within, e.g., seconds or minutes; for things that change more slowly, e.g., in a matter of several minutes or hours, updated then-current output data may be provided later in time, e.g., after several minutes or hours. Thus, \u201creal-time\u201d may be defined differently in different contexts, and does not mean immediate.","Runtime Application :","The Display Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) via an HMI  to the operator  for situational awareness, system control capabilities, and display of data from ISM-X\u2122 or external software entities. The Display Component  provides a means to display system status and equipment monitoring information to one or more Human Machine Interface (HMI) screens , e.g., displays for viewing by and\/or interaction with one or more human operators . HMI displays  may be located at various locations in the operating environment, e.g., a vessel or other platform , as may be necessary for operational function, redundancy, and\/or for convenience. The Display Component  will also process operator input and route the inputs to the appropriate components for further functional analysis, processing, and execution. Display Component  contains several core ISM-X\u2122 screens for interaction with ISM-\u2122 common services . Display Component  also provides the means by which operators  can view and navigate amongst custom built GUIs for monitoring, controlling and varying the levels of detail presented regarding individual subsystems.","The Management Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  provides two tiers of control: (a) upper tier Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSSs) -, and (b) lower tier Equipment Controllers -. The IDSSs - are autonomous agents that employ complex logic and decision making algorithms, expert systems, rules engines and predictive models to determine system assessments and corrective actions in response to data provided by one or more sensors and\/or manual inputs. Examples of envisioned IDSSs, e.g., in the context of a shipboard HM&E control system, are provided in the Entity Description section below.","The upper tier IDSSs - submit tasks to a Task Manager  which analyzes proposed task priority, impact, availability and compliance with established procedures and\/or doctrine. Using these criteria, tasks are de-conflicted (e.g., conflicts between different tasks are resolved and\/or tasks are reconciled, and\/or conflicts between tasks and doctrine and\/or established procedures\/limits are resolved and\/or reconciled), prioritized, and distributed to the appropriate lower tier Equipment Controller -.","The lower tier  of the Management Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  is the Equipment Controller tier . The Equipment Controllers - receive tasks from the upper tier IDSS - management functions, or from an operator  via HMI , and determine appropriate step-by-step responses (e.g., equipment commands) and send these commands to the Execution and Monitoring Component  for execution. Equipment Controllers - may be software and\/or hardware based traditional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) (e.g., using ladder logic, function blocks, or other IEC 61131 and 61499 standard programming conventions, and\/or C++ or Java).","The Execution and Monitor Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  provides an interface C with the input\/output (I\/O) equipment - associated with all sensors and actuators of the machinery (HM&E) control system. It provides data conversion services (e.g., filters data and converts data from raw signal measurements into engineering units) for current sensor values coming into the system and also distributes the automated tasks, automated commands and operator generated control signals to equipment actuators via the I\/O equipment -.","It is noted that various sensor values and alarm values represent actual physical conditions of different places and\/or different equipment and\/or different parts of an installation or vessel or other place, e.g., generally local conditions, that are transformed by the system and method described herein to provide a representation of the overall state and\/or condition of the installation, vessel or place, e.g. a representation of the complete installation, vessel and\/or place. Further, the system and method generates tasks and commands that are executed to transform the installation, vessel or place into a different configuration, i.e. into a different installation, vessel or place, and a representation of that different configuration is provided to human operators. System  described herein may include one or more general purpose and\/or special purpose computers, or microprocessors or other processors, and the method described herein may be performed in part by one or more general purpose and\/or special purpose computers, or microprocessors or other processors.","The Execution and Monitoring Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  also employs a robust controller adapter C design which allows seamless integration with a variety of field bus protocols C and which enables interfacing with multiple I\/O equipment - types in a single platform . This framework allows an ISM-X\u2122 system to utilize various types and kinds of I\/O controllers which is expected to result in long-term integration cost savings, e.g., if the system integrator desires different types of I\/O equipment - (e.g., including reusing existing equipment) for system implementation.","The Common Services Component  within the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  provides common or shared services to be utilized by any or all of the other applications on any or all of the display and processing nodes. Each component may utilize any one or more of the common service libraries which may include, e.g., services such as Time , Station Control , Security and Login , Data Logging , Event Logger , Application Health Monitor , Alarm Manager , Lifecycle Services  (system startup\/shutdown, health monitoring, and fault tolerance), Data Trending , and Communication Services . The common service libraries are described below.","Utilizing common services  components that act and\/or can act to provide functionality to some or all components results in a more efficient system design and operation and enables a greater level of system integration and distribution. Each component will utilize those common services  that are necessary and\/or useful for that component performing its function, and may not utilize other common services . For example, all software entities within an ISM-X\u2122 system  may communicate via messaging services provided by the Communications Common Services component . Each of the three other Components , ,  will use this Common Services Component , e.g., in order to communicate and\/or operate over the Local Area Network (LAN) . This enables entities to be hosted on one-to-many distributed nodes  with no modifications to the executable code.","As shown in , the ISM-X\u2122 development kit  includes tools that enable software and configuration files to be generated  automatically and deployed  on a plurality of control modules , e.g., ISM-X\u2122 control modules  through n. The configuration files define signals that are mapped to the I\/O hardware, GUIs that are linked to the signals they are to display, checklists (sometimes referred to as \u201ckill cards\u201d) that are loaded and linked to the signals, and system simulations that are linked to the signals, so that all are consistent and operative together. The control modules  on which the software is deployed can be easily distributed to various system components, and inherently tend to increase redundancy and survivability. Control module  software can be easily reconfigured by utilizing this process.","The ISM-X\u2122 system  provides a truly open, integrated, distributable, scalable, control system that is independent of the particular hardware employed (e.g., not limited to any particular hardware and\/or equipment) and is capable of monitoring, controlling, and managing a wide range of different systems and equipment.","The schematic diagram of  includes an example arrangement illustrating how the example intelligent manager system is preferably independent of particular items of hardware. HM&E equipment  of various types interface with the ISM-X\u2122 system  via plural remote distributed input\/output (I\/O) devices  that communicate with equipment and controllers via standardized communication protocols and are available from several different suppliers located in several different countries. Controllers  of the ISM-X\u2122 system  are preferably standardized devices, including, e.g., compact PCI controllers, PC  controllers, PC controllers, rack mount controllers and VME controllers, which are also available from plural sources. Human machine interfaces (HMI)  also preferably include standardized devices  that accept input data and provide output data in accordance with standardized protocols, and may include devices  such as multi-screen consoles, local operating panels, portable display units, workstations, computer displays, laptop and other portable computers and the like, which are either themselves standardized or include standardized devices.","Communication among the distributed input\/output (I\/O) devices  and HM&E equipment  utilizes one or more standardized communication protocols and so is independent of the particular I\/O device hardware. Communication may employ discrete wiring and\/or optical fibers, and may employ serial communication that adheres to a standard protocol. Communication among the plural I\/O devices  and one or more controllers  within the ISM-X\u2122 system  is preferably via one or more standardized field bus protocols  which may include e.g., Profinet, Profibus, Modbus Fairnet, and other suitable standard protocols. Communication between controllers  and HMI  is preferably via a fiber optic communication network , and that network preferably includes redundant communication paths A, B and I\/O devices, and also preferably has a suitably high data carrying capacity, e.g., typically exceeding one gigabit per second. ISM-X\u2122 system  is capable and\/or adaptable to meet the requirements of a large number of different platforms .","Development Kit :","The ISM-X\u2122 development kit  includes the system control intelligent database (SCID)  and simplified COTS software applications for GUI development , logic development , simulation development , and data historian\/trending development . Kit  allows the user to more easily develop control system applications for specific control systems through the use of a standardized development kit. The SCID  provides a means for configuration management and thorough definition of all control system signals, wherein each signal is uniquely defined in a configuration file  which includes the attributes of each signal. This configuration file can be managed, updated and reloaded into the runtime application  at any time, which typically results in significant cost savings during development and operation of the control system .","The signal attributes contained in the SCID  configuration file, e.g., a database, are typically defined by or from data that may be contained in an Interface Control Document (ICD), which ICD may be generated automatically from the signals database , thereby to reduce cost and save time, not to mention improving consistency. Such signal attributes may include all or some of the items listed in Table I below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0057"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE I"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SCID CONFIGURATION FILE SIGNAL ATTRIBUTES"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Electrical characteristics of all sensors and\/or actuators related to the"},{"entry":"signals, e.g., signal type (analog or digital), value range (e.g.,"},{"entry":"voltage, current, number of bits\/bytes), units"},{"entry":"(e.g., volts, amperes, psi) and the like."},{"entry":"Unique signal identification codes."},{"entry":"Identification of the sensor and\/or actuator power source(s)."},{"entry":"Identification of the machinery and\/or system to which the signals relate,"},{"entry":"including, e.g., installed location and system associations."},{"entry":"Identification of the vessel drawing or machinery reference document"},{"entry":"from which the ICD information is prepared or obtained."},{"entry":"Identification of the alarm and\/or warning limit and\/or other alarm criteria."},{"entry":"Identification of the RTU to which each signal is allocated."},{"entry":"Identification of the card and channel to which the signal is allocated."},{"entry":"Any interlock, interconnection, and\/or inhibition of any signal with"},{"entry":"any other signal data."},{"entry":"If a particular signal is the resultant of some function and\/or of some"},{"entry":"logic from other signals, then a brief description of such function with"},{"entry":"operating information like input data, tables, ranges, and the like."},{"entry":"Whether a signal is internally generated (e.g., by hardware and\/or "},{"entry":"software) or is a field signal."},{"entry":"Whether a particular signal is or represents a warning, an alarm, a state, "},{"entry":"an operation, a change, an input, an output, a fault, or another indication."},{"entry":"Whether a particular signal is included in or represents an automatic mode, "},{"entry":"a semi- automatic mode or a manual mode."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The SCID Development Tool  also provides the means to integrate the above mentioned COTS software applications within the runtime application  by tying them all together via a common signals configuration, e.g., the common configuration illustrated in . The Development Kit  significantly simplifies application engineering effort and allows specific platform applications of ISM-X\u2122 system  to be adapted and developed independently from the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application , and to then be integrated with the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application . With the use of this development kit , ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  may be utilized in many if not most cases with little or no modification.","Advantages Obtainable with the Present Arrangement:","Few existing solutions function across all levels of subsystem management and automation. Many solutions only work at the individual subsystem level or across a small subset of systems, but do not provide integration across all or almost all automation systems. Other solutions are seen as \u201chigh cost\u201d to deliver truly integrated plant management systems because their architectures are not truly open and their application development costs are high. Additionally, certain other solutions advertise \u201copen\u201d system design, but in actuality require significant customization and interface development with each new platform design and installation. On the other hand, the ISM-X\u2122 system  described herein can provide for monitoring, management and control of all systems utilizing a true open system design and can also provide a comprehensive development kit  therefor that provides efficiencies in the design, testing and maintenance of the control system .","An \u201copen\u201d system generally refers to a system that either has well defined interfaces so that other systems can communicate with it or that can be adapted easily to communicate with other systems. However, if an \u201copen\u201d system is required to interface with other systems that do not subscribe to the same interface standard, then the claim that the overall system is \u201copen\u201d quickly breaks down.","To avoid, or at least minimize such an unfortunate result, the ISM-X\u2122 system  isolates its interfaces into a manageable class called a data port that provides for multiple hardware and software interfaces. Thus, additional interfaces may be generated without modifying the underlying base application.","In addition, the ISM-X\u2122 system  utilizes an Operating System Abstraction that allows ISM-X\u2122 to operate (run) in any operating system by keeping the base application separated from the hardware and the drivers. In addition, none of the control logic or control signals are hard coded in the base application, thereby helping to avoid another downfall of other supposedly \u201copen\u201d systems. Because ISM-X\u2122 system  isolates the control signals and control logic from the base application, the ISM-X\u2122 system  facilitates adapting the control logic and control signals without having to modify any of the runtime (or base) application code. In general, the base application is the executable code that is operating on a target processing node for controlling processes, systems and\/or equipment, and the base application mainly includes the ISM-X\u2122 runtime  environment and may include a portion of the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit .","Only one known solution even offers a development environment, but the development kit for that solution does not contain adequate COTS development features and does not provide a common signals management tool, and so cannot provide the features provided by the ISM-X\u2122 system . On the other hand, the Development Kit  associated with the ISM-X\u2122 system  provides an SCID  within the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit  to tie all of the COTS applications together in the runtime application .","Other known systems also require highly skilled software and systems engineers to perform the system application engineering due to the significant modifications required to be made to the runtime application. On the other hand, the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit  can be used by ship builders, systems engineers, and systems designers who are more familiar with the systems and how they operate, rather than specialists with knowledge of the software code that drives the application. As a result, the individuals who will be performing the system installation on a particular platform or site can also perform the systems and applications engineering using the ISM-X\u2122 development kit , which is expected to significantly improve integration efficiency and success. Additionally, the ability for system designers to use the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit  to create a control system can tend to foster indigenous development of control systems, e.g., where highly skilled systems and software engineers may not be available.","The ISM-X\u2122 system  approach to thin interface components allows for new interfaces to be implemented with the modification of very few lines of software code while leaving the core ISM-X\u2122 application  unchanged. Once a particular interface protocol is developed, it will thereafter be available to future applications using the same interface standard, e.g., as part of an interface library or tool set. Additionally, the ISM-X\u2122 system's  use of a hardware\/operating system abstraction allows ISM-X\u2122 system  to run in virtually any computer operating system and hardware platform with minimal modification, or with no modification, to the base runtime application.","Even though the control systems for many applications, e.g., ships, aircraft and other vessels, integrate multiple sub-components, e.g., relating to damage control, auxiliary systems and power management, their conventional solutions are tied to proprietary hardware and software solutions from one or more suppliers. Furthermore, the conventional approach to I\/O signals management and usage is to hard code the signal attributes into the Software product, and so the system is inflexible, thus requiring significant cost and effort if signals change, e.g., if the system were to be upgraded or to be used for another platform. This also limits the scalability of these systems and of the other known solutions that do not implement a standard, flexible solution to signal management such as the one provided by the ISM-X\u2122 system  described herein.","A summary of the specific features within the scope of this description include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0077"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE II"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"DEVELOPMENT KIT EXAMPLE TOOLS"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"System Control Intelligent Database (SCID) 310."]},{"entry":[{},"Automated Checklist Manager 320."]},{"entry":[{},"Logic Development Tool 340."]},{"entry":[{},"Graphics Development Tool 330."]},{"entry":[{},"System Simulation Development Tool 350."]},{"entry":[{},"Data Historian\/Trending Development Tool 360."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The Development Tool Kit  provides a simplified integrated development environment for the creation of Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) , control logic, system simulations and models, and data trending and historian applications. Because configuration data from the common SCID  is utilized by all parts of the Development Tool Kit , the entire system  is kept synchronized and consistent throughout its development. Detailed descriptions of these tools are provided in the section below relating to the Development Environment.","Intelligent System Manager (Ism-X\u2122) Component Functional Architecture:","The ISM-X\u2122 system  employs a component based functional architecture comprising four main components, including a Display Component , a Management Component , an Execution & Monitor Component , and a Common Services Component (CS) , all as shown in , which also shows ISM-X\u2122 interfaces with example vessel  systems, such as HMI , bridge , C2 (Command & Control) , navigation , exterior communications , and with example equipment , such as NAV sensors , mission modules , auxiliary equipment , propulsion equipment , electrical equipment  and damage control equipment .","ISM-X\u2122 Entity Descriptions:","Common Services Component ","The Common Services (CS) Component  provides an array or suite of services that any ISM-X\u2122 application can utilize rather than developing an application-specific function to accomplish the same goal. These services provide core system management services and infrastructure that allow all nodes within the ISM-X\u2122 system  to operate together, and are typically located on all display and processing nodes of the system. Thus, these services are common to all components of the ISM-X\u2122 system . The use of a common services component embodies open architecture principles and facilitates increased software efficiency, higher degrees of integration, flexibility and scalability of distributed nodes.\n\n","It is noted that many of the Common Services Component entities may be optional and\/or may include optional features, that reflect the environment in which the ISM-X\u2122 system  may be applied. For example, the Security and Login Manager  might be substantially simplified for an ISM-X\u2122 system  employed in a commercial application as compared to that for a military application. Similarly, Cross Domain Solution  may be omitted for a commercial application where there are no classified information domains. Other common services that may be optional in certain settings include IT Resource Manager  and Data Trender . Common services -, and some others, may be referred to as enhanced services, and may or may not be included in many applications, particularly applications on less complex and\/or less expensive platforms.","Display Component ","The Display Component  includes ISM-X\u2122 display software that provides a GUI to display to operator  via HMI  data and information for enabling situational awareness and control authority over automation system , including the HM&E equipment  and installed IDSSs - thereof. The display software provides substantially continuous system status and equipment monitoring information to one or more HMI display screens . HMI  may include displays of various types and kinds, including one or more display screens  or multi-screen consoles . Operator  inputs and commands are routed to the appropriate ISM-X\u2122 system  elements for analysis, processing, and distribution to equipment  controllers and equipment  actuators, e.g., for manual tasks and for automated tasks. Operators  may provide inputs for reconfiguring HM&E system  and\/or various equipment and components via the HMI interface . IDSSs - are also displayed on some or all HMI displays  via an interactive GUI that allows operators  to interact with the IDSSs .","ISM-X\u2122 display software preferably resides on each display device  in ISM-X\u2122 system . Preferably, each display device  is capable of monitoring all systems and is capable of controlling all equipment, subject to the parameters and limitations defined by applicable station control doctrine and procedures and by applicable user  privileges, e.g., as may be defined by a security manager and\/or a log-on manager. This modular arrangement allows each display device  to include one or more display screens, thereby to provide enhanced operator awareness, and flexibility in configuring the HMI  of any system .","Execution and Monitoring Component ","The Execution and Monitoring component  serves as a bridge or connection between the external I\/O signals and the internal ISM-X\u2122 system  control logic, algorithms and displays, thereby providing the services that allow the ISM-X\u2122 system  software to interface with the equipment  being monitored, managed and under its control. Commands that are sent from an HMI display  by an operator  or that are triggered or initiated from the control logic are communicated to the Execution and Monitoring  function which routes them to the appropriate I\/O module , converted to the specific interface protocol for the system\/equipment being commanded, and communicated to the appropriate actuators and\/or equipment.\n\n","Execution and Monitoring function  is separate from the rest of the ISM-X\u2122 runtime  software thereby to encapsulate the external interfaces so that the ISM-X\u2122 system  can readily accommodate plural field bus protocols with little or no modification to its software. The software provides bi-directional translation and\/or transformation to and from any supported field bus protocol and internal format utilized within ISM-X\u2122 system . This arrangement enables ISM-X\u2122 system  to interface with multiple types and kinds of I\/O equipment and field bus protocols in a single control system  without changing the underlying control logic thereof. Configuration data stored in SCID  is utilized to provide data conversion sensors and\/or signals being added to ISM-X\u2122 system . As a result, long term maintenance and updating costs are expected to be reduced as different types of I\/O equipment are replaced and\/or added over the life of the ISM-X\u2122 system .","Management Component ","The Management Component  consists of two types of entities, Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSSs)  and Equipment Controllers . This component provides automated monitoring and control capabilities, including remote control, to reduce the cognitive load on the crew and to reduce the tasks assigned to the crew through the use of advanced software techniques such as data fusion, predictive modeling, and the like.","Equipment controllers execute the high level control requests and commands from operator  by implementing particular equipment to perform specific actions and sequences. By way of example, an operator request or command to transfer fuel from one tank to another tank is translated by the management component  into commands to open and close valves, to activate and deactivate pumps, and to monitor levels in the affected tanks, which are communicated to that equipment via the execution and monitoring component .","The IDSS applications utilize the common services  and signal values from sensors communicated via the execution and monitoring component  to determine whether autonomous action or operator action is required and whether or an indication is displayed to the operator. These actions are expected to reduce stress on operators, crew and staff, to provide a level of autonomy within control system , and to provide services in support of decision making to the operator .","Because the ISM-X\u2122 system  has this open and flexible architecture, IDSSs can be added to the ISM-X\u2122 system  configuration or existing IDSSs can be upgraded and\/or modified, over the life of the ship or other vessel to increase the level of automation and decision support, e.g., as new technologies become available. Among the benefits can be to reduce operating personnel, increase performance, and reduce the total cost of ownership.","In Management Component , the Intelligent Decision Support Systems (IDSS) tier A includes a variety of applications that can be provided and\/or installed in a modular fashion to facilitate supervisory control and intelligent decision making. IDSSs support reduced crew and staff requirements, as well as the potential for future advancements in Artificial Neural Networks and the like. As described below, some IDSSs can communicate with one another to provide integrated awareness and intelligent control of ISM-X\u2122 system , and may communicate with external interfaces. Some examples of IDSSs are now described, e.g., in the example context of a shipboard application.\n\n","In Management Component , System\/Equipment Control & Status tier  includes several libraries of control logic which can be applied to generate discrete equipment control commands. For example, the Stability and Load Management IDSS  could send a task to the Auxiliary controller  which breaks the task down into discrete commands, and various sensors could then be monitored to determine if and when the desired operation is completed. For example, a stability restoration task may typically be broken down into discrete valve alignment and pump commands to pump liquid out of a tank, e.g., pump water out of a ballast tank. The liquid level in the tank would then be monitored by checking a tank level sensor to determine if and when the desired amount of liquid had been pumped out of the tank. This entity  could reside in either a traditional \u201chard PLC\u201d or a software-based \u201csoft PLC\u201d. Logic libraries could include C++ logic statements, XML strings, Ladder Logic, or Functional Block Diagrams related to Ride Control , Electrical , Propulsion , Auxiliary , Damage Control , and the like.","ISM-X\u2122 External Interfaces:","External interfaces are outside the ISM-X\u2122 system  boundary and are illustrated, e.g., in . While these items are generally outside the scope of a potential ISM-X\u2122 platform implementation, they would usually be provided by the system designer or the system integrator, e.g., a shipyard or a subcontractor. External systems - are capable of communicating with ISM-X\u2122 system  if they are provided in a form and format that is compatible with the defined external communication protocols of the ISM-X\u2122 system .","In a ship-board HM&E  application, ISM-X\u2122 system  may interface with any or all of the example items listed in Table III below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0126"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE III"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Equipment including, but not limited to: auxiliary equipment, propulsion "},{"entry":"equipment, electrical equipment, damage control equipment, valves, "},{"entry":"pumps, motor controllers, temperature sensors, pressure transducers,"},{"entry":"liquid sensors, tank level indicators, strainers, dumpers,"},{"entry":"sprinklers, fire sensors, smoke sensors, chemical sensors, motion"},{"entry":"sensors, tilt sensors, audio and other acoustic sensors,"},{"entry":"imagers and other video sensors, and the like."},{"entry":"Mission Modules."},{"entry":"Bridge (generally integrated with the bridge system) 910."},{"entry":"Command & Control 920."},{"entry":"Navigation System 930 and\/or Navigation Equipment (generally"},{"entry":"integrated with the navigation system) 930."},{"entry":"Exterior (or external) Communications 940."},{"entry":"Interior (or internal) Communications 950."},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"ISM-X\u2122 Integrated Development and Runtime Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["300","200","100","310","300","330","360","200","310"]},"SCID  of ISM-X\u2122 system  includes various export functions.

To support rapid, efficient and cost effective development of platform specific applications, a suite of development tools in an integrated development environment called the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit  is provided. This Development Kit  is well suited to support development activities for varied platforms that require full integration of complex systems, such as those found on modern front line naval ships, commercial and other ships, military, commercial and other aircraft, offshore oil rigs, other vessels, factory automation, industrial automation, and other integrated production systems, whether fixed or mobile, and the like. Likewise, the ISM-X\u2122 system  may be utilized for and\/or on any or all of such platforms and systems.","This section describes the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit  which provides designers and engineers with a tool kit or tool suite that includes: a signals list development tool SCID , an automated checklist development tool , a graphics and\/or GUI and\/or HMI development tool , a logic development tool , a system simulation development tool , and a data historian and trending development tool , all of which are shown with the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application  in . A summary of each development tool of the tool suite is provided in the following sections. A development tool may also be referred to as a \u201cbuilder.\u201d","Development Kit  is expected to enable the designers\/engineers to complete design activities in a more efficient manner, thereby enabling the design process to be more cost effective and thus more competitive in future development and business acquisition. This can allow designers\/engineers of relatively lesser skill and experience to be involved as developers for system level platform-specific application development. Additionally, development kit  could be licensed to engineering, government and other entities to enable them to develop platform-specific applications, upgrades and\/or maintenance. This option allows the ISM-X\u2122 system  to be employed for programs that require indigenous platform-specific application software development.","ISM-V\u2033 Development Kit  Tools:","The ISM-X\u2122 development kit  provides a relatively simple to use suite of tools for generating human machine interfaces (HMI) , control logic, automated checklists, system simulations and\/or models and data historian\/trending applications. Each of these features is described in more detail below. It is noted that the term \u201ctool\u201d as used herein may refer to one tool or to more than one tool, e.g., plural tools.","System Control Intelligent Database (SCID) :","The ISM-X\u2122 Signals Management Tool is the System Control Intelligent Database (SCID) , a web-based application that is used to develop and manage all signals and signal attributes within complex control systems. Preferably, the SCID database  is organized in a three tiered structure, such as the example illustrated in .","A configuration is created for each project, i.e. for the overall platform configuration  at its highest level. A project  is divided into multiple systems  and any or all of those systems  are divided into plural or multiple subsystems . Within each of the various subsystems , device tags  are developed for elements, components and signals, as may be required, and may be further subdivided into one or more property groups .","For example, in the case of an Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), the IPMS would be considered a configuration . The IPMS  is broken down into multiple subsystems  which may include an Auxiliary Control System (ACS), a Damage Control System (DCS), an Integrated Machinery Control System (IMCS) and an Automated Power Management System (APMS). The ACS, for example, comprised a number of elements  including, e.g., a fresh water system element and a bilge system element. Both the fresh water system element and the bilge system element have various components , e.g., pumps, valves and level sensors, and these components have various signals associated with them (e.g., on, off, standby, level, etc). Where the platform is, e.g., a ship, the IPMS may be referred to as a shipboard machinery system (MCS).","All of the information related to each signal for each element  and component  thereof is defined and managed via standardized database attributes.

Based on this information the SCID tool  automatically generates a unique tag ID for each signal utilizing a standardized format.  shows an example \u201cscreen shot\u201d  or snapshot of information from the SCID web-based database  illustrating an example of a notional database entry for an example analog monitoring signal. In screen display , the equipment identification is displayed in the top horizontal bar near the top of the screen , types of general information relating thereto is displayed in a column at the left and the value and\/or state thereof is displayed to the right of the respective general entry generally in the middle area of screen , and the location and\/or connection information is similarly displayed in left and right columns near the bottom of screen .","When all signal information is defined and recorded, including RTU allocation, the SCID tool  is able to export the list of signal tags to be compiled into the ISM-X\u2122 run-time  software application. The signals list is automatically read into the ISM-X\u2122 runtime  software thus eliminating the possibility of human error that often occurs when transferring or hard coding signals into executable code as is common practice with other systems. Additionally, the same signals list created within the SCID tool  is exported for use within the Automated Checklist Manager Development Tool, Logic Development Tool, GUI Development Tool, Simulation Development Tool, and Data Historian\/Trending Development Tool, thus ensuring consistency and accuracy of signal definitions across all control system functions.","The SCID tool  coupled with the run-time configuration file for the control system  enables significant efficiencies during development and maintenance throughout the entire product life cycle, thereby reducing cost. Using the ISM-X\u2122 Development Kit , a signals list can be quickly configured and then utilized for control logic development, and may thereafter be updated throughout the operational life of the control system , e.g., as sensors, actuators and other components are added and\/or replaced, whether with the identical or a different component. Accordingly, when new equipment is to be introduced, SCID  is updated to reflect the new equipment and its characteristics, and development tools - then automatically update from the revised data in SCID  to provide an updated runtime application  for utilizing the new equipment in the platform manager system. An example of this deployment is described below.","Thus, SCID  enables significant cost reductions to be realized during the entire product life cycle, as well as during migration of systems and elements to new and\/or different platforms. The use of a common signals list allows remote monitoring software (e.g., front-end and back-end) to be developed using the same signal structure, thus resulting in efficiencies and cost benefits. Front end and back end are typically used to refer to the user interface, e.g., HMI, GUI, and the base application (e.g., mainly the runtime environment ), respectively.","Because the SCID database  when completed for a platform contains most of the information that is required to configure the platform, and the systems, elements and components thereof, it contains most of the information required within a standard Interface Control Document (ICD) and similar documentation and specifications, and so an automatic documentation generation utility may be employed in conjunction with the SCID  to substantially reduce the time and cost required to generate such Interface Control Documents (ICDs) and other documents.","HMI-Graphics Development Tool :","The HMI or Graphics or GUI Development Tool  uses the SCID tool  to define HMI specific attributes for each control and monitoring signal and then to export a pre-configured file of such signals and attributes that can be read into a COTS HMI application, e.g., to produce a desired display thereon.","The HMI Development Tool  will allow application engineers to create a complete set of display screens specific to a particular platform using a simplified COTS HMI software package and then to link those display screens to the ISM-X\u2122 runtime  application through the SCID  generated signals configuration file to provide a representation of the system and\/or of any part thereof. For example: Platform unique piping and wiring diagrams can be overlaid within and\/or on the system and\/or compartment arrangements and layouts. Damage control symbols and equipment and system mimics, e.g., systems layout diagrams and\/or schematic diagrams, can be created and placed within the displays of the relevant compartments. The graphical representations of controllable equipment would then be linked to the appropriate signals within SCID  and a detail\/zoom level display can be defined for each graphic. Once the graphical layout is complete, the graphics files may be compiled into the ISM-X\u2122 runtime software environment . As a result, an operator\/user  is provided displays that are representative of the physical configuration of the platform  and that reflect the status of the systems, subsystems and equipment thereof as well as the status of any or all of such systems, subsystems and equipment, and\/or displays that are representative of the systems, subsystems and equipment thereof as well as the status of any or all of those systems, subsystems and equipment.","Control Logic Development Tool :","The ISM-X\u2122 Control Logic Development Tool  utilizes commercially available COTS software tools to generate and manage executable control logic functions. This Control Logic Development Tool  allows for control logic development and debugging, and provides resource and network configuration utilities. Control logic can be developed using language editors within the tool for C, Flow Charts and IEC-61131 and 61499 standards, which may include various formats such as ladder logic, structured text, functional block diagrams, and sequential function charts. An example COTS software tool might include, e.g., the ISaGRAF tool available from ICS Triplex or the STEP7 tool available from Siemens.","Pre-configured and formatted Auxiliary, Propulsion, Damage Control, Power, and other control and monitoring signals, are exported from the SCID tool  and imported into the data repository of Control Logic Development Tool . Signals are then associated with the appropriate ladder logic rungs and contacts or function blocks. Individual logic routines can be compiled and debugged prior to downloading to the targeted resource. Once debugged, signals are allocated to the proper I\/O points and then the control logic programs are compiled into the ISM-X\u2122 runtime software  and deployed on the target resource.","Automated Checklist Manager :","An extension of SCID  may be employed as the Automated Checklist Manager . SCID tool  is capable of being extended to provide a means for the control system engineer to build automated checklists unique to a particular platform . Automated checklists  preferably include all or selected equipment associated with a particular compartment and\/or system that would need to be stopped, closed, tripped, disabled or shut off, and all procedures associated with the particular equipment, compartment and\/or system that would need to be executed, in order to respond to a hazard or event as may be appropriate and\/or required in a given situation. An example of such response may include, e.g., isolating a compartment and\/or system both mechanically and electrically in response to a hazard or event that should be contained within such compartment and\/or system and\/or area.","Automated checklists may also include other information relating to a compartment or system, such as which, if any, flammable, explosive, toxic, poisonous, or other hazardous material might be associated therewith and\/or present therein. When fully populated with information for a specific platform and configuration, the SCID tool  preferably contains information relating to all equipment on board the vessel or other platform that is capable of being monitored and controlled by the ISM-X\u2122 control system .","Typically, however, automated response checklists require more information than just the identity and characteristics of the sensors and actuators and other equipment being monitored and\/or controlled in a given compartment and\/or system. Such additional information may include, e.g., the locations of firefighting and other emergency equipment, the locations of medical equipment and\/or facilities, the locations where hazardous materials are stored and\/or used, the locations where hazardous or dangerous processes are or may be performed, communication means available at specific locations, and response procedures (e.g., de-smoking, de-watering, and\/or isolation procedures) for the specific compartment and\/or system and preferably for its neighboring, nearby and\/or related compartments and\/or systems.","Optionally, the information accumulated in the SCID tool database  may be sorted, modified and\/or expanded to include system and\/or compartment specific equipment and data items in addition to the existing HM&E equipment  already defined for the platform . During system development, e.g., the control system engineer, battle damage control system engineer, or other system engineer, can easily generate automated checklists for each compartment and\/or system. Control signals for equipment and\/or other items capable of being remotely controlled can be automatically linked to the corresponding item on the checklist via linkage with the SCID  control signal list. Checklists may include data that is stored in the SOD  that is sorted by compartment and\/or system, rather than by another sorting criteria, so as to be in a form useful for isolating a particular compartment and\/or system if and when that action may become necessary or may be desired.","SCID  exports the automated response checklists and compiles them into the ISM-X\u2122 runtime environment . During operation, these checklists are dynamically available on the operator HMI consoles and displays  to help the operator  successfully and timely implement and complete the actions as defined by the checklists. Checklist actions that relate to the remote control of equipment preferably can be controlled by the operator  through the use of \u201chot buttons\u201d on the HMI  that operate via the link that was established between the checklist and the control logic signals prior to compilation.","Simulation Development Tool :","The ISM-X\u2122 Simulation Development Tool  provides a means for scripting system test and training scenarios for HM&E system  models preferably developed using COTS software. An example development tool  includes the COTS Mat Lab\/Simulink modeling software package which is utilized to model HM&E systems  behaviors while the scripting capability allows testers and\/or instructors to inject simulation data to be run through the HM&E equipment models to simulate operational situations and environments. Testers may utilize the scripting capability to ensure that the control logic of IDSSs , - respond properly. Instructors may utilize this to test students and\/or to train personnel for taking proper action when responding to test and\/or training scenarios. A block diagram illustrating and summarizing how the ISM-X\u2122 simulator may be employed is provided in .","The simulation\/training tools , e.g., incorporating system models generated by COTS Mat Lab\/Simulink software, includes one or more system models  and scripting capability  that may communicate with ISM-X\u2122 system  via a training interface  developed, e.g., in Java or in C++, with configurations set up using the SCID tool . ISM-X\u2122 system  provides: (1) an operational instance  that operates with the HMI\/display  and I\/O equipment C for actually controlling system , and (2) a simulation and training instance  that mimics operation of system  and provides displays imported from the scripts and system models of simulated conditions of system  on HMI\/display , but is not coupled to I\/O C or any other actual operating equipment.","During simulation and\/or test, the training tools  may communicate with a simulation instance  of ISM-X\u2122. While operational, a separate training instance  of ISM-X\u2122 can be \u201cinstantiated\u201d to facilitate training, e.g., plural copies of the same software may be run simultaneously on the same computer resources, e.g., one for operating the control system  and another for operator training. In the arrangement, the training tools  can communicate via the training interface  using the system models as the sensor inputs rather than using the actual I\/O device signals. Simultaneously the operational instance  of ISM-X\u2122 would be running, so the actual system  controls would also be functioning. Both training and operational modes of the ISM-X\u2122 system  may be running at the same time and may be accessible from any or all system HMIs .","Data Historian\/Trending Development Tool :","ISM-X\u2122 Data Historian\/Trending Development Tool  preferably includes an Oculus data historian and trending system that is available from Lockheed Martin Corporation located in Baltimore, Md. The Oculus tool provides a means for data logging, for archiving and for determining trending of sensor data and other data over time. This tool  provides a mechanism to develop trending data, screens and data monitoring screens that operators and\/or system  can utilize, e.g., to analyze equipment health to determine if maintenance activities are required.","Additionally, the Oculus system provides external communications, e.g., a means to transmit data off-board the vessel, so equipment can be monitored remotely, e.g., from one or more remotely located command centers. The Oculus system provides a means to build operator screens for display via ship console, e.g., HMI , or remotely via web browser, for current status and trend monitoring. The SCID Tool  will be used to export a pre-configured, formatted signal file that can be read into the Oculus system to significantly improve development efficiency and the linking of Oculus tags to standard common signals.","Activity Diagrams:","Operation of the ISM-X\u2122 system  is described in terms of a series or sets of activity diagrams, such as those included in , A-J and A-B. Each figure, e.g., , , and so forth, comprises a schematic flow chart activity diagram of a process that is performed by the ISM-X\u2122 system . The following notation is employed in each of these activity diagrams:","In each activity diagram, the flow is entered at a blackened circle (\u201c\u2022\u201d) with an arrow exiting therefrom (in some instances also having a shaded text box) generally located near the top of the activity diagram, and the flow is exited at one or more target symbols (\u201c\u2299\u201d), generally but not necessarily located near the bottom of the activity diagram. The term \u201cXYZ System\u201d is generally used to refer to an arbitrary example system that is configured in and is operating in the ISM-X\u2122 runtime application . Each of the headings across the top of the activity diagrams relates to the respective \u201ccolumn\u201d it heads and identifies the ISM-X\u2122 component and\/or the system or entity external to the ISM-X\u2122 system  on which the operations illustrated in that \u201ccolumn\u201d are performed; however, it is noted that \u201ccolumns\u201d may not be uniform in size or in width as is generally the case in a table. Because only the components and systems in which an operation is performed are shown in any activity diagram, the number of columns and the position of any particular column will differ from diagram to diagram.","In addition, certain ones of the activity diagrams contain one or more sets of ovals each encircling an alphabetic character, wherein one or more ovals of each set has an arrow pointing towards it and the other oval or ovals of the set has\/have an arrow pointing away to indicate a signal or data or process flow path from oval to oval.

This deconfliction process  ensures that the new task request adheres to the current mission plan and that its execution is feasible given the current equipment\/system status. If a conflict exists, the entity requesting the tasking (tasking entity) is informed with an infeasible (Not Feasible) task response. That entity may choose to re-evaluate and re-submit a similar or alternate task to attempt to achieve its original goal. If the task has no conflicts the task manager  will evaluate the task received to determine if operator approval is required before the task can be executed. Operator approval is not likely required for tasking generated by an operator , however, operator  approval may be required and\/or desired when the task originated from an IDSS -. This will allow for a \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d in the decision\/task execution process if required by the platform.","If the Task Manager  determines that operator  acknowledgment is required, the Task Manager  will publish this requirement to the Display component  and wait for a response from the operator . If the request is denied by the operator  the Task Manager  will publish the request denied notification back to the tasking entity (e.g., IDSS -, Bridge  or C2 ). If the tasking is approved, or the task did not require operator approval, the task is added to a Queue for execution. The tasks currently being processed, which are stored in this Queue while awaiting execution, are displayed to the operator  via HMI . Tasks are distributed to the appropriate destination by the Task Manager  for execution.","At a high level, there are two types of tasks. The first is a Manual task, which would be displayed to the operator  on the HMI  and executed by a system operator . The second type of tasks are remote equipment tasks which are distributed by the Task Manager  to the appropriate equipment controller , e.g. in the context of a ship application Ride Control , Electrical , Propulsion , Auxiliary , Damage Control , etc. Equipment controllers  distribute the commands to the equipment - and provide progress via task execution responses. These responses or statuses are published to the display  and tasking entities. Should a task complete, it is removed from the queue and the display  is updated accordingly.","Once tasks have been entered in the Queue, the Operator  will have an opportunity to cancel and\/or stop any or all of the tasks that are currently in the queue awaiting execution. This functionality is available as soon as a task (an equipment or manual task) is entered in the queue, and is further described in the Figures following.","Specifically, the deconfliction process  of  starts as tasking is received  by task manager , e.g., by submission  of a task request from an external actor -, by submission  of a new task request or submission  of a replacement task from an IDSS -, or by submission  of a task request from an operator  using the processing  of display component . Usually, but not necessarily, tasking submitted by external actor - or by an operator are submitted in response to an event and so may be called \u201cevent driven.\u201d Tasking submitted by an IDSS - are based upon analysis of the current sensor data and alarm values by the IDSS given its decision making capabilities.
