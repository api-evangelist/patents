title: Loan portfolio management tool
abstract: A loan portfolio manager system is provided to predict and prioritize loans at risk of default and foreclosure. The loan portfolio manager system may analyze the loans at risk to determine which of the loans are at risk and also candidates for modification. The loan portfolio manager system may generate recommended modification solutions for those at risk loans by applying configurable criteria and data analytics. The loan portfolio manager system may monitor and report on the health of loan portfolios, borrowers, and on success of loan modifications. The loan portfolio manager system may facilitate loan modification business process outsourcing through campaign management and buyer contact/interaction capabilities.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/256,733, entitled \u201cLOAN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TOOL,\u201d filed Oct. 30, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to a system and method to avoid loan defaults and foreclosures. In particular, this disclosure relates to a system and method to forecast and prioritize loans that are at risk of default and\/or foreclosure, develop and execute loss mitigation campaigns using distributed resources, and provide recommendations to borrowers to transform at risk loans into performing loans.","2. Background Information","Currently, the mortgage industry faces unprecedented challenges in an effort to address a historically high number of loan defaults and foreclosures. Currently the mortgage industry reports that many borrowers are in foreclosure proceedings and the borrowers have had no contact with their servicer. A sampling of current mortgage industry loan portfolios suggests that few of the borrowers have workout plans in progress. Programs were designed to keep many troubled homeowners in their homes, but typically few applications are received and the applications received failed to meet the programs guidelines and therefore were rejected. Millions of homeowners could end up defaulting on their mortgages in the near future. The pace of loan modifications is slow. Loan modifications may occur for a small percentage of seriously delinquent loans each month.","Mortgage default estimates are considerable in an economic climate of high and growing rates of default and foreclosure. Foreclosure cost estimates under such economic conditions are great. Many families typically lose their homes during such economic conditions. Recidivism rates for loan defaults and foreclosures rise. Regulatory mandates may be expected to force lenders and loan servicers to modify performing loans in order to assist borrowers under such economic conditions.","Bank and loan servicer financial impacts due to poorly serviced loans include: 1) Rise in mortgage default rate with many of the defaulting loans going to foreclosure, resulting in a unprecedented foreclosure rate across the industry; 2) expected re-default rate, in such economic climate, on modified mortgages (using existing processes and tools) has been more than a third of the defaults re-defaulting; and 3) the cost of a foreclosure to the bank, loan servicer and investor yield foreclosure related costs across the industry. Borrower and other consumers impacts due to poorly serviced loans include: 1) higher defaults on other accounts (e.g., credit cards, auto loans); and 2) loss of home equity through foreclosures and short sales.","Therefore, a need exists to address the problems noted above and other problems previously experienced.","In one aspect, a Loan Portfolio Management system may: (1) predict and prioritize loans at risk of default and foreclosure that are candidates for loan modification; (2) recommend modification solutions for those at risk of default by applying configurable criteria and\/or through the use of data analytics; (3) monitor and report on portfolio and borrower level \u201chealth\u201d including success of applied loan modifications. In a second aspect, the Loan Portfolio Management system may facilitate loan modification BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) through campaign management and buyer contact\/interaction capabilities.","The Loan Portfolio Management system may: (1) receive current borrower and macro economic data against a loan servicer portfolio; (2) identify and prioritize borrower candidates for loan modification to prevent loan default and\/or foreclosure; (3) recommend a set of one to many modification solutions that minimize the modification cost to the servicer and maximize the probability of keeping the borrower out of foreclosure; and (3) monitor, manage and report on the portfolio risk profile through a series of executive dashboards on a daily basis.","The Loan Portfolio Management system may facilitate loan modification business process outsourcing (BPO) by providing skills and capacity to assist servicers in executing loan modifications. The servicer may include an optional borrower contact capability.","One misconception is that restructuring loans violates the contractual rights of investors. Streamlined restructuring is a strategy that may be pursued voluntarily by servicers in the interest of investors under existing PSA agreements (Pooling and Servicing Agreements). PSA agreements describe how pooled commercial loans will be serviced and dictate how proceeds and losses will be distributed to bondholders (investors). The significant deterioration seen in mortgage credit performance and the housing market indicates that the restructuring strategy may be a means to maximize the total net present value of securitized subprime mortgages. Given that maximizing the total net present value is the legal mandate of servicers, servicers have begun to embrace the restructuring strategy more often as conditions have worsened. As long as restructuring is chosen voluntarily by servicers under the servicers' existing PSAs, and as long as the servicers can demonstrate that the servicers' strategies are to maximize the proceeds of the pool, restructuring the loans in the portfolio probably does not represent a violation of the investors' contractual rights.","Accordingly, the Loan Portfolio Management system may address (1) the lack of current borrower data, (2) the lack of sophisticated data analytics, (3) the lack of comprehensive and daily portfolio management capability, (4) the limited borrow contact capability, and (5) limited skills and resource capacity. For example the systems may retrieve current data, apply sophisticated analytics, organize and report on data, provide \u201cwhat if analysis\u201d, learn over time to enhance default predictability, and apply capacity, industrialization, process maturity. Thus, the systems may significantly reduce default and foreclosure rates and costs benefiting servicers, borrowers, and the country.","The systems may benefit the servicer\/investor by reducing servicer default rates and costs through intelligent modifications (i.e., reduced foreclosure costs and reduced modification costs). The systems may facilitate more focused loss mitigation campaigns prior to making borrower contact. The systems may further provide a \u201crelief-valve\u201d for resources to address the mounting loan modification backlog.","Millions of families may remain in their homes and have affordable mortgages. Homeowners may maintain current credit scores as loan modifications do not result in an adverse credit profile notification. In one example, the system may provide workout options for all of a borrower's debt obligations and not just the borrower's mortgage. Faster resolution of default situation may result in a higher probability of a \u201cone-time fix\u201d.","A tool may collect data into a lending data warehouse. The data may include (1) fresh borrower data, such as income; (2) loan system data and investor terms; (3) macroeconomic data; and (4) property valuation data. An analytics engine may analyze the data in the lending data warehouse to prepare a prioritized list of loans based on default probability. The analytics engine may further recommended remediation strategy based on determined goals such as default probability avoidance, servicer costs, investor impacts and net present value (NPV) analysis.","The Loan Portfolio Management (LPM) system may adjust the effect of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes. When regulatory changes occur, the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio may change. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.","Benefits to banks and servicers may include, for example: (1) 3-4% reduction in an overall expected default rate across the industry through better insights and optimal modification offers\u2014causing a resultant 1-2% reduction in the 5% foreclosure rate; and (2) industry-wide, this represents a potential foreclosure cost savings of \u02dc$30-50 B (\u02dc$13-$22 B when looking at strictly operational costs).","Reducing foreclosures will help stabilize falling home prices because \u201csame street\u201d foreclosures immediately drive property values down by about 1-5%. Stabilizing falling home prices may benefit the national economy.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the claimed subject matter, and are protected by the following claims.","Many loan servicers and mortgage backed securities investors lack the data, analytics, portfolio management and reporting capabilities necessary to adequately forecast loan defaults and foreclosures. Loan servicers and investors also lack the tools and expertise necessary to design and\/or identify loan remediation recommendations intended to avoid defaults and foreclosures. Additionally, many loan servicers and investors also lack the tools and expertise necessary to minimize costs to the loan servicers in servicing loans.","Current systems fail to analyze macro-economic conditions and data such as upward pricing of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages, rising rate of unemployment and underemployment, ongoing decreases in property values in order to properly analyze normalized borrowers and loan portfolios. Current systems also fail to analyze borrowers and loan portfolios by adjusting for the spread between agency bonds and treasury bonds, which may indicate that fewer refinancing options are available, and prioritize remediation recommendations accordingly.","In particular, current industry systems' limitations include the following: (1) LTV (loan-to-value) is being misrepresented in portfolio analytics as changes in collateral data are not readily available; (2) changes in borrower's income and employment status are unknown or not reported in timely manner to loan servicers which is preventing many at-risk loans from being flagged for scrutiny; (3) no automated and cohesive way exists to promptly report analysis and receive updates of various data regarding the borrowers' profiles and loan data for each loan of a group of loan portfolios; (4) limited forward thinking analytics; and (5) limited ability to analyze loans and provide modification offers on an industrialized scale.","Current industry systems rely on stale borrower data. Loan servicers rely on stale income, employment and asset information which is rarely or never refreshed after being collected. Credit bureau data, for example, is often only refreshed quarterly. Current industry systems lack current real-time property data. Loan servicers often use stale and\/or inaccurate property valuations particularly given the rapid change in values and differences by geography.","Current industry systems lack necessary analytics. Current systems have limited risk models. Current predictive models are focused on assessing risk based on past performance and are not being used to analyze high risk performing loans. Current systems have limited NPV modeling and many lack the capability to calculate with accuracy the minimum amount of modification and cost required to keep the borrower out of default and\/or foreclosure.","Current systems lack necessary reporting and monitoring for borrower profile updates and loan portfolio updates. Current systems have limited portfolio management and reporting capabilities and many lack a centralized data warehouse and \u201cdashboard\u201d management tool to sufficiently house, analyze, report, and track portfolio credit conditions. Current systems provide little automation in dashboard creation and existing dashboards are created using significant man power and thereby dashboard updates are available only on a less than real-time basis.","Current systems lack the capability to interact with people and implement processes to address limited borrower contact. Many loan servicers are unsuccessful in reaching borrowers to validate borrower data and process loan modifications. Loan servicers often have limited skills and staff to handle loan modification volume beyond a particular threshold number of loans. Loan servicers' threshold values may not accommodate a constant large volume of loan modifications, defaults and foreclosures. Loan servicers are often understaffed and under-skilled to handle an accelerating volume of defaults, modifications and foreclosures. Current systems provide no tools to focus on performing loans. Because of a lack of tools to perform the proper analysis, loan servicers have become conditioned to accept a general reluctance to review and take action on the \u201cperforming\u201d component of the loan servicers' portfolios in order to monitor performing loans so that recommended proactive remediation measures may be taken as a result of analyzing borrower profile and loan portfolio updates.","The loan portfolio management (LPM) system includes a processor, and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory includes instructions that when executed by the processor may cause the processor to retrieve, into the memory, borrower data, macro economic data and loan servicer portfolio data for a loan servicer, wherein the loan servicer portfolio comprises data for loans to borrowers that the loan servicer services. The instructions may further cause the processor to analyze, using the loan servicer portfolio data and the macro economic data, the loans and the borrower data to prioritize the borrowers and the loans according to configurable risk threshold values and identify at risk loans. In one implementation, when one of the loans is determined to be an at risk loan, the instructions identify a contact management campaign for the borrower, recommend a remediation solution for the at risk loan according to the contact management campaign, monitor updates to the borrower data to determine whether the updated borrower data exceeds the configurable risk threshold values, and execute the remediation solution. The loan portfolio management system may further include a graphical user interface configured to display a loan servicer portfolio management interface. The loan servicer portfolio management interface may be configured to display the loan servicer portfolio, receive user input and display the remediation solution.","The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to store the borrower data, macro economic data and loan servicer portfolio data in a data repository. The macro economic data may include pricing of mortgages, rate of unemployment, rate of underemployment, property values, and spreads between agency bonds and U.S. treasury bonds. Agency bonds may include bonds issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies.","The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to adjust the effects of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes by scaling borrowers using a borrower loan portfolio management index in order to filter the effects that cause statistical changes to the borrowers' profiles over time. Changes that occur over time may include, for example, regulatory changes, individual borrower profiles, borrower regulatory profiles, economic impact to the loan servicers and investors. When changes occur over time, the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio change. The more variability in the profiles of borrowers, the more difficult the task of comparing borrowers in order to calculate better forecasts. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.","Alternatively or in addition, a loan remediation entity may use the LPM system to carry out, at least in part, the contact management campaign. The contact management campaign may be configured to maximize the ability of the loan remediation entity to contact the borrower and to encourage the borrower to agree to the remediation solution.","The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to automatically route the borrower to the loan remediation entity external to the loan servicer when one of the loans is determined to be an at risk loan.","The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to calculate a borrower loan portfolio management (LPM) index regulatory component, a LPM index market component, a LPM index loan servicer and investor component, and a borrower personal data component. The LPM system instructions may cause the processor to adjust the effects of comparing dissimilar borrower profiles as a result of regulatory and market changes by scaling borrowers using a borrower loan portfolio management index in order to filter the effects that cause statistical changes to the borrowers' profiles over time. Changes that occur over time may include, for example, regulatory changes, individual borrower profiles, borrower regulatory profiles, economic impact to the loan servicers and investors. When changes occur over time, the statistical similarities between borrowers in a loan portfolio change. The more variability in the profiles of borrowers the more difficult the task of comparing borrowers in order to calculate better forecasts. Market changes include changes to contract terms and obligations between investors and loan servicers.","The LPM system instructions may further cause the processor to analyze results of the executed remediation solution to identify whether the remediation solution was successful, identify a remediation resolution trend by comparing results of a previously executed remediation solution to the results of the executed remediation solution and refine the executed remediation solution into a new remediation solution to recommend to borrowers in the future.","The LPM system may generate recommended remediation solutions and alternative remediation solutions that conform to the contact management campaign. The recommended and the alternative remediation solutions each may comprise a success probability that identifies a probability of transforming the at risk loan into a performing loan. The LPM system instructions may use the success probabilities of the recommended and the alternative remediation solutions to display the recommended and the alternative remediation in a ranked order.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","120","122","124","126","128","104"]},"The LPM system  communicates with the various entities and data sources through a communications interface , coupled to a processor  and memory . The memory  comprises data received from the various entities and data sources. For example, the data in the memory  may include borrowers' profiles , property data , financial institutions' data , loan portfolio performance data , contract data  and macro economics data  that the LPM system  stores in the LPM data warehouse .

The portfolio analyzer logic  may use configurable risk threshold values  to determine whether a loan in a servicer's portfolio  is at risk.","The LPM system  may include a graphical user interface  to receive data such as data updates  and user selections from users. A user interface (GUI) is a type of user interface which enables people to interact with electronic devices such as computers, hand-held devices (MP3 Players, Portable Media Players, Gaming devices), household appliances and office equipment. A GUI may offer graphical icons, and visual indicators as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation to fully represent the information and actions available to a user.

Additionally or alternatively, the portfolio trending, statistics and analysis  information may include a percentage of the loans for which corrective action has been taken during the last two months. Additionally or alternatively, the portfolio trending, statistics and analysis  information may include a total of the number of modified loans which do not re-default, and a summary of foreclosure costs avoided due to loan modifications.","The portfolio trending, statistics and analysis  information may reflect information related to segmented campaigns. The LPM system  may facilitate design and monitoring of the segmented campaigns to maximize contact with the borrower and to encourage default resolution actions by the borrower. The campaigns may be created to target various segments of borrowers. For example, the contact campaign segments may correspond to borrower demographics, such as borrowers having \u201cperforming loans\u201d that are no more than 29 days late, \u201cdefault loans\u201d that are between 30 and 89 days late, and \u201cforeclosure loans\u201d that are at least 90 days late. In one example, the contact campaign segments may be identified by the customer via, for example, a self-directed portal. In a second example, the contact campaign segments may be identified by loan servicers. Customers may be contacted according to the campaign guidelines.","The loan modification statistics and analysis  may include information about loan modifications for each respective one of the contact campaign segments. For example, the loan modification statistics and analysis  may include summary information about loan modifications, such as the number of loans modified in the loan portfolio during a period of time, the total cost of the loan modifications, cost savings from avoided defaults, and a percentage of loans having terms, rates, and\/or principals modified.","The performing loans status and statistics  may include information about the loans in each one of the contact campaign segments.

CCI is for uses with a risk score to rank-order the likelihood that consumers can have the credit capacity to take on incremental (future) revolving debt within a given risk level. Higher scores equate to lower future risk of default. Used for credit decisions across the consumer credit lifecycle, such as targeting, underwriting, customer management. The benefit of including the CCI in the analysis is to provide a forward insight into a borrower's credit capacity based on current credit behaviors captured on the borrower's credit report, which is not self-reported or unverified income data. The priority, refresh frequency, and whether a current lender has the capability to generate the analytic, credit capacity index, may be customized.
