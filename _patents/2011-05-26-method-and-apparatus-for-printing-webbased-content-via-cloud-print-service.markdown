{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE","BRIEF DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present exemplary embodiment relates generally to printing web-based content via a cloud print service. It finds particular application in using a print uniform resource locator (URL) service to link an original URL for web-based content to a print URL that can be embedded in a source document as a widget, such as a hypertext link, an interactive control, or a combination thereof. The embedded widget can be activated when the web-based content associated with the original URL is desired to be printed via the cloud print service. However, it is to be appreciated that the exemplary embodiments described herein are also amenable to linking multiple original URLs to the print URL, to linking an original URL for the source document to the print URL, to linking various types of web-based content to the print URL, and to embedding the widget in various types of source documents in various combinations.","Traditionally printing is done behind a firewall using either a network-connected or locally-connected printing device where document submission, conversion, and printing happen in the same environment. With the rapid emergence of cloud-based printing options, some or all of these activities are moving to the cloud and operating across firewalls. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,443,523 to Leone, III et al., assigned to Xerox Corporation of Norwalk, Conn., discloses a method for printing at a networked client site from a document processing application running on a remote server. Xerox and other businesses provide products and services that provide cloud print services that implement this methodology or similar methodologies.","A current challenge is in integrating a variety of web sources of content with cloud-based print services. For example, web-based content appears in blogs, social network messages and other postings, such as Twitter tweets, Facebook postings, Myspace postings, e-mail messages, chat room dialogs, instant message dialogs, online document repositories, and traditional web sites and web pages. One way to print such web-based content is the traditional driver based approach which may either use a File\/Print pull-down or popup menu associated with the browser, a \u201cPrinter\u201d icon associated with the browser, or a \u201cPrinter\u201d icon\/link embedded in the web-based content that uses embedded commands or script technologies, such as JavaScript, to bring up a standard operating system (OS) print driver window or to automatically activate the standard OS print driver. However, this does not work well for the emerging cloud print services which may receive content for printing via web uploads, application program interface (API) calls, e-mail messages, or other types of integration. These integrations to cloud print services usually involve the need to write customized code for the ultimate user experience or force users to use suboptimal methods, such as attachments to e-mail, to deliver the content for printing. In fact, if one wanted to print a blog article via a cloud print service, they would have no way to print it directly and the author of the blog would not be able to do anything to enable or facilitate cloud printing.","Based on the foregoing, there is a need for printing certain types of web-based content via cloud print services that cannot be printed in this manner. Additionally, there is a need for simplifying techniques for printing other types of web-based content that can currently be printed via cloud print services. Moreover, the simplified techniques should reduce the technical knowledge required for authors of web-based content and web applications to enable the printing of web-based content via cloud print services as well as the technical knowledge required for consumer users to print the corresponding web-based content.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,443,523 to Leone, III et al., issued Oct. 28, 2008, assigned to Xerox Corporation of Norwalk, Conn., is fully incorporated herein by reference.","In one aspect, a method for printing web-based content via a cloud print service in provided. In one embodiment, the method includes: a) receiving a print request from a user device at an interface server via a communication network, the interface server being associated with a print interface service and in operative communication with a cloud print service, the print request being associated with an interface record at least temporarily stored in a storage device accessible to the interface server, the interface record being associated with a print uniform resource locator (URL) linked to one or more original URLs comprising web-based content desired to be printed via the cloud print service by a consumer user using the user device; b) obtaining the web-based content associated with the one or more original URLs from one or more host servers on which the corresponding web-based content is stored; and c) sending a job request and the obtained web-based content to the cloud print service from the interface server for printing the desired web-based content via the cloud print service for the consumer user.","In another aspect, an apparatus for printing web-based content via a cloud print service is provided. In one embodiment, the apparatus includes an interface server in operative communication with a cloud print service. In this embodiment, an exemplary embodiment of the interface server includes: a controller for controlling operations of the interface server to provide a print interface service; a consumer user communication module in operative communication with the controller for receiving a print request from a user device via a communication network; a storage device in operative communication with the controller for at least temporarily storing an interface record associated with the print request, the interface record being associated with a print uniform resource locator (URL) linked to one or more original URLs comprising web-based content desired to be printed via the cloud print service by a consumer user using the user device; a print content communication module in operative communication with the controller for obtaining the web-based content associated with the one or more original URLs from one or more host servers on which the corresponding web-based content is stored; and a cloud print communication module in operative communication with the controller for sending a job request and the obtained web-based content to the cloud print service for printing the desired web-based content via the cloud print service for the consumer user.","In yet another aspect, another method for printing web-based content via a cloud print service is provided. In one embodiment, the method includes: a) receiving a record request from an author device at an interface server via a communication network, the interface server being associated with a print interface service and in operative communication with a cloud print service, the record request requesting assignment of a print uniform resource locator (URL) from a plurality of unassigned print URLs managed by the interface server and identifying one or more original URLs, the one or more original URLs comprising web-based content that an author user using the author device desires to enable to be printed via the cloud print service when the print URL is specified in a print request to the interface server; b) assigning the print URL to an interface record stored in a storage device accessible to the interface server; c) storing the print URL, the one or more original URLs, and corresponding links between the print URL and one or more original URLs in the interface record; d) receiving a print request from a user device at the interface server via the communication network, the print request including the print URL assigned in b) and indicating a consumer user using the user device desires to print the web-based content associated with the print URL via the cloud print service; e) obtaining the web-based content associated with the one or more original URLs from one or more host servers on which the corresponding web-based content is stored; and f) sending a job request and the obtained web-based content to the cloud print service from the interface server for printing the desired web-based content via the cloud print service for the consumer user.","This disclosure describes various embodiments of methods and print interface services for printing web-based content via cloud print services. For example, the print interface service can be used to link an original URL for web-based content to a print URL that can be embedded in a source document as a widget, such as a hypertext link, an interactive control, or a combination thereof. The embedded widget can be activated when the web-based content associated with the original URL is desired to be printed via the cloud print service. In other embodiments, the print interface service can be used to link multiple original URLs to the print URL, to link an original URL for the source document to the print URL, and to link various types of web-based content to the print URL in various combinations. Similarly, the print interface service can be used to create the print URL and provision various parameters which would subsequently be used to print the associated web-based content via the cloud print service when the corresponding widget in the source document is activated.","The various embodiments of methods and apparatus disclosed herein strive to solve the problems described above regarding the use of cloud print services to print web-based content by utilizing a specially assigned or constructed print uniform resource locator (URL) in conjunction with a print URL service. The corresponding print URL allows end users or consumers to click or activate an embedded icon, hypertext link, or another type of widget from the web-based content to get the desired content printed via the cloud print service, The techniques disclosed here do not require consumers to have specialized technical knowledge to print web-based content via cloud print services. The techniques also do not require authors of web-based content or web applications to have specialized technical knowledge to enable or provision for the printing of web-based content via cloud print services.","The print URL service may use a URL redirecting technique similar to those used by URL shortening services, such as TinyURL offered by TinyURL, LLC of Blaine, Minn. However, a web-based print URL provided by the print URL service does not simply redirect the user to the source of the web-based content. Rather, it redirects the user to a cloud print page where they can select a printer for printing the web-based content and activate the printing. The print URL service may also automatically forward the web-based content to the cloud print service for printing if a default or pre-selected cloud print printer is used.","With reference to , an exemplary communication system infrastructure  depicts how an embodiment of a print URL service  may permit a web-based print URL  to be created via a web page or a web service by the author or host  of the web-based content. The web-based print URL  is associated with specific web-based content to be printed. The web-based print URL  may also be associated with a source repository, security options, a cloud print service, default print options, and content type. Authors  of web-based content or web applications may add a widget within a web page or other web-based content that allows users  to print the corresponding web-based content via a cloud print service  using the embedded widget. The web-based content desired to be printed is linked to the embedded widget and web-based print URL  via the print URL service . The widget, for example, allows web-content providers to add a simple JavaScript file to the hosted web content which will utilize the print URL service to create a link to their corresponding host web page. The widget, when clicked by a user, may create a web-based print URL  for the web page and link the user to the cloud print service  to print the associated web-based content. The widget and web-based print URL  may also be linked to a different URL (i.e., hosted web page) than the web page that contains the widget. In other words, the author  of the web-based content or web application can specify the web-based print URL  independent of the URL (i.e., hosted web page) for the web page in which the widget is embedded.","In one embodiment of a process for printing web-based content via a cloud print service, the process begins with a web-based content author creating a web-based print URL using a print URL service. Next, the web-based content author includes the web-based print URL in the web-based content to be printed (e.g., original content, tweet, online message, e-mail, etc.). In this embodiment, after a consumer clicks on the web-based print URL, the consumer is redirected to a cloud print service associated with the web-based print URL. From the web-based print URL, the cloud print service understands which web-based content is requested to be printed, how to retrieve the desired content from the original web-based source, and how to print the desired content. The consumer may select one available cloud printer from a list of cloud printers available via the cloud print service. Then, the consumer clicks \u201cPrint\u201d and picks up the printed content at the selected cloud printer.","In another embodiment of a process for printing web-based content via a cloud print service, the process begins with a web-based content author creating a web-based print URL using a web or native device application that serves as a front-end to a print URL service. The web-based print URL may follow a predetermined format, such as http:\/\/prnt.it\/X909X09 where \u201cprnt.it\u201d defines a URL for a host for the print URL service and \u201cX909X09\u201d is a special key used to identify the requested resources associated with the web-based content that is to be printed.","In this embodiment, the web-based print URL is associated with a source document URL, such as http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/article.pdf. The web-based print URL may also be associated with a source document repository, such as box.net or sharepoint-on-line. The web-based print URL may include source document repository credentials, such as a user name and password. The web-based print URL may also identify a source document type, such as web page, PDF, etc. The web-based print URL may also be associated with a cloud print service, such as Xerox's cloud print service. The web-based print URL may include default print options, such as color, A4, etc. Other optional and required parameters can be associated with the web-based print URL.","In additional embodiments, the information stored with the web-based print URL may be stored in a print URL service repository, such as a server, disk drive, or any suitable storage device. The web-based print URL can be embedded in any web-based content or web page capable of displaying it or using it to direct the corresponding web-based content associated with the web-based print URL to the cloud print service associated with the web-based print URL. Upon the invocation or activation of the web-based print URL, the print URL service redirects the consumer to the cloud print service. The cloud print service can query the print URL service for the options associated with the web-based print URL. The cloud print service can fulfill the print request for the web-based content associated with the web-based print URL based on its implementation.","There are several ways of making the URL redirection associated with the print URL service available for web-based content that is desired to be printed via a cloud print service. For example, at least three techniques can be used to access and exploit the benefits of the print URL service: i) using a portal to access the print URL service and define the web-based print URL, ii) using a widget to access the print URL service, and iii) using a representational state transfer (REST) service call to access the print URL service and define the web-based print URL. These techniques allow any type of user or consumer to benefit from the print URL service.","As for using the portal, ordinary users can provide the print URL service with a link to a web-based file that is desired to be printed via the cloud print service. This link can be shared with other users. This provides a simple interface for users that are not technically savvy enough or for users that simply prefer not to create their own web-based print URL.","As for using the widget, web site authors have the ability to embed, for example, a custom JavaScript widget on their authored web page. The embedded widget, for example, allows users to print the content of the web page by clicking or otherwise activating the widget. The widget can create the web-based print URL and provide a link to the original web-based content so that the content can be printed via the cloud print service. The actions that follow activation of the widget can be transparent to the user. There may also be interaction between the print URL service and the user following activation of the widget in order to dynamically provide source document or cloud print parameters, dynamically select default parameters, dynamically edit previously used or default parameters, or any suitable combination thereof. The user may also have the option of saving the dynamic selections for the web-based print URL with the print URL service for reuse the next time the web-based print URL is activated. The widget allows users to have easy access to printing web-based content via the cloud print service when on the go or even on their home computers. The widget also works on smartphones and other devices that support the embedded script that is processed when the widget is activated, such as JavaScript.","As for the REST service call, the print URL service can accept REST service calls from a third party. Therefore, if a third party wants to use a custom implementation that defines one or more web-based print URLs for printing web-based content via a cloud print service, the print URL service give them the ability to do so by simply using a corresponding REST service call.","With reference to , an exemplary embodiment of a process  for printing web-based content via a cloud print service begins at  where a print request is received from a user device at an interface server via a communication network. The interface server being associated with a print interface service and in operative communication with a cloud print service. The print request being associated with an interface record at least temporarily stored in a storage device accessible to the interface server. The interface record being associated with a print URL linked to one or more original URLs comprising web-based content desired to be printed via the cloud print service by a consumer user using the user device. Next, the web-based content associated with the one or more original URLs is obtained from one or more host servers on which the corresponding web-based content is stored (). At , a job request and the obtained web-based content are sent to the cloud print service from the interface server for printing the desired web-based content via the cloud print service for the consumer user.","In another embodiment of the process , the print request received in  is based at least in part on the consumer user activating an interactive control embedded in a content file displayed on the user device, the interactive control associated with a hypertext link that directs the print request to the print interface service after the interactive control is activated. In a further embodiment of this embodiment, the interactive control and the hypertext link were embedded in the content file by an author user using an author device prior to the content file being accessed by the consumer user via the user device. In another further embodiment of this embodiment, the web-based content desired to be printed comprises the content file displayed on the user device.","With reference to , an exemplary embodiment of a process  for printing web-based content via a cloud print service may begin at  where a record request is received from an author device at the interface server.
