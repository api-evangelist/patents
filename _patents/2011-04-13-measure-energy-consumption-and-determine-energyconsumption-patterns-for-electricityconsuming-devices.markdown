{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This disclosure generally relates to managing energy consumption for electricity-consuming devices.","Saving energy is becoming increasingly important due to environmental and other concerns. With smart energy solutions (e.g., employing ecological and cost-effective approaches to solving energy needs), it is desirable to understand the energy-consumption or electricity-consumption patterns of an electricity-consuming device before designing a reasonable model and consumption prediction algorithms for the device.","For various energy related applications, it is desirable to understand the energy-consumption or electricity-consumption patterns of a single electricity-consuming device or across multiple electricity-consuming devices. Currently, there are methods to measure the energy consumption of an electricity-consuming device (e.g., Kill-A-Watt electricity usage monitors), but all such methods are bound to specific electricity outlets. This means that if a device is unplugged from one outlet and then plugged into another outlet, the information collected from the first outlet becomes irrelevant to the device. Consequently, it is difficult to get an overall map of the electricity consumption of the device. In addition, if multiple electricity-consuming devices are connected to the same output (e.g., by using an extension cord or power strip), it is unlikely to obtain accurate readings for each individual device.","Particular embodiments couple an electricity-measurement unit to each electricity-consuming device so that the electricity-measurement unit may collect the energy-consumption or energy-usage information for the associated electricity-consuming device. If the device is moved from one outlet to another, its associated electricity-measurement unit moves with the device and the collection of the energy-consumption information for the device is uninterrupted. In addition, in particular embodiments, an electricity-consumption reader may collect the energy-consumption information of multiple electricity-consuming devices and determine energy-consumption patterns for individual devices or across multiple devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 1 and 2","b":["110","110","110","110","110"]},"In particular embodiments, each electricity-consuming device  is coupled to an electricity-measurement unit . There may be different ways to couple an electricity-consuming device  and an electricity-measurement unit , and this disclosure contemplates any suitable coupling means. In the example system illustrated in , an electricity-measurement unit  may be incorporated in an electricity-consuming device  (e.g., as a component of the electricity-consuming device ). Alternatively, in the example system illustrated in , an electricity-measurement unit  may be an independent device and is connected to an electricity-consuming device . For example, an electricity-measurement unit  may be incorporated in a power cord or power strip connecting the associated electricity-consuming device  to a power-supplying source (e.g., outlet). In particular embodiments, electricity supplied to an electricity-consuming device  goes through its associated electricity-measurement unit  first.","In particular embodiments, an electricity-measurement unit  includes an electricity-measurement component, a calculation component, a storage component, and a communication component. The electricity-measurement component may record the total electricity current flowing through it to the associated electricity-consuming device  at a given time. In one implementation, the electricity-measurement component may incorporate a power-consumption or current sensor. The calculation component may compute the total energy usage for the associated electricity-consuming device  at a given time. By knowing the voltage of the supplied electricity (e.g., 110V or 220V), the total energy usage may be computed based on the total electricity current. The communication component may aggregate the readings based on a predefined or user-specified frequency or time period, such as, for example and without limitation, each minute, hour, or day. For example, the energy usage may be measured in watts hour or kilowatts hour. There may be a default frequency or time period, which may be customized or adjusted by a user. The energy usage information of the associated electricity-consuming device  may be stored in the storage component.","In particular embodiments, each electricity-measurement unit  has a unique or substantially unique identifier (ID). For example and without limitation, the identifier of an electricity-measurement unit  may be its Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address, or a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This disclosure contemplates any suitable means to uniquely identify an electricity-measurement unit . Each electricity-measurement unit  may be identified by its unique ID (e.g., especially when there are multiple electricity-measurement units  in a system).","In particular embodiments, an electricity-consumption reader  may collect energy-usage information of each electricity-consuming device  from its associated electricity-measurement unit . The energy-usage information collected from a specific electricity-measurement unit  may be identified by the ID of that electricity-measurement unit  so that electricity-consumption reader  may determine which energy-usage information is of which electricity-consuming device . Electricity-consumption reader  may communicate with each electricity-measurement unit  through a wire-line or wireless connection. For example and without limitation, electricity-consumption reader  may communicated with an electricity-measurement unit  through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection or a Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or infra-red (IR) connection.","More specifically, in particular embodiments, the communication component of an electricity-measurement unit  may implement a communication protocol for communicating with electricity-consumption reader . The communication component of an electricity-measurement unit  may retrieve the energy-usage information from the storage component of the electricity-measurement unit  and send it to electricity-consumption reader  from time to time or upon request. In one implementation, there may be a standard communication interface between electricity-consumption reader  and each electricity-measurement unit  in the system. In this case, electricity-consumption reader  may retrieve energy-consumption information from each electricity-measurement unit  using the same communication protocol or method.","In the example systems illustrated in , electricity-consumption reader  is an independent device separate from electricity-consuming devices  or electricity-measurement units . In this case, a single electricity-consumption reader  may collect energy-usage information of multiple electricity-consuming devices  through their associated electricity-measurement units  respectively. Alternatively, in particular embodiments, an electricity-consumption reader  may be incorporated in an electricity-measurement measurement unit  or an electricity-consuming device  (e.g., as a component of the electricity-measurement unit  or electricity-consuming device ). In this case, the electricity-consumption reader  may retrieve the energy-usage information of is associated electricity-consuming device  directly from the storage component of its associated electricity-measurement unit .","In particular embodiments, electricity-consumption reader  may display the energy-consumption information of individual electricity-consuming devices  to a user. For example, electricity-consumption reader  may include a display component (e.g., a screen) for displaying the energy-consumption information of the electricity-consuming devices  directly to the user. Alternatively, electricity-consumption reader  may be network-capable and connected to a network so that the energy-consumption information may be displayed to the user indirectly through a web-based service (e.g., Google Power Meter Service).","In addition, in particular embodiments, electricity-consumption reader  may aggregate the energy-consumption information of electricity-consuming devices  to determine one or more energy-consumption patterns for a single electricity-consuming device  or across multiple electricity-consuming devices . The energy-consumption patterns may also be displayed to a user directly or indirectly. In one implementation, electricity-consumption reader  may include a software component for aggregating the energy-consumption information and determining the energy-consumption patterns. By providing a unique ID to each electricity-measurement unit , the software component of electricity-consumption reader  may determine which set of energy-consumption information belongs to which electricity-consuming device . The software component may be able to determine which specific electricity-consuming devices  in the system whose associated electricity-measurement units  are connected to electricity-consumption reader  and their arrangement or configuration (e.g., the topology of the system).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"310"},"In particular embodiments, the electricity-consumption reader may aggregate the energy-consumption information of the electricity-consuming devices to determine energy-consumption patters for a single electricity-consuming device or across multiple electricity-consuming devices, as illustrated in STEP . For example, given a specific electricity-consuming device, the electricity-consumption reader may aggregate multiple sets of energy-consumption information of the electricity-consuming device (e.g., energy-consumption information of the electricity-consuming device during different times of a day or different days of a week) to determine energy-consumption patterns for the electricity-consuming device. As another example, if there are multiple electricity-consuming devices, then the electricity-consumption reader may aggregate multiple sets of energy-consumption information of one or more available electricity-consuming devices to determine energy-consumption patterns for the multiple electricity-consuming devices.","The method illustrated in  has many practical applications. For example, the electricity-consuming devices may be servers in a data center or a server farm, in which case the energy-consumption patterns of the data center or server farm may be determined. As another example, electricity-consuming devices may be devices in a room, a house, a floor of a build, an entire building, or a neighborhood, in which case the energy-consumption patterns of the room, house, floor, building, or neighborhood may be determined.","Sometimes, an electricity-consuming device may receive power from an internal or external battery. The life of the battery is related to the total length of time (e.g., number of hours) the battery supplies power to the electricity-consuming device and the amount of charge the battery holds. The method illustrated in  may also be used to estimate the life expectation of the battery or the electricity-consuming device.","Particular embodiments may be implemented in a network environment.  illustrates an example network environment .
