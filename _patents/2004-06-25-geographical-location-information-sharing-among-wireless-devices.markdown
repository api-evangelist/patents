title: Geographical location information sharing among wireless devices
abstract: A system and method for sharing geographical location information among a set of wireless telecommunication devices, such as mobile telephones. A first wireless telecommunication device generates geographical location information of that wireless telecommunication device, either through a resident device such as a GPS device, or has another computer device on the network provide the geographic location information, and then shares the geographical location information through sending the location information to one or more servers for relay to a predesignated target set of wireless telecommunication devices. The server stores the identity of member devices of the target set and controls communication between the first wireless telecommunications device and the member devices of the target set. A second server can be used to modify the geographical information, such as providing a map showing the location of the first wireless telecommunication device and other member devices of the target set.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention generally relates to communication between computer devices across wireless computer networks. More particularly, the invention relates to the sharing of geographical location information among a predesignated set of wireless telecommunication devices selectively communicating across a wireless network.","In wireless telecommunication devices, such as cellular phones, PDAs, mini-laptops, and advanced pagers, the devices typically communicate over long distances through bridging telephone calls through the existing telephone networks and passing data packets across the telephone network. These wireless devices often have either limited or significant data processing and computing capability, and can accordingly send and receive software programs across the wireless phone network.","There exists a wireless telecommunication service that provides a quick one-to-one or one-to-many communication that is generically referred to as \u201cPush-To-Talk\u201d (PTT) capability. The specific PTT group of recipient devices for the wireless device is set up by the carrier and the wireless devices do not typically allow the modification of the group, to include or drop individuals from the group, or to direct a communication to be received by any fewer members than the entire group.","A PTT communication connection is typically initiated by a single button-push that activates a half-duplex link between the speaker and the group and once the button is released, the device can receive incoming PTT transmissions. In some arrangements, the PTT speaker will have the \u201cfloor\u201d where no other group member can speak while the speaker is speaking. Once the speaker releases the PTT button, any other individual member of the group can engage their PTT button and they will have the floor.","In a designated group of telecommunication devices, such as a PTT group, the members are often in constant ongoing communications, using the group talking function frequently to coordinate a specific activity. However, other than the voice communications between the members of the group, there is not typically a method to communicate data or other information to the group members using the PTT or other wireless device functionality. There accordingly is a need for a system to provide information to group members regarding other group members, especially the geographical location of the other members of the group.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for a wireless device member of a group to provide their geographical location to other members of the group. Such system and method should give the user of the wireless telecommunication device the ability to selectively provide to other wireless devices the geographical location information to maintain the user's location privacy. Further, such system and method should be able to display the position of one to all members of the group to each member of group. It is thus to the provision of such a system and method of sharing geographical location information between wireless telecommunication devices that the present invention is primarily directed.","The present invention is a system and method for sharing geographical location information among a set of wireless telecommunication devices, such as mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, tablet PCs, and other wireless telecommunication computer devices. A group member wireless telecommunication device generates its geographical location information either through a resident device such as a GPS device, or has another computer device on the network provide the geographic location information either to that device or to another device on the wireless network, and then the first wireless telecommunication device shares the geographical location information through sending the location information to one or more servers for relay to a predesignated target set of wireless telecommunication devices, i.e. other member devices of the group such as a predesignated PTT group. The one or more servers stores the identity of the member devices of the target set and controls communication between the first wireless telecommunications device and the group member devices. A second server can be used to modify the geographical information sent from the first wireless telecommunication device, such as providing a map showing the location of the first wireless telecommunication device and other member devices of the target set. The one or more servers can send actual geographical location information to each member of the group, or can provide a link or other reference to a location one the network where the location information may be located.","In one embodiment, the system for sharing geographical information of one or more wireless telecommunication devices with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network includes a first wireless telecommunication device that selectively communicates with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network, and the first wireless telecommunication device selectively generates information about the geographical location of that wireless telecommunication device. There is also a set of one or more target wireless communication devices that are designated by the first wireless communication device, such as designating other group members, and at least one server is in selective communication with the wireless telecommunication devices across the wireless network, and the server stores the identity of the set designated by the first wireless telecommunication device and controls communication between the first wireless telecommunications device and the designated set of member device for the first wireless telecommunications device. The first wireless telecommunication device selectively sends geographical location information to the at least one server for sharing the geographical information with the set of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device.","In one embodiment, the method for sharing geographical location information of one or more wireless telecommunication devices with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network includes the steps of designating a set of one or more target wireless telecommunication devices by a first wireless telecommunication device, the first wireless telecommunication device selectively communicating with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network, then storing the identity of the set of wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device at one or more servers where the one or more servers control communication between the first wireless telecommunications device and the member devices of the designated set for the first wireless telecommunications device. Then the method includes the steps of selectively generating information about the geographical location of a first wireless telecommunication device, selectively sending geographical location information from the first wireless telecommunication device to the one or more servers, and then sharing the geographical location information at the one or more servers with the set of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device.","It is therefore an object of the system and method to allow a wireless telecommunication device to selectively provide geographical location information to the wireless telecommunication devices of other members of a predesignated group. The system and method allows the user of the wireless telecommunication device to selectively provide to other wireless devices his or her geographical location information, while otherwise maintaining the user's location privacy, if desired. Further, the system and method can display the geographical position of one device to one or all members of the group, or can provide enhanced features such as providing the geographical location of each member of group, or a map that displays the location(s) of one to all members of the group.","Other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will become apparent after review of the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims.","With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elements throughout,  illustrates the system  for sharing the geographical location information of one or more wireless telecommunication devices, such as the wireless telephone , smart pager  and personal digital assistant (PDA) , with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network . In the system , a first wireless telecommunication device, such as telephone , selectively generates information about the geographical location of that wireless telecommunication device and shares this information with a group or set  of one or more target wireless communication devices that are predesignated by the first wireless communication device, such as a direct-connect group in a push-to-talk environment. At least group communication server  is in selective communication with the one or more wireless telecommunication devices, such as the set , across the wireless network , the server preferably stores at least the identity of the set designated by the first wireless telecommunication device and the server  controls communication between the first wireless telecommunications device and the designated set .","The set  can also be increased, decreased, or created \u201cad hoc\u201d by the wireless device ,, and the group communication server  can set up the designated set  for the communication, and potentially store the identity of the member devices of the set  for later recall by the wireless device ,,. In such embodiment, the group communication server  stores the identity of the ad hoc set  designated by the wireless device ,, only to the extent that group communications can be bridged while group communication is occurring.","The first wireless telecommunication device (such as cellular telephone ) selectively sends geographical location information to at least the group communication server , which is present on a server-side LAN  across the wireless network. The group communication server  will share the geographical information with the set  of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device. In other embodiments, further described herein, other computer devices can be resident on the server-side LAN  or be accessible across the wireless network  to the wireless devices. The group communication server  can have an attached or accessible database  to store the group identification data for the wireless devices the server  control group communications for. There can also be a mapping server  or other server that receives and\/or modifies geographical location data and then provides that modified data ultimately to the wireless devices of the set, such as a map () showing the location of all wireless devices of the set . The mapping server  is shown here as having accessible a geographical location and map database  that can provide the maps for overlay of the device locations. It should be appreciated that the number of computer components resident on server-side LAN , or across the wireless network , or Internet generally, are not limited.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["32","70","72","74","76","20","32","50","32"]},"The group communication server(s)  are connected to a wireless service provider's packet data service node (PDSN) such as PDSN , shown here resident on a carrier network . Each PDSN  can interface with a base station controller  of a base station  through a packet control function (PCF) . The PCF  is typically located in the base station . The carrier network  controls messages (generally in the form of data packets) sent to a messaging service controller (\u201cMSC\u201d). The carrier network  communicates with the MSC  by a network, the Internet and\/or POTS (\u201cplain ordinary telephone system\u201d). Typically, the network or Internet connection between the carrier network  and the MSC  transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC  can be connected to one or more base stations . In a similar manner to the carrier network, the MSC  is typically connected to the branch-to-source (BTS)  by both the network and\/or Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS  ultimately broadcasts and receives messages wirelessly to and from the wireless devices, such as cellular telephones ,,,, by short messaging service (\u201cSMS\u201d), or other over-the-air methods known in the art.","Cellular telephones and telecommunication devices, such as wireless telephone , are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held PDAs. These \u201csmart\u201d cellular telephones allow software developers to create software applications that are downloadable and executable on the processor of the wireless device. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone , can download many types of applications, such as web pages, applets, MIDlets, games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. In wireless devices that have designated a set  of group members, the wireless device can directly connect with the other member of the set and engage in voice and data communication. However, all such direct communications will occur through, or at the control of, the group communication server . All data packets of the devices do not necessarily have to travel through the group communication server  itself, but the server  must be able to ultimately control the communication because it will typically be the only server-side  component that is aware of and\/or can retrieve the identity of the members of the set , or direct the identity of the members of the set  to another computer device, such as mapping server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["82","14","92","14","80","14","14","82","20","82","84","84","84","86","84","88"]},"As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone , with a graphics display, but can also be any wireless device with a computer platform as known in the art, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a pager with a graphics display, or even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal, and may otherwise have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. Further, the memory  can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform  can also include a local database  for storage of software applications not actively used in memory . The local database  is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.","In this embodiment of the wireless device , the computer platform  also includes a geographic location data device . Examples of such devices are global positioning system (GPS) devices that utilize the signals from a worldwide navigation system formed from a group of 24 satellites and ground stations. The GPS device can comprise only a few integrated circuits that calculate the actual map coordinates of the wireless device  and can relay this data to the group communication server . In an alternate embodiment, the device  can determine the relative coordinates of the wireless device  based upon triangulation of one or more base stations . In such embodiment, the geographical location data device  can provide relative geographical location information, such as a zip code, area of town, city, or general environs. Further, the geographical information can simply indicates the proximity of the first wireless telecommunication device  to one or more other member devices of the set . Thus, the wireless device  can share whatever geographical location data it generates.","The group communication server  can immediately send the geographical information of the first wireless telecommunication device  to the set  designated by the first wireless device, and not store any throughput geographical data. In an alternate embodiment, the group communication server  can also store the geographical information and selectively relay the stored geographical information to the set . In such an embodiment, it is preferable that the group communication server , or other device, include the time of storing with the stored geographical location information relayed to the set  designated by the first wireless device.","Further, while the wireless device can selectively generate its geographical location information in the embodiment of , the first wireless device can selectively generate the geographical location information from requesting data from another computer device on the wireless network  that can send geographical information of the wireless telecommunication device  thereto. For example, the wireless device  can prompt another device such as mapping server , if so embodied, to learn the geographical location of the wireless device , such as by performing a trace-route on the data packet arriving from the wireless device  and determining the base station  or other computer node where the wireless device  contacted the wireless network . The wireless device  then will relay the geographical location data received to the group communication server  for sharing with other members of the set . In another embodiment of the system , the wireless device  can generate the geographical location data from requesting data from another computer device on the wireless network , such as mapping server  or like other server, and the other server can send geographical information of the wireless device  to the group communication server  and\/or one to all members of the set  provided that the other server has permission and is able to learn the identity of the members of the set .","In another embodiment, the wireless device  can selectively request the group communication server  to send a link to the geographical location information of the wireless device resident wherein the information is resident on the second server, such as mapping server . Each wireless device receiving the link can then request the geographical information of the first wireless telecommunication device  from the second server (such as mapping server ).","As shown in , in one embodiment, the mapping server  can provide a map  for display by the member wireless devices of the set . In , the map  is shown on the display  of the wireless device  and shows the geographical location of four member wireless devices of the set . In this embodiment, each wireless device of the set  sent its geographical location information data to the mapping server  on the wireless network  and the mapping server  modified the geographical location information for each wireless device and represented the location on a map . Accordingly, the mapping server  then provided a hyperlink to the map  to the group communication server  and then the hyperlink was shared the member devices of the set . The map  generated by the mapping server  further can show the geographical location information of one to all wireless devices in the set . While a map  is shown as one manner of display of the geographical location information, such information can be displayed in many different types of formats, such as raw geographical coordinates (e.g., Latitude: N 330 53.205\u2032 (N 33.886754.degree.) Longitude: W 84.degree. 27.043\u2032 (W 84.450708.degree.), landmark information (e.g., next to the Smith Building), proximity (e.g., device  is closest to device ), or any other format that assists the user of the wireless device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["12","32","96","96","12","32","14","98","98"]},"Otherwise, of the user has approved sharing geographical location information at decision , then the geographical location data is generated as shown at step . Step  can occur from either a resident device of the wireless device , such as GPS device , or can occur from the retrieval or send of the geographical location data from a second server, such as mapping server , as shown above. After generation of the geographical location data at step , the data is sent to the group communication server  as shown at step . Then, in this embodiment, a determination is made as to whether the user of the device desires to display geographical data for other member devices of the set , as shown at decision . If the user does not desire to display the data at decision , the sharing process terminates.","Otherwise, if the user of the wireless device  desires to display the geographical location data at decision , then the wireless device  request the geographical location data for other member of the designated set  of the wireless device , as shown at step , and such request is made to the group communication server . A determination is then made as to whether the requested data has been received, as shown at decision . If the requested data is not received at decision , then an error is output and the process terminates. Otherwise, if the requested geographical location data has been received at decision , the received data is displayed to the user of the wireless device , as shown at step , and then process terminates. An example of the display in step  would be display of the map  of  on the graphics display  of the wireless device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["32","14","12","14","32","14","12","12","112","14","32","114","114"]},"Otherwise, if the group communication server  has its request acknowledged at decision , then the geographical location data is received from the wireless device, as shown at step . Then a determination is made as to whether a predesignated group\/set  of wireless devices is identifiable for the wireless device  for which the geographical location information has been received, as shown at decision . If no group\/set  can be located at decision , then an error is output and the process terminates. Otherwise, if a predesignated group\/set  of wireless devices is identified for the wireless device , then the geographical location information is sent to one or more of the wireless devices in the set , as shown at step .","A determination is then made, in this embodiment, as to whether the geographical location information for other wireless devices in the set  has been made, as shown at decision . An example of such embodiment would be the wireless device  requesting a map  to show the location of all wireless devices in the set . If no geographical location information has been requested at decision , then the process terminates. Otherwise, if the request for other geographical location information has been made at decision , a map is generated with the location of the group member devices displayed thereon, as shown at step . As is described above, step  can be performed on the group communication server  or a mapping server . Further, step  can alternately be sending raw data or geographical location information in another form, as is described above. Then the map  is sent to the requesting wireless device , as shown at step , and the display process terminates. In alternate embodiments, the geographical location information is sent to the wireless device  in whatever format the system specifies.","It can thus be seen that the wireless device  and group communication server  therefore provide a method for sharing geographical location information of one or more wireless telecommunication devices with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network including the steps of designating a set  of one or more target wireless communication devices by a first wireless communication device , where the first wireless telecommunication device  selectively communicates with other wireless telecommunication devices across a wireless network , and storing the identity of the set of wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device  at the group communication server(s) , where the group communication server(s)  controls communication between the first wireless telecommunications device  and the designated set  of the first wireless telecommunications device . Then the method includes the steps of selectively generating information about the geographical location of a first wireless telecommunication device , selectively sending geographical location information from the first wireless telecommunication device  to the group communication server(s) , and then sharing the geographical location information at the group communication server(s)  with the set  of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device . The step of sending the geographical location information can be immediately sending the geographical location information of the first wireless telecommunication device  to the set  designated by the first wireless device , or can include the steps of storing the geographical information of the first wireless telecommunication device  at the group communication server(s) , and then selectively relaying the stored geographical information from the group communication servers(s)  to the set  of wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless device . In such embodiment, the method can further include the step of including the time of storing with the stored geographical location information relayed to the set designated by the first wireless device.","The step of selectively generating information about the geographical location of a first wireless telecommunication device  can be selectively generating information about the geographical location from a device resident on the first wireless telecommunication device  providing data for the geographical location of that device, such as the GPS device . The step can alternately be where the first telecommunication device  communicates with the wireless network  at a communication node (base station ), and the step of selectively generating information about the geographical location can be generating geographical location information by the first wireless telecommunication device  triangulating a geographical location based upon the communication node of the wireless network  the first wireless device  is in communication with. Alternately, the step of selectively generating information about the geographical location of a first wireless telecommunication device  can be selectively generating information about the geographical location of that wireless telecommunication device  from requesting data from another computer device on the wireless network , such as mapping server , that can send geographical information for the first wireless telecommunication device  to the first telecommunication device . Alternately, the step of selectively generating information about the geographical location of a first wireless telecommunication device  can be selectively generating information about the geographical location of the first wireless telecommunication device  through requesting data from another computer device on the wireless network  that can send geographical location information of the first wireless telecommunication device  to the group communication server(s)  or other member devices of the set .","The method can include the step of sending geographical location information data to a data server, such as mapping server  on the wireless network , the data server selectively modifying the geographical location information for the first wireless telecommunication device . In such embodiment, the method can include the steps of selectively requesting the group communication server(s)  to send a link to the geographical information of the first wireless telecommunication device  resident on the data server to one or more devices of the set  of target wireless telecommunication devices designated by the first wireless telecommunication device  such that each wireless telecommunication device of the set  selectively requesting the geographical information of the first wireless telecommunication device from the data server at each wireless telecommunication device of the designated set  receiving the link.","In one embodiment, the link is a hyperlink to a map  generated by the data server (mapping server ) showing the location of the first wireless telecommunication device . The method can further includes the step of generating a map  by the mapping server  server further showing the geographical location information of one to all wireless telecommunication devices in the set  designated by the first wireless telecommunications device , an example of such map  shown in . Further, the step of sharing the geographical location information can be sharing geographical location information also indicating the proximity of the first wireless telecommunication device  to one or more wireless telecommunication devices of the set  designated by the first wireless device.","The method accordingly can be implemented by the execution of a program held computer readable medium, such as the memory  of the computer platform . The instructions can reside in various types of signal-bearing or data storage primary, secondary, or tertiary media. The media may comprise, for example, RAM (not shown) accessible by, or residing within, the wireless device.
