Research underlying this invention was sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911N F-12-2-0019.","Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a method for modeling a three-dimensional topological surface of an object from thermal radiation emitted from the object.","Long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) imaging has many practical applications. LWIR is generally a passive tool because it is a measure of a signal emitted by an object, thus not requiring an additional light source. One major disadvantage of LWIR imaging is the lack of contrast with respect to background objects and noise. Images of people tend to look washed out and ghostlike, and it is difficult to obtain information from the images, which would allow reliable and repeatable identification of a person's characterizing facial or other features.","Therefore there is a need in the art for improvements in LWIR imaging to enhance identifiability of an object in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method for modeling a surface of an object. A method and apparatus is provided for modeling a surface of an object acquiring, using a thermal imaging camera, a first image of the object, wherein the first image comprises a plurality of pixels each representative of at least one component of thermal data, calculating a normal vector for each pixel in the first image, corresponding to the normal vector on a surface of the object, generating a three-dimensional model representing a surface of the object based on aggregating the normal vector for each pixel together in the first image.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method and apparatus for generating a three-dimensional topological model of the surface of an object emitting thermal radiation using an image captured by a camera. The image captured by the thermal camera contains several component parts of data for each pixel in the image. For each pixel, a surface plane is established by calculating a set of angles with reference to the camera's line-of-sight and the base of the camera. Once the surface plane is established, a normal vector for each pixel is calculated. The normal vectors for all the pixels are integrated over the entire image, forming a function representing the surface of the object. If the result of the function at each (x, y) position is computationally-rendered and\/or plotted against a third axis (z), the topology of the surface of the object can be visualized in three-dimensions.","Thermal imaging involves using heat emitted from objects to form images. Heat is emitted by all objects above absolute zero and the amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature. Thermal imaging allows one to see variations in temperature across a particular object or body. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warmer objects are generally distinguishable from cooler backgrounds. Heat is typically captured by a thermal imaging camera in the infrared radiation (IR) spectrum. Depending on the particular object imaged, some types of thermal radiation may give rise to excessive noise, or not enough data to distinguish the features of an object. One spectrum of thermal imaging that may be of interest is LWIR, which is defined as electromagnetic radiation or light having wavelengths of about 8-15 \u03bcm. This spectrum is generally emitted by humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention is not limited to imaging using the LWIR spectra and that, in embodiments of the present invention, other spectra can be used for thermal imaging also.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"The topology generator  comprises a plane module , a normal module  and a surface module . The topology generator may be embodied as computer software executing on the computer system . A thermal camera  is coupled to the computer system . Thermal camera  is configured to acquire images representative of thermal radiation emitted by one or more target object(s) such as thermal radiation-emitting object . As such, the thermal camera  and the topology generator  do not require a light source to illuminate the object . According to one embodiment, the thermal camera  is a polarimetric camera equipped with a Stirling-cooled mercury cadmium telluride focal-plane array of 640 by 480 pixels. In this embodiment, the array has a spectral response range of 7.5-11.1 \u03bcm. In this embodiment, the thermal camera  is configured to record a sequence of 32-bit images at a frame rate of 120 Hz, and a well-known Fourier modulation technique is applied to the images to obtain radiation data of object  in the form of a Stokes Vector recorded by camera , collectively referred to as camera data .","When positioned in a non-illuminated environment containing object , thermal camera  captures the radiation emitting from the object . In some instances, the object  may be a human, a running vehicle, an animal or the like. The thermal camera  acquires thermal data emitted from the object  and generates camera data  corresponding to the radiation (e.g, LWIR) emitted from the object . In one embodiment, the camera data  includes the polarization state of the total wave emanating from the object along with several other parameters as components of the Stokes vector. Those of ordinary skill in the art recognize that the Stokes vector comprises 4 elements: 1) total intensity of emitted radiation, 2) tendency of emitted radiation to be horizontally or vertically polarized, 3) tendency of radiation to be polarized at \u00b145 degree angle, 4) tendency of the radiation being right circularly or left circularly polarized. Those of ordinary skill in the art recognize that the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) is calculated using S, Sand Sby the thermal camera . The magnitude and direction of the electric field vector at each pixel is determinable based on these four elements. In this embodiment, the camera data  comprises at least the Stokes parameters (S; S; S; and DoLP) for each pixel of the array of camera . The camera  may configured to output Stokes Vector data directly, or such values may be computed externally by an image processor for the camera data . The Stokes parameters may comprise a data vector in camera data . In general, only parameters S, Sand DoLP are utilized while Sis generally not used by the methods described below, except to normalize the quantities to the total amount of intensity.","The recorded images contain both reflected and emitted waves. As a consequence of the Fresnel equations, the emitted waves are polarized parallel to the plane of emission, which is defined by the line-of-sight of the camera and the surface normal N. In contrast, reflected waves are polarized perpendicular to this plane. In other words, the emitted and the reflected polarization states are orthogonal.","According to some embodiments, each of plane module , normal module , and surface module  comprises software instructions residing in memory  and executable by one or more processors  as CPUs CPU to CPU N in . The plane module  calculates the orientation of a plane  with respect to the ground shown in  and  for each pixel in an image captured by the thermal camera  based on the camera data .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["101","108","204","101","202","206","101","108","208","204","206","208","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["101","108","108","101","300","304","202","208","304","300","310","108","202","102","204","208","110","302","208","304","110"],"sub":["1 ","2 "]},"Subsequently, the plane information from the plane module  is provided to the normal module . The normal module  calculates the surface normal vectors at each pixel in the image, wherein the surface normal is a vector perpendicular to the surface on the object  at the point on the surface corresponding to pixel . Once the surface normal vector for each pixel is calculated, the surface module  integrates the surface normal vectors for all the pixels over the entire image to obtain a function f(x, y) defining the surface of the object . The surface module  then determines the value of the function f(x, y) at each point (x, y) to determine a third dimension value for each point. The value of the function f(x,y) at each point represents the topological height of every pixel representing a planar patch of the object  visible by the camera . The surface module  can plot the value of the function f(x,y) on a third axis z perpendicular to the plane formed by the x and y axes as three-dimensional surface representation  of the object . In some embodiments, the vectors comprising camera data  can be mapped to the representation  to generate a more visually discernible view of the surface of the object .","The data points x, y, and z may be stored digitally in an array, pointer, and\/or in any other electronic data structure or file structure as commonly used in computers. The data points can be rendered into a viewable model for display on a display device, for example, model  in . One such technique is by a wiremesh plot, for example. Once rendered, the image may be manipulated in many ways. For example, the vantage point of the image may be altered to view the image at various angles and\/or distances. Other image processing may be implemented as conventional. The image may be printed in a 2-D form, e.g., using an ink-jet or laser printer. Alternatively or additionally, the image may be printed in a 3-D form using a 3-D printer.","According to some embodiments, the topology generator  requires a numerical value for the complex index of refraction (n) for particular surfaces, such as human skin. The effective refractive index is considered to be constant over a human body. The real part of this effective n is between 1.4 and 1.6, and the imaginary part is between 0.01 and 0.03.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["400","400","100","1"]},"The method  begins at step  and proceeds to step .

The image comprises a plurality of pixels each representative of at least one component of thermal data (e.g., there are values for each of the Stokes parameters in each of the pixels for the first image). According to exemplary embodiments, the camera is a thermal polarimetric camera. The camera captures various data points regarding polarization of light emitted from each portion of the object facing the camera. No light source is required in the method  besides the thermal data (e.g. long-wave infrared radiation) emitted from the object itself. The camera may be used in a nocturnal setting, where in some instances an object is present, such as a human or a vehicle, and in some cases no objects are present. The method  is invoked as described when an object is present.","In exemplary embodiments, the thermal data is embodied in several images captured by the camera. The images contain, at each pixel, polarization state information such as intensity and other information regarding the light. In exemplary embodiments, the thermal data captures spectral emissivity (\u03b5), absorptivity (\u03b1) and reflectivity (r) of the thermal radiation being emitted by the object.","As the method proceeds to step , for each pixel of the image captured by the camera, a surface normal vector is calculated. The calculated surface normal vector corresponds to a normal vector on the surface of the object . The surface calculation is described in more detail in text accompanying  below.
