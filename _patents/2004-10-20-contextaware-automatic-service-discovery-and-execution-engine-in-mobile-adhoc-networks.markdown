title: Context-aware automatic service discovery and execution engine in mobile ad-hoc networks
abstract: In mobile computing and context awareness in mobile ad-hoc networks, node connectivity is unpredictably time-varying. A middleware entity solves the problem of automatically executing a user-defined set of actions, collected in a user profile, upon detection of events such as an attachment of a mobile terminal to the ad-hoc network, changes of the underlying network topology, the moving of mobile terminals into the physical proximity of further mobile terminals, the presence of services and/or of users within the network, and a detachment of a mobile terminal from the ad-hoc network. Thereby, the actions are invocations of services hosted on the mobile terminal or other mobile terminals interconnected via the ad-hoc network. The aforementioned profiles are stored on mobile terminals (e.g. PDAs, mobile phones, etc.) or on fixed or mobile customer-edge devices such as television sets, home gateways, etc. Also envisioned is the deployment of a distributed database holding the profiles.

It particularly refers to a specially designed middleware entity that solves the problem of automatically executing a user-defined set of actions for requesting, activating, controlling and\/or deactivating discovered services offered by nodes of any network upon detection of the occurrence of specific triggering conditions.","Context-aware computing was first discussed in \u201cDisseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts\u201d (IEEE Network 8 (5), pp. 22-32, September\/October 1994, available at: ftp:\/\/ftp.parc.xerox.com\/pub\/schilit\/AMS.ps.Z) by B. N. Schilit and M. M. Theimer. Therein, it is defined as software that \u201cadapts according to its location of use, the collection of nearby people and objects as well as changes to those objects over time\u201d. However, it is commonly agreed that the first research investigation of context-aware computing was the Olivetti Active Badge work in 1992 as described in the article \u201cThe Active Badge Location System\u201d (ACM Transactions on Information Systems 10 (1), pp. 91-102, January 1992, available at: http:\/\/www.parc.xerox.com\/csl\/members\/want\/papers\/ab-tois-jan92.pdf) by R. Want, A. Hopper, V. Falcao, and J. Gibbons. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to define context-aware computing.","The first definition of context-aware applications given in the aforementioned article \u201cDisseminating Active Map Information to Mobile Hosts\u201d by B. N. Schilit and M. M. Theimer restricted the definition from applications that are simply informed about context to applications that adapt themselves to context.

Kortuem, Z. Segall, and M. Bauer, context-aware applications are defined as applications that dynamically change or adapt their behavior based on the context of the application and the user. More specifically, in his article \u201cMCFE Metadata Elements, Version 0.2. Working Document\u201d (University of Kent at Canterbury, Kent, UK, available at: http:\/\/www.cs.ukc.ac.uk\/research\/infosys\/mobicomp\/Fieldwork\/Notes\/mcfemeta.html) the author N. Ryan defines them as applications that monitor input from environmental sensors and allow users to select from a range of physical and logical contexts according to their current interests or activities. This definition is more restrictive than the previous definition by identifying the method in which applications act upon context. In the article \u201cTriggering Information by Context\u201d (Personal Technologies 2 (1), pp. 1-9, March 1998, available at: http:\/\/www.cs.ukc.ac.uk\/people\/staff\/pjb\/papers\/personal_technologies.htm) by P. J. Brown the author defines context-aware applications as applications which automatically provide information and\/or take actions according to a user's present context as detected by a number of sensors. He also takes a narrow view of context-aware computing by stating that these actions can take the form of presenting information to the user, executing a program according to context or configuring a graphical layout according to the context. In their article \u201cSoftware Organization for Dynamic and Adaptable Wearable Systems\u201d (Proc. of the 1International symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC '97), pp. 56-63, Cambridge, Mass., IEEE, Oct. 13-14, 1997, http:\/\/www.cs.uoregon.edu\/research\/wearables\/Papers\/iswc97.ps) the authors S. Fickas, G. Kortuem, and Z. Segall define environment-directed (as a practical synonym for context-aware) applications as applications which monitor changes in a user's environment and adapt their operation according to predefined user-defined guidelines.","In EP 1 107 512 A1 a communication device and a software for operating multimedia applications in at least one communication network is described which comprises a computing manager unit for managing and providing multimedia applications on the basis of a communication with one or more communication devices in the at least one communication network.","EP 1 130 869 A1 generally relates to the field of mobile multimedia middleware, computer networking, distributed processing systems, databases, hand-held computers and wireless communication systems. Moreover, a method for conveniently managing user profile information in a unified instant messaging system is proposed.","As described in EP 1 199 860 A1, a service portal is used which enables services to access to context information stored in a context database by accessing a central access control unit of the service platform.","EP 1 298 527 A1 provides a system for supplying context information on request to context-aware devices comprising context attributes specifying a type, a format, and a focus entity for a data record representing the response to the request for context information, at least one context source providing context data relevant for the request of context information, at least one context interpreter for establishing an interconnection between the context attribute and the context source, and a configuration means for setting up a dynamic context graph configuration for assembling context sources and context interpreters based on their actual availability and suitability to provide the data record.","Shortcomings and Problems of Prior-Art Solutions","The problems addressed by the present invention refer to the issues of how to specify userdefined sets of actions (collected in so-called user profiles) and bind them to specific triggering conditions, how to detect when and under which circumstances the actions of a given user profile shall automatically be executed on behalf of the respective user and how to automatically execute said actions. Moreover, the invention is addressed to the problem of identifying middleware components providing the developers of software applications (and\/or of other middleware components) for mobile terminals that are interconnected via wired or wireless ad-hoc networks with sets of specific application programming interfaces (APIs) specialized in addressing the aforementioned three issues. In this way, the developers of software applications (and\/or of other middleware components) for said mobile terminals can leverage the functionality of said middleware components instead of re-implementing the same functionality for each software application (and\/or of other middleware components).","In view of the explanations mentioned above, it is the object of the invention to propose a QoS metric probing mechanism which supports context-aware service discovery and automatic execution of a set of actions offered by services which have automatically been discovered within mobile ad-hoc networks. The triggering conditions should be specified in terms of a detection of specific classes of events (and, eventually, given combinations thereof) such as attachments of a mobile terminals to a wired or wireless ad-hoc network, changes of the underlying network topology, the moving of mobile terminals into the physical proximity of further mobile terminals, presence awareness, which means recognizing the appearance and disappearance of users within said network, and detachments of the mobile terminals from the network.","The specification of each action contained in a given user profile should optionally include certain qualifiers (thereinafter called the \u201cguard conditions\u201d or simply the \u201cguards\u201d), which are additional low-level conditions that should be met before executing the given action.","This object is achieved by means of the features of the independent claims. Advantageous features are defined in the dependent claims. Further objects and advantages of the invention are apparent in the detailed description which follows.","The present invention is dedicated to a middleware entity of a mobile terminal connected to a wireless ad-hoc network which supports a multiplicity of applications and\/or other middleware entities to automatically discover services offered by nodes of said ad-hoc network and execute a user-defined set of actions collected in a profile upon reception of event notification messages indicating the availability of specific services hosted on said mobile terminal or other mobile terminals interconnected via said wireless ad-hoc network whenever a number of predefined triggering conditions for triggering the execution of an action that is used to request, activate, control and\/or deactivate these services is met on behalf of said applications and\/or the other middleware entities. Such an event can e.g. be an attachment of a mobile terminal to the ad-hoc network, changes of the underlying network topology, the moving of mobile terminals into the physical proximity of further mobile terminals, the presence of users within said network or the detachment of a mobile terminal from the ad-hoc network, time-based events (e.g. a calendar item being notified upon occurrence), and any combinations of the aforementioned types of events. Said actions are invocations of services hosted on said mobile terminal or on other mobile terminals interconnected via said ad-hoc network. The user profiles are stored on mobile terminals (e.g. PDAs, mobile phones, etc.), fixed or mobile customer-edge (CE) devices such as television sets, home gateways, etc. Also envisioned is the deployment of a distributed database holding said user profiles.","The invention thereby outlines the concept of the Profile Activation Engine (PAE), a middleware entity that is provided to enable users specifying a list of operations\u2014offered by services located in the given network\u2014which must automatically be executed whenever certain however complex triggering conditions are met. The monitoring of the aforementioned triggering conditions thereby leverages asynchronous notifications of specific events from various event producers.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention as depicted in  shall be explained in detail. The meaning of all the symbols designated with reference numerals and signs in  can be taken from Table 3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","120"]},"According to the invention, the Profile Activation Engine \u2032 is a middleware entity that is composed of the following middleware components:\n\n","The PAE Core  depends on the following middleware entities, which are a part of the PAE \u2032 according to one embodiment of this invention\u2014the Event Service system , the Context Processing system , and the Script Interpreter system  (an optional add-on feature of the PAE Core ) as shown in .","The Event Service system  especially supports the PAE \u2032 evaluating complex triggering conditions (modeled as events whose notifications the PAE \u2032 registers for). This middleware entity acts as a mediator between the set of all the event producers (i.e. the target services and\/or middleware entities generating event notification messages whenever certain conditions are met) and the set of all the event consumers (i.e. the target services and\/or middleware entities interested in receiving specific classes of event notification messages). The Event Service system  particularly takes care of the following actions:\n\n","Through the Event Service system  the PAE \u2032 depends on input data from the following middleware entities (in the following referred to as local event producers):\n\n","Remote event producers are the local event producers of another computational unit forwarding their event notification messages to the given PAE \u2032 via network connections. These remote event producers can include services or any type of sensor device deployed in the given network.","In one embodiment of this invention, a Context Processing system  is employed between the Event Service system  and the local\/remote event producers (the NIE, the Person Identification Unit (PIU) and remote event producers) to deduce more refined information about the actual context from raw data contained in the event notification messages. The Event Correlator feature of the Event Service system  may well be considered as a part of the Context Processing system . To this extent, the use of a framework for statically or even dynamically implementing various configurations of the Context Processing system  is envisioned. The use of a Context Processing system  also allows to include additional context data in the context computation model which is not a part of even notification messages. It is rather retrieved by explicitly polling on-demand specific context data sources such as sensors (e.g. thermo sensors) or a database.","The Binding Creation Engine  depends on a Metadata Management unit , which is used for managing the storage and retrieval of bindings (along with specifications of profiles and triggering conditions). The Binding Creation Engine  allows users to save any created bindings for later reuse by using said Metadata Management unit .","The General Application system  and the General Service system  model the actual clients of the PAE \u2032. The General Application system  thereby registers, activates, deactivates or deregisters a binding with the PAE \u2032 via a specific PAE Core API. To this extent, the Binding Creation Engine  can be considered as a special case of a General Application. However, the Binding Creation Engine  does not only use said API, it also shares the interface with the General Applications system  for managing bindings as meta data. The General Service system  is responsible for offering the implementations of the primitives they publish and which are used for defining the actions stored in the profiles.","The following set of definitions constitute the data model for the PAE concept according to one embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in the UML class diagram depicted in .\n\n","The Actions  are thereby grouped per Target Service : A Profile  can in fact list Actions  that shall be executed by various services, irrespective whether they are installed on the same device as the given PAE \u2032 or on remote devices.","Individual Actions  may optionally be qualified by a Guard condition, which is used for fine-tuning the behavior of the respective Action . To this extent, the following key issues have to be considered:\n\n","It should be noted that Guards  may also contain Boolean expressions which involve more than one locally or remotely defined property. Guards  are defined by the interface of the underlying Services the corresponding Actions deal with.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the following two levels of Profiles are envisioned: user-level Profiles and service-provider-level Profiles. Thereby, the user directly specifies the former by using a list of said properties (for defining Guards ) and primitives (for defining the Actions  to take) that are published by a given service (e.g. as a remote interface).","The manufacturer thereby specifies the service-provider-level Profile to indicate what specific fine-grained primitives are exported by the respective service and which combinations thereof are required to implement the user-level Actions (thus avoiding the user to have indepth knowledge about the given service).","According to a further aspect of the invention, the PAE \u2032 is able to obtain information about remote interface definitions and service-provider-level Profiles in the following two complementary ways: by means of a dynamic retrieval or by means of a static retrieval.\n\n","In any case, any dynamically retrieved remote interface definitions and service-provider-level Profiles can conveniently be stored locally or remotely for a faster static retrieval that is performed later.","The definition of Profiles may be completed with parameter lists for the primitives indicated in the Actions , wherever applicable. The actual value of the parameters should be included in the Profile .","Formal parameters may also be included in the primitives indicated in the Actions , wherever applicable. In this way, the PAE \u2032 will always be able to send to the service which implements the respective primitive any piece of information determined by the PAE \u2032 at run time (e.g. the identifier of a service detected by the NIE).","This information might in fact be of relevance for allowing the service that implements the primitive indicated in a given Action  to take appropriate decisions. For instance, an automatic photo synchronization application might want to avoid synchronizing images on multiple image management services. It might rather want to choose only a specific one which is determined at runtime.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, the specification of said Bindings , Profiles , and Triggering Conditions  is achieved in two ways:\n\n","According to one aspect of the present invention, a custom grammar is used for expressing Boolean expressions with respect to Triggering Conditions  (and, optionally, also with respect to the Guards ). According to a further aspect of the invention, existing standards such as XPath or MathML are envisioned.","The syntax of the Action description may be modeled according to the syntax of the remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism of choice: This requires addressing the issue of adapting the Profile specification with the chosen mechanism (SOAP, XML RPC, etc.). However, in order to achieve independence from the RPC mechanism used and because some Target Services  may also be hosted on the same mobile terminal where the given PAE Core  is installed and operates, the present invention prescribes the use of a simple Profile specification language. This implies the use of a translator mechanism for mapping the respective Action description contained in the Binding specification to the actual remote procedure call mechanism in case the latter differs from the one whose syntax has been used for specifying the Profile .","For Target Services  which are installed on mobile terminals other than the one on which the above-described PAE Core  is installed and operates the description of their remotely controllable interface and the list of their published properties (also known as \u201cstate variables\u201d) are made available via Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) to the creator of a Binding  for selecting which Action  to specify and to the PAE Core  for invoking Actions  when applicable. The description of Target Services  installed on the same mobile terminal on which the PAE Core  is installed and operates should equivalently offer the same information. For this reason, the present invention abstracts the retrieval of this published information from distribution aspects.","Moreover, the invention allows the user to specify formal parameters in local and\/or remote procedure calls, but limited to the set of those parameters which are published as a part of the Target Services' interface description (that can be retrieved via SDP) and known at the time the Profiles  and Triggering Conditions  have been specified. This means that the PAE \u2032 automates only the execution of those Target Services  whose published contracts match the ones used in the Profile and Triggering Condition specifications.","For the sake of simplicity, the PAE Core  does not directly check error values of local and remote procedure calls. For more complex Profiles  featuring conditional branches and loops a scripting language is in fact required. To this extent, the PAE \u2032 uses a delegation model: Whenever a Profile  requires a complex logic to be specified, a specific Action  is correspondingly inserted into the Profile . This Action  invokes a local service which separately interprets the respective script (passed as a parameter of the given Action ) and invokes commands on local and remote Target Services  accordingly. The middleware entity dealing with such additional functionality is the Script Interpreter  depicted in .","Following the same delegation principle as described above, the PAE Core  can delegate any complex processing of the data carried in the received event notification messages to an external entity. The aforementioned Event Correlator functionality is another example application of this principle. According to one aspect of the present invention, this principle can be extended to more general computations by using the concept of a dynamically configurable context system as disclosed in EP 1 298 527 A1. Furthermore, the implementation of RPC mechanisms can totally be delegated to a single middleware entity instead of having the PAE Core  relying directly on an interface-specific support code (e.g. stubs). In this way, the Action specifications may be expressed in an abstract syntax which is not bound to the specific RPC mechanism of choice (e.g. SOAP, XML RPC, etc.).","In the following section, the PAE concept according to the present invention shall be illustrated by means of the UML use case diagram depicted in , which shows the actors (the General Application  and the General Service ) as well as the applied use cases (the manage profile , the activate profile manually , the activate profile automatically , the Register Profile and the DeRegister Profile , the Activate Profile and the DeActivate Profile ).","The \u201cGeneral Application\u201d actor  uses the interfaces of the PAE middleware entity \u2032 hosted by the respective mobile terminal .

Hence, the idea of automatically executing a specific system behavior (the Actions  of a Profile ) based on context information (the occurrence of specific events) is not new. Also, the idea of a Context Processing system , e.g. a general-purpose engine capable of identifying a specific context from various sensor data and eventually triggering specific behavior on applications and\/or other middle- or software entities, is not new.","However, the present invention discloses a specific CA application which targets wired and wireless ad-hoc networks for consumer electronics (CE) devices. Compared to conventional CA solutions according to the state of the art, the advantages of the invention can be summarized as follows:\n\n","The present invention differs from the ad-hoc computing manager concept described in EP 1 107 512 A1 insofar as the latter focuses on abstracting the mechanisms for discovering devices and services in an ad-hoc network and on the dynamic, automatic assembly of a composite remote user interface to capitalize the wealth of functionality which can be discovered at run time in an ad-hoc network. Thereby, EP 1 107 512 A1 does not take into account context awareness aspects which involve the automatic execution of Actions  on the discovered entities (devices and\/or services).","The present invention differs from the user profile data management system disclosed in EP 1 130 869 A1 insofar as the latter describes an architecture centered around the concept of a database which holds various versions of users' profiles in order to capture not only various users' preferences but also context data associated with said users for the sake of most appropriately forwarding instant messages to said users. However, EP 1 130 869 A1 does not consider the case of storing lists of Actions  in these user profiles to be automatically executed on dynamically discovered end systems. Notwithstanding, the present invention shares some of the concepts described in EP 1 130 869 A1, e.g. the easy extensibility and reuse of pre-existing Profiles . To this extent, the present invention uses composite design patterns as described in the book \u201cDesign Patterns\u2014Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software\u201d (in: Addison Wesley, Reading, Mass. (USA), 1994, ISBN 0-201-63361-2) by E. Gamma et al. for defining the Profile  (cf. ), which inherently leads to a tree structure, similar to the tree structure described in EP 1 130 869 A1. However, EP 1 130 869 A1 does not decouple the Profile data from the actual Triggering Condition  as disclosed in the present invention but embeds information about elemental Triggering Conditions  in a sort of tag associated with each Profile . As a consequence, EP 1 130 869 A1 uses those tags for navigating through the tree of Profiles  to select the ones to activate, thus computing event correlation dynamically based on the input information and the content and structure of the Profile data. By contrast, the present invention proposes that the Triggering Conditions  (which may eventually be defined recursively to increase extensibility and reusability) are defined as separate entities\u2014compared to the Profiles \u2014and fed to an Event Correlator  for monitoring the point in time when the evaluation of these conditions yields \u201cTRUE\u201d. To this extent, the present invention does not necessarily prescribe how the Event Correlator  should be implemented, but it uses the services offered by said Event Correlator  based on a specific, well-defined interface. Compared to EP 1130 869 A1, the decoupling of Profiles  from Triggering Conditions  and the recursive specification of both Profiles  and triggering Conditions  thus lead to a much more flexible architecture.","The present invention differs from the context-aware mobile portal concept described in EP 1 199 860 A1 insofar as the latter focuses on automatically adapting the services offered by a WWW portal to the context data of a user accessing said WWW portal. Thereby, said services are augmented with services dynamically discovered within the given user's context and accessed by the user via remote user interfaces, i.e. via interactions of the respective user. By contrast, the present invention automates the execution of actions on the dynamically discovered services on behalf of the respective user.","The present invention differs from the system for automatically creating context information for setting up a sensor configuration described in EP 1 298 527 A1 insofar as the latter focuses only on a framework for dynamically deploying various context information processing logics and does not provide means for an automatic execution of Actions  as proposed by the present invention. However, the present invention advantageously uses the concept disclosed in EP 1 298 527 A1 with respect to the Event Service and, more specifically, the Event Correlator functionality. Also, as already mentioned in the discussion about context awareness, a full-fledged Context Processing system  based on the concept disclosed in EP 1 298 527 A1 might be particularly advantageous, especially with respect to the preprocessing of data carried in the event notification messages, before those events are fed to the PAE Core . In this way, the Triggering Condition and Profile Specifications are able to directly handle refined data without needing operations for obtaining such refined data from the plain content of event notification messages.","In the following section, an example for an application and a service using the PAE functionality according to the present invention is given as well as an example of a possible declarative language, which can be used to allow users and applications to register a Binding  with the aid of the PAE Core . In this example, which should be deemed as purely qualitative without making pretence to formal correctness, the aforementioned application is a wrapper around an automatic photo synchronization service that spawns and registers said service as a target of specific Actions  with the aid of the PAE Core . The Triggering Conditions  thereby consist in detecting the presence of a mobile ad-hoc network and of an Image Management System (IMS) within the given mobile ad-hoc network. Wherever applicable, the application may add to this Triggering Condition  any actual values specifying which specific IMS and\/or which specific mobile ad-hoc network identifier the automatic photo synchronization service shall be triggered upon.","As a simple and quite general solution, such a Triggering Condition  can be expressed as follows. For the sake of simplicity, the ABNF syntax of a draft grammar is used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0131"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"trigger := triggerType [\u201cAND\u201d | \u201cOR\u201d | \u201cXOR\u201d [\u201cNOT\u201d] trigger]"},{"entry":"triggerType := (\u201cdetectNetwork\u201d | \u201cdetectDevice\u201d | \u201cdetectService\u201d)"},{"entry":"triggerValue := network-ID | device-ID | (serviceCategory"},{"entry":"[\u2032serviceName])"},{"entry":"network-ID := schema as defined by the network protocol layer"},{"entry":"device-ID := schema as defined by the data link protocol layer"},{"entry":"serviceCategory := schema as defined by the SDP"},{"entry":"serviceName := arbitrary alphanumeric string"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Finally, the application completes the registration by indicating which kind of Actions  shall be applied when detecting the presence of the IMS. The trigger type and trigger value can then be mapped to an event type and event instance value.","As a simple and quite general solution, a possible guard condition applicable to all types of triggers mentioned above could be named \u201cresult\u201d and carry the event subtype (and eventually the event instance value), which would then take the following values:\n\n","As an example, the automatic photo synchronization application could create and register the following Binding , which is described as a pseudo XML document snippet depicted in ).","The root of the XML document is the Binding  being specified, which\u2014according to the data model depicted in FIG. \u2014includes\n\n","Finally, one may want to allow the PAE to indicate to the automatic photo synchronization service which IMS was actually discovered.
