{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to equipment for neutralizing, and in particular to a stand-off disrupter apparatus for neutralizing improvised explosive devices.","2. Prior Art","Properly trained and equipped Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians provide the best resource for responding to and neutralizing potential improvised explosive device (IED) threats. Under certain circumstances the availability of EOD forces is extremely limited. Under these conditions the options available to operational commanders, without EOD support, are limited to either 1) mark and by-pass the threat, 2) disrupt with direct fire from a safe distance, or 3) cordon off the area and wait for EOD support. Marking and bypassing the threat (due to urgent operational commitments) leaves the threat for follow-on use or a hazard to others. The use of standard issue weapons to effect direct fire disruption to neutralize improvised explosive device increases the probability of a high order detonation and increases the risk of a severe down range collateral hazard. Finally, establishing a security cordon and waiting for EOD support leaves a static target that potentially is an enemy opportunity target, for instance, by direct action, ambush, indirect fire, and the like.","An additional capability for commanders faced with the unavailability of EOD support to neutralize improvised explosive devices would be useful.","The invention provides for an apparatus for neutralizing improvised explosive devices, where an improvised explosive device includes car bombs, truck bombs, mines, suicide bombers with attached or detached explosives, caches of munitions, and the like. The apparatus provides a stand-off disrupter which facilitates safer separation while neutralizing the improvised explosive devices. Hand held firearms used to disrupt or neutralize improvised explosive devices are inefficient because at a safe distance a bullet impacts only a relatively small area, a shotgun shell shot has a scatter pattern that is too dispersed at safe distances, and a more effective tactic is to attack using a medium that neutralizes the timing power unit or another electrical component of the detonator.","The invented stand-off disrupter apparatus includes a delivery vessel with an adaptation for an extrinsic propulsion system, where the delivery vessel has an elongate cylindrical portion and an enlarged rounded front end with an apex. The enlarged rounded front end can be substantially ellipsoidal. A rearward sub-portion of the delivery vessel has an axial shroud which provides the adaptation suitable as the extrinsic propulsion system. The apparatus typically includes aerodynamic components that stabilize flight. The delivery vessel may also have a sighting system for aiming the apparatus. The delivery vessel, in one variation, houses a shotgun shell, which is mounted rearward and substantially coextensive with a substantially frustoconical bore that opens outward toward the enlarged rounded front end. The frustoconical bore provides a channeled pressure focal cone for the contents of the shell. The elongate cylindrical section of the delivery vessel houses a firing pin system rearward of the shotgun shell. The firing pin system detonates the shotgun shell when the apparatus impacts a surface. A layer of disruption medium, sealed in a dish, is proximate to a forward end of the bore, and set-back from the apex. The disruption medium is energized by the impact and shot emitted from the shell upon detonation. The energized disruption medium suitably neutralizes improvised explosive devices typically by disrupting the detonation component of the IED, albeit sympathetic explosions can also be effected.","The disruption medium is typically composed of water, water-based materials or water-based slurries. The invention provides improved frontal and overhead protection against blast and fragmentation in the event of a high order detonation, and the apparatus itself does not generate lethal fragments.","The stand-off disrupter apparatus provides separation. The separation is not to be confused with the \u201csafe separation distance\u201d, which is outside the blast or fragmentation range. Examples of extrinsic propulsion systems include cranes, planes, helicopters, drones, helicopters, robotic devices, firearms and rockets.","An aspect of the invention is that the stand-off disrupter apparatus can be fitted onto a barrel of a firearm, such as a shotgun, where the firearm serves as the extrinsic propulsion system. The extrinsic propulsion system is actuated when the firearm is discharged, emitting a projectile. The extrinsic propulsion system propels the stand-off disrupter apparatus. The axial shroud typically includes a bullet trap to catch the projectile(s). An example of a suitable projectile is pellets or shot. The firearm and ammunition are selected to match the characteristics of the stand-off disrupter apparatus. An example of a suitable hand carried firearm is a 12 gauge shotgun, and suitable ammunition is a shotgun shell loaded with buckshot (i.e. 000 shot).","The invention provides for an apparatus  for neutralizing improvised explosive devices, where an improvised explosive device includes car bombs, truck bombs, mines, suicide bombers with attached or detached explosives, caches of munitions, and the like. The apparatus  provides a stand-off disrupter which facilitates safer separation while neutralizing improvised explosive devices.","The apparatus produces an energized disruption medium upon impact, which neutralizes improvised explosive devices.","Referring to , the stand-off disrupter apparatus has an adaptation for an extrinsic propulsion system, where the apparatus  includes a delivery vessel which houses the disruption medium and some of the elements for energizing the disruption medium at impact. The extrinsic propulsion system is defined as a system where the energy to move the apparatus to the target is provided by an external propulsion system. For instance, a trailer is propelled by a tractor pulling the trailer. The tractor is the external propulsion system. Alternatively described, the tractor is an example of an intrinsic propulsion system, as the tractor can propel itself, and it has an internal propulsion system.","The delivery vessel  includes an elongate cylindrical section , an enlarged rounded front end  that is substantially ellipsoidal in shape, an axial shroud  continuous with the rear end, and aerodynamic fins  that stabilize flight.","In the illustrated example there are three fins, but there could be more or less, and the fins can be trimmed to induce rotation. Also illustrated is a sighting system  for aiming the apparatus. The illustrated system has a \u201cblade\u201d type front sight , and an aperture style rear sight , such as a \u201cGhost Ring\u201d, \u201cnotch\u201d, \u201cV\u201d sight and the like. Other sighting systems, such as laser sights and optical sights may be employed.","Referring to , which is an end-on rear view of the stand-off disrupter apparatus illustrated in , the elongate cylindrical section  and the enlarged rounded ellipsoidal front end  are coaxial and symmetrical. The fins  extend from the elongate cylindrical section . The center of the elongate cylindrical section  is hollow, such that a portion of the elongate cylindrical section  forms the axial shroud , which is the adaptation for fitting to the extrinsic propulsion system. The illustrated shroud has a small groove  cut axially down the top of the axial shroud  to receive the front sight  (see ) on the barrel of a shotgun. The axial shroud  has a diameter  that is sized so that it can readily accommodate the barrel of the shotgun. In one example, the shotgun is 12 gauge having a single barrel. In another example the shotgun is 10 gauge. A 12-gauge shotgun nominally has an inside diameter of 18.5 mm (0.729 inches). That diameter can range from a tight 18.3 mm to an extreme overbore of 20.3 mm, so the inside diameter  of the axial shroud  is properly sized for the outside diameter of the gun barrel before fitting the stand-off disrupter apparatus onto the gun. In this embodiment the rear sight is illustrated as being substantially integral to the top fin.","Referring to , which is an end-on front view of the stand-off disrupter apparatus illustrated in , the apex  of ellipsoidal front end  is approximately the cross-sectional center of the ellipsoidal front end . The front sight is shown superimposed in front of the top fin. Other embodiments are anticipated to be a variation of the disclosed instant invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["18","30"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 4 and 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["30","18","14","30","14","14"]},"Referring to , which are cutaway side views of the stand-off disrupter apparatus, the muzzle of the shotgun barrel  is adjacent to an internal bullet trap  in the axial shroud . In the illustrated embodiment the bullet trap  is typically at least one layer of a resilient rubber  laminated to a metal (i.e. steel) plate . Other combinations of materials are also anticipated. The internal bullet trap  traps most of the gun shot  discharged from the shotgun barrel . The momentum of the gun shot  and the energy of the gasses discharged from the shotgun serve to provide the stand-off disrupter apparatus  with an extrinsic propulsion system, capable of propelling the invention tens to hundreds of meters to the target. Forward of the bullet trap  is a firing pin system  which is actuated when the apparatus impacts a surface. As illustrated, a spring  restrains the firing pin . Forward of the firing pin system  is a shotgun shell  secured in shell chamber . When the apparatus  impacts a surface, such as an IED structure, the momentum of the firing pin  overcomes the restraining force of spring  and firing pin  strikes the percussion cap  initiating the primer, which in turn causes the shell  to fire. Shot  emerges from the cartridge in a spread pattern. The spreading can be augmented by selecting a shell with spreader wads. The illustrated embodiment includes a substantially frustoconical bore  that opens outward in the substantially ellipsoidal front end . The frustoconical bore provides a channeled pressure focal cone for the contents the shot ) of the shell. A layer of disruption medium , sealed in a dish , is proximate to a forward end of the bore , and set-back  from the apex  of the ellipsoidal front end . The disruption medium  will be highly energized by the shot  emitted from the shell.","The disruption medium  is selected from the group consisting of water, water based materials, and water based slurries. The disruption medium  can contain abrasives, which serve to abrade away protective surfaces on wires, explosives, batteries, and electrical components, such as timers. In the illustrated embodiment the layer of disruption medium  is set-back  from the apex  of ellipsoidal front end . The set-back causes some of the force of impact to be transmitted to the disruption medium , therein elevating the level of energization of the disruption medium  (i.e. higher temperature, change of state to a gas), so that it essentially explodes on impact.","As illustrated in , which is a cutaway side view of the stand-off disrupter apparatus  illustrated in  at the instant of impact, the firing pin  has detonated the chambered shotgun shell , causing the shot  from the shell to be blown through the expanded bore  into the layer of disruption medium . The ellipsoidal front end  is being crushed, transmitting some of the force of impact unto the disruption medium , as illustrated by the arrows. In this idealized depiction the disruption medium , which is sealed in a dish , has not broken apart.  is meant only to show some of the steps at impact. In reality, at impact the disruption medium  may have already smashed into the enlarged rounded ellipsoidal front end , and the shot could be scattered throughout. The dish  is typically not designed to withstand impact, and the disruption medium  will not stop all the shot .","In one variation the stand-off disrupter apparatus utilizes a 12 gauge shell. Other larger shells, for example 2-10 gauge shells, and smaller shells can be employed, as well as shaped charges in general. The stand-off disrupter apparatus would be appropriately sized to sufficiently energize the disruption medium. The extrinsic propulsion system can be selected from a variety of propulsion systems, including shotguns, such as 12 gauge shotgun, and less common guns, such as 2-20 gauge guns. The total level of energization of the disruption medium  is a function of both the extrinsic propulsion system and the shell carried by the stand-off disrupter apparatus. A 12 gauge shotgun can potentially accurately deploy the apparatus approximately about 50 ft (\u02dc15 meters) to about 300 ft (\u2212100 meters).","The apparatus can be used in combination with other devices, such as thermite and nanothermite based devices, which are employed to remove protective coverings without igniting an enclosed explosive.","Advantages of the disclosed invention include the following: It is light weight; it provides operational commanders with an effective disruption capability; it enables a safer stand-off distance for better frontal and overhead protection; its design utilizes standard issue ammunition, materials, and equipment to minimize cost and logistic support requirements; there is less collateral (down range or direct area) damage and fragmentation hazard (notwithstanding the effects of a possible sympathetic detonation); when unloaded it poses no storage or explosive hazard in high electromagnetic environments; and it poses no electromagnetic hazard.","Finally, any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations (for example, by using the term \u201cabout\u201d) that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.","It is to be understood that the foregoing description and specific embodiments are merely illustrative of the best mode of the invention and the principles thereof, and that various modifications and additions may be made to the invention by those skilled in the art, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention, which is therefore understood to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing invention will become readily apparent by referring to the following detailed description and the appended drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
