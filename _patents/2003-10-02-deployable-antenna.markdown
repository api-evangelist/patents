{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","Origin of the Apparatus","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The methods described herein were made by employee(s) under contract with the United States Government and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","There exists a need for a deployable antenna for various applications. Considerations include weight, portability, stowage, cost, and ease of manufacturing. Ideally, such an antenna would have a simple structure, be easy to deploy for use, and be easy to collapse into a compact configuration for storage. Example applications for use include military operations, remote industrial operations, surveillance, scientific outposts, and general remote outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, fishing, and mountain climbing. A specific example of an application is the use of a stowable and deployable antenna in combination with a wireless communications system such as a cellular telephone or a cellular modem. As the use and popularity of wireless communication systems combined with the popularity of remote outdoor activities increases, the need for stowable and deployable antennas will also increase.","Mobile communication systems, for example cellular, personal communication systems, and wireless Ethernet provide wireless communications between a base station and at least one portable subscriber unit. Each mobile subscriber unit contains an antenna apparatus for the reception of the forward link signals and for the transmission of the reverse or return link signals. A typical mobile subscriber unit is a digital cellular telephone handset or a personal computer coupled to a wireless network. In urban areas, there usually exists a base station within the range of a mobile subscriber unit's built-in or stock antenna. However, in remote areas, the availability of such a base station within the range of a mobile subscriber unit's built-in or stock antenna may not exist.","In general, the performance of an antenna depends upon its configuration or shape as well as its size. Wireless communications devices are limited in their antenna performance due to a built-in or stock, omnidirectional antenna design. Therefore, increasing the performance of the built-in antenna for remote operations may increase the likelihood of communication between a mobile subscriber unit and a base station. As an example, it is well known in the field that increasing the antenna gain in a wireless communication system typically has beneficial effects on system performance.","The present invention seeks to provide an antenna that overcomes or reduces the aforementioned problems and takes into account the aforementioned considerations.","Description","The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","The word \u201cabout\u201d as used herein may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. For example, a quantitative temperature as disclosed herein may permissibly be different than the precise value if the basic function to which the temperature is related does not change. The word \u201cgenerally\u201d as used herein is used to indicate acceptable variance in a physical configuration so long as the variance doesn't change the basic function to which it is related. The word \u201cradiate\u201d or any form thereof for the purposes herein is defined as either transmitting electromagnetic waves, receiving electromagnetic waves, or both. The word \u201cmembrane\u201d for the purposes herein is synonymous with the term \u201ccollapsible membrane.\u201d The word \u201cslot\u201d for the purposes herein is defined as an opening of rectilinear, ellipsoidal, asymmetric, or arbitrary shape, which defines a nonconductive region contained in a conductive surface. The word \u201cring\u201d for the purposes herein is defined as an object of rectilinear, ellipsoidal, asymmetric, or arbitrary shape with a vacant center. The phrase \u201cradiating element\u201d as used herein is defined as a basic subdivision of an antenna that in itself is capable of radiating, although it does not necessarily imply the smallest such subdivision. A radiating element may be a radiating slot. The phrase \u201ccavity antenna element\u201d as used herein is defined as a radiating element that has a ground plane. The ground plane may be abbreviated so that it is not shared with other radiating elements, or it may be extended and shared with at least one radiating element either locally truncated or globally truncated. Examples of cavity antenna elements include, but are not restricted to the following: resonant antennas such as microstrip patch antennas, planar inverted-F antennas (PIFA), and cavity-backed slots, as well as certain traveling wave antennas such as cavity-backed spirals. The cavity antenna element comprises a ground plane boundary component and one or more of the following: at least one top boundary component and at least one side boundary component. The phrase \u201ccurrent antenna element\u201d as used herein is defined as the set of radiating elements, which do not have or require a ground plane. Examples of current antenna elements include, but are not restricted to the following: conductive loops, dipoles, bow-tie dipoles, slots, annular slots, and spirals. The phrase \u201cboundary component\u201d used in the context of a current antenna element is defined as the conductive pattern used to establish the functionality of that current antenna element. In a general context, the phrase \u201cboundary component\u201d is defined as a conductive pattern for either the cavity or current antenna elements to establish desired functionality over a predetermined band of operating frequencies. As an example, for resonant radiating elements (which may be of either cavity or current antenna types), the boundary component establishes resonances of the electric or magnetic (equivalent) currents or of the electric or magnetic fields at one or more predetermined operating frequencies. For the traveling wave type radiating elements, (which may be of either cavity or current antenna types), the at least one boundary component establish at least one guided wave that radiate in a predetermined manner as they travel away from the at least one feed point. The log-periodic and Archimedean spirals are examples of traveling wave antennas that are well documented in the literature. Furthermore, the phrase \u201cparasitic element\u201d as used herein is defined as a component of an antenna that is coupled electromagnetically; i.e, coupling to it is achieved without direct electrical connectivity. Since coupling occurs without direct electrical connectivity, at least one other component, in addition to the parasitic element, is required to form a complete radiating element. An example of an antenna with at least one driven element and at least one parasitic element is the Yagi-Uda antenna. Here, the phrase \u201cdriven element\u201d is defined as a radiating element with electrical connectivity that may include a transmission line. It should be observed that the driven element individually may be referred to as a radiating element, and the collection, or set, of driven and parasitic elements may be referred to collectively as a single \u201cradiating element.\u201d In addition to being employed to guide a traveling wave, parasitic elements may be used to implement amplitude taper in an array antenna. This may serve to provide reduced sidelobe levels as is well known to those experienced in the art. The term \u201carray\u201d or \u201carray antenna\u201d as used herein is defined to encompass a collection of at least one radiating element or subarray and may further comprise at least one parasitic element. The term \u201csubarray\u201d as used herein is defined as a smaller array which may be duplicated one or more times to form a larger array.","Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to , there is shown a generally planar cavity antenna element  used in microstrip or patch antennas as are commonly known in the art. Microstrip or patch antennas are relatively flat and smooth and may be adapted for mounting on various surfaces without significantly increasing the overall profile. The cavity antenna element  as shown has a rectilinear shape and a microstrip feed network  through which signals are coupled from a node or port  to a top boundary component  of a cavity antenna element. The shape of the top boundary component may also be ellipsoidal, arbitrary, or asymmetric. The feed network  and top boundary component  are electrically connected to each other and printed on a dielectric substrate  through conventional printed circuit techniques known in the art. With continued reference to  and reference to , the dielectric substrate  serves to separate the top boundary component  and feed network  from a ground plane boundary component . Notches are illustrated in  as part of the top boundary component  as an example of one embodiment for the top boundary component . However, all known conventional shapes and designs for top boundary components may be utilized.  also illustrates the low profile and flexibility of the cavity antenna element . Another embodiment of a cavity antenna element incorporated into an antenna  is illustrated in . In this embodiment, a top boundary component  is formed of a conductive fabric. Further, a strip feed probe  and ground plane boundary component  are also formed of a conductive fabric. The strip feed probe  is electrically connected to the top boundary component .

A dielectric substrate  separates the top boundary component  from the ground plane boundary component . An outer conductor  concentrically surrounds the strip feed probe  and is electrically connected to the ground plane boundary component . The outer conductor  serves as a ground line. Both the outer conductor  and strip feed probe  may be connected to an antenna interface adapter (not shown), which is discussed later.  illustrates, as an example, a perspective view of an embodiment of a collapsible membrane  and a deployable cavity antenna element that incorporates a top boundary component . In this embodiment, the top boundary component  is attached to a collapsible membrane  formed of a nonconductive fabric . Further, in this embodiment, a collapsible ground plane boundary component  is illustrated wherein the ground plane boundary component  is formed of a conductive fabric . A single layer or multiple layers of conductive fabric for the deployable ground plane boundary component  may be employed. In addition, in this embodiment, fasteners, which are comprised of spacers , grommets , and caps  are used to attach the deployable ground plane component  to the collapsible membrane .","As stated above, multiple embodiments exist for the boundary components of both cavity and current antenna elements.

In a second embodiment, the boundary components may be formed from conductive fabrics. In additional embodiments, some boundary components are formed from a conductive metal or alloy, while others are formed from conductive fabrics.

In this form, the current element is indistinguishable from the cavity element of . The input impedance of the current element is little affected by the reflector when the latter is placed at this particular distance. The radiation pattern, however, is more concentrated in one hemisphere compared to the current element without the reflector. A reflector as used herein is defined as a conductive surface, which is generally parallel to each radiating element, array antenna, or subarray and spaced at a predetermined distance from each radiating element, array antenna, or subarray. Multiple predetermined distances exist.
