title: Nonparametric method for detection and identification of regions of concern in multidimensional intensity images
abstract: A method for detection and identification of regions of concern in multidimensional intensity images using a template and a nonparametric test is presented. Data corresponding to background intensity is extracted from the outer region of the template while data for mass detection is extracted from the inner region. The statistical nature of the background intensity, specifically the tail structure of the unknown distribution, is estimated via tolerance intervals. Mass detection is based on the fraction of test data within the tail structure.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/484,574, filed Jul. 2, 2003 and which is entitled NONPARAMETRIC METHOD FOR DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION OF REGIONS OF CONCERN IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL INTENSITY IMAGES by Fyzodeen Khan and Ashwin Sarma.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a method for identifying regions in any intensity image (such as a mammogram) that correspond to an approximately known shape in which the regions stand out with a higher intensity with respect to a local background. The size of the region need only be known to within a range.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","It is known in the art that false negatives, those cancers missed during reading, can be attributed to the necessity of viewing large numbers of mammograms, the complex structure of the breast, the subtle nature of certain mammographic characteristics of breast cancer and fatigue or distraction. Some studies have indicated a potential increase of 4 to 15% in the number of breast cancers detected using a double reading of screening mammograms. Computer-aided detection is not intended to replace the medical judgment of a radiologist but has the potential to help the radiologist with a consistent, high level of attention in all cases (See J. Roehrig, and R. A. Castellino, \u201cThe Promise of Computer Aided Detection in Digital Mammography\u201d European Journal of Radiology, 31, pp 35-39; 1999 and L. J. W. Burhenne et al., \u201cPotential Contribution of Computer-Aided Detection to the Sensitivity of Screening Mammography\u201d Radiology, 215(2), pp. 554-562, May 2000).","Computer-aided methods for detection of breast cancer often rely on artificial neural networks or ANNs (See I. Christoyianni, E. Dermatas, G. Kokkinakis, \u201cFast Detection of Masses in Computer-Aided Mammography,\u201d IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 17, pp 54-64, January 2000 and S. C. B Lo, H. Li, Y. Wang, L. Kinnard, M. T. Freedman, \u201cA Multiple Circular Path Convolution Neural Network for Detection of Mammographic Masses,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 21 (2), pp 150-158, February 2002; both incorporated herein by reference) These computer-aided methods require data for training in which the data must statistically match the actual mammogram data on which the computer-aided method is to be applied.","Artificial neural networks also involve nonlinear optimization, a computationally intensive procedure that does not guarantee achieving the best solution. Artificial neural networks thus utilize no statistical modeling and thus are capable of \u201covertraining\u201d, i.e. achieving near perfect performance on the training set but poor generalization performance on the actual data to be tested. This overtraining cannot be controlled.","In Heine et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,310,967), there is disclosed a method for identifying calcifications in mammograms. The method uses wavelet decomposition to determine multi-resolution information by applying parametric or nonparametric (kernel based) statistical modeling to the wavelet decomposed from a training set. The models are then used to empirically determine thresholds for detection; however, identifying calcifications in a mammogram (a pre-cancerous condition) is a different type of detected abnormality than a mass (a cluster of cancer cells that keeps growing) in a mammogram.","In Lee et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,427), there is provided a method to estimate the trabecular index and bone mineral density. The focus of this deterministic method is on an estimation of a quantity rather than a region of concern.","In Seeger et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,577,762), there is provided a method to generate a background image of a pixmap image, which can then be used for additional image processing on the pixmap, such as identification of an image foreground. The determination of the background pixels in an image immediately determines the foreground pixels. The method uses empirical rules to determine the thresholds necessary for determining the background with the threshold surface a linear function of estimated background variances. The method does not directly account for the statistical nature of the background, specifically in distribution.","In Shiratani (U.S. Pat. No. 6,608,929), there is an apparatus for segmenting an image into plural regions according to feature (color) quantities of pixels. Use of image segmentation is different from detection of regions of interest from a background. For example, the regions of interest in mammograms are not homogeneous in intensity. Image segmentation algorithms are designed to segment such a region, not to identify it as a region of interest.","In view of the above, there is a need for a method to detect masses (potentially cancerous regions) in two-dimensional mammograms as abnormalities. The structure of the method can also be used to identify calcifications in mammograms. Specifically, the apriori choices of template sizes and shapes would decompose the image into regions of interest at various scales without the direct use of training sets. Nonparametric tolerance intervals would allow thresholds to be determined based on the current data in an image with the thresholds determined as a stochastic method by accounting for the statistical variability in the original space of pixel intensities, as opposed to wavelet transformed space.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a method to identify regions of interest in any intensity image that correspond to an approximately known specific shape and stand out by higher intensity with respect to a local background in which the size of the region need only be known to within a range.","It is a further purpose of the present invention to provide a method for detecting potentially cancerous regions in mammograms.","To attain the objects described, there is provided a method to locally model image intensity variations statistically using distribution free (DF) methods. DF methods are chosen since image intensity levels vary in an unpredictable manner. Also, DF methods are useful when no reliable information is available about the underlying probability density function (pdf). DF methods based on nonparametric tolerance intervals have been developed as originally applied to inspection and quality control, and prediction of production processes (See S. S. Wilks, \u201cDetermination of Sample Sizes for Setting Tolerance Limits,\u201d The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 12, pp 91-96, 1941; S. S.

Tukey \u201cNon-Parametric Estimation I Validation of Order Statistics,\u201d The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 16, pp 187-192, 1945; all incorporated herein by reference)","Tolerance intervals have been applied in different areas from analysis of classification schemes (See R. L. Streit and T. E. Luginbuhl, \u201cMaximum Likelihood Training of Probabilistic Neural Networks,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5(5), pp 764-783, September 1994; incorporated herein by reference) and detection schemes (See E.

Tufts, \u201cComparison of Two Methods for Multispectral 3-D Detection of Single Pixel Features in Strong Textured Clutter,\u201d IEEE IMDSP' 98 3-D Image Processing Conference, Alpach, Austria Jul. 12-17, 1998; incorporated herein by reference) to constant false alarm rate detection (See E.

Sarma and D. W. Tufts, \u201cRobust Adaptive Threshold for Control of False Alarms, 8(9), pp. 261-263, September 2001; both incorporated herein by reference).","The method of the present invention utilizes a multi-resolution algorithm in which the template size defines the size of objects to identify within the image and the number of templates gives the number of different resolutions (sizes) that can be identified. For a given template, an inner and outer region is included in which a set of data points are assigned to each region. For each of the templates, the template tessellates an image in alternate two-dimensional directions.","Threshold estimation (computed on the basis of outer region data points) is done locally within the image using the statistical technique of nonparametric tolerance intervals. A normalized threshold crossing rate based on data points of the inner region is used in a rank order detector.","A centroid of threshold crossings of the data points of the inner region is computed in relation to the estimated threshold such that false negatives and false positives of the threshold crossing rates are determined.","The threshold-crossing rates are ranked in ascending order such that each rank represents a region, ensuring the centroids correspond to the sorted crossing rates. These regions are agglomerated to form regions of concern. The data is then displayed to the user. The number of regions of concern that may be displayed to a user or output to subsequent processing is under user control.","For the method, a description is given for two-dimensional data but the method can be extendable to more than two dimensions. The user-provided algorithm parameters which define templates and the associated parameters for processing in the steps of the method are:\n\n","In the method, the provided data is processed using the Ntemplates. For two-dimensional data, skip Sand Sdata points in each direction. All points in the data can be processed in which case the number of data points skipped is zero.","Data is processed by first specifying the shape and size of the Ntemplates. At each data point to be processed, compute a threshold for each template, compute the normalized threshold-crossing rate for each template, compute the centroid of the threshold crossings for each template, rank order and cluster (agglomerate). These computations as described in detail below may be accomplished by computer programs known in the art.","A first example is described for digitized film-screen mammograms or digitized mammograms. Abnormal tissue regions, typical of abnormal tissue regions in digitized film-screen mammograms or digitized mammograms are viewed as having higher intensity levels than the surrounding normal tissue. The abnormal tissue regions are considered as coming from the alternative hypothesis H. Normal tissue is considered as belonging to the null hypothesis H.","Referring to  and successive figures where like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that the figure depicts a template  for the method with an arbitrary shape of an outer region  and an inner region . Templates can have geometrical shapes such as circles (See the second example below as described in conjunction with ) or the templates can also have a shape matched to a specific morphology such as finding abnormal regions within mammograms.","As noted above, the template  includes two disjoint regions, the outer region (OR)  (so identified for the purpose of the algorithms used with Ndata points) and the inner region (IR)  (so identified for the purpose of the algorithms used with Ndata points). Data within the outer region  serves as local background coming from the null hypothesis HO whereas data within the inner region  serves as test data coming from the alternative H.","The outer region  is designed to have a minimum of Ndata points for each of the Ndifferent templates (the number of data points Nin the outer region is a design parameter set by the user to provide enough accuracy in the estimate of the threshold. This number directly affects the estimation of the threshold, since the threshold is a function of Nas seen in the equations below). The inner region  has Ndata points for each of the Ndifferent templates. Thus for the Ntemplates there are Npairs (N, N).","Referring now to , for each of the specified templates, process the digitized image in the x-y directions skipping Sand Sdata points in each direction respectively. The figure depicts how the template  may tessellate an image. At each new location with the image, compute a threshold, normalized crossing rate and centroid of all threshold crossings within the inner region .","In the step of threshold estimation, data coming from a tail (of the probability density function, pdf, which describes the background statistics at each location in the image) forms a one-sided interval in which the left endpoint of the interval acts as a threshold. The algorithm tracks variations in data statistically using Tolerance Intervals (TI). The template  conforming to a desired shape containing two disjoint regions is used and tessellates the image, skipping data points in each direction, as described above. At each location, the variation in the data is estimated. Statistical variation of the local background data is characterized by estimating the tail of the unknown local pdf. A threshold is then computed as follows:","Let X={X, X, . . . , X} represent the data points that are in the outer region  of the template  at some location (x, y) in the image. Denote the qorder statistic as Xwhere {X, X, . . . , X} is the data set, sorted in ascending order.","A one-sided interval based on the order statistic Xis constructed such that there is 100\u03b1% confidence that the probability mass within the interval is \u2266pfa.

Highly ranked crossing rates that are located within same regions within the image are agglomerated using a decision rule.

At the highest rank, if any of the other \u03c4\u22121 centroids are within the Euclidian distance d\u2266dof the centroid of the highest ranked, the centroids are labeled as belonging to the same region, the one with the highest rank (Distance is measured between the centroids of the regions). The highest ranked region and its centroid is kept and the others (within d) are pruned or removed. This procedure is repeated for the remaining ranks. At the end of this procedure, the agglomerated ranks identify a set of regions, each separated by a distance d.","The agglomerated regions are displayed to a user as the inner region of the corresponding templates of the agglomerated set.

For this default set, the templates are circles, both the inner region and the outer region; however, the templates employed are up to the user.\n\n","A user may have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) where the above parameters are at the discretion of the user.

At each location (m, n) within the image, a circular template  of  is centered with an inner disk or region  and outer ring or region  of the second illustrative example. Pixels within the outer ring  are used to form a detection threshold. Pixels within the inner disk  are tested to determine if the pixels cross the threshold.

Sensitivity S and FPR are the averages of the TP and FP (respectively) over all images and are combined to form Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. One conventionally used performance measure based on the ROC curve is A. It is the area under the ROC curve.","Images from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database are used in the analysis (See J. Suckling, \u201cThe Mammographic Image Analysis Society Digital Mammogram Database,\u201d Excerpta Medica, Intl Congress Series, 1069, pp 375-378, 1994; incorporated herein by reference) Each image is 1024\u00d71024 pixels with a 0.2 mm pixel edge. The database contains six different types of abnormalities: circumscribed masses, speculated, miscellaneous ill-defined, asymmetric, architectural distortions, and calcifications. The background type is either fatty (F), fatty-glandular (G) or dense glandular (D). The database also contains the mass severity (malignant or benign), location and size.","Since an objective is to determine how well the detector performs on a variety of small abnormalities, it has been shown that matching scale (mass radius) to the template radius gives the best ROC performance (See G. M. teBrake and N. Karssemeijer, \u201cSingle and Multiscale Detection of Masses in Digital Mammograms,\u201d IEEE Trans. Medical Imaging, 18 (7), pp 628-639, July 1999; incorporated herein by reference). The matching criteria of the reference was R=1.3 Rwhere Ris the mass radius. The matching criteria for this example are R\u03b5{R\u03b50.4, R+0.4}. All radii are in millimeters (mm).","The results of the matched scale are presented with detection parameters for a design pfa=0.2, N=1000 and confidence \u03b1=0.99. The number of highest ranked crossing rates is \u03c4=10. Having a low design pfa results in a high threshold. If a mass signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is small, low pfa (large \u03c4) can lead to a missed detection. To reduce the possible number of missed detections, the design pfa is set relatively high. The large number of pixels in the outer ring  leads to an accurate estimate of the threshold. The choice of \u03c4can result in a worst case FPR of 10, a result too high. However, regions with high relative intensities would tend to produce high crossing rates in a localized area, and thus should have a high rank thereby leading to a lower FAR.","In further support of the example above, thirty images containing thirty one lesions from the data base are detailed below (See Fyzodeen Khan, Ashwin Sarma, Ying Sun and Donald Tufts \u201cMass Detection Using Tolerance Intervals and a Rank Detector\u201d pp 185-187; incorporated herein by reference).","The mammograms used contain the smallest lesions in MIAS, with the largest having radius 8 mm and smallest radius 3 mm. Images without calcifications were used. The mammograms contained benign and malignant masses in different backgrounds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"sub":"d"},"The following, Table 1 indicates the minimum, maximum and average rank of the \u03c4largest ranks for the different template radii and background tissue type. Also shown are FPR and area A. The sensitivity is S=1 for each case with the largest FPR=2.5 and lowest FPR=0.33. For R=3 mm, there was only one image in the database so no ROC curve can be computed. FPR=4 and S=1 for this case. At the design pfa, masses in a dense background were the most difficult to detect with a measured FPR of 2.3 per image. Over all radii, the minimum rank of the \u03c4=10 ranks is 7 with maximum rank 1, indicating that for the images analyzed, the highest ranked pixel crossing rate M was located within the mass.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0093"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Case","Max","Min","Avg","FPR","A"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["4","mm","1","5","2.5","1.50","0.88"]},{"entry":["5","mm","1","7","4.0","2.50","0.66"]},{"entry":["6","mm","1","4","1.8","1.17","0.93"]},{"entry":["7","mm","1","3","1.3","0.33","0.99"]},{"entry":["8","mm","1","5","2.7","1.50","0.80"]},{"entry":["F",{},"1","5","2.1","1.20","0.92"]},{"entry":["D",{},"1","7","3.5","2.30","0.74"]},{"entry":["G",{},"1","3","1.3","0.67","0.98"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["100","110","120","130","130","130"]},"A multiscale detector based on template matching and tolerance intervals was implemented and analyzed using a set comprising mammograms with lesions less than 8 mm radius. The lesions had different morphological characteristics in different types of background tissue types. The detector results are presented for the matched single scale only. The detector achieves S=1 in all cases. The FPR at each scale was less than 3 for all cases evaluated when choosing a maximum of \u03c4=10 ranks. The average False Positive Rate, , over all radii, is 1.4 per image and average rank is 2.46. That is, the detected region containing the abnormal mass was ranked within the top three of the \u03c4=10 ranks. The average area, over all radii, under the ROC curve is =0.85.","ROC curves, conditioned on R, to determine performance in different background tissue types show that worst case performance occurs for lesions in dense backgrounds. Worst case FPR was 2.3 per image with S=1 for dense mammograms. It must be noted that only a detector is implemented. Improved performance may also be achieved by processing all pixels instead of tessellating at R\/4 since this may increase the rank of the number of threshold crossing M corresponding to the lesion without necessarily increasing the FPR.","Choice of \u03c4was done by arguing that high intensity regions should yield threshold crossing rates that are large enough to be within the top ten ranks. Design of this threshold can also be accomplished through more rigorous means using, possibly using nonparametric methods. Further reductions in FPR can be achieved by applying clustering and classification algorithms on the detected regions.","Nonparametric tolerance intervals allow inference without having any knowledge of the distribution from which data is drawn (See J. W. Pratt and J. D. Gibbons, \u201cConcepts of Nonparametric Theory\u201d, Berlin, Germany, Springer-Verlag, 1981; incorporated herein by reference). The nonparametric detector, based on tolerance intervals, avoids the assumption of an underlying pdf and therefore absolute thresholds. Combined with the ranking of the threshold crossing rates, good ROC performance was achieved on all test mammograms. Background training data is extracted from the outer ring of a circular template and used to compute a detection threshold. The data within the inner disk of the template is then tested. The proposed detector does show promise in having a low false positive rate and a high sensitivity.","The major advantages of this new method are the ability to train using local background data from the image itself; is computationally simpler than ANNs with no nonlinear optimization problems and provides competitive performance. The method is based on statistical principles and allows for local background data to be arbitrarily distributed, a real possibility when dealing with complex images. The statistical basis helps prevent \u201covertraining\u201d.","The nonparametric nature of the method prevents the need for unwarranted and unnecessary assumptions on the local background data. Beyond the use for mammograms, the method can be applied to any multi-dimensional intensity image in which there can exist at least one region of interest with the shape approximately known. The size of the region needs only to be known within a range.","Thus by the present invention its objects and advantages are realized and although preferred embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein, its scope should be determined by that of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"sub":["x ","y ","x ","y "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
