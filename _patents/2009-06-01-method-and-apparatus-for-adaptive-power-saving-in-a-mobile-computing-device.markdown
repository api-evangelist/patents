{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, have become highly capable communication devices in recent years. In addition to the wide array of processing capabilities such as digital assistant (PDA) features, including word processing, spreadsheets, synchronization of information (e.g., e-mail) with a desktop computer, and so forth, mobile computing devices also typically include wireless communications capabilities to provide features, such as mobile telephony, mobile e-mail access, web browsing, and content (e.g., video and radio) reception. Exemplary wireless communications technologies include cellular, satellite, and mobile data networking technologies.","Providing such a wide array of functionality in a single device results in increased power requirements. As the amount of power required to provide the ever increasing array of capabilities continues to increase, conservation of power becomes an important consideration. As a result, it is desirable to adapt the power consumption of a mobile computing device, when possible, to conserve power. For example, it may be advantageous to adaptively enter and control different power saving modes to conserve system power based on a variety of wireless communication parameters. Consequently, there exists a substantial need for techniques to improve the management of power within a mobile computing device.","Various embodiments may be generally directed to power management techniques for a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone. Some embodiments may be particularly directed to selecting a power mode for a mobile computing device based on one or more monitored wireless communications parameters.","In one embodiment, for example, a mobile computing device may include a data traffic monitor module, a power management module and one or more wireless transceivers. In various embodiments, the data traffic monitor module may be operative to monitor one or more wireless communications parameters for the mobile computing device. Examples of wireless communications parameters may comprise one or more application or protocol demands for the mobile computing device, for example. In some embodiments, the power management module may be operative to select a power mode for the mobile computing device based on the one or more wireless communications parameters. The power mode, in various embodiments, may comprise an extended power save mode wherein the one or more wireless transceivers are disabled during a plurality of consecutive wireless beacon events. A beacon event may comprise a transmitted frame or packet from an access point or any other network device, such as a router, switch, gateway, etc., that identifies the access point and\/or the wireless device\/network and generally includes information regarding characteristics of the access point and\/or wireless device\/network. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Improving the power management of a mobile computing device may provide several advantages. For example, reducing the amount of power required by the mobile computing device when application and protocol demands decrease may result in improved system performance and extended battery life. Furthermore, increasing the time for which the wireless transceivers and other suitable components may be powered off during times of reduced wireless activity may also improve the power management and system performance of the mobile computing device. Additionally, implementing the power management techniques in a dynamic manner may limit the change in user experience as power may be increased as wireless demands increase. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Various embodiments may comprise one or more elements. An element may comprise any structure arranged to perform certain operations. Each element may be implemented as hardware, software, or any combination thereof, as desired for a given set of design parameters or performance constraints. Although an embodiment may be described with a limited number of elements, nodes or modules in a certain topology by way of example, the embodiment may include other combinations of elements, nodes or modules in alternate arrangements as desired for a given implementation. It is worthy to note that any reference to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. It should also be understood that the use of the term control to refer to data and\/or signals throughout the application can refer to data flowing in any direction as control and\/or status data or signals. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112"]},"The mobile computing device  may be generally configured to support or provide cellular voice communication, wireless data communication and computing capabilities. The mobile computing device  may be implemented as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone, sometimes referred to as a smart phone. Examples of smart phones include, for example, Palm\u00ae products such as Palm\u00ae Pre\u2122 smart phone. Although some embodiments may be described with the mobile computing device  implemented as a smart phone by way of example, it may be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example, the mobile computing device  may comprise, or be implemented as, any type of wireless device, mobile station, or portable computing device with a self-contained power source (e.g., battery) such as a laptop computer, ultra-laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, combination cellular telephone\/PDA, mobile unit, subscriber station, user terminal, portable computer, handheld computer, palmtop computer, wearable computer, media player, pager, messaging device, data communication device, and so forth. Additional details for a mobile computing device may be described in more detail with reference to .","In various embodiments, mobile computing device  may include one or more wireless transceivers . Wireless transceivers  may comprise combination transmitters and receivers for wireless communication. In some embodiments, mobile computing device  may include separate or combined transceivers  for providing cellular, Wi-Fi, WLAN, Bluetooth, or any other type of wireless communication technology. The one or more transceivers may be configured to transmit or receive wireless data or other wireless signals using antenna  in some embodiments. The antenna  may comprise or be implemented as one or more internal antennas and\/or external antennas. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Mobile computing device  may also include a data traffic monitor module  in various embodiments. The data traffic monitor module  may be operative to monitor one or more wireless communications parameters for the mobile computing device . In various embodiments, the one or more communications parameters may comprise one or more of application or protocol demands for the mobile computing device . For example, the wireless communications parameters may comprise throughput, latency, power requirements, type of wireless traffic, type of wireless connection, signal strength, or any other wireless communications parameters that have an effect on the power performance of mobile computing device .","In various embodiments, the data traffic monitor module  may monitor the data traffic carried over a wireless radio stack and\/or one or more transceivers  of mobile computing device  and determine when and at what level to set power consumption by the wireless radio and\/or the one or more transceivers . For example, data traffic monitor module  may track the application and protocol demands on the wireless radio link of mobile computing device . The tracked demand may be associated with the normal TCP\/IP socket interface as well as other protocols, including ICMP, DHCP, ARP, Connection Manager and 802.11 link management frames. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In some embodiments, as the application and protocol demands on the wireless radio link and\/or the one or more transceivers  change, the data traffic monitor module  may notify a power management module . Power management module  may be operative to select a power mode for the mobile computing device  based on the one or more wireless communications parameters in various embodiments. In some embodiments, power management module  may select an appropriate power level or power mode for mobile computing device  that matches the throughput, latency, and available battery power required by mobile computing device . For example, when applications and protocols are actively sending and receiving packets, power management module  may configure the wireless radio and\/or one or more transceivers  for higher throughput and suspend any power save modes. In other embodiments, when the application and protocol demands on the wireless radio link and\/or the one or more wireless transceivers  are reduced the power management module  may select a power mode that matches the decreased demand. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","To conserve power, mobile computing device  may include a plurality of power modes in some embodiments. For example, when applications are busy using the WLAN link for browsing, email or media, for example, it is assumed that a user will desire high throughput and latency performance. Consequently, power management module  may configure the wireless radio for higher throughput and suspend any power save modes when it is notified by data traffic monitor module  that the applications and user are active on the wireless link using one or more wireless transceivers . In some embodiments, when data traffic monitor module  determines that application and protocol throughput and latency demands have been reduced, a first power save mode may be selected by power management module . In various embodiments, the power save mode may include disabling the one or more wireless transceivers  between each wireless beacon event.","In some embodiments, power save mode may comprise an IEEE power saving mechanism as defined in the 802.11 standards. Disabling the one or more wireless transceivers  between each wireless beacon event may reduce the power consumption of the mobile computing device  where the one or more wireless transceivers  typically draw approximately 200-300 mA when powered on and potentially less than 1 mA when in a suspended state. In power save mode, the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  are awoken to process each beacon transmitted by an access point or other network device. In some embodiments, the beacon processing time interval is about 10 ms. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, additional power savings may be desired. In some embodiments, data traffic monitor module  will continue to monitor data flow and instruct power management module  to activate an extended power save mode when the application and protocol demands are further reduced. The extended power save mode may comprise disabling the one or more wireless transceivers  during a plurality of consecutive wireless beacon events in some embodiments. For example, the extended power save mode may comprise disabling the one or more wireless transceivers for four consecutive wireless beacon events, or any other number of beacon events that is greater than one. Disabling the one or more wireless transceivers  for a plurality of beacon events may result in additional power savings. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Mobile computing device  may include a timing module  in various embodiments. Timing module  may be operative to detect periods of wireless inactivity from data traffic monitor module . For example, the power save mode may be selected after a first time interval and the extended power save mode may be selected after a second time interval. In some embodiments, the second time interval is longer than the first time interval.","In a typical mobile computing device, power save modes may be disabled or suspended when the device is connected to a wired power source or external power supply. In various embodiments, the extended power save mode may be optionally suspended when the mobile computing device is coupled to an external power supply. For example, a user may wish to continue using the power save mode and the extended power save mode even when mobile computing device  is connected to an external power supply. Such use may improve the energy efficiency and environmental friendliness associated with the use of mobile computing device .","The wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device  must remain synchronized with one or more wireless access points or other network devices to maintain a reliable connection. For example, the one or more wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device  may need to remain synchronized with the time a wireless access point is transmitting 802.11 beacon frames to reliably receive unicast, multicast and broadcast frames and packets. This may be problematic in extended power save mode where the one or more wireless transceivers are disabled during a plurality of wireless beacon events. Absent corrective measures, it is known that reception of multi-cast and broadcast traffic may be unreliable during periods of extended power save mode. Router address resolution protocol (ARP) frames may not be reliably received during periods of extended power save mode. Furthermore, keeping access point or other network device station tables and network router address tables intact and updated on network routers and access points must also be accomplished during periods of extended inactivity.","In various embodiments, mobile computing device  may include a processor  to periodically transmit an address resolution protocol (ARP) response to one or more wireless access points or other network devices to maintain a wireless connection between the mobile computing device and the one or more wireless access points or other network devices when the mobile computing device is in the extended power save mode. These gratuitously transmitted ARP responses may be used to maintain an up to date connection with an associated access point or other network device, for example. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In some embodiments, power management module  or processor  may direct the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  to periodically send 802.11 Null data frames to keep the access point connected to the mobile computing device . In other embodiments, power management module  or processor  may direct the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  to periodically send an ARP frame to keep the network router tables up to date. The automatic transmissions of maintenance frames will, in some embodiments, be coordinated by the power management module  or processor  to coincide with a normal beacon processing event. In various embodiments, this may have the effect of additionally saving power while taking advantage of the fact that the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  are already in an operational state and efficiently performing link reliability tasks. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, the processor  may be disabled in addition to or in place of the one or more wireless transceivers  to conserve power during the power save modes. The processor  may comprise a general purpose processor or an application specific processor arranged to provide general or specific computing capabilities for the mobile computing device . For example, the processor  may perform operations associated with higher layer protocols and applications. For instance, the processor  may be implemented as a host processor to provide various user applications, such as telephony, text messaging, e-mail, web browsing, word processing, video signal display, and so forth. In addition, the processor  may provide one or more functional utilities that are available to various protocols, operations, and\/or applications. Examples of such utilities include operating systems, device drivers, user interface functionality, and so forth. In some embodiments, processor  may comprise a communications processor.","Despite entering various power save modes, users may expect the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  to maintain a connected state to a network as the user moves around an extended service set ID having multiple access points or other network devices. In some embodiments, a user may wish to ascertain the link status and quality of any surrounding wireless networks. To do so, users often look to signal bars presented in the graphical user interface (GUI) and\/or a wireless status bar. In various embodiments, processor  may be used to notify mobile computing device  when movement by the user and mobile computing device  has occurred. The notification may be based on a preset minimum distance, for example. Because the wireless radio and\/or one or more wireless transceivers  typically do not have global positioning system (GPS) functionality for mapping distances, processor  may measure the signal strength of a frame transmitted by an access point or other network device to the one or more wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device , along with a basic path loss formula, to estimate the distance moved.","Processor  may maintain a running average of the relative signal strength of the past few received frames and compare that average with thresholds set by system roaming software. In some embodiments, when the average signal strength crosses a threshold, a possible roam event or signal bar event may be indicated to the host software of mobile computing device . By monitoring the movement by the user and mobile computing device , the processor  may not need to be burdened with the fairly repetitive and simple task or repeatedly identifying that the mobile computing device  is still connected to the same access point or other network device. In some embodiments, this may result in additional power savings. Other embodiments are described and claimed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","100","200","100","200"]},"As shown at , mobile computing device  may be operating normally with no power save modes enabled. At  however, mobile computing device  may transition to power save mode as a result of changes in system requirements, for example. As illustrated by the spikes in power consumption between  and , mobile computing device  may utilize a reduced amount of power for 100 ms intervals, for example. In some embodiments, the spikes between  and  may represent mobile computing device  using increased power to ensure reception of transmitted beacon events. For example, the one or more wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device  may awaken every 100 ms in accordance with scheduled beacon events to maintain a reliable connection.","At , mobile computing device  may transition into extended power save mode as a result of an additional reduction of system or wireless communication requirements. As shown between  and , mobile computing device  may have even further reduced power requirements in extended power save mode versus power save mode. For example, in extended power save mode, the one or more wireless transceivers  and\/or processor  of mobile computing device  may be disabled for longer periods of time in extended power save mode. In some embodiments, the one or more wireless transceivers  and\/or processor  may be disabled for the duration of four beacon events, or the equivalent of 400 ms. The increased time between wake events may greatly reduce the power consumption of mobile computing device .","In some embodiments, an ARP response may be transmitted as illustrated by the spike in power consumption at . ARP responses may need to be gratuitously sent by processor  to one or more wireless access points or other network devices to maintain a wireless connection between the mobile computing device  and the one or more wireless access points or other network devices when the mobile computing device is in the extended power save mode. At , normal usage, such as web browsing for example, may resume resulting in mobile computing device  transitioning out of extended power save mode and back into a normal operating mode. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","The above described embodiments may be implemented in software, hardware or any combination of software and hardware. In some embodiments, the above described functionality may be implemented using the following programming code or algorithms. It should be understood, however, that the following code is presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation.

In some embodiments, the power mode may comprise an extended power save mode wherein one or more wireless transceivers of the mobile computing device, such as wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device , are disabled during a plurality of consecutive wireless beacon events.","In various embodiments, an address resolution protocol (ARP) response may be transmitted to one or more wireless access points or other network devices to maintain a wireless connection between the mobile computing device and the one or more wireless access points or other network devices when the mobile computing device is in the extended power save mode. For example, processor  of mobile computing device  may transmit an ARP response to an associated access point or other network device to maintain a connection with the access point or other network device and to ensure that the access point or other network device remains aware of the location of the mobile computing device .","The power mode may comprise a power save mode wherein the one or more wireless transceivers are disabled between each wireless beacon event in some embodiments. For example, the one or more wireless transceivers  of mobile computing device  may be disabled between each beacon event, and may be enabled at predetermined intervals to detect beacon signals. In various embodiments, the power mode may be selected to match a throughput, latency and available power required by mobile computing device  based on the one or more communications parameters.","In some embodiments, periods of wireless inactivity may be detected and the power save mode may be selected after a first time interval and the extended power save mode may be selected after a second time interval. The second time interval is longer than the first time interval in various embodiments. For example, after a first time interval, the one or more transceivers  of mobile computing device  may be disabled between each wireless beacon event. After a second time interval, which is longer than the first time interval, the one or more transceivers  may be disabled for a plurality of consecutive wireless beacon events. In some embodiments, the one or more wireless transceivers may be disabled for four consecutive wireless beacon events in the extended power save mode. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","The extended power save mode may be optionally suspended when the mobile computing device is coupled to an external power supply in various embodiments. For example, if a user were to connect mobile computing device  to an AC power supply, it may be desirable to optionally continue to utilize the available power saving modes to conserve energy and to use the mobile computing device  in a more environmentally friendly manner.","In various embodiments, power savings in addition to the power savings described above may be desired. Various embodiments are described below that may result in additional power savings for a mobile computing device, such as mobile computing device  of , for example.","Cached Access Point Discovery","In various embodiments, network discovery may be a time and battery power consuming task. A transceiver, such as the one more wireless transceivers , for example, baseband and media access control (MAC) functions may all be involved in the operations of network discovery. In some embodiments, the service of network discovery may involve scanning logic that performs reliable wireless or WLAN scans to perform access point discovery. In various embodiments, theses scans provide an access point address, name and signal strength information to the mobile computing device performing the scan. It may be desirable, in some embodiments, to perform the network discovery service in a more power efficient manner to conserve power.","A typical user scenario may involve, for example, a wireless or Wi-Fi service at a mobile computing device to perform an access point discovery scan and display to the user a list of available networks. In some embodiments, the displayed list may be updated frequently so that the graphical user interface (GUI) experience is responsive. In various embodiments, when the mobile computing device connects to a wireless or WLAN network, the service may perform access point discovery so that it can choose the access point that will provide the best connection at that time. In some embodiments, the service may also perform access point discovery as the mobile computing device moves around an extended service set (ESSID) or corporate network with multiple access points. Access point discovery may be performed at other, un-described times as well.","In various embodiments, a power save feature of the mobile computing device may provide an access point cache or list that is shared by the above described different sub tasks of the discovery service. For example, access point discovery requests made by the service that are less than 3 seconds apart, for example, may use the access point list that is present in the access point cache rather than scanning for new access points. In some embodiments, access points may be aged out from the list over time. For example, the age out of the access point cache may be on the order of 3 seconds. The use of an access point cache in this manner may result in power savings associated with not turning on the transceivers and\/or baseband processor to perform additional scanning operations as some of these repetitive operations may be replaced with use of the list of access points in the cache. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Backed Off Scanning Interval While Searching for Networks","In various embodiments, when searching for wireless access points to connect to, a service of a mobile computing device may initiate a scan interval to ensure that the mobile computing device can connect to a network in a short amount of time, if a network is found. The typical scan interval may comprise 1 second for example. In various embodiments, if no network is discovered during the scan, the service may double the time between successive scans to conserve power. In some embodiments, the time between successive scans may be doubled up to a predetermined limit, such as a predetermined maximum number of seconds, for example.","In some embodiments, for example, a mobile computing device may be searching for an access point with a specific service set identifier (SSID) or network name, such as \u201cMathilda\u201d for example. The mobile computing device may perform a scan when the wireless or WLAN connection attempt is first initiated. In various embodiments, if a SSID or network name of \u201cMathilda\u201d is not discovered in range, the next successive scans may take place after 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 seconds and so on respectively, or until a predetermined threshold has been reached. In various embodiments, the maximum interval can be adjusted to successively back off the scan interval in greater amounts depending on the battery level available on the mobile computing device. Backing off the time between scans may result in additional power savings for the mobile computing device. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Off Loading Keep Alive and Application Packets to the Communications Processor","In various embodiments, a service of a mobile computing device may need to provide an interface where periodic application oriented packets can be transmitted from the mobile computing device automatically. For example, an email program may need to maintain a connection with an email server so that email can be pushed to the mobile computing device. In various embodiments, this periodic transmission may be offloaded from the host processor to communications processor to conserve power. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Additional Power Savings While Moving About a Network","In some embodiments, a mobile computing device may be moved around an extended service set identifier (ESSID) or corporate network containing multiple access points. When moved, the mobile computing device may be required to choose a new or different access point to maintain a network connection. In various embodiments, a service of a mobile computing device may program the wireless or WLAN communications processor with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) triggers to assist in this process and to conserve power.","Choosing the correct RSSI triggers requires the creation of models of the wireless or WLAN environment based on different topologies and densities of access points over different areas in various embodiments. For example, the wireless or WLAN environment models may be comprised of discrete states including low and high density access point deployments. Additional states may also exist. , for example, may illustrate simulated power histograms for two buildings having different topologies and densities of access points in different areas. More particularly,  illustrates power versus probably density function for a Building 2.2 and a Building 3.1. As illustrated, Building 2.2 may comprise low density and Building 3.1 may comprise high density. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, wireless environments, such as the environment illustrated in , may be modeled, for example, through simulation and by actively and passively scanning networks known to be low and high density access point deployments. The simulations may include, in some embodiments, placement of access points on a grid and then iterating standard path loss formulas to generate tables of signal strengths per access point at different locations. In some embodiments, this type of scanning may be performed at large companies, metropolitan networks, personal networks, public hotspots or different buildings both indoors and outdoors or any other location where a plurality of access points are known to exist. In some embodiments, histograms of the signal strengths provide a mathematical model of the different density access point deployments, as shown in . More particularly,  illustrates a graph showing probably density function of RSSI in high and low density. The horizontal axis of the graph shows a received power level from an access point and the vertical access illustrates a percentage. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","In various embodiments, probability density functions for different access point density models may be developed. These models may be used, for example, by designers or a service of a mobile computing device to select appropriate RSSI triggers that match the density of the access point deployments. Bayesian inference may be used to train the model to the actual wireless or WLAN environments the mobile computing device is used in, in some embodiments. By providing appropriate RSSI triggers which invoke scanning operations by the wireless or WLAN radio in the most efficient places of a WLAN environment, power savings may be achieved in various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C"]},"In some embodiments, when a mobile computing device scans for an access point, a list of received signal power levels may be compared to the probability density functions or WLAN environment models. In various embodiments, a Bayesian inference may be used to select the appropriate RSSI triggers by identifying the density of the access point deployment.","Initially, in some embodiments, the probability of being in either topology may be 0.5 but as each RSSI sample is received, the probability may be adjusted according to the formula shown in Equation (1) as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["H","high"]},"mo":"|","mi":"S"}}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["H","high"]}}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["H","high"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["H","high"]}}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["H","high"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"S","mo":"|","msub":{"mi":["H","low"]}}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["H","low"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"+"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"In various embodiments, the resulting value may be used as the P(H high) for the next sample. In this way, the model may adapt as needed and may statically discount samples that do not provide a clear distinction between the two hypotheses. In various embodiments, more than two hypotheses are possible but only two hypotheses are shown for purposes of illustration and not limitation. Other embodiments are described and claimed.","Communications Processor Transmission Parameters","In various embodiments, the above described Bayesian model and inference can help to identify other quality of service parameters. For example, the rate selection algorithm, the frame size, aggregation size and\/or packet retry limit can be adjusted to fit the access point deployment density. In various embodiments, adjustments of one or more of these parameters may result in more efficient transmission of frames and additional power savings.","Communication Processor Clocking Speed","In some embodiments, as the power, thermal or Bluetooth coexistence demands change for a mobile computing device, a service of the mobile computing device can change the clock speed at which that the communications MAC, baseband, and\/or CPU are running. By adjusting the clock speed separately or together, more power can be saved, less heat may be generated and the overlapping demands with a Bluetooth radio for the shared ISM band can be improved in various embodiments.
