The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to nitrated and non-nitrated compounds and use thereof in mitigating cellular damage. More particularly, the present invention relates to nitrated and non-nitrated thiazole compounds having therapeutic utility as agents that protect brain tissue from injury, that ameliorate symptoms and pathologies associated with brain injuries, and that are useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and conditions.","Nitric oxide (NO) signaling is essential for normal physiological function in the central nervous system (CNS) and is compromised in many disease states. NO can serve as a retrograde synaptic messenger, as an intracellular messenger, and as a lateral diffusible messenger in the CNS. NO plays a critical role in signal transduction cascades that are compromised in dementia, and thereby contribute to the symptoms of cognitive impairment that characterize Alzheimer's Disease (AD). NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) to release cyclic guanosine-2\u2032:3\u2032-monophosphate (cGMP). NO\/cGMP signaling is important for modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity in brain regions, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which are critical for learning and memory (H. Son et al., 1998, 5, 231-245; and Y. F. Lu et al., 1999, 19, 10250-10261). Evidence exists that NO may positively impact learning, memory, and cognition through cGMP-dependent and independent pathways (T. M. Edwards et al., 2002, 77, 313-326).","Compounds that mimic the effects of NO, i.e., NO mimetics, bypass cholinergic receptor activation and are expected to provide multiple pathways of treating and circumventing dementia. The action of an appropriate nitrate in the hippocampus modulates signaling cascades, in part via MAPK\/ERK (mitogen activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein), leading to amelioration of learning and memory pathways under pathophysiological conditions which might lead to neurodegeneration.","Nitrates are NO mimetics that can act as NO donors. In contrast to other NO donors, nitrates do not release high fluxes of NO, which is potentially harmful. Bioactivation and metabolism of nitrates is a variable that strongly influences activity and pharmaceutical use. Whereas the potent hypotensive effects of the organic nitrate vasodilator nitroglycerin may be deleterious in the treatment of depression and dementia, it is theorized herein, but not relied upon, that regulation of systemic versus central effects is required for development of new and useful therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of brain injuries, dementia, and neurological diseases.","Cerebral ischemia results in marked increases in the release of the excitatory amino acid glutamate in the affected brain region (Bullock et al., 1998; Huang et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998). In both humans (Bullock et al., 1998) and experimental animals (Huang et al., 1998; Goda et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998), the amount of glutamate released during ischemia is positively correlated with the extent of brain injury. In experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia, a decreased release of glutamate during ischemia (Goda et al., 1998) or a blockade of glutamate receptors with antagonists (Ibarrola et al., 1998; O'Neill et al., 1998; Umemura et al., 1997) significantly reduces the extent of brain injury. However, these interventions are only effective when administered prior to or during the ischemic insult. To be broadly useful, a therapeutic intervention preferably is effective when administered after a period of ischemia.","Reoxygenation and reperfusion after a period of ischemia contributes significantly to the development of brain injury. Oxygen radicals, especially superoxide and peroxynitrite, formed in the period after an ischemic event, may initiate processes, such as breakdown of membrane lipids (lipid peroxidation), that lead to loss of cell membrane integrity and inhibition of mitochondrial function (Macdonald and Stoodley, 1998; Gaetani et al, 1998). Oxidative stress may be a factor involved in initiation of apoptotic neuronal cell death (Tagami et al., 1998). In experimental animal models of ischemic brain injury, a cytokine attenuating anti-inflammatory compound has been found to reduce the extent of neuronal injury and cell death (Chan et al., 1998; Mizuno et al., 1998; Tagami et al., 1998). Neurodegeneration therefore is mitigated by inhibition of cytokine induced damage.","Clomethiazole (CMZ) is a sedative\/hypnotic and anticonvulsant, currently in clinical use for anxiety in the elderly. Ample evidence supports the actions of CMZ as both GABAmimetic and anti-inflammatory. These properties together provide neuroprotection in animal models of ischemic stroke (A. N. Clarkson et. al., 200519, 1036-1038). In addition to acting as a GABApotentiator, it has been proposed that CMZ also inhibits the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (A. Simi et al., 2000& 20, 1077-1088) and decreases inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in cortical glial cells (M. J. Wilby et. al., 200410, 281-294). AR-A008055 was reported as a CMZ analog (R. M. Nelson et. al., 200141, 159-166).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"66.46mm","wi":"60.54mm","file":"US08957086-20150217-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"GT-1061 incorporates the 5-methylthiazole (MZ) pharmacophore of CMZ and retains GABApotentiating, as well as anticonvulsant, activity with attenuated sedative\/hypnotic effects. In preclinical studies, GT-1061 reversed cognitive impairment in experimental models of dementia, and also significantly improved learning and memory in experimental animals in which the cholinergic systems of the basal forebrain had been lesioned (B. M. Bennett et al., 2007, 32, 505-13; G. R. J. Thatcher et al., 2006, 3, 237-45; G. R. J. Thatcher et al., 2004, 6, S75-84.). The aliphatic nitrate group of GT-1061 provides nitric oxide (NO) mimetic activity via cGMP\/ERK\/CREB signal transduction enhancing synaptic plasticity and via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) upregulation, thereby enhancing neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis. Evidence exists for attenuated NO\/cGMP signaling and downregulated BDNF in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. GT-1061 has completed Phase 1A clinical trials for AD.","The present invention therefore is directed to novel 4-methylthiazole compounds having neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory properties, and that are useful in the methods of protecting brain tissue from injury and of ameliorating symptoms and pathologies associated with brain injuries.","The present invention is directed to compounds having the following generic structures:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"20.32mm","wi":"56.22mm","file":"US08957086-20150217-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":"1 ","sub":["1-24 ","2","1-3","2","1-3"]},"Ris selected from the group consisting of H, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, a substituted or unsubstituted Caliphatic group, \u2014OR, halo, N(R)(R), N, \u2014(CH)N, \u2014(CH)OR, and \u2014(CH)halo, wherein at least one of Rand Ris different from H; and","Rand R, independently, are selected from the group consisting of H, Calkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, or Rand Rare taken together with the atom to which they are attached to from a 3 to 6 membered ring;","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug or hydrate thereof; and",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"20.32mm","wi":"54.36mm","file":"US08957086-20150217-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris selected from the group consisting of H, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, a substituted or unsubstituted Caliphatic group, \u2014N, \u2014(CH)aryl, and \u2014(CH)heteroaryl;","Ris selected from the group consisting of ONO, \u2014(CH)ONO, \u2014NHC(\u2550O)O(CH)ONO, \u2014NHC(\u2550O)C(R)(R)CHONO, \u2014NHC(\u2550O)CHC(R)(R)ONO, \u2014NHC(\u2550O)YC(R)(R)CHONO, \u2014NHC(\u2550O)YCHC(R)(R)ONO, \u2014OC(\u2550O)CHC(R)(R)ONO, \u2014OC(\u2550O)C(R)(R)CHONO, \u2014O(CH)ONO, \u2014O(CH)O(CH)ONO, and \u2014O(CH)YCH\u2014[CH(ONO)]\u2014(CH)ONO, and heteroaryl having at least one aliphatic nitro substituent;","Rand R, independently, are selected from the group consisting of H, Calkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, or Rand Rare taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to from a 3 to 6 membered ring;","n is an integer of 1 through 5; and","Y is O, S, or NH;","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, or hydrate thereof.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide nitrated derivatives of the compounds of structural formula (I).","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of protecting the brain from injury, and to provide a method of mitigating brain tissue and cellular damage by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) to an individual in need thereof.

The scopolamine treatment results in mice having an attenuated cognitive function. STPA (step through passive avoidance task) is widely used to test long-term memory. The STPA apparatus consists of a two-compartment acrylic box with an illuminated side (15\u00d712\u00d712 cm) connected to a dark side (15\u00d712\u00d712 cm) by a vertical door. The dark side is equipped with an electric grid floor. During the habituation, animals were habituated to the normal behavior of rapidly translocating to the dark from the light side, where they were initially placed. Habituation trials are continued until latency of entering the dark side for each animal is less than 30 seconds. Animals that cannot pass this screening phase are excluded from the study. During the training, animals were trained by receiving an aversive electrical shock (0.5 mA, 2 sec), triggered by entry to the dark compartment, until the latency of entering the dark side reach 300 seconds. At 24 and 72 hours post-training, the animals again are individually placed in the light compartment and the latency to enter the dark compartment, without shock stimulus, is recorded. Statistical analysis of the latency data was performed with one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test. For STPA tests using na\u00efve animals, each animal was administered two ip injections. Amnesic agent (e.g., scopolamine 1 mg\/kg, MK-801 0.07 mg\/kg or diazepam 0.5 mg\/kg) or vehicle was administered 30 minutes prior training to induce amnesia, and testing drug was given at 20 minutes prior training start., i.e. (Vehicle+Vehicle; Scopolamine+Vehicle; or Scopolamine+drug). For APP\/PS1 animals, each animal only received one i.p. injection of testing drug at 20 min prior training. Test compounds are compared to vehicle controls. An enhanced latency time represents higher cognitive function and increased memory consolidation and retrieval.","Another test demonstrated the ability of compounds of structural formula (I) to restore normal LTP in hippocampal brain slices from amyloid transgenic mice. Animals were killed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. Hippocampi were quickly removed and sectioned into 400 \u03bcm slices. Hippocampal LTP were recorded as previously described (Vitolo et al., 2002). Briefly, hippocampal slices were transferred to a recording chamber where they were maintained at 29\u00b0 C. and perfused continuously with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) pre-bubbled with 95% Oand 5% CO. The aCSF contains (in M) following: 124.0 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.0 NaHPO, 25.0 NaHCO, 2.0 CaCl, 2.0 MgSO, 10.0 glucose. After about one hour of recovering, the stimulating and the recording electrodes were both placed in CA1 stratum radiatum and CA1 field-excitatory-post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) were recorded. For LTP experiments, a 15 minute baseline was recorded every minute at an intensity that evokes a response about 35% of the maximum evoked response. LTP was induced using O-burst stimulation (4 pulses at 100 Hz, with the bursts repeated at 5 Hz and each tetanus including 3 ten-burst trains separated by 15 seconds). In a set of experiments, LTP was induced with 1 or 2 ten-burst trains to assess the effect of drug on LTP induced with a different strength of the tetanus. Responses were recorded for 2 hours after tetanization and measured as fEPSP slope expressed as percentage of baseline. Hippocampal slices were perfused with testing compounds (100 \u03bcM) for 5 minutes before inducing LTP. The results were expressed as mean\u00b1Standard Error Mean (SEM).","A compound of structural formula (I) therefore is useful in a method of treating neurological conditions and\/or preventing an undesirable mental condition (e.g., memory loss) comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) to an individual in need thereof. In one embodiment, the compound of structural formula (I) provides neuroprotection. In another embodiment, the compound of structural formula (I) provides cognition enhancement.","The above tests show that compounds of structural formula (I) have a high efficacy in effecting neuroprotection in vivo in models of transient global and focal cerebral ischemia when administered after the ischemic insult. The compounds of structural formula (I) can be used in the treatment of diseases and conditions including but not limited to stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis, AIDS-induced dementia, epilepsy, alcoholism, alcohol withdrawal, drug-induced seizures, viral\/bacterial\/fever-induced seizures, trauma to the head, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion, cerebral vascular hemorrhage, hemorrhage, vascular dementia, environmental excitotoxins of plant, animal, or marine origin, neurodegenerative disorders and dementia, including diseases of aging resulting in dementia, neuroinflammation, or neuronal, and synaptic dysfunction; and neurological disorders characterized by imbalanced excitatory stimuli, such as anxiety, epilepsy, and insomnia.","Neuroprotection and\/or cognition enhancement by administration of a compound of structural formula (I) can be affected, for example, by modulating an interaction a glutamate or non-glutamate neuroreceptor or attenuating cytokine induced damage. The attenuation of cytokine concentration by a compound of structural formula (I) can also be useful for preventing or mitigating tissue and\/or cellular damage.","Accordingly, in certain aspects and embodiments of the invention, compounds of structural formula (I) have an ability to inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with a wide range of diseases and conditions, such as, for example, aging, septic shock, ischemia, overexpression of cytokines, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., gastritis, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), diabetes, arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), asthma, cirrhosis, allograft rejection (e.g., transplant rejection), encephalomyelitis, meningitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis, vasculitis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, glomerulonephritis, ophthalmologic diseases (e.g., uveitis, glaucoma, blepharitis, chalazion, allergic eye disease, corneal ulcer, keratitis, cataract, retinal disorders, age-related macular degeneration, optic neuritis, and the like), ileitis, inflammation induced by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., liver inflammation, renal inflammation, airway inflammation, and the like), hemorrhagic shock, anaphylactic shock, burn, infection leading to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (including bacterial (e.g., infection), viral (e.g., HIV), fungal (e.g., Candidiosis and histoplasmosis) and parasitic (e.g., Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) infections), hemodialysis, chronic fatigue syndrome, stroke, cancers (e.g., breast, melanoma, carcinoma, and the like), cardiovascular diseases associated with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., heart disease, cardiopulmonary bypass, ischemic\/reperfusion injury, and the like), ischemic\/reperfusion associated with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cachexia, myocarditis, autoimmune disorders, eczema, psoriasis, heart failure, dermatitis, urticaria, cerebral ischemia, systemic lupus erythematosis, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., chronic neurodegenerative disease), chronic pain, priapism, cystic fibrosis, schizophrenia, depression, premenstrual syndrome, anxiety, addiction, migraine, gastrointestinal motility disorders, obesity, hyperphagia, solid tumors (e.g., neuroblastoma), malaria, hematologic cancers, myelofibrosis, lung injury, graft-versus-host disease, head injury, CNS trauma, hepatitis, renal failure, liver disease (e.g., chronic hepatitis C), drug-induced lung injury (e.g., paraquat), transplant rejection and preservation, fertility enhancement, bacterial translocation, circulatory shock, traumatic shock, and vascular aneurysm (e.g., aortic aneurysm), ileus, and myocardial infarction.","In addition, the compounds of structural formula (I) can be used in cytokine therapy (with consequent induction of cytokine overproduction) which, for example, is commonly used in the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disease, and in AIDS patients. Systemic hypotension due to the induction of cytokine overproduction is a dose-limiting side effect of cytokine therapy. Thus, a large patient population exists which benefit from the present invention.","Compounds of Structural Formula (II)","The compounds of structural formula (I) exhibit excellent neuroprotective properties. These properties are enhanced by introducing aliphatic nitro groups into the molecule. The nitrated compounds of structural formula (II), like the compounds of structural formula (I), therefore mitigate cellular damage, protect brain tissue from injury, and provide amelioration of symptoms and pathology associated with brain injury. The compounds of structural formula (II) provide both neuroprotection and neurorestoration utilizing the activity of the MZ pharmacophore and the NO mimetic nitrate. The compounds of structural formula (II) provide both neuroprotection and neurorestoration utilizing the activity of the MZ pharmacophore and the NO mimetic nitrate. The compounds of structural formula (II) also enhance NO\/cGMP signaling.","The compounds of structural formula (II) are chimeric nitrate esters, i.e., organic nitrates that contain a 4-methylthiazole (MT) pharmacophore and an NO mimetic. A present chimeric nitrate ester incorporating an MT pharmacore represents a novel therapy for the treatment of brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases and conditions.","The present invention therefore is directed to methods and compounds useful for treating neurodegeneration, or preventing or mitigating tissue and\/or cellular damage, by administering to an individual in need thereof a nitrate ester of structural formula (II). Neuroprotection and\/or cognition enhancement can be affected, for example, by modulating an interaction with soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC, the enzyme responsible for cGMP production in various areas of the brain), a glutamate or non-glutamate neuroreceptor or attenuating cytokine induced damage. The attenuation of cytokine concentration by a nitrate ester of structural formula (II) also can be useful for preventing or mitigating tissue and\/or cellular damage.","According to certain aspects of the invention, neurodegeneration is mitigated by stimulating cerebral sGC. One of the major targets for organic nitrates is sGC activation, resulting in the production of cGMP. Experimental evidence obtained in a number of in vitro model systems supports the notion that elevated levels of cGMP help to prevent apoptotic (programmed) cell death. Thus, a cGMP-dependent mechanism significantly increases the survival of trophic factor-deprived PC12 cells and rat sympathetic neurons (Farinelli et al., 1996), and of primary cultures of rat embryonic motor neurons (Estevez et al., 1998). The mechanism of action for organic nitrates in preventing apoptotic cell death may be inhibition of caspase-3 activation indirectly through elevations in cGMP levels or directly via protein S-nitrosylation of the enzyme by an NO-intermediate (Kim et al., 1997). Caspase-3 is a member of the cysteine protease family of enzymes that are essential for the execution step in apoptosis (Cohen, 1997; Nicholson and Thornberry, 1997). Activation of caspase-3 is required for apoptotic cell death in trophic factor-deprived PC12 cells (Haviv et al., 1997) and in glutamate-mediated apoptotic cell death of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (Du et al., 1997). In animal models of cerebral ischemia, caspase-3 activity is induced and may be responsible for the apoptotic component of delayed neuronal cell death (Chen et al., 1998; Namura et al., 1998; Ni et al., 1998). Inhibitors of caspase-3 significantly decrease the apoptotic component of delayed neuronal cell death in response to ischemic injury both in vitro (Gottron et al., 1997) and in vivo (Endres et al., 1998). A secreted region of the Alzheimer's disease \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein lowers intracellular calcium levels and provides neuroprotective effects on target cells through increases in cGMP levels and activation of protein kinase G (Barger et al., 1995; Furukawa et al., 1996). In accordance with the present invention, nitrated compounds of structural formula (II) have the capacity to activate sGC directly, or via release of an NO-containing intermediate, to modulate sGC activity.","In one aspect of the invention, cognition enhancement (e.g., improved memory performance) is achieved by stimulating cerebral sGC. Several lines of experimental evidence support the notion that sGC and cGMP are involved in the formation and retention of new information. cGMP has been directly implicated in both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are proposed cellular models for learning and memory (Arancio et al., 1995; Wu et al., 1998). In animal models, elevation of hippocampal cGMP levels leading to increased protein kinase G activity has been shown to be important for retention and consolidation of new learning (Bernabeu et al., 1996, 1997). Thus, stimulation of cerebral sGC activity is expected to improve learning and memory performance in individuals in whom cognitive abilities are impaired by injury, disease, or aging.","Compounds of structural formula (II) activate soluble sGC and cause cGMP accumulation in vascular and brain tissue. Activation of sGC and accumulation of cGMP have been shown to be important in the neuroprotection of hippocampal brain slices subjected to a period of in vitro ischemia.","The potent, peripheral hypotension effects of organic nitrates may have deleterious effects. These deleterious effects are overcome by the present organic nitrates of structural formula (II) that incorporate sulfur-containing functionalities, which themselves deliver protective effects to cells. The compounds of structural formula (II) therefore protect against, and provide behavioral relief of symptoms of diseases and conditions including cognition deficits resulting from brain insults (including amyloid neurotoxicity and synaptic dysfunction), and neurodegenerative disorders and dementia, including stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other diseases of aging resulting in dementia, neuroinflammation, or neuronal and synaptic dysfunction. In particular, the compounds of structural formula (II) are useful in the same methods as the compounds of structural formula (I).","The compounds of structural formula (II) are \u201caliphatic nitrates\u201d, in which a nitrate group is bonded to a non-aromatic carbon atom. By incorporating one or more nitrate group into the compound, an aliphatic nitrate acts as a nitric oxide (NO) mimetic. In some preferred embodiments, a compound of structural formula (II) contains at least two nitrate groups, and in other embodiments, a nitrate group is beta, gamma, or delta to a sulfur atom. In other preferred embodiments, a compound of structural formula (II) contains at least one aliphatic nitrate group and at least one heterocyclic sulfur atom in a thiazole ring. A compound of structural formula (II) can contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nitro groups. In another embodiment, a compound of structural formula (II) is used in methods of preventing or mitigating tissue and\/or cellular damage in the brain of a subject by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (II) to the subject.","The compounds of structural formula (II) are used in methods of affecting neuroprotection, mitigating neurodegeneration, affecting cognition enhancement, and\/or protecting tissues from oxidative injury. The compounds of structural formula (II) also are neuroprotective agents and are used to protect tissues from oxidative injury.","Compounds of structural formula (II) often position a sulfur atom with respect to a nitrate functional group such that a linker, like a carbonyl group, intervenes to form a linkage that can be bioactivated by cleavage. Such compounds form part of the invention if cleavage at the bond produces two entirely separate molecules, i.e., one containing the nitrate functionality and another the S-functionality. It is understood by one skilled in the art that facile cleavage of a carbonyl linkage in an aqueous biological milieu will render an aliphatic nitrate that may not contain a sulfur atom, and such a compound comprises part of the present invention when the sulfur atom is present in a heterocyclic ring.","Specific compounds of structural formula (II) include the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0230"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00087","num":"00087"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00087","he":"253.49mm","wi":"69.43mm","file":"US08957086-20150217-C00087.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00088","num":"00088"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00088","he":"200.66mm","wi":"74.59mm","file":"US08957086-20150217-C00088.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Compounds of structural formula (II) can be synthesized by methods set forth herein and in U.S. Pat.

GTN itself, proposed as a neuroprotective agent, has no clinical utility as a neuroprotective agent in therapy owing to its extraordinarily high vasodilatory potency. Similarly, by extrapolation, 1,2,3-trinitratopropane (GTN) derivatives are not expected to have clinical utility as neuroprotective agents in therapy owing to their especially high vasodilatory potency.","It will additionally be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the use of an organic nitrate of structural formula (II) in cognition enhancement therapy represents a new and useful treatment for cognition enhancement, particularly in treatment of diseases and conditions including, but not limited to, stroke; dementias of all type, trauma, drug-induced brain damage, and aging.","In particular, the compounds of structural formula (II) comprise at least one nitrate group. The nitrate groups(s) optionally can be covalently bound to a carrier moiety or molecule (e.g., an aromatic group, an aliphatic group, peptide, steroid, nucleoside, peptidomimetic, steroidomimetic, or nucleoside analogue, or the like). In addition to functioning as a carrier for the nitrate functionality, the carrier moiety or molecule can enable the compound to traverse biological membranes and to be biodistributed preferentially, without excessive or premature metabolism. Further, in addition to functioning as a carrier for the nitrate functionality, the carrier moiety or molecule can enable the compound to exert amplified neuroprotective effects and\/or cognition enhancement through synergism with the nitrate functionality.","Carrier moieties useful in the present invention also include moieties that allow a present compound to be selectively delivered to a target organ. For example, delivery of a present compound to the brain may be enhanced by a carrier moiety using either active or passive transport (a \u201ctargeting moiety\u201d). For example, the carrier molecule can be a redox moiety, as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,540,654 and 5,389,623, each incorporated herein by reference. These patents disclose drugs linked to dihydropyridine moieties that can enter the brain, where they are oxidized to a charged pyridinium species which is trapped in the brain. The drugs therefore accumulate in the brain. Other carrier moieties include compounds, such as amino acids or thyroxine, that can be passively or actively transported in vivo. Such a carrier moiety can be metabolically removed in vivo, or can remain intact as part of an active compound. Structural mimics of amino acids (and other actively transported moieties) including peptidomimetics, are also useful in the invention. As used herein, the term \u201cpeptidomimetic\u201d includes peptide analogues that serve as appropriate substitutes for peptides in interactions with, for example, receptors and enzymes. The peptodomimetic must possess not only affinity, but also efficacy and substrate function. A peptidomimetic therefore exhibits functions of a peptide, without restriction of structure to amino acid constituents. Peptidomimetics and methods for their preparation and use are described in Morgan et al. (1989). Many targeting moieties are known, and include, for example, asialoglycoproteins (see e.g., Wu, U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,320, incorporated herein by reference) and other ligands which are transported into cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.","The compounds of structural formula (I) and (II) can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the compounds of structural formula (I) and (II) cross the BBB, they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331, each incorporated herein by reference. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs (\u201ctargeting moieties\u201d), thus providing targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., Ranade et al., 1989). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate and biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016, incorporated herein by reference); mannosides (Umezawa et al., 1988), antibodies (Bloeman et al., 1995; Owais et al., 1995), and surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al., 1995). In one preferred embodiment, the compounds of structural formula (I) and (II) are formulated in liposomes. In more preferred embodiments, the liposomes include a targeting moiety.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating an above disclosed disease or condition by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) to an individual in need thereof. A method of the present invention can be accomplished by administering a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) as the neat compound or as a pharmaceutical composition. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition, or neat compound, can be performed during or after the onset of the disease or condition. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions are sterile, and contain no toxic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic compounds that would cause an adverse reaction when administered.","The present invention also is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of structural formula (I) or (II). Further provided are kits comprising a compound of structural formula (I) or (II), and an insert having instructions for using the compound.","In the present method, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compound of structural formula (I) or (II), typically formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical practice, is administered to a mammal in need thereof. Whether such a treatment is indicated depends on the individual case and is subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) that takes into consideration signs, symptoms, and\/or malfunctions that are present, the risks of developing particular signs, symptoms and\/or malfunctions, and other factors. Typically, the mammal is a human being.","A compound of the invention can be administered by any suitable route, for example by oral, buccal, inhalation, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, intracistemal or intrathecal through lumbar puncture, transurethral, nasal, percutaneous, i.e., transdermal, or parenteral (including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracoronary, intradermal, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and\/or surgical implantation at a particular site) administration. Parenteral administration can be accomplished using a needle and syringe or using a high pressure technique.","Pharmaceutical compositions include those wherein a present compound of the invention is administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage is determined by an individual physician in view of the diagnosed disease or condition. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide levels of a compound of the invention that is sufficient to maintain therapeutic effects.","Compounds of structural formula (I) and (II) are administered at a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to mitigate neurodegeneration, to effect neuroprotection, to effect cognition enhancement, and\/or to prevent or mitigate tissue and\/or cellular damage in a subject. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d mitigates neurodegeneration by about 20%, preferably by about 40%, more preferably by about 60%, and still more preferably by about 80%, relative to untreated subjects. The ability of a compound of structural formula (I) and (II) to mitigate neurodegeneration can be evaluated in model systems predictive of efficacy in mitigating neurodegeneration in human diseases, such as animal model systems known in the art (e.g., the method of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat) or by in vitro methods, (e.g., the assays described herein).","The ability of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) to mitigate neurodegeneration can be evaluated by observation of one or more symptoms or signs associated with neurodegeneration in vivo. For example, the ability of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) to mitigate neurodegeneration can be associated with an observable improvement in a clinical manifestation of the underlying neurodegeneration-related disease or condition, or a slowing or delay in progression of symptoms of the condition. Thus, monitoring of clinical manifestations of disease can be useful in evaluating the neurodegeneration-mitigating efficacy of a compound of the invention.","Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which is expressed as the ratio between LDand ED. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from such data can be used in formulating a dosage range for use in humans and other mammals. The dosage preferably lies within a range of circulating compound concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed, and the route of administration utilized. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.","A therapeutically effective amount of a present compound required for use in therapy varies with the nature of the disease or condition being treated, the length of time that activity is desired, and the age and the condition of the patient, and ultimately is determined by the attendant physician. Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound that are sufficient to maintain the desired therapeutic effects. The desired dose conveniently can be administered in a single dose, or as multiple doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as one, two, three, four or more subdoses per day. For example, a present compound can be administered at a frequency of: four doses delivered as one dose per day at four-day intervals (q4d\u00d74); four doses delivered as one close per day at three-day intervals (q3d\u00d74); one dose delivered per day at five-day intervals (qd\u00d75); one dose per week for three weeks (qwk3); five daily doses, with two days rest, and another five daily doses (5\/2\/5); or, any dose regimen determined to be appropriate for the circumstance.","The dosage of a composition containing a compound of structural formula (I) or (II), can be from about 1 ng\/kg to about 200 mg\/kg, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, or about 1 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg.

The dosage of a composition may be at any dosage including, but not limited to, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg, 10 \u03bcg\/kg, 25 \u03bcg\/kg, 50 \u03bcg\/kg, 75 \u03bcg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg, 125 \u03bcg\/kg, 150 \u03bcg\/kg, 175 \u03bcg\/kg, 200 \u03bcg\/kg, 225 \u03bcg\/kg, 250 \u03bcg\/kg, 275 \u03bcg\/kg, 300 \u03bcg\/kg, 325 \u03bcg\/kg, 350 \u03bcg\/kg, 375 \u03bcg\/kg, 400 \u03bcg\/kg, 425 \u03bcg\/kg, 450 \u03bcg\/kg, 475 \u03bcg\/kg, 500 \u03bcg\/kg, 525 \u03bcg\/kg, 550 \u03bcg\/kg, 575 \u03bcg\/kg, 600 \u03bcg\/kg, 625 \u03bcg\/kg, 650 \u03bcg\/kg, 675 \u03bcg\/kg, 700 \u03bcg\/kg, 725 \u03bcg\/kg, 750 \u03bcg\/kg, 775 \u03bcg\/kg, 800 \u03bcg\/kg, 825 \u03bcg\/kg, 850 \u03bcg\/kg, 875 \u03bcg\/kg, 900 \u03bcg\/kg, 925 \u03bcg\/kg, 950 \u03bcg\/kg, 975 \u03bcg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg, 5 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg, 15 mg\/kg, 20 mg\/kg, 25 mg\/kg, 30 mg\/kg, 35 mg\/kg, 40 mg\/kg, 45 mg\/kg, 50 mg\/kg, 60 mg\/kg, 70 mg\/kg, 80 mg\/kg, 90 mg\/kg, 100 mg\/kg, 125 mg\/kg, 150 mg\/kg, 175 mg\/kg, or 200 mg\/kg. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case, but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. In practice, the physician determines the actual dosing regimen that is most suitable for an individual patient, which can vary with the age, weight, and response of the particular patient.","A compound of structural formula (I) or (II) used in a method of the present invention can be administered in an amount of about 0.005 to about 200 milligrams per dose, about 0.05 to about 150 milligrams per dose, or about 0.5 to about 100 milligrams per dose. For example, a present compound, can be administered, per dose, in an amount of about 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, 150, or 200 milligrams, including all doses between 0.005 and 200 milligrams.","The compound typically are administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of present compounds.","These pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured, for example, by conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. When a therapeutically effective amount of a present compound is administered orally, the composition typically is in the form of a tablet, capsule, powder, solution, or elixir. When administered in tablet form, the composition additionally can contain a solid carrier, such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. The tablet, capsule, and powder contain about 0.01% to about 95%, and preferably from about 1% to about 50%, of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II). When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier, such as water, petroleum, or oils of animal or plant origin, can be added. The liquid form of the composition can further contain physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solutions, or glycols. When administered in liquid form, the composition contains about 0.1% to about 90%, and preferably about 1% to about 50%, by weight, of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II).","When a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) is administered by intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection, the composition is in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection typically contains, an isotonic vehicle. A present compound can be infused with other fluids over a 10-30 minute span or over several hours.","A present compound can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding a present compound to a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added.","Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In some cases, it is preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols, such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be achieved by including an agent that delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.","A compound of structural formula (I) or (II) can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents.","It is advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in a unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. \u201cUnit dosage form\u201d as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated. Each dose unit contains a predetermined quantity of a present compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical vehicle. The dosage unit forms are dictated by and are directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the compound of structural formula (I) or (II) and (b) the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of a compound of structural formula (I) or (II) can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally, the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","A compound of structural formula (I) or (II) also can be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously, a present compound also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a compound can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins.","In particular, a compound can be administered orally, buccally, or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients, such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules, either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents. A present compound also can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intracoronarily.
