Browsing and internet\/IP communications are limited to web browsing when not moving. To reduce cost of communications, to offer better services and to automate assistance, the use of RTC (Real Time Communications) in vehicle is desirable. In the case of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) service providers additional questions can be raised: how to best provide the IP-based RTC services considering time to market and overall cost. So far dedicated networks and solutions have often been involved to provide services like remote monitoring and management, navigation support, in car communications and emergency systems. As IP based networks and services become available it is of interest to explore their adequacy and recommended approaches to develop IP-Based multimedia services in vehicle. Hence, there is a need for improved methods and systems for providing an in-vehicle, multimedia, real-time communication system.","Embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for providing an in-vehicle, multimedia, real-time communication system. According to one embodiment, a system for providing in-vehicle communication services can comprise a communications network and a vehicle user agent communicatively coupled with the first communications network, wherein the vehicle user agent publishes one or more published presence attributes. A Service Delivery Platform (SDP) can be communicatively coupled with the communications network. The SDP can provide a presence service adapted to receive the one or more published presence attributes from the vehicle user agent and update a presence profile for the vehicle user agent based on the received presence attributes. The presence attributes can comprise at least one attribute indicating information other than presence information and to provide one or more telco functions to the vehicle user agent. For example, the one or more published presence attributes can comprise at least one attribute indicating a vehicle location and\/or at least one attribute indicating vehicle telemetrics. The one or more telco functions can comprise, for example, a charging function, a Quality of Service (QoS) management and enforcement function, and\/or a presence service.","In some cases, the SDP can be further adapted to provide one or more services with features as provided by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). For example, the one or more services can comprise a streaming media service, an IP television service, a multimedia messaging service, an instant messaging service, a telephony service, a presence service, a push-to-talk service, a conference service, e.g., a voice conference service or a multimedia conference service, a download service, an upload service, etc.","In some cases, the SDP can be further adapted to maintain a communication session with the vehicle user agent upon a failure of the session on the communication network. For example, the SDP can further comprise a media server. In such a case, maintaining the communication session can comprise maintaining a state of the communication session with the media server. Maintain the communication session can comprise resuming the communication session with the vehicle user agent on the communication network or on a second communication network.","According to another embodiment, a method for providing in-vehicle communication services can comprise publishing one or more presence attributes with a vehicle user agent to a presence service. The one or more published presence attributes can be received from the vehicle user agent at the presence service. A presence profile for the vehicle user agent can be updated with the presence service based on the received presence attributes. The presence attributes can comprise at least one attribute indicating information other than presence information and to provide one or more telco functions to the vehicle user agent. For example, the one or more published presence attributes can comprise one or more of an attribute indicating a vehicle location and an attribute indicating vehicle telemetrics. The one or more telco functions can be selected from a group consisting of: a charging function; a Quality of Service (QoS) management and enforcement function; and a presence service.","In some cases, the presence service can be provided by a Service Delivery Platform (SDP). In such cases, the SDP can provide one or more services with features as provided by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). For example, the one or more services can be selected from a group consisting of: a streaming media service; an IP television service; a multimedia messaging service; an instant messaging service; a telephony service; a presence service; a push-to-talk service; a conference service; a voice conference service; a download service; and an upload service.","According to yet another embodiment, a machine-readable medium can have stored thereon a series of executable instructions which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to provide in-vehicle communication services by receiving one or more published presence attributes from a vehicle user agent at a presence service of a Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The one or more published presence attributes can comprise one or more of an attribute indicating a vehicle location and an attribute indicating vehicle telemetrics. A presence profile for the vehicle user agent can be updated with the presence service based on the received presence attributes. The presence attributes can comprise at least one attribute indicating information other than presence information and to provide one or more telco functions to the vehicle user agent. The one or more telco functions can be selected from a group consisting of: a charging function; a Quality of Service (QoS) management and enforcement function; and a presence service. One or more services with features as provided by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) can also be provided by the SDP. The one or more services can be selected from a group consisting of: a streaming media service; an IP television service; a multimedia messaging service; an instant messaging service; a telephony service; a presence service; a push-to-talk service; a conference service; a voice conference service; a download service; and an upload service.","In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention.

According to one embodiment, an in-vehicle multimedia real-time communication system can be implemented based on the methods and systems described in the Related Application entitled Pragmatic Approaches to IMS. For example, a SIP\/SIMPLE embodiment of a presence\/VoIP Real Time communication solution in-vehicle can be implemented based on the methods and systems described in the Related Applications.

According to one embodiment, a Real Time Communication (RTC) RTC system for example including a communicator as multimedia instant messaging with video and VoIP, can be integrated with a set of on board sensors and collecting and monitoring systems. The data collected can then be uploaded to the SDP. According to one embodiment, the SDP can be implemented according to the methods and systems described in the Related Application entitled \u201cPragmatic Approaches to IMS\u201d a portion of which is reproduced here for the sake of convenience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","310","315","310","315","320","325","320","325"]},"The SDP  can include a number of enablers - including but not limited to a Parlay API implementation , a Parlay X implementation  and\/or other enablers  and . The various enablers - are defined to provide reusable, composable components with specific functions and can be adapted to provide an abstract interface to network resources  and ,  and . According to one embodiment, the Parlay API implementation  and Parlay X implementation  (and any other enablers) can be implemented with southbound adapters to SIP or other protocols e.g. via JCA 1.5 or other protocols. When they consist of Parlay, they can be provided by an OSA application server The SDP  can also include one or more bindings - adapted to provide standard northbound interfaces for the one or more enablers -. According to one embodiment, the enablers and interfaces can be implemented according to the methods and systems described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/951,500 filed Dec. 6, 2007 by Maes and entitled \u201cAchieving Low Latencies on Network Events in a Non-Real Time Platform\u201d of which the entire disclosure is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Such a horizontal platform can be standards-based and follow the SDP blueprint described in the Related Application entitled \u201cFactorization of Concerns to Build a SDP (Service Deliver Platform) referenced above. Accordingly, applications  and  can be based on the SOA composition of reusable piece of codes (i.e. enablers -) that expose relevant and intrinsic communications functionalities along with other reusable services which may not be standard or expose intrinsic functions. Intrinsic means that one type of functions relevant to the nature of the enabler is exposed and other aspects that are driven by business rules need not included. So for example, a messaging enabler need not include authentication, authorization, charging etc. These functions can be left to other enablers composed by the application  or  to add these features based on the business rules (aka policies). Enablers - when implemented by driving network resources or OSS\/BSS resources can do that through an adapter approach. The same enabler - can use different adapters to be realized\/implemented on different network technologies or using equipment from different vendors (when non standard). Doing this, the same enablers - can be deployed or even coexist on multiple network technologies like legacy networks (e.g. PSTN, IN, . . . with our without Parlay\/OSA GWs), against other network resources (e.g. messaging GWs), on internet and on IMS and variations (e.g., pre-IMS, different release or IMS variations across standard bodies, future IMS etc.).","The SDP  can also include one or more policy enforcers . The policy enforcer  can be adapted to apply one or more policies to messages to or from the one or more enablers -. A policy can be defined as any combination of a condition and one or more associated actions. Therefore, policies can be enforced to implement and\/or enforce a service oriented architecture, factor out business rules, and define interactions between applications  and . Policies can be implemented and\/or enforced by the policy enforcers  of the SDP , for example, according to the methods and systems described in one or more of the following applications: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/024,160 filed Dec. 27, 2004 by Maes and entitled \u201cPolicies as Workflows;\u201d U.S. patent application Ser.

Standard interfaces can lead to Java and web services bindings  and other technologies like C, C+, etc. Enablers - can be composed via SOA. The policy enforcer  can be a SOA composition\/orchestration engine. As such, it applies the business rules when the enablers - are used by applications  and  when trying to use an enabler message and responses can be intercepted by the policy enforcer  that enforces the policies by composing calls to other enablers and resources as specified by the policies. This can be generalized to any composition. Applications  and  can compose enablers - to take advantage of communications features. There are no differences between local and remote, trusted or un-trusted applications. They only differ by the fact that different policies\/business rules apply. Of course, it is possible that local applications rely on different bindings than remote applications. Enablers that are contemplated and considered to be within the scope of the present invention include but are not limited to a call control enabler as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/949,930 filed Dec. 4, 2007 by Maes and entitled \u201cCall Control Enabler Abstracted from Underlying Network Technologies\u201d, a media server control enabler as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/877,129 filed Oct. 23, 2007 by Maes and entitled \u201cNetwork Agnostic Media Server Control Enabler\u201d, an intelligent messaging enabler as described in U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 12\/544,484 filed Aug. 20, 2009 by Maes and entitled \u201cCharging Enabler\u201d of which the entire disclosure of each is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. As described in the referenced applications and herein, these enablers can operate on different networks with possibly different underlying technologies while abstracting that technologies to the applications utilizing the functions provided by those enablers.","The set of enablers - can expose both network and application specific common, reusable intrinsic functions. Furthermore, the framework for specifying enablers - should be extensible so that additional enablers can be developed as needed. Enablers - can be reusable components that expose a useful set of network or application specific capability through northbound, standardized APIs. In the case of a J2EE realization of the SDP , such APIs can be exposed through either Java APIs, Web Services , or other bindings (e.g. SOAP, REST, etc.) -. Enablers - can be realized via southbound adapters on the underlying network resources\/network technologies. In particular they can be intended to be realizable on vanilla SIP networks (e.g., IETF), IMS, PSTN, IN or any other network technology as appropriate. South bound interfaces to implement the enablers - on any underlying network or resources can rely on JCA 1.5 with a design for high throughput and predictable low latencies, e.g. Parlay Corba adapters to Parlay GW\/SCSs, Diameter, Connectors to legacy\/proprietary resources like messaging GWs, Billing systems (e.g. Oracle BRM); SIP; HTTP as well as towards OSS and BSS. Other technologies can include but are not limited to RA, RMI, etc.","Enablers - can provide functions they're designed to provide (e.g., user location or call control) and should explicitly not provide that are set up by an operator's policies (e.g., security, authentication, authorization, SLA\/QoS, Charging). Execution and enforcement of such policies are appropriately handled by the SOA layer (detailed in the Related Applications). Parlay API implementations  (e.g. Java realizations) and Parlay X API implementations  (i.e. web services bindings) can include, for example, call control, messaging\/notification, charging, location, terminal status, and user interaction.","Generally speaking, the SDP  provides an architecture framework that describes the interaction with and among enablers -, services  and  and resources  and . According to one embodiment, the SDP  can be implemented as a Service Orchestration Architecture (SOA). For example, the blueprint described in the Related Application entitled \u201cFactorization of Concerns to Build a SDP (Service Delivery Platform)\u201d referenced above and derived from the SDP  ensures that enablers - correctly abstract the network technologies. As a result, an application  or  is not affected by the coexistence or migration across network technologies as long that the network can bear the same capabilities.","As noted in the Related Applications, IMS can be considered to be Internet (IP Network) plus a set of useful features for consumers  and  or Communications Service Providers. These functions can include, for example, Charging, Security (Access control, Authentication, Firewall, etc.), Subscription Management, Policy enforcement, QoS, Logging, Support for specific Telco Services (e.g. Voice). The functions that matter may vary based on what the service provider wants to achieve and what are the dependencies on the network of the applications that the service provider wants to provide. The Internet or other IP network plus these Telco functions allows development of multimedia services as on the IMS. Indeed and as a particular and preferred embodiment, a SDP implemented according to the embodiments described above can provide the same services that can be developed and deployed on any network providing the required capabilities. This is the case of the IMS, Internet plus Telco functions or on legacy networks (PSTN, etc.).","Additionally or alternatively, services like presence, IM, VoIP, PBX, IPTV, video chat, multimedia real-time communications, conferencing, etc. can be implemented by various custom and\/or standard enablers of the SDP. As described in the Related Applications, these enablers can operate on different networks with possibly different underlying technologies while abstracting that technologies to the applications utilizing the functions provided by those enablers. Therefore, a service platform like SDP can be used to develop\/deploy services across different networks. Furthermore, these services can include in-vehicle communication services. These services can include multimedia and real-time communications over one or more networks. Therefore, roaming and continuity of service can be addressed with an approach consistent with the pragmatic IMS approach disclosed in the Related Application entitled \u201cPragmatic Approaches to IMS.\u201d This can include using a media server using call control enabler and media server control enabler to provide continuity (hold the call) when switching networks or when coverage drops.

According to one embodiment and as noted above, collection of such telemetry data or \u201ctelematics\u201d from the vehicle can be performed according to the methods and systems described in the Related Applications entitled \u201cPresence-Based Event-Driven Architecture\u201d and \u201cUsing Location as Presence Attributes.\u201d In other words, telematic data for the vehicle  can be provided to the SDP  as presence information collected and published, for example, by a user agent (not shown here) in or for the vehicle .","As noted in the Related Application entitled \u201cPresence-Based Event-Driven Architecture,\u201d a presence-based network can be used for monitoring of systems, devices, or agents, e.g., the vehicle  and\/or an agent associated with the vehicle . More specifically, a presence network can be used to implement systems such as an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) by extending a presence profile to include attributes indicating information other than or in addition to presence information, e.g., telematics for the vehicle . As described in \u201cPresence-Based Event-Driven Architecture,\u201d presence attributes can be used to identify or indicate any type of information related to the principal, i.e., the vehicle or user agent associated with the vehicle. For example, such information can include but is not limited to a state or status of a device or process, a reading or measurement from a device such as a sensor, information collected or generated by an application or process, etc, as well as presence information. Additionally or alternatively, information indicated by the presence attributes can include other types of information. For example, information indicated by one or more presence attributes can include but is not limited to a multimedia document, a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to a document of stream, etc.","As described in detail in the Related Application, a presence attribute can be defined for any type of information of a device, system, agent, or other entity to be monitored that can then be used, i.e., published\/subscribed. That is, presence information can be obtained by the SDP  and\/or services - using a subscribe\/publish model wherein a vehicle  or agent publishes presence attributes to the SDP  which in turn notifies authorized subscribers, e.g., services -, of the information or change of information. Thus, when the telematic information of the vehicle changes or another event occurs, the presence attributes in the presence profile of that vehicle can be updated and the update can be published to one or more services -. Additionally or alternatively, presence information can be obtained by the services - by interrogating or querying the repository  which in turn responds to the query.","Data collected by sensors of the vehicle  or network can be provided as presence attributes associated with the vehicle, exploiting the extensibility of the presence data model. Interested parties (e.g., diagnostic and monitoring or other services) can subscribe to the information. According to one embodiment, the edge server  can be set up as a presence network agent. Notification in such case can be immediate. Doing so can avoid a need to use requiring specific protocol adapters and provides immediate notification. In such cases, event filtering, interpretation, etc. may be done in the vehicle. When the processing is left to the server, notifications can be generated via the messaging enabler integrated with BPEL.","Location can be determined by the vehicle (e.g. via GPS) and\/or in the network and published, for example by the presence network agent of the edge server , to the SDP  where the vehicle  can collect it. This method is especially useful when GPS is not available (e.g. out of the line of sight of satellites). In some implementations, location information for fleet management can be published as presence attributes associated to the individual vehicles of the fleet. As a result, client and server based applications can rely on a presence based programming model to access and exploit presence. The applications may be part of the presence network and\/or can rely on the Parlay X presence interface exposed by the presence enabler as northbound enabler interface as described in the Related Applications. For example, a navigation application can be built using the location information.","Additionally or alternatively and as noted above, the SDP  can be adapted to provide one or more multimedia services to the vehicle  over the communication network as described, for example, in the Related Application entitled \u201cPragmatic Approaches to IMS.\u201d For example, the SDP , through the various services -, can provide one or more telco functions to the vehicle . For example, the one or more telco functions can comprise voice services, a charging function, a Quality of Service (QoS) management and enforcement function, a presence service, etc. The SDP  can be further adapted to provide one or more services with features as provided by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). For example, such services can comprise a streaming media service, an IP television service, a multimedia messaging service, an instant messaging service, a telephony service, a presence service, a push-to-talk service, a voice and\/or multimedia conference service, a download service, an upload service, etc. Interaction with assistance operators, authorized parties and BOTs can be provided via a multimedia messaging client that can support, for example presence, buddy lists, IM, VoIP chat, Video chat, IM to SMS in\/out and other messaging channels. The client can also be integrated with a virtual PBX that allows the drive to set hunting groups and manage queues of incoming calls (send to other numbers or users, send to voicemail, put on hold etc).","Stated another way, a system  for providing in-vehicle communication services, can comprise a communications network such as one or more cellular or other mobile networks. A user agent for the vehicle  can be communicatively coupled with the communications network. The user agent can publish one or more presence attributes for the vehicle . For example, the one or more published presence attributes can comprise one or more attributes indicating a vehicle location and\/or one or more attributes indicating vehicle telemetrics.","An SDP  can be communicatively coupled with the communications network. The SDP  can provide a presence service adapted to receive the one or more published presence attributes from the user agent of the vehicle  and update a presence profile, e.g., maintained in repository , for the vehicle  based on the received presence attributes. As noted, the presence attributes can comprise at least one attribute indicating information other than presence information, e.g., various system information and other telematics. The SDP , through the various services -, can be further adapted to provide one or more telco functions to the vehicle. For example, the one or more telco functions can comprise a charging function, a Quality of Service (QoS) management and enforcement function, a presence service, etc. The SDP  can be further adapted to provide one or more services with features as provided by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). For example, such services can comprise a streaming media service, an IP television service, a multimedia messaging service, an instant messaging service, a telephony service, a presence service, a push-to-talk service, a voice and\/or multimedia conference service, a download service, an upload service, etc.","Thus, in use, the SDP  with SOA  can be used to exploit many of conventional tools and capabilities provide with IT platforms. For example, using Business activity Monitoring (BAM) as part of the SOA , an administrator or the driver of the vehicle  can be presented (in real time or in a differed mode), diagnostic information collected from the vehicle . Business intelligence tools can then be applied to study the data and possibly issue warnings, initiate campaigns or manage a fleet.","As is typical with most mobile communication networks, drops in the coverage or poor communications may occur, especially as the vehicle moves. According to the pragmatic IMS described in the Related Application entitled \u201cPragmatic Approaches to IMS,\u201d the SDP  and telco functions can be adapted to provide continuity as will be described below with reference to . In some cases, service continuity can include switching or changing between available networks. For example, a session started over a WLAN may be continues over a cellular network. In another cases, a session on a network may be put on hold and resumed when coverage is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","501","402","500","545","501","550","545","550","501","505","540"]},"According to one embodiment, the application  and\/or SDP  can be adapted to support call continuity with the user agent . In some cases, service continuity can include switching or changing between available networks. For example, a session started over the first network  may be continued over a second network  if available. In another cases, for example if the second network  is unavailable, the session on the first network  may be put on hold and resumed when coverage is again available.","For example, such continuity can be achieved according to the methods and systems described in the Related Applications entitled \u201cIn-Session Continuation via Data Server\u201d and \u201cService Level Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Enforcement.\u201d As described therein, a call or media interaction on the first network , using the call control enabler , can be put in a conference call with a media server  controlled via the media server enabler . When the connection on the first network  is dropped, the rest of the interaction can be paused in the media server  and other calls can remain active. Clients can try to reconnect when the first network  is again available or established on the second network . In other cases, the media server  may try to do the same (e.g. when it detects the clients' presence). In either case, the session can then be resumed. If others parties to the session that is placed on hold are other users, messages played by the media server  can ask the parties to wait for the user to come into new coverage zone and, based on location, may even estimate how long it will take (i.e., how long to reach a decent coverage area). Such an infrastructure plus media server is an example of Telco functions that can be added as desired according to the methods and systems of the Related Application entitled \u201cPragmatic Approaches to IMS.\u201d","Stated another way, the SDP  can be adapted to maintain a communication session with the vehicle user agent  upon a failure of the session on the first communication network . A media server  can be adapted to maintain a state of the communication session. The communication session can be resumed with the vehicle user agent  on the first communication network  if or when it becomes available again or can be resumed on the second communication network  if or when it becomes available.","In the foregoing description, for the purposes of illustration, methods were described in a particular order.
