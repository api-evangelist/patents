title: Automated method of decomposing scanned documents
abstract: Some embodiments produce an image capture application that implements a novel auto scan feature. The auto scan feature directs a scanner to perform an initial scan and then decomposes the scanned document into component regions. Some embodiments then identify a set of attributes of each region from the initial scan, select a set of optimal scanning parameters for each region based on the identified set of attributes, and then direct the scanner to perform a detailed secondary scan of each region with the identified set of scanning parameters. Following the secondary scan, some embodiments perform post-scan operations on the image of the scanned region.

Appendix A","Image Kit APIs","VIII. Appendix B","Image Capture Core APIs"],"p":["This Application is related to the following applications: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/479,853, filed Jun. 7, 2009; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/479,854, filed Jun. 7, 2009.","The present inventions relate to image capture software.","Many devices are available to capture images for a computer. Computer applications that control individual image capture devices are often provided by the manufactures of those devices. For example, makers of document scanners provide software to enable a user of a computer to scan documents into the computer.","Some image capture devices allow a user to lay an item such as a photograph flat upon a glass scanning bed through which a scanning head of the image capture device shines a light and through which the scanning head takes an image of the item. The image data is converted into binary form and the scanner sends the data to a computer. Some scanners are capable of scanning a subsection of the glass. Such scanners receive identifications of subsections to be scanned from the computer. By scanning small areas of the glass, instead of the entire glass the scanners save and produce less image data. At higher resolutions, the amount of image data required to represent a small subsection of the glass is much smaller than the amount of image data required to represent the entire glass.","Some image capture applications are available that control more than one image capture device. However, such image capture applications do not easily switch between image capture devices.","Some embodiments of the invention provide an image capture application that detects available image capture devices and controls them. The image capture application of some embodiments implements the following novel features: (1) a novel user interface (UI) feature, (2) a novel auto-scan feature, and (3) a novel manual scan feature. Each of these features will be sequentially described below.","Some embodiments of the image capture application implement a novel UI feature. In some embodiments, the UI feature provides a GUI that displays a window with multiple window areas including (1) a first window area that includes a menu of the available image capture devices automatically detected by the image capture application and (2) a second window for displaying controls for individual scanners. The menu allows a user to select a particular device from among the multiple devices in the first window area. In some embodiments, when a user selects a particular image capture device in the first window area, the GUI manifests controls for that particular device in the second window area. The controls allow the user to set various parameters for the image capture device.","Some embodiments display different controls for different scanners. In some embodiments, the specific set of controls displayed for a particular scanner is chosen by a driver associated with that scanner. Some embodiments provide a set of generic controls that are usable by device driver manufacturers to allow a particular scanner to interface with the image capture application. These controls include controls that are common to most if not all scanners, such as a control for setting the resolution of a scan, a control for setting the color depth (the number of colors per pixel) of a scan, and controls for setting the orientation of a scan. Some embodiments also allow scanner drivers to define the features of controls which are (1) not previously defined by the image capture application, and (2) specific to the scanner associated with the driver. In some embodiments, the image capture application provides a control that allows a user to select a separate application to receive scanned images.","Some embodiments of the image capture application implement a novel auto-scan feature. Some embodiments of the auto-scan feature (1) automatically decompose a scanned document into one or more component regions and (2) perform scans of the component regions. In some embodiments, the image capture application directs the scanner to first produce an initial scan. The image capture application then identifies a set of attributes of the document from the initial scan, selects a set of optimal scanning parameters based on the identified set of attributes, and then directs the scanner to perform a detailed secondary scan with the identified set of scanning parameters. Following the secondary scan, some embodiments of the image capture application with an auto-scan feature perform post-scan operations.","The initial scan produces a scanned document. The scanned document, sometimes referred to as a scanned electronic document, is an electronic image of the contents of the scanner glass of a flatbed scanner, or a page that is fed through a document feeder on a scanner. In some embodiments the scanned document is a relatively low resolution image. Some embodiments perform a series of image processing operations on the scanned document to ascertain the borders of component regions and to distinguish the component regions from the scanner background and noise artifacts. In some embodiments, these operations include thresholding, seed filling, group seed filling, edge detection, and boundary identification (e.g., by a Hough transform).","The auto-scan feature analyzes each component region to identify a set of attributes for each component region. Examples of such attributes include the type of content (e.g., text, image, etc.), the color of the content (e.g., black and white, grey scale, color, etc.), and the orientation of the component region. The auto-scan feature derives a set of scan parameters for each component region according to the component region's identified attributes. Some embodiments then perform a secondary scan on each component region using the scan parameters derived from the component region's attributes.","In some embodiments, the image capture application performs post-scan operations on a component region after the secondary scan. Specifically as needed, the auto-scan feature performs alignment, optical character recognition (OCR), storage or other operations on the component region. In some embodiments, the auto-scan feature also delivers data or images to applications other than the image capture application.","Some embodiments of the image capture application also implement a novel manual scan feature. In some embodiments, an image capture application with a manual scan feature automatically identifies regions in a similar manner to the auto-scan, but rather than automatically performing the secondary scans, the image capture application provides a manual scanning tool that enables the user to manually adjust the regions. Some embodiments further provide tools such as visual indicators of the size, location, and orientation of identified regions. In some embodiments, a set of guidelines are provided to show the user the original location and orientation of the automatically identified region. The guidelines provide a set of reference lines that allow a user to identify directions relative to a selected, automatically identified region. In some embodiments, since the image capture application automatically selects a set of scan parameters for automatically identified regions, the manual scan feature provides scanner controls that enable the user to manually override the automatically selected scan parameters.","Some embodiments implement all of the above described features. Other embodiments implement a subset of the above described features For example, an image capture application may implement some of the above described features without implementing all of them. Moreover, some embodiments do not implement these features as one image capture application, but instead provide the features as frameworks (sometimes called libraries) for other applications to build image capture interfaces upon. For instance, some embodiments provide some or all these features as APIs in a framework provided by the operating system of a device such as a computer. Some embodiments provide these features to third party application developers to integrate into third party applications. The frameworks of some embodiments are designed to interact with modules of the operating system. Under such an approach, a developer of an application that runs on the operating system can access the above described features through the APIs. By accessing the frameworks through the APIs the developers can add functionalities such as the novel UI feature, the novel auto-scan feature or the novel manual scan feature to their applications.","In the following detailed description of the invention, numerous details, examples, and embodiments of the invention are set forth and described. However, it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention may be practiced without some of the specific details and examples discussed.","Some embodiments of the invention provide an image capture application that manages multiple image capture devices from multiple manufacturers. The image capture application of some embodiments detects image capture devices connected to the computer on which the image capture application is running. In some embodiments the image capture application also detects image capture devices that are shared on a network that is connected to the computer on which the image capture application is running. The image capture application of some embodiments detects multiple types of devices include scanners, cameras, and memory devices that store images. Some embodiments manage multiple types of devices (e.g., cameras and scanners). Some embodiments manage a single type of device (e.g., scanners only).","In some embodiments, the image capture application includes a graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d). The GUIs of some embodiments display a window with a first window area that includes a menu of the available image capture devices. The menu allows a user to select a particular device from among the multiple devices in the first window area. In some embodiments, when a user selects a particular image capture device in the first window area, the GUI manifests controls for that particular device in a second area of the window that includes the menu of available image capture devices. That is, the GUI simultaneously displays, in a single window, the multiple image capture devices (from different manufacturers) and the particular controls for the selected image capture device. The controls allow the user to set various parameters for the image capture device. An example of such an image capture application is illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","100","101","102","103","104"]},"As shown in , the GUI  includes device display area , which includes icons , , and , scan display area  (in stages -), control area , and thumbnail display area  (in stage ). The device display area  displays a menu of image capture devices that are available to the image capture application. The scan display area  visually presents images captured by scanners. The control area  displays controls that manage particular scanners and functions of the image capture application that relate to particular scanners. Thumbnail display area  shows miniature representations of images stored in a digital camera or other image recording device.","The operation of the GUI  will now be described by reference to the state of the GUI  during the four stages -. Stage  shows the GUI  after the image capture application has detected available image capture devices and populated the menu in device display area  with the detected devices. The image capture application allows users to select image capture devices from the menu. The device display area  shows icons  and , which represent detected scanners, and icon , which represents a detected camera. None of the icons have been selected in stage . Accordingly, the scan display area  is empty. As shown in stage , in some embodiments, when no image capture device is selected, the GUI  displays a default set of scanner controls  in control area . In some embodiments, the default controls  are not shown when no scanner has been selected. In other embodiments, default controls  are shown even when no scanner has been selected, though the controls remain inactive.","Stage  shows the GUI  when scanner icon  is selected (as indicated by its inverted colors). As a result of the selection, the image capture application has commanded the scanner represented by scanner icon  to perform a preview scan of the glass of the scanner. The preview scan is a low resolution scan performed to get general data about the item(s) on the glass. As used herein, the glass of the scanner refers to the area of the scanner on which items are placed to have their images captured. The scanner glass is sometimes referred to as a \u201cscanner bed\u201d. In the illustrated embodiment, the scanner has performed the scan and is displaying preview  in scan display area . Preview  shows the images of photographs on the scanner. As used herein \u201cpreview data\u201d is the raw data received from the scanner during a preview scan. A \u201cpreview\u201d refers to the display of that preview data as an image. In some embodiments, a preview may include various overlays and indicators as well as the image itself.","As another result of the selection of icon , the GUI  in stage  displays a set of controls , which are controls that apply to the selected scanner. Some embodiments display multiple sets of controls. For example, separate sets of controls provided by the image capture application programmers and controls provided by the scanner manufacturers. Additional details about sets of scanner controls are found in section I.B., below.","Stage  shows the GUI  when scanner icon  is selected. As a result of the selection, the image capture application has commanded the scanner represented by scanner icon  to perform a preview scan of the glass of the scanner to generate a replacement of preview . In the illustrated embodiment, the scanner has performed the scan and is displaying preview  in scan display area . Preview  shows the image of a tax form on the newly selected scanner. Preview  is different from preview  because different items are on the different scanners.","Also in stage , the GUI  displays a set of controls , which are controls that apply to the newly selected scanner. The GUI  provides each particular scanner with a set of controls that apply to that particular scanner. The scanner represented by icon  is different from the scanner represented by icon ; therefore the GUI  provides a different set of controls for each of the selected scanners. That is, set of controls  are different from set of controls  because they are controls for different models of scanner.","Stage  shows that GUI  manages cameras as well as scanners. Stage  shows the GUI  when camera icon  is selected. As a result of the selection, the image capture application has retrieved or generated thumbnails  of images on the camera and has displayed the thumbnails in thumbnail display area . The GUI  displays a set of camera controls  in control area . The camera controls  allow a user to perform various operations with the camera (e.g., downloading the photographs).","Though the GUI  and other GUIs described herein are drawn with particular areas associated with particular features of an image capture application, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that in some embodiments the areas or controls will be provided in different configurations. For example, in some embodiments a device display area is on the right side of a GUI rather than the left. Similarly, in some embodiments, the location of the control area depends on which device is selected. For example, when a scanner is selected, the scanner controls appear on the right, but when a camera is selected the camera controls appear along the bottom of the window (in a similar fashion to the simplified GUI illustrated in , below). In some such embodiments, the display area extends to the right edge of the window in order to provide more room for thumbnails or other image data.","In some embodiments, an image capture application automatically detects scanners from multiple manufacturers that are accessible to the computer on which the image capture application is running. The image capture application provides a GUI with a single window that includes (1) a first area for displaying a set of icons that represent the detected scanners from multiple manufacturers and (2) a second area for displaying controls of a scanner when that scanner is selected from the set of icons. In some embodiments the set of icons represents both scanners that are directly connected to the computer on which the image capture application is running (the \u201clocal computer\u201d) and scanners that are shared on a computer network to which the local computer is connected. A local computer that can access a device either through the network or directly can be described as \u201ccommunicatively coupled\u201d to the device. The GUI of some embodiments continues to display the set of icons in the first area of the window while simultaneously displaying the controls in the second area of the window. The GUI of some embodiments provides different controls for scanners with different features.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","200","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","322","330","316","310","310","312","320","322","310","320","330","316","330","310","322","310","316","316","320","320","322"]},"Computer  is able to access devices that are connected to it directly as well as shared devices that are connected to it via the network. A device is shared when the computer to which it is connected makes the device accessible to other computers on a computer network. In some cases, devices connected directly to a network may be set to be shared devices by default. For the purposes of describing GUIs herein the flatbed scanner  and the multi-function device  will be assumed to be shared devices. The scanners as shown in the figures have arbitrary names (e.g., scanner six). One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the use of arbitrary individual names for devices on a network is a common practice.","As mentioned above,  illustrates a GUI  of an image capture application of some embodiments. The GUI  of  includes (1) a device display area , which includes a local device display area  and a shared device display area , (2) a scan display area , and (3) a scanner control area . Local device display area  shows icons that represent scanners that are connected directly to the local computer. The shared device display area  shows scanners that are available to the local computer through a network. The scanner control area  is where the GUI displays the particular set of controls that apply to a particular scanner once the scanner has been selected.","The image capture application detects scanners by different manufacturers locally and through the network. This detection can be performed by various modules of the image capture application. As described in relation to , below, in some embodiments, the image capture application is provided as a set of modules including a client module and an extension module. In some embodiments, the client module detects the devices. In other embodiments, the extension module detects the devices. In still other embodiments, the image capture application is provided as a single module and that single module detects the devices. Similarly, many other operations described herein as being performed by an image capture application are performed by an image capture extension module or an image capture client module. Examples of image capture extension modules are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/873,822, titled \u201cImage Sharing\u201d, filed on Jun. 22, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference.","As shown in , the image capture application has detected the scanners of the example computer system  illustrated in . The application has detected (1) scanner  (manufactured by Canon\u00ae), which is connected to the USB port of computer , (2) duplex scanner  (manufactured by HP\u00ae), which is connected to network  and (3) scanner  (manufactured by Epson\u00ae), which is connected to computer . The GUI  displays these scanners from different manufacturers in device display area , which shows graphical representations (\u201cicons\u201d) of the various available scanners.","After detecting the scanners, the GUI  displays icons representing these scanners from different manufacturers in the device display area . Icon  represents scanner , which is connected directly to the local computer  on which GUI  is displayed. Therefore, the GUI  displays icon  in local device display area . Icon  represents scanner , which is accessible to computer  through the connection of computer  to network . Therefore, GUI  displays icon  in the shared device menu . Icon  represents multi-function device , which is accessible to computer  through the connection of computer  to network . Therefore, GUI  displays icon  in the shared device menu . In the embodiment shown in , the local devices are separated from the shared devices; however, the GUIs of some embodiments do not separate scanners into local and shared areas.","As shown in , each of the illustrated scanners is made by a different hardware manufacturing company. However, all the available scanners are displayed together in device display area . One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that in computer systems that have scanners from only one manufacturer, the GUI  will display scanners from only that manufacturer in the device display area. Some embodiments allow available scanners to be excluded from the device display area (e.g., scanners that the user chooses to exclude, scanners which are in use by another computer, etc.).","The icons , , and  have text that indicates the name of the scanner, the manufacturer of the scanner, and the location of the scanner. For example, scanner  is an Epson\u00ae brand scanner connected to computer  which has the name \u201cComp2\u201d. Accordingly the text for icon , which represents scanner  shows that it is an Epson\u00ae scanner connected to Comp2. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that some embodiments do not provide the same type of information for the icons as illustrated in . For example, some embodiments do not display the brand names of the scanners in the device display area. Some embodiments display the brand names of some scanners but not other scanners. For example, older model scanners might not provide a brand name to the image capture application. Similarly, some embodiments omit the location of the scanner, or show the location of only some of the scanners. For example, some embodiments omit the locations of some network scanners; such as scanners directly connected to the local network  that do not employ the protocols that the image capture application uses to identify the locations of scanners.","In some embodiments, the GUI  receives elections of particular scanners through GUI operations (e.g., a click operation) on the icons in device display area . When a particular scanner has been selected, the GUI  displays controls that apply to that particular scanner in the scanner control area  while continuing to display the scanners from different manufacturers in the device display area . The GUI  is then able to receive commands from users to control the selected scanner through the controls displayed in the scanner control area . When a scanner has been selected and a scan of the image capture area (\u201cglass\u201d) of the scanner has been performed, scan display area  graphically displays the results of that scan.","In some embodiments, when the GUI  receives a selection of a particular scanner the image capture application directs the scanner to perform a low resolution preview scan of the glass of the scanner. Details of the preview scan will be further described below in reference to . Other embodiments direct the scanner to perform the preview scan at the regular full resolution. GUI  displays the results of such preview scans in scan display area . However, scan display area  is shown in  as empty because the figure illustrates a state of the GUI  in which no scanner has been selected and no preview scan has been performed.","As an additional consequence of a scanner being selected, the scanner control area  displays GUI controls for the scanner. In , the scanner control area includes blank GUI controls  and . Blank controls  are provided in the figure for the purpose of showing the typical location of generic scanner controls. Blank controls  are provided in the figure for the purpose of showing the typical location of scanner specific controls.","Generic scanner controls are provided by the makers of the image capture application. Scanner specific controls manage features that are built into a specific model of scanner but are not provided by the makers of the image control application. More details about generic and scanner specific controls are provided in section I.A., below.","When no scanner has been selected, some embodiments display all the available generic scanner controls. Some embodiments display a subset of the available generic scanner controls. Still other embodiments do not display any scanner controls until a particular scanner has been selected. In some embodiments, a scanner is automatically selected by default and the controls (generic and scanner specific) that apply to that scanner are displayed in scanner control area  until a different device has been selected.","To illustrate different generic and scanner specific controls for different scanners. Two more detailed examples of the GUI of some embodiments will be described below in relation to .","A. Individual Scanner Controls","Different scanners have different features. Accordingly, some embodiments display different controls for different scanners. In some embodiments, the specific set of controls displayed for a particular scanner is chosen by a driver associated with that scanner. As mentioned above, some embodiments provide a regular set of controls (referred to herein as \u201cgeneric controls\u201d) that are usable by device driver manufacturers to allow a particular scanner to interface with the image capture application. These controls include controls that are common to most if not all scanners, such as a control for setting the resolution of a scan, a control for setting the color depth (the number of colors per pixel) of a scan, and controls for setting the orientation of a scan. Different scanners may require different sets of generic controls. Accordingly, the scanner manufacturers program a device driver associated with a particular scanner to select a specific subset of the available generic controls that apply to that particular scanner. In some embodiments, the individual scanner drivers provide codes that identify the generic controls for a scanner and their associated menu items but do not provide the names of the controls or the names of menu options for the controls.","A scanner driver that provides an interface between a scanner and the image capture application of some embodiments would not have to provide the names of the generic controls or the names of individual menu items of the generic controls. The drivers would merely indicate which of the available generic controls and menu items were valid options for the particular scanner. That is, the scanner drivers used with some embodiments provide specific codes (from a list of codes supplied by the image capture application producer) that the image capture application uses to determine which of multiple available generic controls and menu options provided by the image capture applications are applicable to a particular scanner. In some embodiments, because the codes refer to specific controls supplied by the makers of the image capture application, generic controls for the same function on two different scanners will always have the same name. For example drivers of a scanner could select a code to include the control that sets the scan resolution in the generic controls for that scanner. The image capture application would display the name \u201cresolution\u201d for that control for all scanners rather than \u201cresolution\u201d for some scanners and \u201cres.\u201d, \u201cscan resolution\u201d or \u201cdpi\u201d for other scanners. This serves to eliminate the confusion that would result from different manufacturers giving different names to the same standard control.","The options for individual generic controls of some embodiments are also supplied by the makers of the image capture application. For example, in some embodiments a generic control for color number might have four acceptable values 1) two, 2) 256, 3) thousands, and 4) millions. A driver for use with such embodiments could provide a code, e.g., from a list of codes supplied to the maker of the drivers by the makers of the image capture application. The code would (1) identify the color number control as control for the scanner and (2) append a four-bit word to identify which of the preset menu options the particular scanner supports. The four-bit word would be a binary digit indicating \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for each of the four menu items.","In some embodiments, when a driver indicates that an option is not viable for controlling a scanner the GUI grays out that option on the control menu. In other embodiments, the GUI omits any non-viable options from the control menu and displays only the viable options. For example, a scanner could be made that is able to scan with two colors, 256 colors, or millions of colors, but not thousands of colors. The driver for the scanner would identify, as a control of the scanner, a color number control with options 1), 2), and 4) as viable options for the corresponding scanner and option 3) as non-viable. The GUI would take this identification and display a color number control with options 1) two, 2) 256, and 3) millions.","In addition to the generic controls, some embodiments provide interfaces for controls to set scan parameters that are specific to individual scanners and not provided as part of the generic controls. In contrast to the generic controls, these controls can be anything that the device manufacturer wants them to be. These controls are referred to herein as \u201cscanner specific controls\u201d. In some embodiments, the device drivers supply the elements of each scanner specific control. Such elements may include: (1) the type of control such as toggle or menu, (2) the name of the control, (3) the names of the menu options of the control (if applicable), and (4) which of the named options is the default option.","In such embodiments, the image capture application merely displays the scanner specific controls to the user in the manner that the device driver indicates and acts as a pass-through (to the scanner) of the selected menu items or values. The availability of scanner specific controls allows the image capture application to control scanner functions that were not originally contemplated by the programmers of the image capture application. For example, if a scanner manufacturer adds a dust removal feature that is not supported by the regular controls of the image capture application, the scanner manufacturer can program the device driver for the scanner to command the image capture application to show a \u201cdust removal\u201d scanner specific control to the user. The driver could also specify that the control should have menu options \u201clight dust\u201d, \u201cmedium dust\u201d or \u201cheavy dust\u201d. The image capture application would then display a control for the user with exactly the specified control name, \u201cdust removal\u201d and menu options \u201clight dust\u201d, \u201cmedium dust\u201d and \u201cheavy dust\u201d.","The scanner specific controls are entirely at the discretion of the individual scanner manufacturer. As an example of a feature that is unusual or unknown in existing scanners, a scanner manufacturer could create a scanner with an attached paper shredder. The manufacturer could program the device driver for the scanner to provide the image capture application with a scanner specific \u201cshred document after scanning\u201d control. Some examples of generic and scanner specific controls are illustrated in . In giving these examples, additional details are provided regarding the scan display area, generic scanner controls, and scanner specific controls.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","442","444","432","434","436"]},"As previously mentioned, when a scanner icon in local device display area  or shared device display area  is selected, the image capture application provides controls for that scanner. The generic scanner controls  and the scanner specific controls  receive settings from a user that determine various parameters that will be used when scanning the items on the scanner and processing the scanned images. Preview  shows a low resolution image of the items that are on the glass of selected scanner . Preview scans are described in additional detail in section II, below.","In , icon  has been selected. As mentioned in relation to , icon  represents scanner  of . In , the GUI  indicates that scanner  has been selected by inverting the colors of the corresponding icon . However other embodiments use other visual cues to indicate that a scanner has been selected. For example, some embodiments provide a border box around the icon, altered icon colors, bold lettering for the icon, or other cues.","In , because scanner  has been selected, the GUI  displays the controls that apply to scanner  in scanner control area . Generic controls  are displayed in the upper section of scanner control area , while scanner specific controls  are displayed in the lower section of scanner control area .","As mentioned above, different scanners can require different sets of generic controls. In such embodiments, the generic controls provided by the GUI  for the selected scanner depend on the generic features of the selected scanner. One generic control included in generic controls  is an orientation control . Orientation controls determine which side of a scanned image is saved as the top of the image. Orientation controls are provided because items may be placed on a scanner in any orientation. Some items are placed on the scanner sideways or upside-down. Orientation control  determines the orientation of an image generated by scanner .","Scanner  is a simplex scanner (a scanner that can only scan on one side of a page without a user turning the page over). Therefore, generic controls  in  are generic controls appropriate for a simplex scanner (though other simplex scanners may have other sets of generic controls). Because a simplex scanner can only scan one side of a page, and a stack of pages fed into a sheet feeder of the simplex scanner is generally fed in with a common orientation, there is no need for more than one orientation control for simplex scanner. Therefore, generic controls  only include one orientation control. Orientation control  is a generic control because orientation control  is provided by the makers of the image capture application rather than the scanner manufacturer.","In some embodiments, the section of the scanner control area that displays the generic controls also displays controls that determine the actions of the image capture application beyond controlling the scanner itself. For example, the scan-to control  described in section I.C., below, determines to which application (from a provided list of applications) the scanned image will be sent once it has been scanned and processed by the image capture application.","As mentioned above, scanner specific controls manage features that are built in to the specific model of scanner but are not pre-programmed in the image control application.  shows that the selected scanner  has features that the scanner manufacturer calls \u201cunsharp mask\u201d and \u201cdescreening\u201d. In the driver for scanner , the manufacturer (or third party driver programmer) has identified the names and menu options of controls that the manufacturer (or programmer) wants the image capture application to display. The image capture application receives the names of the controls and the menu items and generates the scanner specific controls . Scanner specific controls  include controls  and . Control  is labeled \u201cunsharp mask\u201d because the driver for scanner  provided the name \u201cunsharp mask\u201d for a scanner specific control. Control  is labeled \u201cdescreening\u201d because the driver provided the name \u201cdescreening\u201d for a scanner specific control. If the image capture application receives selections of the options of scanner specific control  or , then the image capture application passes the received selection to the scanner.","In some embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in  scanner specific controls are in a separate section from generic controls. In some embodiments, the separate section is a dedicated section set aside for scanner specific controls. In other embodiments, the section for the scanner specific controls is inserted just after the last generic control. In still other embodiments, scanner specific controls are positioned among the generic controls.","Because the names and menu options are set by the driver, in some embodiments, the GUI  could provide controls for the same feature on two different scanners with two different names. That is, if a driver for a scanner from a different manufacturer (or even a different driver for the same scanner) called the \u201cunsharp mask\u201d feature by a different name (e.g., \u201cblur\u201d) the name of control  would be different for the different scanner (or driver). The names would be different even if the result of using the differently named controls would be the same for each scanner. Similarly, in some embodiments, the scanner specific controls for the same features may have different names for the options. For example, one driver could specify that the options for control  should be named \u201cheavy\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201clight\u201d, while another driver could specify that the options be named \u201chigh\u201d, \u201cmiddle\u201d, or \u201clow\u201d, even though selection of the corresponding options (e.g., selection of \u201cheavy\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d) would cause the same result.","The amount of time it takes to perform a scan increases for higher resolution scans. Many scanners are capable of performing high resolution scans of specified portions of the glass while ignoring other portions of the glass. Accordingly, scanning time can be reduced by performing an initial scan at a low resolution and then selecting (manually or automatically) portions of the glass on which to perform higher resolution scans. In the embodiment illustrated in , the image capture application automatically commands scanner  to perform a low resolution preview scan when the scanner icon  is selected. The preview scan generates a preview  that shows the items  and  on scanner . Additional details about preview scans are described in section II, below.","Some features of  described above are associated with the particular scanner selected.  illustrates GUI  when another particular scanner has been selected. Like ,  shows different controls that are provided by the GUI  to control the selected scanner and a preview scan of the items on the scanner. However, a different scanner has been selected in  than .  includes generic scanner controls , scanner specific controls , and preview .","Like the controls in  the generic scanner controls  and the scanner specific controls  receive settings from a user that determine various parameters that will be used when scanning the items on the scanner and processing the scanned images. Preview  shows a low resolution image of the item that is on the glass of selected scanner .","In , icon  has been selected. Icon  represents scanner  of , which is a duplex scanner. In , because scanner  has been selected, the GUI  displays the controls that apply to scanner  in scanner control area . The controls shown in  are different from the controls shown in , demonstrating that the image capture application provides different sets of controls for different scanners. Specifically,  show that the GUI  provides both different generic controls and different scanner specific controls for scanner  than for scanner .","Although the particular controls are different in , the generic controls  are displayed in the upper section of scanner control area  like the generic controls  in . Similarly, scanner specific controls  are displayed in the lower section of scanner control area  like the scanner specific controls  in .","As mentioned above, in some embodiments, different sets of generic controls apply to different scanners. In such embodiments, the generic controls provided by the GUI  for the selected scanner depend on the generic features of the selected scanner. In the example shown in , the selected scanner  was a simplex scanner. In  the selected scanner is a duplex scanner (scanner ). Therefore, the generic controls  of  are generic controls that are appropriate for a duplex scanner (though other duplex scanners may have other sets of generic controls). In contrast to the generic controls  of , which included a single orientation control , generic controls  include dual orientation controls  and  for setting the orientation of each side of a two-sided page.","The provided orientation controls  and  are useful for duplex scanners but not to one-sided scanners. They are useful to duplex scanners because duplex scanners can flip pages over. The duplex scanners scan one side of the paper and then flip the paper over to scan the other side. Two-sided pages are sometimes printed so that the text of the even numbered pages will be in the same orientation as the odd numbered pages when the pages are flipped up (rotated through an axis parallel to the top and bottom of the page). However, two-sided pagers are also sometimes printed so the text of the even numbered pages will be in the same orientation as the odd numbered pages when the pages are flipped over (rotated through an axis parallel to the left and right sides of the page). Flipping a page in the wrong direction results in the even numbered pages being oriented in the opposite direction from the odd numbered pages. Duplex scanner  can only flip the page in one direction. Accordingly, if the pages are printed so as to require flipping in the other direction then a single orientation control for duplex scanner  would leave every other scanned page upside down. The dual orientation controls  and  solve this problem. This is shown by control  being set to save images of the odd pages upside-down and control  being set to save images of the even pages right side-up.","Duplex scanners are common enough that in some embodiments, like the one shown in , the image capture application producer provides generic controls to handle the two-sided-page orientation issue. That is, in some embodiments, the different orientation controls , , and  are all generic because all of them are pre-programmed in the image capture application rather than provided by the scanner manufacturer. However, in some embodiments, dual orientation controls are not provided by the makers of the image capture application. In some of such embodiments, the makers of the drivers can provide dual orientation controls as scanner specific controls.","Because the generic controls and their options are pre-programmed in the image capture application, the image capture application of some embodiments is programmed to provide secondary uses of the selected options of generic controls. That is, secondary to passing the control setting to a scanner. For example, the image capture application of some embodiments provides a scanner resolution control. The programmers of the image capture application, knowing how scan resolution affects file size, could program the image capture application to calculate an estimated file size for the scan that varies depending on the resolution setting.","In contrast, scanner specific controls manage features that are built in to the specific model of scanner but are not pre-programmed in the image control application. Because scanner specific controls perform operations that were not anticipated by the programmers of the image capture application, the image capture application of some embodiments has no secondary use for a selected option of a scanner specific control (e.g., the image capture application can only pass it through to the scanner).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["312","330","330","544","546","548","546","548"]},"As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the image capture application automatically commands a scanner to perform a low resolution preview scan of a scanner when the scanner is selected. Therefore, when scanner  is selected (e.g., by the selection of icon  shown in ), the preview scan generates a preview that shows the item on scanner . The preview  of  is different from the preview  of  because they are preview scans of different items on different scanners.","Some embodiments provide a control for the user to command the scanner to redo the preview scan (e.g., when items on the glass have been moved or replaced). Some embodiments provide a control to command a preview scan in addition to or instead of automatically commanding a preview scan when the scanner is first selected.","B. Preview Scans","As mentioned in relation to , in some embodiments, an automatic preview scan of the glass of a selected scanner is performed upon selection of the scanner. The preview scan provides the GUI with a low resolution image of the entire glass (including the items on the glass and the surrounding space) to display as a preview. In some embodiments, the image capture application evaluates the data collected in the preview scan to determine the positions and types of items on the glass.","In embodiments that automatically determine scanning parameters based on preview scans and in embodiments in which the user selects parameters based on the preview image, parameters of subsequent detailed scans of the items on the glass (such as which areas of the glass will be scanned in the detailed scans) depend on the information gathered in the preview scan. Therefore, it is important that the information gathered in the preview scan remains accurate. If the positions of the items on the glass change after a preview scan but before a detailed scan, then the existing preview scan data will no longer accurately represent the state of the items on the glass. Such inaccuracies could lead to worthless detailed scans and wasted time, so the preview scan should be redone when items on the glass are moved or replaced. However, many scanners do not have a sensor that identifies when the lid of the scanner has been opened and the items on the glass have been moved or replaced. Therefore, the images on the glass can change without the image capture application being notified. Accordingly, some embodiments provide a control to receive a user command to redo the preview scan. Such a control can be activated by a user. For example, a user can activate the control after the user has moved or replaced items that were previously on the scanner. Activating the control ensures that the image capture application has up-to-date preview scan data to evaluate. An example of the preview scan of some embodiments is illustrated in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0142"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["400","230","605","620","625","627"]},"Overview button  is a control that commands the scanner to redo the preview scan. Cancel button  is a control that aborts the preview scan before it is finished.

Incomplete preview  shows a partial scan of item . Item  is an image of a photograph that has replaced the male portrait represented by scanned image  shown in . The scan status indicator  indicates what type of scan operation is being performed.","In , the item  has replaced item  on the scanner glass. In , a preview  was generated by the automatic preview scan performed when the scanner icon  was selected. Because of the replacement of item  with item  on the scanner glass, preview  does not accurately represent the contents of the glass of scanner  at the time of the preview scan shown in . Accordingly, the user has activated overview button  (e.g., by clicking on the button) and the image capture application has commanded the scanner to perform another preview scan. The GUI  displays the preview scan in progress, showing partially scanned item  and status indicator . In this figure, status indicator  shows that a \u201cquickscan\u201d (i.e. a preview scan) is being performed. While the preview scan is in progress, a user can select the cancel button  to command that the preview scan be stopped immediately (or as soon as the software and hardware are able to stop the scan).

The preview  shows the items  and , which are images of the items on the glass during the new preview scan. In some embodiments, the GUI  provides a bounding box  that surrounds the scanned items in the preview . The bounding box  indicates the outer limits of the scanned group of items. Scan button  activates a detailed scan of the scanner glass.","Preview image  in  shows an image of the entire glass of the selected scanner after the new preview scan is complete. The items placed on the glass of a scanner (here, items  and ) are generally of interest to the user, while the areas outside of the items are generally not of interest to the user. Accordingly it is desirable that the image capture application should default to not scanning areas outside of the items. That is, unless the image capture application receives overriding commands (e.g., from a user), a detailed scan of items  and  should exclude the areas outside of those images. Therefore, the image capture application uses the preview scan data to determine the outermost locations of the items on the glass. That is, the highest, lowest, rightmost, and leftmost locations of any items placed on the glass to be scanned. GUI  shows the determined limits to the user as bounding box  which is a box with edges parallel to the sides of the preview  that surrounds all the images (items  and ) in the preview . In , bounding box  is the smallest possible box with edges parallel to the sides of the preview  that surrounds all the images in the preview . Bounding box  indicates the automatically determined limits of the area that it would be useful to capture in a detailed scan. When the detailed scan button  is activated (e.g., by a click of a mouse button) the image capture application will perform a detailed scan of the area represented by bounding box .","In some cases a user might want to scan a different area of the glass than the automatically determined area (e.g., more of the surrounding blank space). Therefore, some embodiments provide controls to change the location, size, or orientation of the identified bounding box. Some examples of such embodiments are described in section III, below. In some embodiments, the image capture application commands the scanner to perform a detailed scan of the area in the bounding box. In some embodiments, the image or images captured by the detailed scan are sent to an application selected by a user. An example of the controls for selecting an application as a recipient of the scanned image is shown in .","C. Application Menu","The image capture applications of some embodiments provide a control that allows a user to select an application to receive scanned images.  illustrates a GUI with an application selection menu of some embodiments. The figure shows various menu items that a user can select to determine the application to which a scanned image will be sent.

Individual selectable menu items , , and  represent applications that are capable of displaying or otherwise handling supplied images. Non-selectable menu items  and  represent applications that are not capable of displaying or otherwise handling supplied images.","Some computer applications are capable of displaying image files that are sent to the application. For example, the Firefox\u00ae web browser displays images in a browser window when an image is supplied to the browser. In , applications that are capable of displaying supplied image files (mail , ImageViewer\u00ae , and Firefox\u00ae ) are represented in the scan-to-application selector  in black lettering, indicating that they are selectable. When a selectable menu item is selected, a subsequent detailed scan will be sent to the application that corresponds to the selected menu item.","In contrast, some computer applications are not capable of displaying supplied images. For example, a calculator program may not be capable of displaying a supplied image file. In , applications calculator  and chess , which are incapable of displaying supplied image files, are represented in the scan-to-application selector in grayed out text, preventing the user from accidentally sending a scanned image file to an application that is incapable of handling an image file. Alternate embodiments may provide representations of applications that are not capable of displaying supplied images that are deprecated in other ways than being grayed out. Scan-to-application selector  demonstrates the concept of grayed out application options. However, in some embodiments, the scan-to-application selector omits non-viable menu options, but includes an option to browse additional applications, some of which may be non-viable. In some such embodiments the display of the additional applications includes grayed out non-viable applications.","Some applications, such as mail  are not programmed to display received images, but are capable of using received images in some manner if the applications are provided with instructions for how to use the received images. In some embodiments, the image capture application (or some other application or operating system component) provides scripts to instruct such applications how to handle scanned images. For example, a script for sending a scan to a mail application could include instructions to the mail application to create a new e-mail and attach the scanned image as a file attachment to the new e-mail.","Some embodiments provide local drive, network drive, SD card and\/or other storage medium as an alternative destination for the scanned images.

Accordingly, preview  shows each item enclosed in a separate individual bounding box, bounding boxes  and .","Some embodiments switch back and forth between the large bounding box of  and the individual bounding boxes of  when toggle  is checked and unchecked. In some embodiments, the image capture application can switch from either of the two modes to the other without performing a new preview scan.

In some embodiments, when the detect-separate items toggle  is first checked after a preview scan, the detection of the separate items is performed and the results are stored for later retrieval in the event that the detect-separate-items toggle  is unchecked and then checked again. In other embodiments, the detection of the separate items is performed on the preview image each time toggle  is checked and rechecked.","Most scanners are only able to scan areas that are aligned with the edges of the glass. The scanners contain a scanner head that captures thin slices of an image at right angles to the sides of the scanner glass. The scanner head is then moved parallel to the sides of the glass, scanning a rectangular area aligned with the edges of the glass. Therefore, in some embodiments, when the image capture application determines the bounding box of an image that is rotated in relation to the glass, the image capture application also determines a larger bounding box for the image that has sides that are aligned with the glass and encompass the first bounding box.

In some cases, the image capture application receives the auto-scan command after the user places one or more documents on a scan bed or in a document feeder. The image capture application then receives in some embodiments the auto-scan command when the user presses a button on the device (e.g., on the scanner or multi-function device), or the user selects an auto-scan option in the application's UI. The auto-scan command can be generated differently in other embodiments.","Next, the process determines (at ) whether it needs to try to parse the document into its individual component parts. As mentioned above, the image capture application in some embodiment makes this determination based on whether the user has made the selection (e.g., checked the box) to detect multiple images in the scanned document. If so, then the process performs (at ) an initial scan. Otherwise, the process proceeds to operation , which is described further below.","The process directs (at ) a scanner to perform an initial scan. The initial scan is performed at a relatively low-resolution setting in some embodiments, in order to save time and to reduce complexity. Many scanners are capable of scanning at multiple resolutions and color depths. However, the amount of data generated by a high-resolution scan of the entire glass of a scanner can be relatively large. For example, an uncompressed image of a scan at 9600 dpi and 24-bit color is over 275 megabytes per square inch. The area of the glass of a scanner can be greater than 100 square inches. A high-resolution scan of such a glass could result in an image file tens of gigabytes in size. Therefore, in some embodiments, an initial scan (sometimes called a \u201cpreview scan\u201d or an \u201coverview scan\u201d) at a relatively low resolution is performed to allow the application and\/or the user to select particular areas or interest for more detailed scans.","The initial scan produces (at ) a scanned document. In the case of a flatbed scanner, the scanned document is a low resolution image of the scanner bed, on which the user may simultaneously place multiple items, such as a photo and a page of text. Alternatively, in case of a scan that is performed through a document feeder, the scanned document is a low resolution copy of the page passing through the feeder. The scanned document includes both regions with content and regions without. Regions without content are background regions, which correspond to the image inside of the scanner's cover, or blank spaces in the page being scanned. Background regions may contain noise due to debris, shadow, light leakage or other unwanted artifacts. Regions with content in a scanned document may simultaneously include black and white content, color content, text, photos, and\/or other types of contents. Further, different regions in the scanned document may be tilted, and thereby not aligned with each other or with the boundaries of the scan bed, area or document.","After producing the initial scan, the process identifies (at ) one or more component regions in the scanned document (i.e., the document generated at ). A component region is a contiguous section in a document (1) that is distinct and separate from other possible sections, and (2) that is identified by the process as having content rather than being mere empty background. The identification of component regions also gives the component regions definite sets of borders, which in some embodiments serve as the component regions' scan boundary during the secondary scans. The region-identification operation  will be further described below by reference to .","As mentioned above, a scanned document may be a copy of the scanner bed, or a copy of the document currently passing through the document feeder. A component region identified from a scanned document can come from an item on the scanner bed. A component region may also come from a section of a document sitting on the scanner bed that are distinct and separate from background and other sections.  conceptually illustrates and compares the identification of component regions from separate items on the scanner bed with identification of component region from a single document. In , sitting on top of a scanner bed  is a single document . Within the single document  are a photograph section  and a text section . After an initial scan produces a scanned document , the process  identifies component regions  and , which are sections of the scanned document that are distinct and separate from background and other sections. On the other hand, sitting on top of a scanner bed  are two separate items  and . After an initial scan produces a scanned document , the process identifies component regions  and , which correspond to the separate items  and  on the scanner bed.","Once the component regions from the scanned document are identified, the process  selects (at ) one of the identified component regions. The process then identifies (at ) a set of attributes for the component region selected at . Examples of such attributes include the type of content (e.g., text, image, etc.), the color of the content (e.g., black and white, grey scale, color), etc.","Some embodiments identify the attributes of the component region by analyzing the pixels within the component region. For example, color is one identified attribute when the process determines that the pixels have an amount of chrominance more than a predetermined threshold. Conversely, when the process determines that the component region pixels have an amount of chrominance less than a predetermined threshold, the process identifies black and white as the attribute of the component region. The process also identifies an attribute of a component region as text where a sufficient number of English words are recognizable. Otherwise, it identifies the attribute as either photo or graphics. Some scanners are capable of providing a set of attributes from its own analysis of the scanned document. In those instances, some or all scanner identified attributes may be incorporated into the component region's set of attributes.","When a region includes different types of content, some embodiments assign the region a default set of attributes in some embodiments. Other embodiments assign the region the set of attributes belonging to the most dominant content in other embodiments. Some other embodiments identify the different sub-regions within the component region. One of ordinary skill would recognize that other methods of handling a component region that includes different types of content are available. For example, the image capture application may prompt the user for further instructions.","After identifying (at ) the set of attributes for the component region selected at , the process directs (at ) the scanner to perform a detailed secondary scan of the selected region. In some embodiments, the process uses (at ) the attributes identified at  to identify an optimal set of scan parameters for the selected component region. The process then uses (at ) these detailed parameters to perform the secondary scan of the selected region. For example, when the region has been identified as having a color image, the process uses in some embodiments the scan parameters of 150 dpi (dots per inch) and 24-bit color encoding. Alternatively, when the region has been identified as containing only black and white text, the process uses in some embodiments default scan parameters of 300 dpi, 1-bit black and white encoding.","To ensure the quality of the scanned image, some embodiments use 24-bit color encoding to preserve color fidelity of a color image and 300 dpi to preserve textual readability of a text. Where such image quality is not needed, some embodiments use lower resolution settings such as 1-bit black and white encoding or 150 dpi scan resolution to conserve computing resources. One of ordinary skill would recognize that these scan settings are merely illustrative examples, and that other considerations may lead to different optimal scan settings.","In some embodiments, the process  directs (at ) the scanner to only scan the boundary of the selected component region (i.e., to forego the scanning of other identified component regions). This allows the scanner and the image capture application to process each scanned region faster. Many scanners are capable of performing high resolution scans of specified portions of the glass while ignoring other portions of the glass. Accordingly, time can be saved by automatically selecting portions of the glass on which to perform higher resolution scans.","After obtaining the secondary scan of the component region, the process performs (at ) post-scan operations on the scanned component region. Examples of such post-scan operations will be described further below by reference to . After performing (at ) post-scan operations, the process  determines (at ) whether it still needs to perform a secondary scan of other component regions identified at . When the process determines (at ) that it still needs to generate the secondary scan of one or more other component regions, it transitions back to operation  to select another component region. It then repeats operations -. When the process determines (at ) that it has generated the secondary scan for all component regions identified at , the process ends.","As mentioned above, the process transitions from  to  when the process  determines (at ) that it should scan the whole scanner glass or fed-through page rather than individual component parts. At , the process directs the scanner to generate a scan of the document, i.e., of the scanner bed, or of the document placed in the document feeder of the scanning device.","In some embodiments, the process directs (at ) the scanner to generate the scanned document as a detailed scan of the scanner glass or of a page fed through the scanner. However, in other embodiments, the process directs (at ) the scanner to perform two-stage scanning operations that are similar to operations  and -. In other words, at operation , the process  in some embodiments directs the scanner to first produce an initial scan. It then identifies a set of attributes for the document from the initial scan, selects a set of scanning parameters based on the identified set of attributes, and then directs the scanner to perform a secondary scan with the selected set of scanning parameters. Following the secondary scan, the process  performs post-scan operations in some embodiments. After operation , the process ends.","One of ordinary skill will recognize that process  is an example of one possible process performed by some embodiments in order to perform the auto-scan process. Process  is not necessarily the only example of how to identify component regions. Operations in the process can be performed in a different order. For example, the process can perform operation  after , namely performing post-scan operations on scanned images after the process has completed the detailed secondary scans of all component regions. The process may also perform operation  before , namely identifying a set of attributes for each component region before selecting a component region for detailed secondary scan.","B. Pre-Scan Operations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0208"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 17","FIGS. 20-30"],"b":["1900","1730","1700","1900","1900","1900"]},"As shown in , the process  starts (at ) when it receives a scanned document from an initial scan. The scanned document includes images of content as well as background and noise.  is an example screenshot of a scanned document . As shown in this figure, the scanned document  includes two sections with content, namely regions  and . This figure further shows that the scanned document includes noisy artifacts, such as shadow  and light leakage .","Next, the process  performs (at ) thresholding on the scanned document to produce a binary document. A binary document has only two colors, unlike a color or gray scale document which may have hundreds or even millions of colors. Thresholding is the operation that converts color or gray-scale pixels into black and white pixels. In some embodiments, thresholding marks a pixel as black if its luminance value compares in a predetermined manner to a certain threshold value (e.g. less than), and as white if otherwise.  illustrates the result of a thresholding operation on the scanned document  of . In binary document , the region  is a binary image version of the region  after thresholding, while the region  is the binary image version of region  after thresholding. Both regions  and  still contain unfilled white regions. Noisy artifacts are also present in this binary document. The artifact  is the binary image of the shadow, while the artifact  is the binary image of the light leakage.","After performing the thresholding operation, the process  performs (at ) a seed filling operation to fill all bounded regions in the binary document. In some embodiments, seed filling floods all regions in the binary document that are bounded by black pixels with black pixels. In other words, seed filling leaves only white regions not bounded by black pixels. These white regions are the background regions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0213","num":"0212"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 20","FIG. 22","FIG. 21"],"b":["2200","2110","2120","2230","2240"]},"Next, the process  eliminates (at ) noisy artifacts from the binary document and indexes the remaining black regions. As illustrated in , noisy artifacts continue to be present in the binary document after the seed filling operation. Artifact  is the binary image of the shadow , while artifact  is the binary image of the light leakage .","In some embodiments, the process  cleans up (at ) these artifacts with a group seed filling operation. Group seed fill is a variant of the seed fill operation. In applying the group seed filling operation at , the process  steps through each black region in the binary document to determine whether the black region is too small in size or too odd in shape to have content. If the black region is too small in size or too odd in shape to have content, the process fills the region with white pixels and eliminates it from the binary document. Otherwise, the process leaves the region intact and gives it an index.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0216","num":"0215"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 20","FIG. 23","FIG. 23"],"b":["2300","2021","2011","2350","2360","2230","2240","2301","2302","1900","2301","2302"]},"After applying group seed fill, the process  selects (at ) a component region.

As mentioned above, binary document  at the end of group seed filling includes two component regions  and  with indices  and . The process uses index  to select component region  and masks the unselected component region . The result of this operation is the binary document , which has only one component region . The marker  identifies the location of the masked component region .","After selecting (at ) a component region, the process  performs (at ) edge detection on the selected component region in order to detect its borders. In some embodiments, the edge detection is accomplished by using a Sobel operator, which calculates the gradient of the image intensity at each point of an image. Because the binary document after thresholding and seed filling operations contain only regions of uniform image intensity, applying the Sobel operator results in the borders of these regions.  illustrates the result of applying the Sobel operator to the binary document  that remains after the selection of the component region . As shown in this figure, the application of the Sobel operator results in the document  a region . The region  specifies the borders of the component region .","Next, the process  performs (at ) a Hough transform on the borders of the component region. The Hough transform identifies a set of lines that best represent the borders of the regions identified by the Sobel transform. The Hough transform mathematically generates a series of curves based on a series of test lines through the points on the border. For each point on the border, the Hough transform generates a curve in a parameterized space (the Hough space) that relates the angle of the test line to the distance of the test line from the origin. A point in the Hough space at which large numbers of curves intersect represents the angle and distances of lines that lie along a particular edge of the border.

Otherwise, the process transitions back to operation  to repeat this operation and operations - for each component region.","At operation , the process  eliminates falsely identified component regions. False identification of component regions may occur in some embodiments due to peculiarities within the scanned document. For example, the layout of the content within a component region may cause some embodiments to falsely identify a component region within the boundary of another, correctly identified component region.  conceptually illustrates how the process  eliminates a falsely identified component region for the above mentioned example.","In , an image  includes two sections  and  separated by a gap . The gap  can be a boundary defined by the document. The gap can also be an artifact in the image  created by lighting or other conditions. Thresholding and seed filling of the image  produces binary document , which separates the image  into a large L-shaped component region  and a smaller rectangular shaped component region . The smaller rectangular shaped component region  is not a real component region, but merely a sub region of the image . The process applies Sobel edge detect to component regions  and  to yield regions  and . The process then applies Hough transform to region  and correctly identifies rectangular component region , which corresponds to the image . However, the process also applies Hough transform on region  and falsely identifies a smaller component region .","The process  then eliminates the smaller, falsely identified region . Some embodiments identify and eliminate all regions that lie within another region, thereby eliminating falsely identified regions such as the region . One of ordinary skill will recognize that other methods of eliminating falsely identified regions are available. For example, the process  may eliminate all regions that are too small and too oddly shaped to be a component region. After eliminating (at ) falsely identified component regions, the process  ends.","The operations - will now be explained again in order to finish describing the example illustrated in .

Process  is not necessarily the only example of how to identify component regions.","C. Post-Scan Operations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0227"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 17"],"b":["3100","1760","1700","3100","3100"]},"The process  starts when it receives a secondary scan of a component region. The process initially identifies (at ) a set of post-scan parameters. Post-scan parameters control a post-scan operation that the process  performs on the component region. These parameters specify whether the process should perform an OCR operation, rotate the scanned region, send the scan result to a particular application, store the scan result, etc. The process  may identify one or more post scan parameters by analyzing the secondary scan of the component region. The process may also derive these post scan parameters from various data (e.g., the set of attributes of the component region) generated by the process  or the process .","After identifying a set of post-scan parameters, the process  rotates (at ) the component region if necessary (i.e., if specified by the post-scan parameters.) The process rotates the component region by a rotational adjustment angle. In some embodiment, this rotational adjustment angle is identified when process  performs the Hough transform. Since the \u03b8-coordinate of an intersect point on the Hough plane correspond to the angular separation between a component region's border and the horizontal, the process  of some embodiments uses the angle \u03b8\u2014to arrive at the necessary rotational adjustment. In some embodiments, the process  performs an image transform by using the rotational angle in order to realize the adjustment.","Next, the process performs (at ) an OCR on the component region if necessary. The OCR operation if performed produces text. Some embodiments perform this operation only if the component region has been determined to include text as result of the initial or secondary scan.","After performing the OCR operation, the process performs (at ) a document recognition operation to identify structural elements in the text. The OCR in some embodiments results in an unstructured document containing a collection of glyphs or characters without any structures such as lines, paragraphs or columns. The document recognition process identifies these structural elements, and these elements are used in some embodiments to construct a structured document from the unstructured document. Structural elements of some embodiments include associated primitive elements (e.g., words, paragraphs, joined graphs, etc.), guides, gutters, text flow, tables, etc. These structural elements are related in a hierarchical manner in some embodiments (e.g., a paragraph includes text lines, a text line includes words, and a word includes primitive glyphs). Several document recognition processes are described in a non-provisional U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/455,866 filed concurrently with this application, with the title \u201cIdentification of Layout and Content Flow of an Unstructured Document\u201d, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The process  then converts (at ) the result of the above mentioned operations into another data format if necessary. For example, in some embodiments, the process converts OCR recognized text or the resulting structured document into ASCII, Word, WordPerfect, PDF, HTML or any other format capable of supporting a text document. Some embodiments use the structural elements identified at  to assist in the format conversion. The process may also convert an image aligned at  into Bitmap, TGA, TIFF, GIF, JPEG or any other format capable of supporting graphical images. The conversion of an image, however, is performed in some embodiments as part of the image transform operation that some embodiments perform at .","Next, the process  stores (at ) a post processed scan data into a storage medium if necessary. A post-processed scan data may be an OCR recognized text, a structured document, an aligned secondary scan, converted scanned result, or other data derived from detailed second scan. The process may save any of these post-processed data into a hard disc, random access memory, or other types of storage medium accessible by computer.","Finally, the process  forwards (at ) the post-processed scan data to a destination application if necessary. Applications other than the image capture application may serve as the destinations for any type of post-processed scan data. For example, the process  can forward the scanned result to image editing application, word processor program, print server, mail program, any application capable of view or editing text, or other types of applications that are capable of handling the post-processed scan data.","Some embodiments also communicate a message to the destination application on how to handle the post-processed scan data from the image capture application. In some embodiments, this message is a command or a script understood by the destination application. For example, some embodiment sends an \u201copen image\u201d command in order to notify the destination application that the image capture application is about to deliver an image. In another example, the process may execute a script to instruct a mail application on how to compose a message using an OCR recognized text as the body of the message and a scanned image as the attachment.","One of ordinary skill will recognize that process  is an example of one possible process performed by some embodiments in order to perform post scan operations on a component region.

Other embodiments do not provide the display shown in , but instead proceed directly from the preview scan to the detailed scans without showing the identified regions before starting the detailed scans.","Just as in auto-scans that detect separate items, in some embodiments, while the image capture application receives the detailed scan data for the single region, the scan display area  shows a faded preview and then progressively replaces the faded preview with non-faded images of the detailed scan as the detailed scan data is received from the scanner.  illustrates a GUI as it progressively displays the results of a detailed scan. The detailed scan is a scan of the single automatically identified region.  includes demarcations . Demarcation  conceptually separates the display of the detailed scan of the region in bounding box  from the faded display of the preview scan of the region.","During the detailed scan of region , the image capture application progressively replaces the faded preview with the detailed scan. Unlike the replacement of the preview in , the replacement here is not performed at right angles to the individual items  and . The replacement is performed at right angles to the bounding box . However, as bounding box  is already aligned with the glass, each slice of pixel data from the scanner provides a full slice of data at right angles to the bounding box . Therefore, the image capture application reveals all scan data as it comes in.","Unlike the detailed scan of separate items shown in , the detailed scan in  is being performed for the entire region rather than for the individual items  and . Accordingly, when the scanner has finished scanning the part of the glass containing item , the scanner continues to scan the area between items  and  instead of skipping that area as it did when performing the scans in .  illustrates the detailed scan of region  when the scan is between two items. The scanner head has passed the bottom of item , but has not yet reached the top of item . Accordingly, demarcation line  is between the items  and .","Eventually, the scanner head reaches the top of item  and continues to scan it as part of the single region in bounding box .  illustrates the detailed scan of region  when the scan is in the middle of item . Here, the scanner head has reached the middle of item . Accordingly, demarcation line  is across item , indicating that scan data for the upper portion of item  has been received by the image capture application.","As mentioned above, the image capture application of some embodiments provides an automatic scan operation that (1) identifies different regions in an initial scanned documents, (2) re-scans these different regions separately based on parameters that are optimized for each region, and (3) post-processes the individually scanned regions (e.g., post-processes different regions differently). In addition or in lieu of this auto-scan feature, the image capture application of some embodiments also includes a set of manual scanning tools that allow the user to: (1) manually adjust the regions to be scanned (i.e., the location, size, and orientation of the scanned regions); (2) manually adjust the scan parameters (e.g., the scan resolution, the scan color, etc.) for each region; and (3) activate a detailed scan.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0265","num":"0264"},"figref":"FIG. 43","b":["4300","4326","4300","4300","4301","4302","4303","4304"]},"With the exception of the manual selection tool , the GUI  of  includes many of the same basic elements as the GUIs described in section I, with a layout that closely resembles that of GUI  in . As mentioned above, a user can invoke the manual selection tool  to bound a particular region that is initially identified through a pre-scan operation, by selecting (e.g., clicking or double-clicking) on the region. As shown in , this tool can be a rectangle with a circle inside of it. The rectangle is moveable (e.g., by a drag operation) to move the location of the selection tool. Also, the sides of the rectangle are independently moveable (i.e., each side can be moved independently of the other sides of the rectangle) to adjust the size of the rectangle. The circle has a handle that a user can select and drag to rotate the bounding rectangle of the manual selection tool.","The operations of GUI  will now be described in relation to the four stages -. The first stage  shows the GUI after a preview scan has been performed. The image capture application has identified two regions  and  of the scanner glass as containing separate items (e.g., two separate photographs). The image capture application has automatically selected the identified regions  and  to be the default areas for a future detailed scan. The rectangles around regions  and  provide the user with a visual representation of the current boundaries of the regions. The user can select the regions  and  to activate a manual selection tool  to modify the areas of the future detailed scan. The preview scan automatically identified separate regions  and  because the detect-separate-items toggle  is checked. The preview scan could have been performed automatically upon the selection of scanner icon  or commanded by the overview button .","In addition to identifying the regions  and , some embodiments automatically identify the type of content in each region (e.g., color or black and white photograph). As described in section II, the image capture application of some embodiments automatically determines scanning parameters for a subsequent detailed scan of each region. In the first stage , some embodiments leave the controls blank because the user has not yet selected a region for editing. Once a particular region  or  is selected, the automatically determined scanning parameters for that region will be displayed as settings of the generic scanner controls  and scanner specific controls . As mentioned above, the user can select (e.g., by clicking or double-clicking) one of the identified regions  or  to activate the manual selection tool to operate on that region. Other embodiments display as a list the automatically determined scanning parameters of each region even before the user selects a region.","The second stage  shows the manifestation of the manual selection tool . The manual selection tool  is displayed by GUI  in response to the user's selection of region . Manual selection tool  has manifested over the selected region . Some embodiments display the manual selection tool  as a rectangular border  with a circle  inside it. The circle  has a handle . A user can: (1) adjust the size of the manual selection tool  by dragging an edge or a corner of the border ; (2) rotate the manual selection tool  by dragging the handle ; and (3) move the manual selection tool  by dragging any place in the manual selection tool  that does not command a rotation or resizing. By adjusting the manual selection tool , the user can select a sub-region of the identified region image, include some of the background of the scanner, or even scan parts or all of multiple images.","The selection of the region  also causes the GUI  to display the automatically determined scanning parameters as settings of the generic controls  and the scanner specific controls . In stage , the generic controls - are all set to \u201cauto\u201d to conceptually illustrate that they are set to the automatically determined parameters. In some embodiments, the scanner specific controls  are also set to automatically determined scanning parameters.","In other embodiments, the image capture application do not automatically set scanning parameters for the scanner specific controls but rather sets the scanner specific controls to default options specified in the scanner driver. Therefore, in stage , the scanner specific controls  and  are set to \u201cdefault\u201d. The parameter names \u201cauto\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d are conceptual identifications only and are not intended to indicate the names of actual parameters. The manual editing process allows the user to change the automatically selected settings of the generic controls - and the default settings of the scanner specific controls  and . Changes to the controls are shown later, in relation to the fourth stage .","Returning to the manual selection tool , stage  shows the manual selection tool surrounding the entire region , indicating that a detailed scan at this stage would capture the entire picture in region . However, the user may want to capture a smaller portion of region . For example, the user may want to focus on the section of region  that includes an airplane. The third stage  shows that the user has adjusted the manual selection tool  to closely surround the section of region  that includes the airplane.","A user may employ many sequences of movement, rotation, and resizing of the manual selection tool to select an area within the region selection tool .  illustrates one such possible sequence of adjustments of the manual selection tool . The sequence includes five substages that change the selected region from the area shown in second stage  to the area shown in third stage  of . The first substage  shows a movement of the manual selection tool ; the second substage  shows a rotation of the manual selection tool ; the third and fourth substages - show alterations of the size of the manual selection tool . The figure includes original state , substages -, and cursor . Original state  shows the manual selection tool  just after it has been selected. The substages - show how the manual selection tool  is manipulated (e.g., by the user) to perform each adjustment to the region for scanning. The cursor  shows which part of the manual selection tool  the user dragged to perform the operation of each substage.","The first substage  shows the end of a movement operation of the manual selection tool . In the movement operation, the user has clicked-and-dragged the manual selection  tool with cursor . As shown by the position of cursor  in the manual selection tool , the user clicked on a part of the manual selection tool  that does not activate a rotation or resizing operation (i.e. anywhere other than the handle or border). As mentioned above, clicking and dragging a part of the manual selection tool  that does not activate a rotation or resizing operation moves the manual selection tool . The user dragged cursor  to the upper right, which moved the manual selection tool  to the upper right. Then the user released cursor  at the position shown in the first stage .","The second substage  shows the end of rotation operation of the manual selection tool . The rotation operation started with the manual selection tool  in the same location as shown in substage . All the completed operations shown in this figure start with the manual selection tool  in the position, size, and orientation shown in the previous stage. The user moved the cursor  to the handle . The user then clicked and dragged the handle  with the cursor . Specifically, the user moved the cursor down, which moved the handle down. By dragging the handle  down, the user rotated the manual selection tool  into the position shown in the second substage . In some embodiments, dragging on the circle would also rotate the manual selection tool .","The third through fourth substages show various resizing operations. The third substage  shows the end of a first resizing operation of the manual selection tool . In the resizing operation of the third substage , the user clicked and dragged the right border of the manual selection tool  and to the left. This reduced the size of the region .","The fourth substage  shows the end of a second resizing operation of the manual selection tool . In this resizing operation, the user has clicked and dragged the upper left corner of the manual selection tool  down and to the right. In the embodiment shown in this figure, dragging a corner of the manual selection tool  changes the size of the manual selection tool  while keeping the aspect ratio (the ratio of height to width) constant. In other embodiments, dragging a corner of the manual selection tool  allows the user to freely change the length of both sides of the manual selection tool  that are connected to the dragged corner. As shown in this figure, moving, rotating, and changing the size of the manual selection tool  has not affected the image in region . The movement and rotation of manual selection tool  has not affected the image in region  because the manual selection tool  is for selecting an area of the glass to scan; it is not a tool for editing the images in the preview scan.","The sequence of operations shown in this figure has produced the change in the size, orientation, and location of the manual selection tool  seen when going from the second stage  to the third stage  in . However this sequence of operations is not the only sequence that would produce such a change. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the operations shown could be performed in any order to produce the same change. Additionally, equivalent sequences can make the same changes without exactly duplicating the individual operations shown. For example, the movement operation could be replaced with multiple border shifting operations.","Returning to , in the third stage , the options in the controls  and , options are the same as in the previous stage , indicating that the user has not yet changed the scanner control options set by the image capture application. Between the third stage  and the fourth stage , the user does change those settings.","The fourth stage  shows user modified settings. The user has changed the settings of some of the generic controls  and scanner specific controls . Specifically, the user set control  to option D, control  to option C, and control  to option B. The user has not changed the settings of controls  and , so those controls remain at the automatically selected or default values. Specific types of controls with parameters that the user can adjust are described in more detail below.","One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that although the stages - are shown in  in a particular order, other embodiments may receive adjustments to the location, size, and orientation of a region after receiving adjustments to the scanning parameters in the scanner control area or receive multiple adjustments of the controls and the manual selection tool in any order.","The manual selection tool  includes multiple features to indicate the angle of the tool, including handle  and the alignment of the border . However, other embodiments may provide different or additional indications of the rotation of the manual selection tool.  illustrates two examples of manual selection tools with additional angle indicators. The angle indicators shown can be used along with the previously described indicators, or can function independently. The figure includes manual selection tool , which includes angle indicator  and manual selection tool , which includes angle indicator . Angle indicator  is a stylized human figure. Angle indicator  is a numerical readout of the angle of the manual selection tool . When manual selection tool  rotates, angle indicator  rotates with the tool. The head of the stylized human figure points in the direction that the GUI will treat as up during a detailed scan of a region selected by manual selection tool . In contrast, when manual selection tool  rotates, the numerical readout of angle indicator  updates to display the new angle of the manual selection tool .","In some embodiments, a manual selection tool might be invoked or implemented differently than as described above. In some embodiments, such as the embodiments described above, this tool is invoked by a user selecting a region that is identified as a separable region in the scanned document. This invocation causes the tool to appear to bound the selected region. Instead or in lieu of this manner of invoking the tool, some embodiments allow a user simply to select the tool from the GUI  and to use the tool to bound any identified region in the scanned document.","The sections that follow describe various aspects of the manual override features of some embodiments. Section III.A. describes the way that the GUIs of some embodiments display automatically identified regions to the user before the user selects a region for editing. Section III.B. describes the results of detailed scans performed after various adjustments to a manual selection tool. Section III.C. describes guidelines that show the frame of reference of the identified regions during adjustments to the manual selection tool. Section III.D. describes manual overrides of various automatically identified parameters for performing a detailed scan on an automatically selected region.","A. Indicators of Separate and Grouped Selectable Regions","One parameter that a user can control is whether the image capture application will present the results of the preview scan as separate items or as a group of items. A basic user interface for detecting separate regions is described in section I in reference to . However, some embodiments provide additional indicators of the separate regions when the regions are presented to the user for manual editing.  illustrates a GUI that provides visual indicators of the size, location, and orientation of identified regions when a detect-separate-items option is selected. The visual indicators help to distinguish between states of the GUI in which separate regions are selectable and states in which a single region is selectable.  includes angle indicators  and . Angle indicators  and  are visual indicators of the presence and orientations of the two identified regions in bounding boxes  and .","The image capture application indicates the selectable regions by displaying the bounding boxes  and  with angle indicators  and  superimposed on the regions. The bounding boxes  and  show the user the separate regions of the glass that will be captured by a detailed scan if the user activates the scan button  without adjusting the regions (e.g. with a manual selection tool). Angle indicator  is superimposed on the picture in bounding box  and shows the angular displacement of the bounding box  from the horizontal axis of the GUI. One end of the angle indicator  is positioned on the center of the identified region to show the user where the center of the region is. The angle between angle indicator  and an edge of the preview display area visually presents the identified orientation of bounding box . Angle indicator  provides the same visual indications for bounding box  as angle indicator  provides for bounding box .","In addition to allowing manual editing of separately detected individual regions, some embodiments allow manual editing of regions containing groups of items when the detect-separate-items option is turned off. Such embodiments identify a single region on the glass that encompasses all the items on the glass. The embodiments then provide visual indicators of the size, location, and orientation of the single identified region.  illustrates a GUI that provides visual indicators of the size, location, and orientation of an identified region containing a group of items when the detect-separate-items option is not selected. The visual indicators show the angle when the region is a group of items rather than a single item.  includes angle indicator . Angle indicator  is superimposed on the middle of bounding box  and shows the angular displacement of the bounding box from the horizontal axis of the scanner. As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the bounding box  of a group of items is defined by horizontal and vertical lines through the outermost corners of the group of items. In such embodiments, the bounding box  is aligned with the scanner by default; therefore the default angle of the angle indicator  is zero. However, if a user (1) selected the region in bounding box  for manual adjustment, (2) rotated the manual selection tool that appeared on the region, and (3) unselected the region, then the angle indicator  would change to show the new angle of the bounding box.","B. Detailed Scans of Adjusted Regions","As mentioned above, the manual selection tool of some embodiments can move, rotate, or resize scanning regions. The manual selection tool affects the scanning area, not the underlying images. That is, shrinking the manual selection tool reduces the portion of the image that will be captured, not the size of the image presently shown in the boundaries of the manual selection tool.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0291","num":"0290"},"figref":"FIG. 48","b":["4326","4326","4800","4801","4805","4811","4815","4800","4801","4805","4326","4811","4815"]},"Image  is a captured image of the entire photograph . Image  includes the entire content of the photograph  and is the same size as the photograph . Because the user has made no changes with the manual selection tool, image  is the same image that the image capture application would produce in the automatic scans described in section II. The corresponding operation  represents the default selection of an identified region. The manual selection tool  completely surrounds the photograph  and the borders of the manual selection tool  are co-extensive with the borders of the photograph. The region was automatically identified after a preview scan and has not been adjusted. A detailed scan after operation  produces image .","Image  is a rotated image of the photograph . More accurately, image  is rotated by a different angle than the angle necessary to counter the actual rotation of the photograph  relative to the scanner glass. Image  includes a counterclockwise rotated view of those portions of photograph  that remain in the manual selection tool  after the rotation operation . The user rotated the manual selection tool  clockwise relative to the default region. Operation  shows that the user rotated the manual selection tool  by clicking and dragging the handle  with cursor . A detailed scan after operation  produces image .","Image  is a shorter version of an image of the photograph . Image  includes a view of the top of the photograph , but does not contain a view of the bottom of the photograph . The user shrank the region and cut off the bottom of the photograph with manual selection tool . Operation  shows that the user shrank the manual selection tool  by clicking and dragging the boundary  with cursor . A detailed scan after operation  produces image .","Image  is an offset image of the photograph . The image  shows the lower-right portion of photograph . The user moved the manual selection tool  down and to the right (which moved the region of the detailed scan). Operation  shows that the user moved the manual selection tool  by clicking and dragging the manual selection tool  with cursor . A detailed scan after operation  produces image .","Image  is an image of photograph  and some of the surrounding area of photograph . The user manipulated manual selection tool  to expand the region for the detailed scan into the area surrounding the photograph , so the image  is larger than image  and unlike image  includes some of the background of the scanner glass. Operation  shows that the user increased the size of manual selection tool  by clicking and dragging the corner of the boundary  with cursor  (and by other, unshown, operations, e.g., dragging the top and left sides of the boundary outward). A detailed scan after operation  produces image .","Some embodiments provide an option to preview the image in the manual selection tool. In such embodiments, clicking the control, or selecting a set of keyboard keys temporarily shows a view of the images that is similar to the images - in . That is, the GUI displays a preview of the adjusted region, aligned with the edges of the GUI, rather than showing the preview with a bounding box of manual selection tool  rotated relative to the edges of the GUI. In some embodiments, once the control or set of keyboard keys that activates the preview of the image is released, the manual selection tool  returns to the position and orientation that it had before the preview of the image was activated.","C. Guidelines","In some embodiments, when a user selects a region for editing with a manual selection tool, the GUI provides guidelines to show the user the original location and orientation of the automatically identified region. Some embodiments display the guidelines only when the manual selection tool is moved, resized, or rotated.  illustrates a manual selection tool  with guidelines of some embodiments. The guidelines provide the user with location and orientation references relative to the originally identified region.  includes guidelines -. The guidelines - outline the originally detected region.","The guidelines - provide a set of reference lines that allow a user to identify directions relative to the original region . The guidelines serve two main purposes. First, when a user moves, rotates, or resizes the manual selection tool , the guidelines - show the user the original position and orientation of the automatically identified region . Second, when a user moves, rotates, or resizes the manual selection tool , the extension of the guidelines - past the boundaries of the region allow a user to identify places that are offset from the region  by right angles to the region. The guidelines show where the manual selection tool  is relative to the region . For example, if the user moves manual selection tool  up along the guidelines , then the sides of the manual selection tool  will remain aligned with the sides of region . A user can, for example, align the manual select tool with guidelines  to select the entire top half of region .","In some embodiments, the manual selection tool  snaps to the guidelines when it gets close to them. The snapping feature allows a user to easily move the manual selection tool to a position at right angles to the original position. The snapping feature also helps to restore parameters of the manual selection tool to their original values after they have been changed. For example, in some embodiments, the snapping feature helps a user to resize a manual selection tool to its original length or width. In some embodiments, the snapping tool helps the user return the manual selection tool to its original position or orientation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0302","num":"0301"},"figref":"FIG. 50","b":["5010","5012","5014","5020","5022","5024","5030","5032","5034","5010","5012","5014","4326","5020","5022","5024","4326","5030","5032","5034","4326"]},"The operation of the snapping features will now be described in relation to the stages -. As mentioned above, stages - show the snapping feature during a movement operation. The movement related snapping feature is triggered by the proximity of the manual selection tool  to the guidelines. In stages -, the user drags the manual selection tool  with the cursor . The manual selection tool  moves progressively closer to the guidelines  until it reaches a proximity that triggers the snapping feature. The proximity at which the snapping feature activates is shown in stages - by proximity lines . In stage , the edges of the manual selection tool  nearest to each of the guidelines  are still farther away from the guidelines than the proximity lines  are, therefore the snapping function is not triggered. In stage , the manual selection tool  reaches the proximity lines  and the snapping feature is triggered. Without further dragging of the manual selection tool  by the user, the manual selection tool  snaps to the guidelines, as shown in stage .","Stages - show the snapping feature during a resizing operation. The resizing related snapping feature is triggered by the proximity between a guideline and the edge (or corner) being dragged. In stages -, the user drags the right edge of border  with the cursor .

The proximity at which the snapping feature activates is shown in stages - by proximity line . In stage , the moving edge of the border  is still farther away from the nearest guideline  than the proximity line  is, therefore the snapping function is not triggered. In stage , the border  reaches the proximity line  and the snapping feature is triggered. Without further dragging of the border  by the user, the border snaps to the guidelines , as shown in stage .","Stages - show the snapping feature during a rotation operation. The resizing related snapping feature is triggered by the proximity and angular proximity between a guideline and an edge of a rotating manual selection tool . In stages -, the user drags the handle  with the cursor . The edge the manual selection tool  moves progressively closer to alignment with the right side guideline  until it reaches a proximity that triggers the snapping feature. The proximity at which the snapping feature activates is shown in stages - by proximity line . In stage , the moving edge of the rotating manual selection tool  is still farther away from the nearest guideline  than the proximity line  is, therefore the snapping function is not triggered. In stage , the edge of the rotating manual selection tool  reaches the proximity line  and the snapping feature is triggered. Without further dragging on the handle  by the user, the manual selection tool  snaps into alignment with the guidelines , as shown in stage .","Though the snapping features in this figure were illustrated with proximity lines, some embodiments do not visibly display proximity lines. In some embodiments, the snap features activate after the cursor  is released. That is, the user moves\/resizes\/rotates the manual selection tool  into the proper proximity and then releases the cursor  to activate the relevant snap feature. In some embodiments, the snap features can be activated by a GUI item, a keyboard key, or a combination of keyboard keys. In some embodiments the snap features can be temporarily turned on or off. For example, some embodiments deactivate the snap features while a user holds down a particular set of keyboard keys and reactivates the snap features when the set of keys are released. In some embodiments, the snapping tool only affects the parameter being modified. For example, when the user is rotating the manual selection tool , the snap feature can rotate the manual selection tool , but cannot move the manual selection tool  laterally.","D. Overriding Automatically Selected Scan Parameters","This section describes manual adjustments to the automatically selected scan parameters. As mentioned above, when the user selects an automatically detected region for editing, the automatically selected scan parameters for that region are displayed as settings on the controls in control area .","As described in section II, some embodiments automatically select scan parameters for automatically identified regions. The automatically selected scan parameters act as default parameters for subsequent detailed scans of the identified regions. Some automatically selected scan parameters affect the performance of the detailed scan itself. For example, the scan resolution parameter determines how many dots per inch the scanner will produce. Other scan parameters affect the processing of the images after a scan is performed. For example, scan output format parameters determine the image format in which the image capture application will save the detailed scan. Some embodiments provide the user with various types of scanner controls to manually override the automatically selected scan parameters. Some examples of controls for performing manual overrides for various types of parameters are described below in reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0310","num":"0309"},"figref":["FIG. 51","FIG. 51"],"b":["5110","5120","5130","5110","5120","5130"]},"As mentioned above, the scanner controls of  are set to the automatically selected parameters. The way in which the parameters are displayed depends on the type of control that the GUI provides for that parameter. In this figure, controls - are menu controls. Menu controls present a set of options to a user in the form of a list (or menu). In some embodiments, the options are only displayed when the menu control is selected. When the options are displayed, the top listed option of a particular menu can represent the current setting of that particular menu control, while the lower items on the menu represent other available settings of the menu control. As mentioned, the controls in this figure are set to the automatically selected parameters, therefore the top menu options of menus - are the automatically selected parameters for the selected region. A user could change the selected parameters using menu controls - (e.g., by clicking on a menu option other than the top listed option). The specific settings and functions of the individual menus are described below.","The image capture application has identified item  as a color photo. Therefore, the image type menu  is set to \u201ccolor photo\u201d. The image type menu  affects how raw data is gathered by the scanner. For example, when the color photo menu option is selected, the scanner gathers both chrominance and luminance data about the image and encodes them using the color number set in color number menu . In contrast, when the grayscale photo menu option is selected, the scanner gathers luminance information about the image, but not chrominance information, and encodes the luminance information using the color number set in color number menu . If the user wants to scan the photograph in grayscale, the user can select the \u201cgrayscale\u201d option of menu control  to override the image capture application's selection of the \u201ccolor photo\u201d option.","The image capture application has chosen 256 colors as the default color number for a future scan of region . Therefore, the color number menu is set to 8-bits. Color number menu  determines how many bits to use to encode the color data of each pixel the scanner generates. The color number menu  affects the detailed scan itself. The image capture application commands the scanner to use a particular color number, which affects what data the scanner will capture. If the user wants more color number, the user can select the \u201cthousands\u201d, \u201cmillions\u201d, or \u201cbillions\u201d options of menu control  to override the image capture application's selection of 256 colors.","The image capture application has chosen to save the image to a .jpg file. Therefore, the format menu  is set to \u201cJPEG\u201d. In some embodiments, the image capture application receives raw data from the scanner and saves the data in format specified by the format menu . In some embodiments, the image capture application commands a scanner to provide the data in the format specified by the format menu  rather than as raw data.","The output format menu  controls the format in which the image capture application will output the image. Some scanners convert images to a selected format themselves, however for some models of scanner the conversion of raw image data to a particular format is performed entirely by the image capture application. That is, the image capture application receives raw image data from the scanner and saves the data in the selected format after (or while) the raw image data has been received from the scanner. Only the post-scan processing of the data is affected by the output format menu , not the data from the scanner itself. If the user prefers not to use the .jpg format, the user can select the \u201cGIF\u201d, \u201cTIFF\u201d, or other format option of format menu  to override the image capture application's selection of the .jpg format.","In some embodiments, some menu controls are sliders. A slider control includes a line and a knob on that line. The line represents the available range of values for that parameter, and the position of the knob selects from among those values. The user slides the knob back and forth to change the values. In some embodiments, some menu controls are check boxes.

In some such embodiments, the image correction parameters are applied to the selected region in the scan display area to provide the user with a preview of the effects that various adjustments will have on the detailed scan of that particular region.","As mentioned above, some automatically determined parameters are displayed on controls that are toggles in the form of checkboxes. In , the OCR checkbox  determines whether to apply an optical character recognition algorithm to the scanned image. The OCR checkbox  is not checked for item , because the image capture application has chosen not to perform a post-scan OCR on an item that has no text in it. In the case of textual item , the OCR check box  would be automatically checked. The user can click on the checkbox  to check or uncheck and thus override the automatically determined post-scan OCR parameter.","The above described manual override operations of the image capture applications of some embodiments can be performed by various processes. One such process is described below.  conceptually illustrates the process  of some embodiments for receiving manual adjustments to automatically identified regions and scanning parameters. The process receives commands from a user and commands a scanner to perform various scans. Several figures described before  provide examples of the states of GUIs of some embodiments during the operations of process . The description of  will note the figures associated with the various operations.","Some embodiments provide a user with manual scan options after directing a scanner to perform a preview scan, receiving a preview image from the scanner, and performing an automatic region decomposition operation that provides an initial identification of one or more separate regions in the scan document. The process  begins after the preview scan when the process displays (at ) automatically identified regions that a user can select to activate manual editing tools. , described above, provides an example of a grouped region displayed for selection. , described above, provides an example of multiple separate regions displayed for selection.","The process then determines (at ) whether the user has selected one of the automatically identified regions. When the user has not selected an automatically identified region, the process waits until the user does select such a region. When the user does select such a region, the process provides (at ) editing tools that allow the user to adjust the identified regions by specifying the location, size, orientation, and scanner settings for one or more subsequent manual scan operations. , described above, provides an example of a GUI providing such editing tools.","The process then determines (at ) whether the user has accepted the automatic selections. In some embodiments, the process determines that the user has accepted the automatic selections when the user activates a manual control for performing a detailed scan without first editing the automatically selected parameters. When the process determines (at ) that the user has not accepted the automatic selections (e.g., by receiving a user command to edit the automatically selected parameters), the process receives (at ) user edits to the location, size, and orientation of the automatically identified scanning region. The edited region determines the location, size, and orientation of a pending detailed scan. , described above, provides an example of a series of user edits to the location, orientation, and size of a region.","The process then receives (at ) edits to the scanner control settings. The scanner control settings determine the scan parameters (e.g., resolution) for the pending detailed scan. They are automatically selected for each region by the image capture application after the preview scan. , described above, provide examples of editable scanner control settings.","The process then receives (at ) a command to perform a detailed scan. The image capture application directs the scanner to scan the edited region using the edited scan parameters. The detailed scan is similar to the detailed scan described in section II. The process then receives (at ) a scanned image from the scanner. The process then performs (at ) any post scan processing that is required by the settings of the scan parameters (e.g., OCR, changing file formats, etc.). In some embodiments, the post-scan processing includes extracting a selected region from a larger set of image data provided by the scanner, as described in relation to  in section I. The process then saves (at ) the processed image. In some embodiments, saving the image includes forwarding the image to a selected application after it has been scanned, as described in relation to . The process then determines (at ) whether another region has been selected. When another region has been selected, then the process returns to operation  and displays the manual selection tool on the new region. When another region has not been selected, the process  ends.","While the above described process  includes operations in a particular order, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that in some embodiments these operations are performed in other orders, or in some cases skipped. For example, a user could choose to edit the scanner control settings and choose not to edit the location, orientation, or size of the scanning region. Similarly, in some embodiments, after a detailed scan is performed, the process will wait for another region to be selected or for some other action to end the process rather than simply ending if another region is not selected.

For instance, the bus  communicatively connects one or more processors  with the system memory , the read-only memory , and the permanent storage device .","From these various memory units, the processor  retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of the invention. In some embodiments the processor comprises a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), an ASIC, or various other electronic components for executing instructions. The read-only-memory (ROM)  stores static data and instructions that are needed by the processor  and other modules of the computer system. The permanent storage device , on the other hand, is a read-and-write memory device. This device is a non-volatile memory unit that stores instructions and data even when the computer system  is off. Some embodiments of the invention use a mass-storage device (such as a magnetic or optical disk and its corresponding disk drive) as the permanent storage device . Some embodiments use one or more removable storage devices (flash memory card or memory stick) as the permanent storage device . Some embodiments use a removable storage device (such as a floppy disk, flash drive, or CD-ROM) as the permanent storage device.","Like the permanent storage device , the system memory  is a read-and-write memory device. However, unlike storage device , the system memory  is a volatile read-and-write memory, such as a random access memory (RAM). The system memory stores some of the instructions and data that the processor needs at runtime.","Instructions and\/or data needed to perform processes of some embodiments are stored in the system memory , the permanent storage device , the read-only memory , or any combination of the three. For example, the various memory units include instructions for processing multimedia items in accordance with some embodiments. From these various memory units, the processor  retrieves instructions to execute and data to process in order to execute the processes of some embodiments.","In some embodiments, the bus  connects to the GPU . The GPU of some embodiments performs various graphics processing functions. These functions may include display functions, rendering, compositing, and\/or other functions related to the processing or display of graphical data.","The bus  also connects to the input and output devices  and . The input devices  enable the user to communicate information and select commands to the computer system. The input devices  include alphanumeric keyboards, touch-screens, and cursor-controllers. The input devices also include audio input devices (e.g., microphones, MIDI musical instruments, etc.) and video input devices (e.g., video cameras, still cameras, optical scanning devices, etc.).","The present application describes a GUI that provides users with numerous ways to perform different sets of operations and functionalities. In some embodiments, these operations and functionalities are performed based on different commands that are received from users through different input devices (e.g., keyboard, trackpad, touchpad, mouse, etc). For example, the present application describes the use of a cursor in the GUI to control (e.g., select, move) objects in the GUI. However, in some embodiments, objects in the GUI can also be controlled or manipulated through other control, such as touch control. In some embodiments, touch control is implemented through an input device that can detect the presence and location of touch on a display of the device. An example of such a device is a touch screen device. In some embodiments, with touch control, a user can directly manipulate objects by interacting with the GUI that is displayed on the display of the touch screen device. For instance, a user can select a particular object in the GUI by simply touching that particular object on the display of the touch screen device. As such, in some embodiments when touch control is utilized, a cursor is not even provided for enabling selection of an object of a GUI. However, when a cursor is provided in a GUI, touch control can be used to control the cursor in some embodiments.","The output devices  include printers, electronic display devices that display still or moving images, and electronic audio devices that play audio generated by the computer system. Electronic display devices in some embodiments display the graphical aspects of a GUI. Electronic display devices include devices such as cathode ray tubes (CRT), liquid crystal displays (LCD), light emitting diode displays (LED) including organic light emitting diode displays (OLED), plasma display panels (PDP), surface-conduction electron-emitter displays (alternatively referred to as a \u201csurface electron display\u201d or SED), electronic paper, etc. Audio output devices include a PC's sound card and speakers, a speaker on a cellular phone, a Bluetooth\u00ae earpiece, etc. Some or all of these output devices may be wirelessly or optically connected to the computer system.","Finally, as shown in , bus  also couples computer  to a network  through a network adapter (not shown). In this manner, the computer can be a part of a network of computers (such as a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or an Intranet) or a network of networks (such as the Internet). Internet. For example, the computer  may be coupled to a web server (through network ) so that a web browser executing on the computer  can interact with the web server as a user interacts with a GUI that operates in the web browser.","Any or all of the components of computer system  may be used in conjunction with the invention. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any other system configuration may also be used in conjunction with the invention or components of the invention.","Some embodiments include electronic components, such as microprocessors, storage and memory that store computer program instructions in a machine-readable or computer-readable medium (alternatively referred to as computer-readable storage media, machine-readable media, or machine-readable storage media). Some examples of such computer-readable media include RAM, ROM, read-only compact discs (CD-ROM), recordable compact discs (CD-R), rewritable compact discs (CD-RW), read-only digital versatile discs (e.g., DVD-ROM, dual-layer DVD-ROM), a variety of recordable\/rewritable DVDs (e.g., DVD-RAM, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, etc.), flash memory (e.g., USB drives, flash drives, SD cards, mini-SD cards, micro-SD cards, etc.), magnetic and\/or solid state hard drives, read-only and recordable blu-ray discs, ultra density optical discs, any other optical or magnetic media, and floppy disks.","The computer-readable media stores a computer program that is executable by at least one processor and includes sets of instructions for performing various operations. Examples of hardware devices configured to store and execute sets of instructions include, but are not limited to application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), programmable logic devices (PLDs), ROM, and RAM devices. Examples of computer programs or computer code include machine code, such as produced by a compiler, and files including higher-level code that are executed by a computer, an electronic component, or a microprocessor using an interpreter. In some embodiments, the hardware includes one or more of the above described computer-readable medium, memory, or storage.","It should be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that any or all of the components of computer system  may be used in conjunction with the invention. Moreover, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any other system configuration may also be used in conjunction with the invention or components of the invention.","While the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, several embodiments were described above by reference to particular image capture applications with particular features and components (e.g., particular arrangements of window areas). However, one of ordinary skill will realize that other embodiments might be implemented with other types of image capture applications with other types of features and components (e.g., other arrangements of window areas).","Moreover, while the examples shown illustrate many individual modules as separate blocks, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that some embodiments combine these modules into a single functional block or element. One of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that some embodiments divide a particular module into multiple modules.","Cursor operations can be managed any number of ways, e.g., use of a mouse, trackpad, etc., but also touch screen based operations. Some embodiments do not even have cursor for enabling selection in touch screen approaches. The media editing application can be a standalone application on a desktop, part of another program (e.g., part of the OS), part of a server based solution (fat client, thin client\/browser based\/web based), etc., or some combination of the preceding.","One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that, while the invention has been described with reference to numerous specific details, the invention can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance, alternate embodiments are implemented by using a generic processor to implement the video processing functions instead of using a GPU. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the invention is not to be limited by the foregoing illustrative details, but rather is to be defined by the appended claims.","The following Appendices provide examples of frameworks. Appendix A includes the APIs of an example image kit framework, while Appendix B includes the APIs of an example of an image capture core framework. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that frameworks with different listings can still fall within the scope of the inventions. For example, some embodiments could use some APIs from the Image Capture framework from Apple\u00ae.","A.
