title: Method for performing computations using wide operands
abstract: A programmable processor and method for improving the performance of processors by expanding at least two source operands, or a source and a result operand, to a width greater than the width of either the general purpose register or the data path width. The present invention provides operands which are substantially larger than the data path width of the processor by using the contents of a general purpose register to specify a memory address at which a plurality of data path widths of data can be read or written, as well as the size and shape of the operand. In addition, several instructions and apparatus for implementing these instructions are described which obtain performance advantages if the operands are not limited to the width and accessible number of general purpose registers.

Each of the above applications and\/or patents are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Communications products require increased computational performance to process digital signals in software on a real time basis. Increases in performance have come through improvements in process technology and by improvements in microprocessor design. Increased parallelism, higher clock rates, increased densities, coupled with improved design tools and compilers have made this more practical. However, many of these improvements cost additional overhead in memory and latency due to a lack of the necessary bandwidth that is closely coupled to the computational units.","The performance level of a processor, and particularly a general purpose processor, can be estimated from the multiple of a plurality of interdependent factors: clock rate, gates per clock, number of operands, operand and data path width, and operand and data path partitioning. Clock rate is largely influenced by the choice of circuit and logic technology, but is also influenced by the number of gates per clock. Gates per clock is how many gates in a pipeline may change state in a single clock cycle. This can be reduced by inserting latches into the data path: when the number of gates between latches is reduced, a higher clock is possible. However, the additional latches produce a longer pipeline length, and thus come at a cost of increased instruction latency. The number of operands is straightforward; for example, by adding with carry-save techniques, three values may be added together with little more delay than is required for adding two values. Operand and data path width defines how much data can be processed at once; wider data paths can perform more complex functions, but generally this comes at a higher implementation cost. Operand and data path partitioning refers to the efficient use of the data path as width is increased, with the objective of maintaining substantially peak usage.","The last factor, operand and data path partitioning, is treated extensively in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,742,840, 5,794,060, 5,794,061, 5,809,321, and 5,822,603, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, which describe systems and methods for enhancing the utilization of a general purpose processor by adding classes of instructions. These classes of instructions use the contents of general purpose registers as data path sources, partition the operands into symbols of a specified size, perform operations in parallel, catenate the results and place the catenated results into a general-purpose register. These patents, all of which are assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, teach a general purpose microprocessor which has been optimized for processing and transmitting media data streams through significant parallelism.","While the foregoing patents offered significant improvements in utilization and performance of a general purpose microprocessor, particularly for handling broadband communications such as media data streams, other improvements are possible.","Many general purpose processors have general registers to store operands for instructions, with the register width matched to the size of the data path. Processor designs generally limit the number of accessible registers per instruction because the hardware to access these registers is relatively expensive in power and area. While the number of accessible registers varies among processor designs, it is often limited to two, three or four registers per instruction when such instructions are designed to operate in a single processor clock cycle or a single pipeline flow. Some processors, such as the Motorola 68000 have instructions to save and restore an unlimited number of registers, but require multiple cycles to perform such an instruction.","The Motorola 68000 also attempts to overcome a narrow data path combined with a narrow register file by taking multiple cycles or pipeline flows to perform an instruction, and thus emulating a wider data path. However, such multiple precision techniques offer only marginal improvement in view of the additional clock cycles required. The width and accessible number of the general purpose registers thus fundamentally limits the amount of processing that can be performed by a single instruction in a register-based machine.","Existing processors may provide instructions that accept operands for which one or more operands are read from a general purpose processor's memory system. However, as these memory operands are generally specified by register operands, and the memory system data path is no wider than the processor data path, the width and accessible number of general purpose operands per instruction per cycle or pipeline flow is not enhanced.","The number of general purpose register operands accessible per instruction is generally limited by logical complexity and instruction size. For example, it might be possible to implement certain desirable but complex functions by specifying a large number of general purpose registers, but substantial additional logic would have to be added to a conventional design to permit simultaneous reading and bypassing of the register values. While dedicated registers have been used in some prior art designs to increase the number or size of source operands or results, explicit instructions load or store values into these dedicated registers, and additional instructions are required to save and restore these registers upon a change of processor context.","The size of an execution unit result may be constrained to that of a general register so that no dedicated or other special storage is required for the result. Specifying a large number of general purpose registers as a result would similarly require substantial additional logic to be added to a conventional design to permit simultaneous writing and bypassing of the register values.","When the size of an execution unit result is constrained, it can limit the amount of computation which can reasonably be handled by a single instruction. As a consequence, algorithms must be implemented in a series of single instruction steps in which all intermediate results can be represented within the constraints. By eliminating this constraint, instruction sets can be developed in which a larger component of an algorithm is implemented as a single instruction, and the representation of intermediate results are no longer limited in size. Further, some of these intermediate results are not required to be retained upon completion of the larger component of an algorithm, so a processor freed of these constraints can improve performance and reduce operating power by not storing and retrieving these results from the general register file. When the intermediate results are not retained in the general register file, processor instruction sets and implemented algorithms are also not constrained by the size of the general register file.","There has therefore been a need for a processor system capable of efficient handling of operands and results of greater width than either the memory system or any accessible general purpose register. There is also a need for a processor system capable of efficient handling of operands and results of greater overall size than the entire general register file.","Commonly-assigned and related U.S. Pat. No. 6,295,599, describes in detail a method and system for improving the performance of general-purpose processors by expanding at least one source operand to a width greater than the width of either the general purpose register or the data path width. Further improvements in performance may be achieved by allowing a plurality of source operands to be expanded to a greater width than either the memory system or any accessible general purpose register, and by allowing the at least one result operand to be expanded to a greater width than either the memory system or any accessible general purpose register.","The present invention provides a system and method for improving the performance of general purpose processors by expanding at least one source operand or at least one result operand to a width greater than the width of either the general purpose register or the data path width. In addition, several classes of instructions will be provided which cannot be performed efficiently if the source operands or the at least one result operand are limited to the width and accessible number of general purpose registers.","In the present invention, source and result operands are provided which are substantially larger than the data path width of the processor. This is achieved, in part, by using a general purpose register to specify at least one memory address from which at least more than one, but typically several data path widths of data can be read. To permit such a wide operand to be performed in a single cycle, a data path functional unit is augmented with dedicated storage to which the memory operand is copied on an initial execution of the instruction. Further execution of the instruction or other similar instructions that specify the same memory address can read the dedicated storage to obtain the operand value. However, such reads are subject to conditions to verify that the memory operand has not been altered by intervening instructions. If the memory operand remains current\u2014that is, the conditions are met\u2014the memory operand fetch can be combined with one or more register operands in the functional unit, producing a result. The size of the result may be constrained to that of a general register so that no dedicated or other special storage is required for the result. The size of the result for additional instructions may not be so constrained, and so utilize dedicated storage to which the result operand is placed on execution of the instruction. The dedicated storage may be implemented in a local memory tightly coupled to the logic circuits that comprise the functional unit.","The present invention extends the previous embodiments to include methods and apparatus for performing operations that both receive operands from wide embedded memories and also deposit results in wide embedded memories. The present invention includes operations that autonomously read and update the wide embedded memories in multiple successive cycles of access and computation. The present invention also describes operations that employ simultaneously two or more independently addressed wide embedded memories.","Exemplary instructions using wide operations include wide instructions that perform bit level switching (Wide Switch), byte or larger table-lookup (Wide Translate), Wide Multiply Matrix, Wide Multiply Matrix Extract, Wide Multiply Matrix Extract Immediate, Wide Multiply Matrix Floating point, and Wide Multiply Matrix Galois.","Additional exemplary instructions using wide operations include wide instructions that solve equations iteratively (Wide Solve Galois), perform fast transforms (Wide Transform Slice), compute digital filter or motion estimation (Wide Convolve Extract, Wide Convolve Floating-point), decode Viterbi or turbo codes (Wide Decode), general look-up tables and interconnection (Wide Boolean).","Another aspect of the present invention addresses efficient usage of a multiplier array that is fully used for high precision arithmetic, but is only partly used for other, lower precision operations. This can be accomplished by extracting the high-order portion of the multiplier product or sum of products, adjusted by a dynamic shift amount from a general register or an adjustment specified as part of the instruction, and rounded by a control value from a register or instruction portion. The rounding may be any of several types, including round-to-nearest\/even, toward zero, floor, or ceiling. Overflows are typically handled by limiting the result to the largest and smallest values that can be accurately represented in the output result.","When an extract is controlled by a register, the size of the result can be specified, allowing rounding and limiting to a smaller number of bits than can fit in the result. This permits the result to be scaled for use in subsequent operations without concern of overflow or rounding. As a result, performance is enhanced. In those instances where the extract is controlled by a register, a single register value defines the size of the operands, the shift amount and size of the result, and the rounding control. By placing such control information in a single register, the size of the instruction is reduced over the number of bits that such an instruction would otherwise require, again improving performance and enhancing processor flexibility. Exemplary instructions are Ensemble Convolve Extract, Ensemble Multiply Extract, Ensemble Multiply Add Extract, and Ensemble Scale Add Extract. With particular regard to the Ensemble Scale Add Extract Instruction, the extract control information is combined in a register with two values used as scalar multipliers to the contents of two vector multiplicands. This combination reduces the number of registers otherwise required, thus reducing the number of bits required for the instruction.","A method of performing a computation in a programmable processor, the programmable processor having a first memory system having a first data path width, and a second memory system and a third memory system each of the second memory system and the third memory system having a data path width which is greater than the first data path width, may comprise the steps of: copying a first memory operand portion from the first memory system to the second memory system, the first memory operand portion having the first data path width;

MicroUnity's Zeus Architecture describes general-purpose processor, memory, and interface subsystems, organized to operate at the enormously high bandwidth rates required for broadband applications.","The Zeus processor performs integer, floating point, signal processing and non-linear operations such as Galois field, table lookup and bit switching on data sizes from 1 bit to 128 bits. Group or SIMD (single instruction multiple data) operations sustain external operand bandwidth rates up to 512 bits (i.e., up to four 128-bit operand groups) per instruction even on data items of small size. The processor performs ensemble operations such as convolution that maintain full intermediate precision with aggregate internal operand bandwidth rates up to 20,000 bits per instruction. The processor performs wide operations such as crossbar switch, matrix multiply and table lookup that use caches embedded in the execution units themselves to extend operands to as much as 32768 bits. All instructions produce at most a single 128-bit general register result, source at most three 128-bit general registers and are free of side effects such as the setting of condition codes and flags. The instruction set design carries the concept of streamlining beyond Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architectures, to simplify implementations that issue several instructions per machine cycle.","The Zeus memory subsystem provides 64-bit virtual and physical addressing for UNIX, Mach, and other advanced OS environments. Separate address instructions enable the division of the processor into decoupled access and execution units, to reduce the effective latency of memory to the pipeline. The Zeus cache supplies the high data and instruction issue rates of the processor, and supports coherency primitives for scaleable multiprocessors. The memory subsystem includes mechanisms for sustaining high data rates not only in block transfer modes, but also in non-unit stride and scatterred access patterns.","The Zeus interface subsystem is designed to match industry-standard protocols and pin-outs. In this way, Zeus can make use of existing infrastructure for building low-cost systems. The interface subsystem is modular, and can be replaced with appropriate protocols and pin-outs for lower-cost and higher-performance systems.","The goal of the Zeus architecture is to integrate these processor, memory, and interface capabilities with optimal simplicity and generality. From the software perspective, the entire machine state consists of a program counter, a single bank of 64 general-purpose 128-bit general registers, and a linear byte-addressed shared memory space with mapped interface registers. All interrupts and exceptions are precise, and occur with low overhead.","Examples discussed herein are intended for Zeus software and hardware developers alike, and defines the interface at which their designs must meet. Zeus pursues the most efficient tradeoffs between hardware and software complexity by making all processor, memory, and interface resources directly accessible to high-level language programs.","Common Elements","Notation","The descriptive notation used in this document is summarized in the table below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["x + y","two's complement addition of x and y.

All system state is memory mapped, so that it can be manipulated by compiled code.","Fixed-point","Zeus provides load and store instructions to move data between memory and the general registers, branch instructions to compare the contents of general registers and to transfer control from one code address to another, and arithmetic operations to perform computation on the contents of general registers, returning the result to general registers.","Load and Store","The load and store instructions move data between memory and the general registers. When loading data from memory into a general register, values are zero-extended or sign-extended to fill the general register. When storing data from a general register into memory, values are truncated on the left to fit the specified memory region.","Load and store instructions that specify a memory region of more than one byte may use either little-endian or big-endian byte ordering: the size and ordering are explicitly specified in the instruction. Regions larger than one byte may be either aligned to addresses that are an even multiple of the size of the region or of unspecified alignment: alignment checking is also explicitly specified in the instruction.","Load and store instructions specify memory addresses as the sum of a base general register and the product of the size of the memory region and either an immediate value or another general register. Scaling maximizes the memory space which can be reached by immediate offsets from a single base general register, and assists in generating memory addresses within iterative loops. Alignment of the address can be reduced to checking the alignment of the first general register.","The load and store instructions are used for fixed-point data as well as floating-point and digital signal processing data; Zeus has a single bank of general registers for all data types.","Swap instructions provide multithread and multiprocessor synchronization, using indivisible operations: add-swap, compare-swap, multiplex-swap, and double-compare-swap. A store-multiplex operation provides the ability to indivisibly write to a portion of an octlet. These instructions always operate on aligned octlet data, using either little-endian or big-endian byte ordering.","Branch","The fixed-point compare-and-branch instructions provide all arithmetic tests for equality and inequality of signed and unsigned fixed-point values. Tests are performed either between two operands contained in general registers, or on the bitwise and of two operands. Depending on the result of the compare, either a branch is taken, or not taken. A taken branch causes an immediate transfer of the program counter to the target of the branch, specified by a 12-bit signed offset from the location of the branch instruction. A non-taken branch causes no transfer; execution continues with the following instruction.","Other branch instructions provide for unconditional transfer of control to addresses too distant to be reached by a 12-bit offset, and to transfer to a target while placing the location following the branch into a general register. The branch through gateway instruction provides a secure means to access code at a higher privilege level, in a form similar to a normal procedure call.","Addressing Operations","A subset of general fixed-point arithmetic operations is available as addressing operations. These include add, subtract, Boolean, and simple shift operations. These addressing operations may be performed at a point in the Zeus processor pipeline so that they may be completed prior to or in conjunction with the execution of load and store operations in a \u201csuperspring\u201d pipeline in which other arithmetic operations are deferred until the completion of load and store operations.","Execution Operations","Many of the operations used for Digital Signal Processing (DSP), which are described in greater detail below, are also used for performing simple scalar operations. These operations perform arithmetic operations on values of 8-, 16-, 32-, 64-, or 128-bit sizes, which are right-aligned in general registers. These execution operations include the add, subtract, boolean and simple shift operations which are also available as addressing operations, but further extend the available set to include three-operand add\/subtract, three-operand boolean, dynamic shifts, and bit-field operations.","Floating-point","Zeus provides all the facilities mandated and recommended by ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985: Binary Floating-point Arithmetic, with the use of supporting software.","Branch Conditionally","The floating-point compare-and-branch instructions provide all the comparison types required and suggested by the IEEE floating-point standard. These floating-point comparisons augment the usual types of numeric value comparisons with special handling for NaN (not-a-number) values. A NaN value compares as \u201cunordered\u201d with respect to any other value, even that of an identical NaN value.","Zeus floating-point compare-branch instructions do not generate an exception on comparisons involving quiet or signaling NaN values. If such exceptions are desired, they can be obtained by combining the use of a floating-point compare-set instruction, with either a floating-point compare-branch instruction on the floating-point operands or a fixed-point compare-branch on the set result.","Because the less and greater relations are anti-commutative, one of each relation that differs from another only by the replacement of an L with a G in the code can be removed by reversing the order of the operands and using the other code. Thus, an L relation can be used in place of a G relation by swapping the operands to the compare-branch or compare-set instruction.","No instructions are provided that branch when the values are unordered. To accomplish such an operation, use the reverse condition to branch over an immediately following unconditional branch, or in the case of an if-then-else clause, reverse the clauses and use the reverse condition.","The E relation can be used to determine the unordered condition of a single operand by comparing the operand with itself.","The following floating-point compare-branch relations are provided as instructions:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0277","num":"0276"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Branch taken if",{}]},{"entry":["Mnemonic","values compare as:","Exception if"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["code","C-like","Unordered","Greater","Less","Equal","unordered","invalid"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["E","==","F","F","F","T","no","no"]},{"entry":["LG","<>","F","T","T","F","no","no"]},{"entry":["L","<","F","F","T","F","no","no"]},{"entry":["GE",">=","F","T","F","T","no","no"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The compare-set floating-point instructions provide all the comparison types supported as branch instructions.

Each of the basic operations splits operand general registers into symbols of the specified precision and performs the same operation on corresponding symbols.","In addition to the basic operations, Zeus performs a variety of operations in which one or more products are summed to each other and\/or to an additional operand. The instructions include a fused multiply-add (E.MUL.ADD.F), convolve (E.CON.F), matrix multiply (E.MUL.MAT.F), and scale-add (E.SCAL.ADD.F).","The results of these operations are computed as if the multiplies are performed to infinite precision, added as if in infinite precision, then rounded only once. Consequently, these operations perform these operations with no rounding of intermediate results that would have limited the accuracy of the result.","Rounding and Exceptions","Rounding is specified within the instructions explicitly, to avoid explicit state registers for a rounding mode. Similarly, the instructions explicitly specify how standard exceptions (invalid operation, division by zero, overflow, underflow and inexact) are to be handled (U.S. Pat. No. 5,812,439 describes this \u201cTechnique of incorporating floating point information into processor instructions.\u201d).","When no rounding is explicitly named by the instruction (default), round to nearest rounding is performed, and all floating-point exception signals cause the standard-specified default result, rather than a trap. When rounding is explicity named by the instruction (N: nearest, Z: zero, F: floor, C: ceiling), the specified rounding is performed, and floating-point exception signals other than inexact cause a floating-point exception trap. When X (exact, or exception) is specified, all floating-point exception signals cause a floating-point exception trap, including inexact.","This technique assists the Zeus processor in executing floating-point operations with greater parallelism. When default rounding and exception handling control is specified in floating-point instructions, Zeus may safely retire instructions following them, as they are guaranteed not to cause data-dependent exceptions. Similarly, floating-point instructions with N, Z, F, or C control can be guaranteed not to cause data-dependent exceptions once the operands have been examined to rule out invalid operations, division by zero, overflow or underflow exceptions. Only floating-point instructions with X control, or when exceptions cannot be ruled out with N, Z, F, or C control need to avoid retiring following instructions until the final result is generated.","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies information to be given to trap handlers for the five floating-point exceptions. The Zeus architecture produces a precise exception, (The program counter points to the instruction that caused the exception and all general register state is present) from which all the required information can be produced in software, as all source operand values and the specified operation are available.","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies a set of five \u201csticky-exception\u201d bits, for recording the occurrence of exceptions that are handled by default. The Zeus architecture produces a precise exception for instructions with N, Z, F, or C control for invalid operation, division by zero, overflow or underflow exceptions and with X control for all floating-point exceptions, from which software may arrange that corresponding sticky-exception bits can be set. Execution of the same instruction with default control will compute the default result with round-to-nearest rounding. Most compound operations not specified by the standard are not available with rounding and exception controls. These compound operations provide round-to-nearest rounding and default exception handling.","NaN Handling","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that operations involving a signaling NaN or invalid operation shall, if no trap occurs and if a floating-point result is to be delivered, deliver a quiet NaN as its result. However, it fails to specify what quiet NaN value to deliver.","Zeus operations that produce a floating-point result and do not trap on invalid operations propagate signaling NaN values from operands to results, changing the signaling NaN values to quiet NaN values by setting the most significant fraction bit and leaving the remaining bits unchanged. Other causes of invalid operations produce the default quiet NaN value, where the sign bit is zero, the exponent field is all one bits, the most significant fraction bit is set and the remaining fraction bits are zero bits. For Zeus operations that produce multiple results catenated together, signaling NaN propagation or quiet NaN production is handled separately and independently for each result symbol.","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that quiet NaN values should be propagated from operand to result by the basic operations. However, it fails to specify which of several quiet NaN values to propagate when more than one operand is a quiet NaN. In addition, the standard does not clearly specify how quiet NaN should be propagated for the multiple-operation instructions provided in Zeus. The standard does not specify the quiet NaN produced as a result of an operand being a signaling NaN when invalid operation exceptions are handled by default. The standard leaves unspecified how quiet and signaling NaN values are propagated though format conversions and the absolute-value, negate and copy operations. This section specifies these aspects left unspecified by the standard.","First of all, for Zeus operations that produce multiple results catenated together, quiet and signaling NaN propagation is handled separately and independently for each result symbol. A quiet or signaling NaN value in a single symbol of an operand causes only those result symbols that are dependent on that operand symbol's value to be propagated as that quiet NaN. Multiple quiet or signaling NaN values in symbols of an operand which influence separate symbols of the result are propagated independently of each other. Any signaling NaN that is propagated has the high-order fraction bit set to convert it to a quiet NaN.","For Zeus operations in which multiple symbols among operands upon which a result symbol is dependent are quiet or signaling NaNs, a priority rule will determine which NaN is propagated. Priority shall be given to the operand that is specified by a general register definition at a lower-numbered (little-endian) bit position within the instruction (rb has priority over rc, which has priority over rd). In the case of operands which are catenated from two general registers, priority shall be assigned based on the general register which has highest priority (lower-numbered bit position within the instruction). In the case of tie (as when the E.SCAL.ADD scaling operand has two corresponding NaN values, or when a E.MUL.CF operand has NaN values for both real and imaginary components of a value), the value which is located at a lower-numbered (little-endian) bit position within the operand is to receive priority. The identification of a NaN as quiet or signaling shall not confer any priority for selection\u2014only the operand position, though a signaling NaN will cause an invalid operand exception.","The sign bit of NaN values propagated shall be complemented if the instruction subtracts or negates the corresponding operand or (but not and) multiplies it by or divides it by or divides it into an operand which has the sign bit set, even if that operand is another NaN. If a NaN is both subtracted and multiplied by a negative value, the sign bit shall be propagated unchanged.","For Zeus operations that convert between two floating-point formats (INFLATE and DEFLATE), NaN values are propagated by preserving the sign and the most-significant fraction bits, except that the most-significant bit of a signalling NaN is set and (for DEFLATE) the least-significant fraction bit preserved is combined, via a logical-or of all fraction bits not preserved. All additional fraction bits (for INFLATE) are set to zero.","For Zeus operations that convert from a floating-point format to a fixed-point format (SINK), NaN values produce zero values (maximum-likelihood estimate). Infinity values produce the largest representable positive or negative fixed-point value that fits in the destination field. When exception traps are enabled, NaN or Infinity values produce a floating-point exception. Underflows do not occur in the SINK operation, they produce \u22121, 0 or +1, depending on rounding controls.","For absolute-value, negate, or copy operations, NaN values are propagated with the sign bit cleared, complemented, or copied, respectively. Signalling NaN values cause the Invalid operation exception, propagating a quieted NaN in corresponding symbol locations (default) or an exception, as specified by the instruction.","Invalid Operation","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that invalid operation shall be signaled if an operand is invalid for the operation to be performed. Zeus operations that specify a rounding mode trap on invalid operation. Zeus operations that default the rounding mode (to round to nearest) do not trap on invalid operation and produce a quiet NaN result as described above.","Standard compliant software produces the required result to a trap handler by following the requirements of the standard. Software may simulate untrapped invalid operation for other specified rounding modes by following the requirements of the standard for the result.","Division by Zero","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that division by zero shall be signaled the divisor is zero and the dividend is a finite non zero number. Zeus operations that specify a rounding mode trap on division by zero. Zeus operations that default the rounding mode (to round to nearest) do not trap on division by zero and produce a signed infinity result.","Standard compliant software produces the required result to a trap handler by following the requirements of the standard. Software may simulate untrapped division by zero for other specified rounding modes by following the requirements of the standard for the result.","Overflow","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that overflow shall be signaled whenever the destination format's largest finite number is exceeded in magnitude by what would have been the rounded floating-point result were the exponent range unbounded. Zeus operations that specify a rounding mode trap on overflow. Zeus operations that default the rounding mode (to round to nearest) do not trap on overflow and produce a result that carries all overflows to infinity with the sign of the intermediate result.","Standard compliant software produces the required result to a trap handler by following the requirements of the standard. Software may simulate untrapped overflow for other specified rounding modes by following the requirements of the standard for the result. The standard specifies a value with the sign of the intermediate result and specifies the largest finite number when the overflow is in the direction away from rounding or infinity otherwise.","Underflow","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that underflow is dependent on two correlated events: tininess and loss of accuracy, but allows some latitute in the definition of these conditions. For Zeus operations, tininess is detected \u201cafter rounding,\u201d that is when a non zero result computed as though the exponent range were unbounded would lie between the smallest normalized number for the format of the result. Zeus hardware does not produce sticky exception bits, so a notion of loss of accuracy does not apply.","Zeus operations that specify a rounding mode trap on underflow, which is to be signaled whenever tininess occurs. Zeus operations that default the rounding mode (to round to nearest) do not trap on underflow and produce a result that is zero or a denormalized number.","Standard compliant software produces the required result to a trap handler by following the requirements of the standard. Software may simulate untrapped underflow sticky exceptions by using the trapping operations and simulating a result, applying whatever definition of loss of accuracy is desired.","Inexact","ANSI\/IEEE standard 754-1985 specifies that inexact shall be signaled whenever the rounded result of an operation is not exact or if it overflows without an overflow trap. Zeus operations that specify \u201cexact\u201d rounding trap on inexact. Zeus operations that default the rounding mode (to round to nearest) or specify a rounding mode do not trap on inexact and produce a rounded or overflowed result.","Standard compliant software produces the required result to a trap handler by following the requirements of the standard, delivering a rounded result.","Floating-point functions","Referring to , functions are defined for use within the detailed instruction definitions in the following section. In these functions an internal format represents infinite-precision floating-point values as a four-element structure consisting of (1) s (sign bit): 0 for positive, 1 for negative, (2) t (type): NORM, ZERO, SNAN, QNAN, INFINITY, (3) e (exponent), and (4) f: (fraction). The mathematical interpretation of a normal value places the binary point at the units of the fraction, adjusted by the exponent: (\u22121)^*(2^)*f. The function F converts a packed IEEE floating-point value into internal format. The function PackF converts an internal format back into IEEE floating-point format, with rounding and exception control.","Digital Signal Processing","The Zeus processor provides a set of operations that maintain the fullest possible use of 128-bit data paths when operating on lower-precision fixed-point or floating-point vector values. These operations are useful for several application areas, including digital signal processing, image processing and synthetic graphics. The basic goal of these operations is to accelerate the performance of algorithms that exhibit the following characteristics:","Low-precision arithmetic","The operands and intermediate results are fixed-point values represented in no greater than 64 bit precision. For floating-point arithmetic, operands and intermediate results are of 16, 32, or 64 bit precision.","The fixed-point arithmetic operations include add, subtract, multiply, divide, shifts, and set on compare.","The use of fixed-point arithmetic permits various forms of operation reordering that are not permitted in floating-point arithmetic. Specifically, commutativity and associativity, and distribution identities can be used to reorder operations. Compilers can evaluate operations to determine what intermediate precision is required to get the specified arithmetic result.","Zeus supports several levels of precision, as well as operations to convert between these different levels. These precision levels are always powers of two, and are explicitly specified in the operation code.","When specified, add, subtract, and shift operations may cause a fixed-point arithmetic exception to occur on resulting conditions such as signed or unsigned overflow. The fixed-point arithmetic exception may also be invoked upon a signed or unsigned comparison.","Sequential Access to Data","The algorithms are or can be expressed as operations on sequentially ordered items in memory. Scatter-gather memory access or sparse-matrix techniques are not required.","Where an index variable is used with a multiplier, such multipliers must be powers of two. When the index is of the form: nx+k, the value of n must be a power of two, and the values referenced should have k include the majority of values in the range 0 . . . n\u22121. A negative multiplier may also be used.","Vectorizable Operations","The operations performed on these sequentially ordered items are identical and independent. Conditional operations are either rewritten to use Boolean variables or masking, or the compiler is permitted to convert the code into such a form.","Data-handling Operations","The characteristics of these algorithms include sequential access to data, which permit the use of the normal load and store operations to reference the data. Octlet and hexlet loads and stores reference several sequential items of data, the number depending on the operand precision.","The discussion of these operations is independent of byte ordering, though the ordering of bit fields within octlets and hexlets must be consistent with the ordering used for bytes. Specifically, if big-endian byte ordering is used for the loads and stores, the figures below should assume that index values increase from left to right, and for little-endian byte ordering, the index values increase from right to left. For this reason, the figures indicate different index values with different shades, rather than numbering.","When an index of the nx+k form is used in array operands, where n is a power of 2, data memory sequentially loaded contains elements useful for separate operands. The \u201cshuffle\u201d instruction divides a triclet of data up into two hexlets, with alternate bit fields of the source triclet grouped together into the two results. An immediate field, h, in the instruction specifies which of the two regrouped hexlets to select for the result. For example, two X.SHUFFLE.PAIR rd=rc,rb,32,128,h operations rearrange the source triclet (c,b) into two hexlets as in .","In the shuffle operation, two hexlet general registers specify the source triclet, and one of the two result hexlets are specified as hexlet general register.","The example above directly applies to the case where n is 2. When n is larger, shuffle operations can be used to further subdivide the sequential stream. For example, when n is 4, we need to deal out 4 sets of doublet operands, as shown in . (An example of the use of a four-way deal is a digital signal processing application such as conversion of color to monochrome.)","When an array result of computation is accessed with an index of the form nx+k, for n a power of 2, the reverse of the \u201cdeal\u201d operation needs to be performed on vectors of results to interleave them for storage in sequential order. The \u201cshuffle\u201d operation interleaves the bit fields of two octlets of results into a single hexlet. For example a X.SHUFFLE.16 operation combines two octlets of doublet fields into a hexlet as in .","For larger values of n, a series of shuffle operations can be used to combine additional sets of fields, similarly to the mechanism used for the deal operations. For example, when n is 4, we need to shuffle up 4 sets of doublet operands, as shown in . (An example of a four-way shuffle is a digital signal processing application such as conversion of monochrome to color.)","When the index of a source array operand or a destination array result is negated, or in other words, if of the form nx+k where n is negative, the elements of the array must be arranged in reverse order. The \u201cswizzle\u201d operation can reverse the order of the bit fields in a hexlet. For example, a X.SWIZZLE rd=rc,127,112 operation reverses the doublets within a hexlet: as shown in .","In some cases, it is desirable to use a group instruction in which one or more operands is a single value, not an array. The \u201cswizzle\u201d operation can also copy operands to multiple locations within a hexlet. For example, a X.SWIZZLE 15,0 operation copies the low-order 16 bits to each double within a hexlet.","Variations of the deal and shuffle operations are also useful for converting from one precision to another. This may be required if one operand is represented in a different precision than another operand or the result, or if computation must be performed with intermediate precision greater than that of the operands, such as when using an integer multiply.","When converting from a higher precision to a lower precision, specifically when halving the precision of a hexlet of bit fields, half of the data must be discarded, and the bit fields packed together. The \u201ccompress\u201d operation is a variant of the \u201cdeal\u201d operation, in which the operand is a hexlet, and the result is an octlet. An arbitrary half-sized sub-field of each bit field can be selected to appear in the result. For example, a selection of bits  . . .  of each quadlet in a hexlet is performed by the X.COMPRESS rd=rc,16,4 operation as shown in .","When converting from lower-precision to higher-precision, specifically when doubling the precision of an octlet of bit fields, one of several techniques can be used, either multiply, expand, or shuffle. Each has certain useful properties. In the discussion below, m is the precision of the source operand.","The multiply operation, described in detail below, automatically doubles the precision of the result, so multiplication by a constant vector will simultaneously double the precision of the operand and multiply by a constant that can be represented in m bits.","An operand can be doubled in precision and shifted left with the \u201cexpand\u201d operation, which is essentially the reverse of the \u201ccompress\u201d operation. For example the X.EXPAND rd=rc,16,4 expands from 16 bits to 32, and shifts 4 bits left as shown in ","The \u201cshuffle\u201d operation can double the precision of an operand and multiply it by 1 (unsigned only), 2or 2+1, by specifying the sources of the shuffle operation to be a zeroed general register and the source operand, the source operand and zero, or both to be the source operand. When multiplying by 2m, a constant can be freely added to the source operand by specifying the constant as the right operand to the shuffle.","Arithmetic Operations","The characteristics of the algorithms that affect the arithmetic operations most directly are low-precision arithmetic, and vectorizable operations. The fixed-point arithmetic operations provided are most of the functions provided in the standard integer unit, except for those that check conditions. These functions include add, subtract, bitwise Boolean operations, shift, set on condition, and multiply, in forms that take packed sets of bit fields of a specified size as operands. The floating-point arithmetic operations provided are as complete as the scalar floating-point arithmetic set. The result is generally a packed set of bit fields of the same size as the operands, except that the fixed-point multiply function intrinsically doubles the precision of the bit field.","Conditional operations are provided only in the sense that the set on condition operations can be used to construct bit masks that can select between alternate vector expressions, using the bitwise Boolean operations. All instructions operate over the entire octlet or hexlet operands, and produce a hexlet result. The sizes of the bit fields supported are always powers of two.","Galois Field Operations","Zeus provides a general software solution to the most common operations required for Galois Field arithmetic. The instructions provided include a polynomial multiply, with the polynomial specified as one general register operand. This instruction can be used to perform CRC generation and checking, Reed-Solomon code generation and checking, and spread-spectrum encoding and decoding.","Software Conventions","The following section describes software conventions that are to be employed at software module boundaries, in order to permit the combination of separately compiled code and to provide standard interfaces between application, library and system software. General register usage and procedure call conventions may be modified, simplified or optimized when a single compilation encloses procedures within a compilation unit so that the procedures have no external interfaces. For example, internal procedures may permit a greater number of general register-passed parameters, or have general registers allocated to avoid the need to save general registers at procedure boundaries, or may use a single stack or data pointer allocation to suffice for more than one level of procedure call.","General Register Usage","All Zeus general registers are identical and general-purpose; there is no dedicated zero-valued general register, and there are no dedicated floating-point general registers. However, some procedure-call-oriented instructions imply usage of general registers zero (0) and one (1) in a manner consistent with the conventions described below.

Compilers may choose to allocate variables into caller or callee saved general registers depending on how their lifetimes overlap with procedure calls.","Procedure Calling Conventions","Procedure parameters are normally allocated in general registers, starting from general register 2 up to general register 9. These general registers hold up to 8 parameters, which may each be of any size from one byte to sixteen bytes (hexlet), including floating-point and small structure parameters. Additional parameters are passed in memory, allocated on the stack. For C procedures which use varargs.h or stdarg.h and pass parameters to further procedures, the compilers must leave room in the stack memory allocation to save general registers 2 through 9 into memory contiguously with the additional stack memory parameters, so that procedures such as _doprnt can refer to the parameters as an array.","Procedure return values are also allocated in general registers, starting from general register 2 up to general register 9. Larger values are passed in memory, allocated on the stack.","There are several pointers maintained in general registers for the procedure calling conventions: lp, sp, dp, fp.","The lp general register contains the address to which the callee should return to at the conclusion of the procedure. If the procedure is also a caller, the lp general register will need to be saved on the stack, once, before any procedure call, and restored, once, after all procedure calls. The procedure returns with a branch instruction, specifying the lp general register.","The sp general register is used to form addresses to save parameter and other general registers, maintain local variables, i.e., data that is allocated as a LIFO stack. For procedures that require a stack, normally a single allocation is performed, which allocates space for input parameters, local variables, saved general registers, and output parameters all at once. The sp general register is always hexlet aligned.","The dp general register is used to address pointers, literals and static variables for the procedure. The dp general register points to a small (approximately 4096-entry) array of pointers, literals, and statically-allocated variables, which is used locally to the procedure. The uses of the dp general register are similar to the use of the gp general register on a Mips R-series processor, except that each procedure may have a different value, which expands the space addressable by small offsets from this pointer. This is an important distinction, as the offset field of Zeus load and store instructions are only 12 bits. The compiler may use additional general registers and\/or indirect pointers to address larger regions for a single procedure. The compiler may also share a single dp general register value between procedures which are compiled as a single unit (including procedures which are externally callable), eliminating the need to save, modify and restore the dp general register for calls between procedures which share the same dp general register value.","Load- and store-immediate-aligned instructions, specifying the dp general register as the base general register, are generally used to obtain values from the dp region. These instructions shift the immediate value by the logarithm of the size of the operand, so loads and stores of large operands may reach farther from the dp general register than of small operands. Referring to , the size of the addressable region is maximized if the elements to be placed in the dp region are sorted according to size, with the smallest elements placed closest to the dp base. At points where the size changes, appropriate padding is added to keep elements aligned to memory boundaries matching the size of the elements. Using this technique, the maximum size of the dp region is always at least 4096 items, and may be larger when the dp area is composed of a mixture of data sizes.","The dp general register mechanism also permits code to be shared, with each static instance of the dp region assigned to a different address in memory. In conjunction with position-independent or pc-relative branches, this allows library code to be dynamically relocated and shared between processes.","To implement an inter-module (separately compiled) procedure call, the lp general register is loaded with the entry point of the procedure, and the dp general register is loaded with the value of the dp general register required for the procedure. These two values are located adjacent to each other as a pair of octlet quantities in the dp region for the calling procedure. For a statically-linked inter-module procedure call, the linker fills in the values at link time. However, this mechanism also provides for dynamic linking, by initially filling in the lp and dp fields in the data structure to invoke the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker can use the contents of the lp and\/or dp general registers to determine the identity of the caller and callee, to find the location to fill in the pointers and resume execution. Specifically, the lp value is initially set to point to an entry point in the dynamic linker, and the dp value is set to point to itself: the location of the lp and dp values in the dp region of the calling procedure. The identity of the procedure can be discovered from a string following the dp pointer, or a separate table, indexed by the dp pointer.","The fp general register is used to address the stack frame when the stack size varies during execution of a procedure, such as when using the GNU C alloca function. When the stack size can be determined at compile time, the sp general register is used to address the stack frame and the fp general register may be used for any other general purpose as a callee-saved general register.","Typical Static-linked, Intra-module calling sequence:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0353","num":"0352"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"caller (non-leaf):"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["caller:","A.ADDI","sp@-size","\/\/ allocate caller stack frame"]},{"entry":[{},"S.I.64.A","lp,sp,off","\/\/ save original lp general register"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"...

Rather than invoke system calls as an exception, which involves significant latency and complication, we prefer to use a modified procedure call in which the process privilege level is quietly raised to the required level. To provide this mechanism safely, interaction with the virtual memory system is required.","Such a procedure must not be entered from anywhere other than its legitimate entry point, to prohibit entering a procedure after the point at which security checks are performed or with invalid general register contents, otherwise the access to a higher privilege level can lead to a security violation. In addition, the procedure generally must have access to memory data, for which addresses must be produced by the privileged code. To facilitate generating these addresses, the branch-gateway instruction allows the privileged code procedure to rely the fact that a single general register has been verified to contain a pointer to a valid memory region.","The branch-gateway instruction ensures both that the procedure is invoked at a proper entry point, and that other general registers such as the data pointer and stack pointer can be properly set. To ensure this, the branch-gateway instruction retrieves a \u201cgateway\u201d directly from the protected virtual memory space. The gateway contains the virtual address of the entry point of the procedure and the target privilege level. A gateway can only exist in regions of the virtual address space designated to contain them, and can only be used to access privilege levels at or below the privilege level at which the memory region can be written to ensure that a gateway cannot be forged.","The branch-gateway instruction ensures that general register 1 (dp) contains a valid pointer to the gateway for this target code address by comparing the contents of general register 0 (lp) against the gateway retrieved from memory and causing an exception trap if they do not match. By ensuring that general register 1 points to the gateway, auxiliary information, such as the data pointer and stack pointer can be set by loading values located by the contents of general register 1. For example, the eight bytes following the gateway may be used as a pointer to a data region for the procedure.","Referring to  before executing the branch-gateway instruction, general register 1 must be set to point at the gateway, and general register 0 must be set to the address of the target code address plus the desired privilege level. A \u201cL.I.64.L.A r0=r1,0\u201d instruction is one way to set general register 0, if general register 1 has already been set, but any means of getting the correct value into general register 0 is permissible.","Similarly, a return from a system or privileged routine involves a reduction of privilege. This need not be carefully controlled by architectural facilities, so a procedure may freely branch to a less-privileged code address.

Indeed, if a B.GATE instruction is used when the privilege level in the lp general register is not higher than the current privilege level, the B.GATE instruction performs an identical function to a B.LINK.","The callee, if it uses a stack for local variable allocation, cannot necessarily trust the value of the sp passed to it, as it can be forged. Similarly, any pointers which the callee provides should not be used directly unless it they are verified to point to regions which the callee should be permitted to address. This can be avoided by defining application programming interfaces (APIs) in which all values are passed and returned in general registers, or by using a trusted, intermediate privilege wrapper routine to pass and return parameters. The method described below can also be used.","It can be useful to have highly privileged code call less-privileged routines. For example, a user may request that errors in a privileged routine be reported by invoking a user-supplied error-logging routine. To invoke the procedure, the privilege can be reduced via the branch-down instruction. The return from the procedure actually requires an increase in privilege, which must be carefully controlled. This is dealt with by placing the procedure call within a lower-privilege procedure wrapper, which uses the branch-gateway instruction to return to the higher privilege region after the call through a secure re-entry point. Special care must be taken to ensure that the less-privileged routine is not permitted to gain unauthorized access by corruption of the stack or saved general registers, such as by saving all general registers and setting up a new stack frame (or restoring the original lower-privilege stack) that may be manipulated by the less-privileged routine. Finally, such a technique is vulnerable to an unprivileged routine attempting to use the re-entry point directly, so it may be appropriate to keep a privileged state variable which controls permission to enter at the re-entry point.","Processor Layout","Referring first to , a general purpose processor is illustrated therein in block diagram form. In , four copies of an access unit are shown, each with an access instruction fetch queue A-Queue -. Each access instruction fetch queue A-Queue - is coupled to an access register file AR -, which are each coupled to two access functional units A -. In a typical embodiment, each thread of the processor may have on the order of sixty-four general purpose registers (e.g., the AR's - and ER's -). The access units function independently for four simultaneous threads of execution, and each compute program control flow by performing arithmetic and branch instructions and access memory by performing load and store instructions. These access units also provide wide operand specifiers for wide operand instructions. These eight access functional units A - produce results for access register files AR - and memory addresses to a shared memory system -.","In one embodiment, the memory hierarchy includes on-chip instruction and data memories, instruction and data caches, a virtual memory facility, and interfaces to external devices. In , the memory system is comprised of a combined cache and niche memory , an external bus interface , and, externally to the device, a secondary cache  and main memory system with I\/O devices . The memory contents fetched from memory system - are combined with execute instructions not performed by the access unit, and entered into the four execute instruction queues E-Queue -. For wide instructions, memory contents fetched from memory system - are also provided to wide operand microcaches - by bus . Instructions and memory data from E-queue - are presented to execution register files -, which fetch execution register file source operands. The instructions are coupled to the execution unit arbitration unit Arbitration , that selects which instructions from the four threads are to be routed to the available execution functional units E  and , X  and , G - and -, and T . The execution functional units E  and , the execution functional units X  and , and the execution functional unit T  each contain a wide operand microcache -, which are each coupled to the memory system  by bus .","The execution functional units G - and - are group arithmetic and logical units that perform simple arithmetic and logical instructions, including group operations wherein the source and result operands represent a group of values of a specified symbol size, which are partitioned and operated on separately, with results catenated together. In a presently preferred embodiment the data path is 128 bits wide, although the present invention is not intended to be limited to any specific size of data path.","The execution functional units X  and  are crossbar switch units that perform crossbar switch instructions. The crossbar switch units  and  perform data handling operations on the data stream provided over the data path source operand buses -, including deals, shuffles, shifts, expands, compresses, swizzles, permutes and reverses, plus the wide operations discussed hereinafter. In a key element of a first aspect of the invention, at least one such operation will be expanded to a width greater than the general register and data path width.","The execution functional units E  and  are ensemble units that perform ensemble instructions using a large array multiplier, including group or vector multiply and matrix multiply of operands partitioned from data path source operand buses - and treated as integer, floating point, polynomial or Galois field values. Matrix multiply instructions and other operations utilize a wide operand loaded into the wide operand microcache  and .","The execution functional unit T  is a translate unit that performs table-look-up operations on a group of operands partitioned from a register operand, and catenates the result. The Wide Translate instruction utilizes a wide operand loaded into the wide operand microcache .","The execution functional units E , , execution functional units X\u2014, , and execution functional unit T each contain dedicated storage to permit storage of source operands including wide operands as discussed hereinafter. The dedicated storage -, which may be thought of as a wide microcache, typically has a width which is a multiple of the width of the data path operands related to the data path source operand buses -. Thus, if the width of the data path - is 128 bits, the dedicated storage - may have a width of 256, 512, 1024 or 2048 bits. Operands which utilize the full width of the dedicated storage are referred to herein as wide operands, although it is not necessary in all instances that a wide operand use the entirety of the width of the dedicated storage; it is sufficient that the wide operand use a portion greater than the width of the memory data path of the output of the memory system - and the functional unit data path of the input of the execution functional units -, though not necessarily greater than the width of the two combined. Because the width of the dedicated storage - is greater than the width of the memory operand bus , portions of wide operands are loaded sequentially into the dedicated storage -. However, once loaded, the wide operands may then be used at substantially the same time. It can be seen that functional units - and associated execution registers - form a data functional unit, the exact elements of which may vary with implementation.","The execution register file ER - source operands are coupled to the execution units - using source operand buses - and to the execution units - using source operand buses -. The function unit result operands from execution units - are coupled to the execution register file ER - using result bus  and the function units result operands from execution units - are coupled to the execution register file using result bus .","Wide Multiply Matrix","The wide operands of the present invention provide the ability to execute complex instructions such as the wide multiply matrix instruction shown in , which can be appreciated in an alternative form, as well, from . As can be appreciated from , a wide operand permits, for example, the matrix multiplication of various sizes and shapes which exceed the data path width. The example of  involves a matrix specified by register rc having 128*64\/size bits (512 bits for this example) multiplied by a vector contained in register rb having 128 bits, to yield a result, placed in register rd, of 128 bits.","The notation used in  and following similar figures illustrates a multiplication as a shaded area at the intersection of two operands projected in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. A summing node is illustrated as a line segment connecting a darkened dots at the location of multiplier products that are summed. Products that are subtracted at the summing node are indicated with a minus symbol within the shaded area.","When the instruction operates on floating-point values, the multiplications and summations illustrated are floating point multiplications and summations. An exemplary embodiment may perform these operations without rounding the intermediate results, thus computing the final result as if computed to infinite precision and then rounded only once.","It can be appreciated that an exemplary embodiment of the multipliers may compute the product in carry-save form and may encode the multiplier rb using Booth encoding to minimize circuit area and delay. It can be appreciated that an exemplary embodiment of such summing nodes may perform the summation of the products in any order, with particular attention to minimizing computation delay, such as by performing the additions in a binary or higher-radix tree, and may use carry-save adders to perform the addition to minimize the summation delay. It can also be appreciated that an exemplary embodiment may perform the summation using sufficient intermediate precision that no fixed-point or floating-point overflows occur on intermediate results.","A comparison of  can be used to clarify the relation between the notation used in  and the more conventional schematic notation in , as the same operation is illustrated in these two figures.","Wide Operand","The operands that are substantially larger than the data path width of the processor are provided by using a general-purpose register to specify a memory specifier from which more than one but in some embodiments several data path widths of data can be read into the dedicated storage. The memory specifier typically includes the memory address together with the size and shape of the matrix of data being operated on. The memory specifier or wide operand specifier can be better appreciated from , in which a specifier  is seen to be an address, plus a field representative of the size\/2 and a further field representative of width\/2, where size is the product of the depth and width of the data. The address is aligned to a specified size, for example sixty four bytes, so that a plurality of low order bits (for example, six bits) are zero. The specifier  can thus be seen to comprise a first field  for the address, plus two field indicia  within the low order six bits to indicate size and width.","Specifier Decoding","The decoding of the specifier  may be further appreciated from  where, for a given specifier  made up of an address field  together with a field  comprising plurality of low order bits. By a series of arithmetic operations shown at steps  and , the portion of the field  representative of width\/2 is developed. In a similar series of steps shown at  and , the value of t is decoded, which can then be used to decode both size and address. The portion of the field  representative of size\/2 is decoded as shown at steps  and , while the address is decoded in a similar way at steps  and .","Wide Function Unit","The wide function unit may be better appreciated from , in which a register number  is provided to an operand checker . Wide operand specifier  communicates with the operand checker  and also addresses memory  having a defined memory width. The memory address includes a plurality of register operands A n, which are accumulated in a dedicated storage portion  of a data functional unit . In the exemplary embodiment shown in , the dedicated storage . can be seen to have a width equal to eight data path widths, such that eight wide operand portions A-H are sequentially loaded into the dedicated storage to form the wide operand. Although eight portions are shown in , the present invention is not limited to eight or any other specific multiple of data path widths. Once the wide operand portions A-H are sequentially loaded, they may be used as a single wide operand  by the functional element , which may be any element(s) from  connected thereto. The result of the wide operand is then provided to a result register , which in a presently preferred embodiment is of the same width as the memory width.","Once the wide operand is successfully loaded into the dedicated storage , a second aspect of the present invention may be appreciated. Further execution of this instruction or other similar instructions that specify the same memory address can read the dedicated storage to obtain the operand value under specific conditions that determine whether the memory operand has been altered by intervening instructions. Assuming that these conditions are met, the memory operand fetch from the dedicated storage is combined with one or more register operands in the functional unit, producing a result. In some embodiments, the size of the result is limited to that of a general register, so that no similar dedicated storage is required for the result. However, in some different embodiments, the result may be a wide operand, to further enhance performance.","To permit the wide operand value to be addressed by subsequent instructions specifying the same memory address, various conditions must be checked and confirmed:","Those Conditions Include:","Each memory store instruction checks the memory address against the memory addresses recorded for the dedicated storage. Any match causes the storage to be marked invalid, since a memory store instruction directed to any of the memory addresses stored in dedicated storage  means that data has been overwritten.","The register number used to address the storage is recorded. If no intervening instructions have written to the register, and the same register is used on the subsequent instruction, the storage is valid (unless marked invalid by rule #1).","If the register has been modified or a different register number is used, the value of the register is read and compared against the address recorded for the dedicated storage. This uses more resources than #1 because of the need to fetch the register contents and because the width of the register is greater than that of the register number itself. If the address matches, the storage is valid. The new register number is recorded for the dedicated storage.","If conditions #2 or #3 are not met, the register contents are used to address the general-purpose processor's memory and load the dedicated storage. If dedicated storage is already fully loaded, a portion of the dedicated storage must be discarded (victimized) to make room for the new value. The instruction is then performed using the newly updated dedicated storage. The address and register number is recorded for the dedicated storage.","By checking the above conditions, the need for saving and restoring the dedicated storage is eliminated. In addition, if the context of the processor is changed and the new context does not employ Wide instructions that reference the same dedicated storage, when the original context is restored, the contents of the dedicated storage are allowed to be used without refreshing the value from memory, using checking rule #3. Because the values in the dedicated storage are read from memory and not modified directly by performing wide operations, the values can be discarded at any time without saving the results into general memory. This property simplifies the implementation of rule #4 above.","An alternate embodiment of the present invention can replace rule #1 above with the following rule:","1a. Each memory store instruction checks the memory address against the memory addresses recorded for the dedicated storage. Any match causes the dedicated storage to be updated, as well as the general memory.","By use of the above rule 1.a, memory store instructions can modify the dedicated storage, updating just the piece of the dedicated storage that has been changed, leaving the remainder intact. By continuing to update the general memory, it is still true that the contents of the dedicated memory can be discarded at any time without saving the results into general memory. Thus rule #4 is not made more complicated by this choice. The advantage of this alternate embodiment is that the dedicated storage need not be discarded (invalidated) by memory store operations.","Wide Microcache Data Structures","Referring next to , an exemplary arrangement of the data structures of the wide microcache or dedicated storage  may be better appreciated. The wide microcache contents, wmc.c, can be seen to form a plurality of data path widths A-n, although in the example shown the number is eight. The physical address, wmc.pa, is shown as 64 bits in the example shown, although the invention is not limited to a specific width. The size of the contents, wmc.size, is also provided in a field which is shown as 10 bits in an exemplary embodiment. A \u201ccontents valid\u201d flag, wmc.cv, of one bit is also included in the data structure, together with a two bit field for thread last used, or wmc.th. In addition, a six bit field for register last used, wmc.reg, is provided in an exemplary embodiment. Further, a one bit flag for register and thread valid, or wmc.rtv, may be provided.","Wide Microcache Control-Software","The process by which the microcache is initially written with a wide operand, and thereafter verified as valid for fast subsequent operations, may be better appreciated from . The process begins at , and progresses to step  where a check of the register contents is made against the stored value wmc.rc. If true, a check is made at step  to verify the thread. If true, the process then advances to step  to verify whether the register and thread are valid. If step  reports as true, a check is made at step  to verify whether the contents are valid. If all of steps  through  return as true, the subsequent instruction is able to utilize the existing wide operand as shown at step , after which the process ends. However, if any of steps  through  return as false, the process branches to step , where content, physical address and size are set. Because steps  through  all lead to either step  or , steps  through  may be performed in any order or simultaneously without altering the process. The process then advances to step  where size is checked. This check basically ensures that the size of the translation unit is greater than or equal to the size of the wide operand, so that a physical address can directly replace the use of a virtual address. The concern is that, in some embodiments, the wide operands may be larger than the minimum region that the virtual memory system is capable of mapping. As a result, it would be possible for a single contiguous virtual address range to be mapped into multiple, disjoint physical address ranges, complicating the task of comparing physical addresses. By determining the size of the wide operand and comparing that size against the size of the virtual address mapping region which is referenced, the instruction is aborted with an exception trap if the wide operand is larger than the mapping region. This ensures secure operation of the processor. Software can then re-map the region using a larger size map to continue execution if desired. Thus, if size is reported as unacceptable at step , an exception is generated at step . If size is acceptable, the process advances to step  where physical address is checked. If the check reports as met, the process advances to step , where a check of the contents valid flag is made. If either check at step  or  reports as false, the process branches and new content is written into the dedicated storage , with the fields thereof being set accordingly. Whether the check at step  reported true, or whether new content was written at step , the process advances to step  where appropriate fields are set to indicate the validity of the data, after which the requested function can be performed at step . The process then ends.","Wide Microcache Control-Hardware","Referring next to , which together show the operation of the microcache controller from a hardware standpoint, the operation of the microcache controller may be better understood. In the hardware implementation, it is clear that conditions which are indicated as sequential steps in  above can be performed in parallel, reducing the delay for such wide operand checking. Further, a copy of the indicated hardware may be included for each wide microcache, and thereby all such microcaches as may be alternatively referenced by an instruction can be tested in parallel. It is believed that no further discussion of  is required in view of the extensive discussion of , above.","Various alternatives to the foregoing approach do exist for the use of wide operands, including an implementation in which a single instruction can accept two wide operands, partition the operands into symbols, multiply corresponding symbols together, and add the products to produce a single scalar value or a vector of partitioned values of width of the register file, possibly after extraction of a portion of the sums. Such an instruction can be valuable for detection of motion or estimation of motion in video compression. A further enhancement of such an instruction can incrementally update the dedicated storage if the address of one wide operand is within the range of previously specified wide operands in the dedicated storage, by loading only the portion not already within the range and shifting the in-range portion as required. Such an enhancement allows the operation to be performed over a \u201csliding window\u201d of possible values. In such an instruction, one wide operand is aligned and supplies the size and shape information, while the second wide operand, updated incrementally, is not aligned.","The Wide Convolve Extract instruction and Wide Convolve Floating-point instruction described below is one alternative embodiment of an instruction that accepts two wide operands.","Another alternative embodiment of the present invention can define additional instructions where the result operand is a wide operand. Such an enhancement removes the limit that a result can be no larger than the size of a general register, further enhancing performance. These wide results can be cached locally to the functional unit that created them, but must be copied to the general memory system before the storage can be reused and before the virtual memory system alters the mapping of the address of the wide result. Data paths must be added so that load operations and other wide operations can read these wide results\u2014forwarding of a wide result from the output of a functional unit back to its input is relatively easy, but additional data paths may have to be introduced if it is desired to forward wide results back to other functional units as wide operands.","As previously discussed, a specification of the size and shape of the memory operand is included with the low-order bits of the address. In a presently preferred implementation, such memory operands are typically a power of two in size and aligned to that size. Generally, one half the total size is added (or inclusively or'ed, or exclusively or'ed) to the memory address, and one half of the data width is added (or inclusively or'ed, or exclusively or'ed) to the memory address. These bits can be decoded and stripped from the memory address, so that the controller is made to step through all the required addresses. The number of distinct operands required for these instructions is hereby decreased, as the size, shape and address of the memory operand are combined into a single register operand value.","In an alternative exemplary embodiment described below in the Wide Switch instruction and others below, the wide operand specifier is described as containing optional size and shape specifiers. As such, the omission of the specifier value obtains a default size or shape defined from attributes of the specified instruction.","In an alternative exemplary embodiment described below in the Wide Convolve Extract instruction below, the wide operand specifier contains mandatory size and shape specifier. The omission of the specifier value obtains an exception which aborts the operation. Notably, the specification of a larger size or shape than an implementation may permit due to limited resources, such as the limited size of a wide operand memory, may result in a similar exception when the size or shape descriptor is searched for only in the limited bit range in which a valid specifier value may be located. This can be utilized to ensure that software that requires a larger specifier value than the implementation can provide results in a detected exception condition, when for example, a plurality of implementations of the same instruction set of a processor differ in capabilities. This also allows for an upward-compatible extension of wide operand sizes and shapes to larger values in extended implementations of the same instruction set.","In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the wide operand specifier contains size and shape specifiers in an alternative representation other than linearly related to the value of the size and shape parameters. For example, low-order bits of the specifier may contain a fixed-size binary value which is logarithmically related to the value, such as a two-bit field where 00 conveys a value of 128, 01 a value of 256, 10 a value of 512, and 11 a value of 1024. The use of a fixed-size field limits the maximum value which can be specified in, for example, a later upward-compatible implementation of a processor.","Instruction Set","This section describes the instruction set in complete architectural detail. Operation codes are numerically defined by their position in the following operation code tables, and are referred to symbolically in the detailed instruction definitions. Entries that span more than one location in the table define the operation code identifier as the smallest value of all the locations spanned. The value of the symbol can be calculated from the sum of the legend values to the left and above the identifier.","Instructions that have great similarity and identical formats are grouped together. Starting on a new page, each category of instructions is named and introduced.","The Operation codes section lists each instruction by mnemonic that is defined on that page. A textual interpretation of each instruction is shown beside each mnemonic.","The Equivalences section lists additional instructions known to assemblers that are equivalent or special cases of base instructions, again with a textual interpretation of each instruction beside each mnemonic. Below the list, each equivalent instruction is defined, either in terms of a base instruction or another equivalent instruction. The symbol between the instruction and the definition has a particular meaning. If it is an arrow (\u2190 or \u2192), it connects two mathematically equivalent operations, and the arrow direction indicates which form is preferred and produced in a reverse assembly.

While the discussion below focuses on particular sizes for the exemplary instructions, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to a particular width.","Wide Switch","An exemplary embodiment of the Wide Switch instruction is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, the Wide Switch instruction rearranges the contents of up to two registers (256 bits) at the bit level, producing a full-width (128 bits) register result. To control the rearrangement, a wide operand specified by a single register, consisting of eight bits per bit position is used. For each result bit position, eight wide operand bits for each bit position select which of the 256 possible source register bits to place in the result.

The wide operand specifier specifies a memory operand shape by adding the desired width in bytes to the specifier. The height of the memory operand (vsize) can be inferred by dividing the operand extent (msize) by the operand width (wsize). Valid specifiers for these instructions must specify wsize bounded by gsize\u2266wsize\u2266128, and vsize bounded by 4\u2266vsize\u22662, so msize=wsize*vsize is bounded by 4*wsize\u2266msize\u22662*wsize.

Tables with just 2 entries cannot be specified; if 2-entry tables are desired, it is recommended to load the entries into registers and use G.MUX to select the table entries.","In an exemplary embodiment, failing to initialize the entire table is a potential security hole, as an instruction in with a small-depth table could access table entries previously initialized by an instruction with a large-depth table. This security hole may be closed either by initializing the entire table, even if extra cycles are required, or by masking the index bits so that only the initialized portion of the table is used. An exemplary embodiment may initialize the entire table with no penalty in cycles by writing to as many as 128 table entries at once. Initializing the entire table with writes to only one entry at a time requires writing 256 cycles, even when the table is smaller. Masking the index bits is the preferred solution.","In an exemplary embodiment, masking the index bits suggests that this instruction, for tables larger than 256 entries, may be extended to a general-purpose memory translate function where the processor performs enough independent load operations to fill the 128 bits. Thus, the 16, 32, and 64 bit versions of this function perform equivalent of 8, 4, 2 withdraw, 8, 4, or 2 load-indexed and 7, 3, or 1 group-extract instructions. In other words, this instruction can be as powerful as 23, 11, or 5 previously existing instructions. The 8-bit version is a single cycle operation replacing  existing instructions, so these extensions are not as powerful, but nonetheless, this is at least a 50% improvement on a 2-issue processor, even with one cycle per load timing. To make this possible, the default table size becomes 65536, 2^32 and 2^64 for 16, 32 and 64-bit versions of the instruction.","In an exemplary embodiment, for the big-endian version of this instruction, in the definition below, the contents of register rb is complemented. This reflects a desire to organize the table so that the lowest addressed table entries are selected when the index is zero. In the logical implementation, complementing the index can be avoided by loading the table memory differently for big-endian and little-endian versions; specifically by loading the table into memory so that the highest-addressed table entries are selected when the index is zero for a big-endian version of the instruction. In an exemplary embodiment of the logical implementation, complementing the index can be avoided by loading the table memory differently for big endian and little endian versions. In order to avoid complementing the index, the table memory is loaded differently for big-endian versions of the instruction by complementing the addresses at which table entries are written into the table for a big-endian version of the instruction.","This instruction can perform translations for tables larger than 256 entries when the group size is greater than 8. For tables of this size, copying the wide operand into separate memories to allow simultaneous access at differing addresses is likely to be prohibitive. However, this operation can be performed by producing a stream of addresses in serial fashion to the main memory system, or with whatever degree of parallelism the memory system can provide, such as by interleaving, pipelining, or multiple-porting. To make this possible, the maximum table size becomes 65536, 232 and 264 for 16, 32 and 64-bit versions of the instruction.","An implementation may limit the extent, width or depth of operands due to limits on the operand memory or cache, and thereby cause a ReservedInstruction exception. For example, it may limit the depth of translation tables to 256.","In an exemplary embodiment, the virtual address must either be aligned to 4096 bytes, or must be the sum of an aligned address and one-half of the size of the memory operand in bytes and\/or the desired total table width in bytes. An aligned address must be an exact multiple of the size expressed in bytes. The size of the memory operand must be a power of two from 4 to 4096 bytes, but must be at least 4 times the group size and 4 times the total table width. If the address is not valid an \u201caccess disallowed by virtual address\u201d exception occurs.","In an exemplary embodiment, a wide translate (W.TRANSLATE.8.L or W.TRANSLATE.8.B) instruction specifies a translation table of 16 entries (vsize=16) in depth, a group size of 1 byte (gsize=8 bits), and a width of 8 bytes (wsize=64 bits) as shown in . The wide operand specifier specifies a total table size (msize=1024 bits=vsize*wsize) and a table width (wsize=64 bits) by adding one half of the size in bytes of the table (64) and adding the size in bytes of the table width (8) to the table address in the wide operand specifier The operation will create duplicates of this table in the upper and lower 64 bits of the data path, so that 128 bits of operand are processed at once, yielding a 128 bit result. The operation uses the low-order 4 bits of each byte of the contents of general register rb as an address into memory containing byte-wide slices of the wide operand, producing byte results, which are catenated and placed into register rd.","An exemplary embodiment of the pseudocode  of the Wide Translate instruction is shown in .

In an exemplary embodiment, the Wide Multiply Matrix Extract instructions use a wide operand to specify a matrix of value of width up to 128 bits (full width of register file and data path) and depth of up to 128 bits\/symbol size. The contents of a general register (128 bits) is used as a source operand, partitioned into a vector of symbols, and multiplied with the matrix, producing a vector of width up to 256 bits of symbols of twice the size of the source operand symbols plus additional bits to represent the sums of products without overflow. The results are then extracted in a manner described below (Enhanced Multiply Bandwidth by Result Extraction), as controlled by the contents of a general register specified by the instruction. The general register also specifies the format of the operands: signed, mixed-signed, unsigned, and complex as well as the size of the operands, byte (8 bit), doublet (16 bit), quadlet (32 bit), or hexlet (64 bit).","In an exemplary embodiment, these instructions take an specifier from a general register to fetch a large operand from memory, a second operand from a general register, perform a group of operations on partitions of bits in the operands, and catenate the results together, placing the result in a general register.

Related U.S. Pat. No. 5,742,840 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,953,241 describe a system and method for enhancing the utilization of a multiplier array by adding specific classes of instructions to a general-purpose processor. This addresses the problem of making the most use of a large multiplier array that is fully used for high-precision arithmetic\u2014for example a 64\u00d764 bit multiplier is fully used by a 64-bit by 64-bit multiply, but only one quarter used for a 32-bit by 32-bit multiply) for (relative to the multiplier data width and registers) low-precision arithmetic operations. In particular, operations that perform a great many low-precision multiplies which are combined (added) together in various ways are specified. One of the overriding considerations in selecting the set of operations is a limitation on the size of the result operand. In an exemplary embodiment, for example, this size might be limited to on the order of 128 bits, or a single register, although no specific size limitation need exist.","The size of a multiply result, a product, is generally the sum of the sizes of the operands, multiplicands and multiplier. Consequently, multiply instructions specify operations in which the size of the result is twice the size of identically-sized input operands. For our prior art design, for example, a multiply instruction accepted two 64-bit register sources and produces a single 128-bit register-pair result, using an entire 64\u00d764 multiplier array for 64-bit symbols, or half the multiplier array for pairs of 32-bit symbols, or one quarter the multiplier array for quads of 16-bit symbols. For all of these cases, note that two register sources of 64 bits are combined, yielding a 128-bit result.","In several of the operations, including complex multiplies, convolve, and matrix multiplication, low-precision multiplier products are added together. The additions further increase the required precision. The sum of two products requires one additional bit of precision; adding four products requires two, adding eight products requires three, adding sixteen products requires four. In some prior designs, some of this precision is lost, requiring scaling of the multiplier operands to avoid overflow, further reducing accuracy of the result.","The use of register pairs creates an undesirable complexity, in that both the register pair and individual register values must be bypassed to subsequent instructions. As a result, with prior art techniques only half of the source operand 128-bit register values could be employed toward producing a single-register 128-bit result.","In the present invention, a high-order portion of the multiplier product or sum of products is extracted, adjusted by a dynamic shift amount from a general register or an adjustment specified as part of the instruction, and rounded by a control value from a register or instruction portion as round-to-nearest\/even, toward zero, floor, or ceiling. Overflows are handled by limiting the result to the largest and smallest values that can be accurately represented in the output result.","Extract Controlled by a Register","In the present invention, when the extract is controlled by a register, the size of the result can be specified, allowing rounding and limiting to a smaller number of bits than can fit in the result. This permits the result to be scaled to be used in subsequent operations without concern of overflow or rounding, enhancing performance.","Also in the present invention, when the extract is controlled by a register, a single register value defines the size of the operands, the shift amount and size of the result, and the rounding control. By placing all this control information in a single register, the size of the instruction is reduced over the number of bits that such a instruction would otherwise require, improving performance and enhancing flexibility of the processor.","The particular instructions included in this aspect of the present invention are Ensemble Convolve Extract, Ensemble Multiply Extract, Ensemble Multiply Add Extract and Ensemble Scale Add Extract.","Ensemble Extract Inplace","An exemplary embodiment of the Ensemble Extract Inplace instruction is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, several of these instructions (Ensemble Convolve Extract, Ensemble Multiply Add Extract) are typically available only in forms where the extract is specified as part of the instruction. An alternative embodiment can incorporate forms of the operations in which the size of the operand, the shift amount and the rounding can be controlled by the contents of a general register (as they are in the Ensemble Multiply Extract instruction). The definition of this kind of instruction for Ensemble Convolve Extract, and Ensemble Multiply Add Extract would require four source registers, which increases complexity by requiring additional general-register read ports.","In an exemplary embodiment, these operations take operands from four general registers, perform operations on partitions of bits in the operands, and place the concatenated results in a fourth general register.

The group of results is catenated and placed in register rd.","As shown in , in an exemplary embodiment, bits  . . .  of the contents of register ra specifies several parameters that control the manner in which data is extracted, and for certain operations, the manner in which the operation is performed. The position of the control fields allows for the source position to be added to a fixed control value for dynamic computation, and allows for the lower 16 bits of the control field to be set for some of the simpler extract cases by a single GCOPYI.128 instruction. The control fields are further arranged so that if only the low order 8 bits are non-zero, a 128-bit extraction with truncation and no rounding is performed.","In an exemplary embodiment, the table below describes the meaning of each label:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0580","num":"0579"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"label","bits","meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"fsize","8","field size"]},{"entry":[{},"dpos","8","destination position"]},{"entry":[{},"x","1","extended vs. group size result"]},{"entry":[{},"s","1","signed vs. unsigned"]},{"entry":[{},"n","1","complex vs. real multiplication"]},{"entry":[{},"m","1","mixed-sign vs. same-sign multiplication"]},{"entry":[{},"l","1","limit: saturation vs. truncation"]},{"entry":[{},"rnd","2","rounding"]},{"entry":[{},"gssp","9","group size and source position"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In an exemplary embodiment, the 9-bit gssp field encodes both the group size, gsize, and source position, spos, according to the formula gssp=512\u22124*gsize+spos.

The value of the extract control register can be fetched using an additional cycle on an initial execution and retained within or near the functional unit for subsequent executions, thus reducing the amount of hardware required for implementation with a small additional performance penalty. The value retained would be marked invalid, causing a re-fetch of the extract control register, by instructions that modify the register, or alternatively, the retained value can be updated by such an operation. A re-fetch of the extract control register would also be required if a different register number were specified on a subsequent execution. It should be clear that the properties of the above two alternative embodiments can be combined.","Galois Field Arithmetic","Another aspect of the invention includes Galois field arithmetic, where multiplies are performed by an initial binary polynomial multiplication (unsigned binary multiplication with carries suppressed), followed by a polynomial modulo\/remainder operation (unsigned binary division with carries suppressed). The remainder operation is relatively expensive in area and delay. In Galois field arithmetic, additions are performed by binary addition with carries suppressed, or equivalently, a bitwise exclusive or operation. In this aspect of the present invention, a matrix multiplication is performed using Galois field arithmetic, where the multiplies and additions are Galois field multiples and additions.","Using prior art methods, a 16 byte vector multiplied by a 16\u00d716 byte matrix can be performed as 256 8-bit Galois field multiplies and 16*15=240 8-bit Galois field additions. Included in the 256 Galois field multiplies are 256 polynomial multiplies and 256 polynomial remainder operations.","By use of the present invention, the total computation is reduced significantly by performing 256 polynomial multiplies, 240 16-bit polynomial additions, and 16 polynomial remainder operations. Note that the cost of the polynomial additions has been doubled compared with the Galois field additions, as these are now 16-bit operations rather than 8-bit operations, but the cost of the polynomial remainder functions has been reduced by a factor of 16. Overall, this is a favorable tradeoff, as the cost of addition is much lower than the cost of remainder.","Decoupled Access from Execution Pipelines and Simultaneous Multithreading","In yet another aspect of the present invention, best shown in , the present invention employs both decoupled access from execution pipelines and simultaneous multithreading in a unique way. Simultaneous Multithreaded pipelines have been employed in prior art to enhance the utilization of data path units by allowing instructions to be issued from one of several execution threads to each functional unit (e.g. Dean M. Tullsen, Susan J. Eggers, and Henry M. Levy, \u201cSimultaneous Multithreading: Maximizing On Chip Parallelism,\u201d Proceedings of the 22nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture, Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, June, 1995).","Decoupled access from execution pipelines have been employed in prior art to enhance the utilization of execution data path units by buffering results from an access unit, which computes addresses to a memory unit that in turn fetches the requested items from memory, and then presenting them to an execution unit (e.g. J. E. Smith, \u201cDecoupled Access\/Execute Computer Architectures\u201d, Proceedings of the Ninth Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture, Austin, Tex. (Apr. 26 29, 1982), pp. 112-119).","Compared to conventional pipelines, the Eggers prior art used an additional pipeline cycle before instructions could be issued to functional units, the additional cycle needed to determine which threads should be permitted to issue instructions. Consequently, relative to conventional pipelines, the prior art design had additional delay, including dependent branch delay.","The present invention contains individual access data path units, with associated register files, for each execution thread. These access units produce addresses, which are aggregated together to a common memory unit, which fetches all the addresses and places the memory contents in one or more buffers. Instructions for execution units, which are shared to varying degrees among the threads are also buffered for later execution. The execution units then perform operations from all active threads using functional data path units that are shared.","For instructions performed by the execution units, the extra cycle required for prior art simultaneous multithreading designs is overlapped with the memory data access time from prior art decoupled access from execution cycles, so that no additional delay is incurred by the execution functional units for scheduling resources. For instructions performed by the access units, by employing individual access units for each thread the additional cycle for scheduling shared resources is also eliminated.","This is a favorable tradeoff because, while threads do not share the access functional units, these units are relatively small compared to the execution functional units, which are shared by threads.","With regard to the sharing of execution units, the present invention employs several different classes of functional units for the execution unit, with varying cost, utilization, and performance. In particular, the G units, which perform simple addition and bitwise operations is relatively inexpensive (in area and power) compared to the other units, and its utilization is relatively high. Consequently, the design employs four such units, where each unit can be shared between two threads. The X unit, which performs a broad class of data switching functions is more expensive and less used, so two units are provided that are each shared among two threads. The T unit, which performs the Wide Translate instruction, is expensive and utilization is low, so the single unit is shared among all four threads. The E unit, which performs the class of Ensemble instructions, is very expensive in area and power compared to the other functional units, but utilization is relatively high, so we provide two such units, each unit shared by two threads.","In , four copies of an access unit are shown, each with an access instruction fetch queue A-Queue -, coupled to an access register file AR -, each of which is, in turn, coupled to two access functional units A -. The access units function independently for four simultaneous threads of execution. These eight access functional units A - produce results for access register files AR - and addresses to a shared memory system . The memory contents fetched from memory system  are combined with execute instructions not performed by the access unit and entered into the four execute instruction queues E-Queue -. Instructions and memory data from E-queue - are presented to execution register files -, which fetches execution register file source operands. The instructions are coupled to the execution unit arbitration unit Arbitration , that selects which instructions from the four threads are to be routed to the available execution units E  and , X  and , G - and -, and T . The execution register file source operands ER - are coupled to the execution units - using source operand buses - and to the execution units - using source operand buses -. The function unit result operands from execution units - are coupled to the execution register file using result bus  and the function units result operands from execution units - are coupled to the execution register file using result bus .","Improved Interprivilege Gateway","In a still further aspect of the present invention, an improved interprivilege gateway is described which involves increased parallelism and leads to enhanced performance. In related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/541,416, a system and method is described for implementing an instruction that, in a controlled fashion, allows the transfer of control (branch) from a lower privilege level to a higher privilege level. The present invention is an improved system and method for a modified instruction that accomplishes the same purpose but with specific advantages.","Many processor resources, such as control of the virtual memory system itself, input and output operations, and system control functions are protected from accidental or malicious misuse by enclosing them in a protective, privileged region. Entry to this region must be established only though particular entry points, called gateways, to maintain the integrity of these protected regions.","Prior art versions of this operation generally load an address from a region of memory using a protected virtual memory attribute that is only set for data regions that contain valid gateway entry points, then perform a branch to an address contained in the contents of memory. Basically, three steps were involved: load, then branch and check. Compared to other instructions, such as register to register computation instructions and memory loads and stores, and register based branches, this is a substantially longer operation, which introduces delays and complexity to a pipelined implementation.","In the present invention, the branch-gateway instruction performs two operations in parallel: 1) a branch is performed to the Contents of register 0 and 2) a load is performed using the contents of register 1, using a specified byte order (little-endian) and a specified size (64 bits). If the value loaded from memory does not equal the contents of register 0, the instruction is aborted due to an exception. In addition, 3) a return address (the next sequential instruction address following the branch-gateway instruction) is written into register 0, provided the instruction is not aborted. This approach essentially uses a first instruction to establish the requisite permission to allow user code to access privileged code, and then a second instruction is permitted to branch directly to the privileged code because of the permissions issued for the first instruction.","In the present invention, the new privilege level is also contained in register 0, and the second parallel operation does not need to be performed if the new privilege level is not greater than the old privilege level. When this second operation is suppressed, the remainder of the instruction performs an identical function to a branch-link instruction, which is used for invoking procedures that do not require an increase in privilege. The advantage that this feature brings is that the branch-gateway instruction can be used to call a procedure that may or may not require an increase in privilege.","The memory load operation verifies with the virtual memory system that the region that is loaded has been tagged as containing valid gateway data. A further advantage of the present invention is that the called procedure may rely on the fact that register 1 contains the address that the gateway data was loaded from, and can use the contents of register 1 to locate additional data or addresses that the procedure may require. Prior art versions of this instruction required that an additional address be loaded from the gateway region of memory in order to initialize that address in a protected manner\u2014the present invention allows the address itself to be loaded with a \u201cnormal\u201d load operation that does not require special protection.","The present invention allows a \u201cnormal\u201d load operation to also load the contents of register 0 prior to issuing the branch-gateway instruction. The value may be loaded from the same memory address that is loaded by the branch-gateway instruction, because the present invention contains a virtual memory system in which the region may be enabled for normal load operations as well as the special \u201cgateway\u201d load operation performed by the branch-gateway instruction.","Improved Interprivilege Gateway\u2014System and Privileged Library Calls","An exemplary embodiment of the System and Privileged Library Calls is shown in  B. An exemplary embodiment of the schematic  of System and Privileged Library Calls is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, it is an objective to make calls to system facilities and privileged libraries as similar as possible to normal procedure calls as described above. Rather than invoke system calls as an exception, which involves significant latency and complication, a modified procedure call in which the process privilege level is quietly raised to the required level is used. To provide this mechanism safely, interaction with the virtual memory system is required.","In an exemplary embodiment, such a procedure must not be entered from anywhere other than its legitimate entry point, to prohibit entering a procedure after the point at which security checks are performed or with invalid register contents, otherwise the access to a higher privilege level can lead to a security violation. In addition, the procedure generally must have access to memory data, for which addresses must be produced by the privileged code. To facilitate generating these addresses, the branch-gateway instruction allows the privileged code procedure to rely on the fact that a single register has been verified to contain a pointer to a valid memory region.","In an exemplary embodiment, the branch-gateway instruction ensures both that the procedure is invoked at a proper entry point, and that other registers such as the data pointer and stack pointer can be properly set. To ensure this, the branch-gateway instruction retrieves a \u201cgateway\u201d directly from the protected virtual memory space. The gateway contains the virtual address of the entry point of the procedure and the target privilege level. A gateway can only exist in regions of the virtual address space designated to contain them, and can only be used to access privilege levels at or below the privilege level at which the memory region can be written to ensure that a gateway cannot be forged.","In an exemplary embodiment, the branch-gateway instruction ensures that register 1 (dp) contains a valid pointer to the gateway for this target code address by comparing the contents of register 0 (lp) against the gateway retrieved from memory and causing an exception trap if they do not match. By ensuring that register 1 points to the gateway, auxiliary information, such as the data pointer and stack pointer can be set by loading values located by the contents of register 1. For example, the eight bytes following the gateway may be used as a pointer to a data region for the procedure.","In an exemplary embodiment, before executing the branch-gateway instruction, register 1 must be set to point at the gateway, and register 0 must be set to the address of the target code address plus the desired privilege level. A \u201cL.I.64.L.A r0=r1,0\u201d instruction is one way to set register 0, if register 1 has already been set, but any means of getting the correct value into register 0 is permissible.","In an exemplary embodiment, similarly, a return from a system or privileged routine involves a reduction of privilege. This need not be carefully controlled by architectural facilities, so a procedure may freely branch to a less-privileged code address. Normally, such a procedure restores the stack frame, then uses the branch-down instruction to return.","An exemplary embodiment of the typical dynamic-linked, inter-gateway calling sequence  is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, the calling sequence is identical to that of the inter-module calling sequence shown above, except for the use of the B.GATE instruction instead of a B.LINK instruction. Indeed, if a B.GATE instruction is used when the privilege level in the lp register is not higher than the current privilege level, the B.GATE instruction performs an identical function to a B.LINK.","In an exemplary embodiment, the callee, if it uses a stack for local variable allocation, cannot necessarily trust the value of the sp passed to it, as it can be forged. Similarly, any pointers which the callee provides should not be used directly unless it they are verified to point to regions which the callee should be permitted to address. This can be avoided by defining application programming interfaces (APIs) in which all values are passed and returned in registers, or by using a trusted, intermediate privilege wrapper routine to pass and return parameters. The method described below can also be used.","In an exemplary embodiment, it can be useful to have highly privileged code call less-privileged routines. For example, a user may request that errors in a privileged routine be reported by invoking a user-supplied error-logging routine. To invoke the procedure, the privilege can be reduced via the branch-down instruction. The return from the procedure actually requires an increase in privilege, which must be carefully controlled. This is dealt with by placing the procedure call within a lower-privilege procedure wrapper, which uses the branch-gateway instruction to return to the higher privilege region after the call through a secure re-entry point. Special care must be taken to ensure that the less-privileged routine is not permitted to gain unauthorized access by corruption of the stack or saved registers, such as by saving all registers and setting up a new stack frame (or restoring the original lower-privilege stack) that may be manipulated by the less-privileged routine. Finally, such a technique is vulnerable to an unprivileged routine attempting to use the re-entry point directly, so it may be appropriate to keep a privileged state variable which controls permission to enter at the re-entry point.","Improved Interprivilege Gateway\u2014Branch Gateway","An exemplary embodiment of the Branch Gateway instruction is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, this operation provides a secure means to call a procedure, including those at a higher privilege level. An exemplary embodiment of the format and operation codes  of the Branch Gateway instruction is shown in .","An exemplary embodiment of the schematic  of the Branch Gateway instruction is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, the contents of register rb are a branch address in the high-order 62 bits and a new privilege level in the low-order 2 bits. A branch and link occurs to the branch address, and the privilege level is raised to the new privilege level. The high-order 62 bits of the successor to the current program counter is catenated with the 2-bit current execution privilege and placed in register 0.","In an exemplary embodiment, if the new privilege level is greater than the current privilege level, an octlet of memory data is fetched from the address specified by register 1, using the little-endian byte order and a gateway access type. A GatewayDisallowed exception occurs if the original contents of register 0 do not equal the memory data.","In an exemplary embodiment, if the new privilege level is the same as the current privilege level, no checking of register 1 is performed.","In an exemplary embodiment, an AccessDisallowed exception occurs if the new privilege level is greater than the privilege level required to write the memory data, or if the old privilege level is lower than the privilege required to access the memory data as a gateway, or if the access is not aligned on an 8-byte boundary.","In an exemplary embodiment, a ReservedInstruction exception occurs if the rc field is not one or the rd field is not zero.","In an exemplary embodiment, in the example in  D, a gateway from level 0 to level 2 is illustrated. The gateway pointer, located by the contents of general register rc (1), is fetched from memory and compared against the contents of general register rb (0). The instruction may only complete if these values are equal. Concurrently, the contents of general register rb (0) is placed in the program counter and privilege level, and the address of the next sequential address and privilege level is placed into register rd (0). Code at the target of the gateway locates the data pointer at an offset from the gateway pointer (register 1), and fetches it into general register 1, making a data region available. A stack pointer may be saved and fetched using the data region, another region located from the data region, or a data region located as an offset from the original gateway pointer.","For additional information on the branch-gateway instruction, see the System and Privileged Library Calls section herein.","In an exemplary embodiment, this instruction gives the target procedure the assurances that general register 0 contains a valid return address and privilege level, that general register 1 points to the gateway location, and that the gateway location is octlet aligned. General register 1 can then be used to securely reach values in memory. If no sharing of literal pools is desired, register 1 may be used as a literal pool pointer directly. If sharing of literal pools is desired, general register 1 may be used with an appropriate offset to load a new literal pool pointer; for example, with a one cache line offset from the register 1. Note that because the virtual memory system operates with cache line granularity, that several gateway locations must be created together.","In an exemplary embodiment, software must ensure that an attempt to use any octlet within the region designated by virtual memory as gateway either functions properly or causes a legitimate exception. For example, if the adjacent octlets contain pointers to literal pool locations, software should ensure that these literal pools are not executable, or that by virtue of being aligned addresses, cannot raise the execution privilege level. If general register 1 is used directly as a literal pool location, software must ensure that the literal pool locations that are accessible as a gateway do not lead to a security violation.","In an exemplary embodiment, general register 0 contains a valid return address and privilege level, the value is suitable for use directly in the Branch down (B.DOWN) instruction to return to the gateway callee.","An exemplary embodiment of the pseudocode  of the Branch Gateway instruction is shown in .

the foregoing discussion, it can be appreciated that an exemplary embodiment of a compiler or assembler producing the encoded instruction performs the steps above to encode the instruction, comparing the f6 and f5 values and the f2 and f1 values of the immediate field to determine which one of several means of encoding the immediate field is to be employed, and that the placement of the trb and trc register specifiers into the encoded instruction depends on the values of f2 (or f1) and f6 (or f5).","An exemplary embodiment of the pseudocode  of the Group Boolean instruction is shown in .

In such a simple loop, the end of the loop is indicated by a conditional branch backward to the beginning of the loop. The condition branch of such a loop is taken for each iteration of the loop except the final iteration, when it is not taken. Prior art branch prediction systems have employed finite state machine operations to attempt to properly predict a majority of such conditional branches, but without specific information as to the number of times the loop iterates, will make an error in prediction when the loop terminates.","The system and method of the present invention includes providing a count field for indicating how many times a branch is likely to be taken before it is not taken, which enhances the ability to properly predict both the initial and final branches of simple loops when a compiler can determine the number of iterations that the loop will be performed. This improves performance by avoiding misprediction of the branch at the end of a loop when the loop terminates and instruction execution is to continue beyond the loop, as occurs in prior art branch prediction hardware.","Branch Hint","An exemplary embodiment of the Branch Hint instruction is shown in .

In related U.S. Pat. No. 5,812,439, a system and method are described for incorporating control of rounding and exceptions for floating-point instructions into the instruction itself. The present invention extends this invention to include separate instructions in which rounding is specified, but default handling of exceptions is also specified, for a particular class of floating-point instructions.","Ensemble Sink Floating-Point","In an exemplary embodiment, a Ensemble Sink Floating-point instruction, which converts floating-point values to integral values, is available with control in the instruction that include all previously specified combinations (default-near rounding and default exceptions, Z\u2014round-toward-zero and trap on exceptions, N\u2014round to nearest and trap on exceptions, F\u2014floor rounding (toward minus infinity) and trap on exceptions, C\u2014ceiling rounding (toward plus infinity) and trap on exceptions, and X\u2014trap on inexact and other exceptions), as well as three new combinations (Z.D\u2014round toward zero and default exception handling, F.D\u2014floor rounding and default exception handling, and C.D\u2014ceiling rounding and default exception handling). (The other combinations: N.D is equivalent to the default, and X.D\u2014trap on inexact but default handling for other exceptions is possible but not particularly valuable).","An exemplary embodiment of the Ensemble Sink Floating-point instruction is shown in . In an exemplary embodiment, these operations take one value from a register, perform a group of floating-point arithmetic conversions to integer on partitions of bits in the operands, and place the concatenated results in a register.

The results are catenated and placed in register rd.","In an exemplary embodiment, the operation is rounded using the specified rounding option or using round-to-nearest if not specified. If a rounding option is specified, unless default exception handling is specified, the operation raises a floating-point exception if a floating-point invalid operation, divide by zero, overflow, or underflow occurs, or when specified, if the result is inexact. If a rounding option is not specified or if default exception handling is specified, floating-point exceptions are not raised, and are handled according to the default rules of IEEE 754.","An exemplary embodiment of the pseudocode  of the Ensemble Sink Floating-point instruction is shown in .

The group of results is catenated and placed in register rd.","Various Group Compress operations may convert groups of operands from higher precision data to lower precision data. An arbitrary half-sized sub-field of each bit field can be selected to appear in the result. For example,  shows an X.COMPRESS rd=rc,16,4 operation, which performs a selection of bits  . . .  of each quadlet in a hexlet. Various Group Shift operations may allow shifting of groups of operands by a specified number of bits, in a specified direction, such as shift right or shift left. As can be seen in , certain Group Shift Left instructions may also involve clearing (to zero) empty low order bits associated with the shift, for each operand. Certain Group Shift Right instructions may involve clearing (to zero) empty high order bits associated with the shift, for each operand. Further, certain Group Shift Right instructions may involve filling empty high order bits associated with the shift with copies of the sign bit, for each operand.","Extract","In one embodiment of the invention, data handling operations may also include a Crossbar Extract instruction.  illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a format and operation codes that can be used to perform the Crossbar Extract instruction.

The code block in  describes details of the operation of the apparatus of , using a C language notation.","Similar code and apparatus can be developed for scalar multiply-add iterative equation solvers in other mathematical domains, such as integers and floating point numbers of various sizes, and for matrix operands of particular properties, such as positive definite matrices, or symetrix matrices, or upper or lower triangular matrices.","Wide Transform Slice","An exemplary embodiment of the Wide Transform Slice instruction is shown in .  illustrates a method and apparatus for extremely fast computation of transforms, such as the Fourier Transform, which is needed for frequency-domain communications, image analysis, etc. In this apparatus, a 4\u00d74 array of 16 complex multipliers is shown, each adjacent to a first wide operand cache. A second wide operand cache or embedded coefficient memory array supplies operands that are multiplied by the multipliers with the data access from the wide embedded cache. The resulting products are supplied to strips of atomic transforms\u2014in this preferred embodiment, radix-4 or radix-2 butterfly units. These units receive the products from a row or column of multipliers, and deposit results with specified stride and digit reversal back into the first wide operand cache.","A general register ra contains both the address of the first wide operand as well as size and shape specifiers, and a second general register rb contains both the address of the second wide operand as well as size and shape specifiers.","An additional general register rc specifies further parameters, such as precision, result extraction parameters (as in the various Extract instructions described in the present invention).","In an alternative embodiment, the second memory operand may be located together with the first memory operand in an enlarged memory, using distinctive memory addressing to obtain either the first or second memory operand.","In an alternative embodiment, the results are deposited into a third wide operand cache memory. This third memory operand may be combined with the first memory operand, again using distinctive memory addressing. By relabeling of wide operand cache tags, the third memory may alternate storage locations with the first memory. Thus upon completion of the Wide Transform Slice instruction, the wide operand cache tags are relabeled to that the result appears in the location specified for the first memory operand. This alternation allows for the specification of not-in-place transform steps and permits the operation to be aborted and subsequently restarted if required as the result of interruption of the flow of execution.","The code block in  describes the details of the operation of the apparatus of , using a C language notation. Similar code and apparatus can be developed for other transforms and other mathematical domains, such as polynomial, Galois field, and integer and floating point real and complex numbers of various sizes.","In an exemplary embodiment, the Wide Transform Slice instruction also computes the location of the most significant bit of all result elements, returning that value as a scalar result of the instruction to be placed in a general register rc. This is the same operand in which extraction control and other information is placed, but in an alternative embodiment, it could be a distinct register. Notably, this location of the most significant bit may be computed in the exemplary embodiment by a series of Boolean operations on parallel subsets of the result elements yielding vector Boolean results, and at the conclusion of the operation, by reduction of the vector of Boolean results to a scalar Boolean value, followed by a determination of the most significant bit of the scalar Boolean value.","By adding the values representing the extraction control and other information to this location of the most significant bit, an appropriate scaling parameter is obtained, for use in the subsequent stage of the Wide Transform Slice instruction. By accumulating the most significant bit information, an overall scaling value for the entire transform can be obtained, and the transformed results are maintained with additional precision over that of fixed scaling schemes in prior art.","Wide Convolve Extract","These instructions take two specifiers from general registers to fetch two large operands from memory, a third controlling operand from a general register, multiply, sum and extract partitions of bits in the operands, and catenate the results together, placing the result in a general register.","An exemplary embodiment of the Wide Convolve Extract instruction is shown in .

The same operation may be used for correlation, as correlation can be computed by reversing the order of the 1-D or 2-D pattern and performing a convolution. Thus, the convolution instruction described herein may be used for correlation, or a Wide Correlate Extract instruction can be constructed that is similar to the convolution instruction herein described except that the order of the coefficient operand block is 1-D or 2-D reversed.","Digital filter coefficients or a estimation template block is stored in one wide operand memory, and the image data is stored in a second wide operand memory. A single row or column of image data can be shifted into the image array, with a corresponding shift of the relationship of the image data locations to the template block and multipliers. By this method of partially updating and moving the data in the second embedded memory. The correlation of template against image can be computed with greatly enhanced effective bandwidth to the multiplier array.

In this case, embedded memory strips are employed to contain state metrics and pre-traceback decision digits. An array of Add-Compare-Swap or log-MAP units receive a small number of branch metrics, such as 128 bits from an external register in our preferred embodiment. The array then reads, recomputes, and updates the state metric memory entries which for many practical codes are very much larger. A number of decision digits, typically 4-bits each with a radix-16 pre-traceback method, is accumulated in a the second traceback memory. The array computations and state metric updates are performed iteratively for a specified number of cycles. A second iterative operation then traverses the traceback memory to resolve the most likely path through the state trellis.","Wide Boolean","Another category of enhanced wide operations are Wide Boolean operations that involve an array of small look up tables (LUTs), typically with 8 or 16 entries each specified by 3 or 4 bits of input address, interconnected with nearby multiplexors and latches.

This structure provides a mean to provide a strip of field programmable gate array that can perform iterative operations on operands provided from the registers of a general purpose microprocessor. These operations can iterate over multiple cycles, performing randomly specifiable logical operations that update both the internal latches and the memory strip itself.","Transfers Between Wide Operand Memories","The method and apparatus described here are widely applicable to the problem of increasing the effective bandwidth of microprocessor functional units to approximate what is achieved in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). When two or more functional units capable of handling wide operands are present at the same time, the problem arises of transferring data from one functional unit that is producing it into an embedded memory, and through or around the memory system, to a second functional unit also capable of handling wide operands that needs to consume that data after loading it into its wide operand memory.

The memory management system is designed to provide the requirements for implementation of virtual machines as well as virtual memory.","All facilities of the memory management system are themselves memory mapped, in order to provide for the manipulation of these facilities by high-level language, compiled code.","The translation mechanism is designed to allow full byte-at-a-time control of access to the virtual address space, with the assistance of fast exception handlers.","Privilege levels provide for the secure transition between insecure user code and secure system facilities. Instructions execute with a privilege specified by a two-bit field in the access information. Zero is the least-privileged level, and three is the most-privileged level.","Referring to , the diagram sketches the basic organization of the memory management system.","In general terms, the memory management starts from a local virtual address. The local virtual address is translated to a global virtual address by a LTB (Local Translation Buffer). In turn, the global virtual address is translated to a physical address by a GTB (Global Translation Buffer). One of the addresses, a local virtual address, a global virtual address, or a physical address, is used to index the cache data and cache tag arrays, and one of the addresses is used to check the cache tag array for cache presence. Protection information is assembled from the LTB, GTB, and optionally the cache tag, to determine if the access is legal.","This form varies somewhat, depending on implementation choices made. Because the LTB leaves the lower 48 bits of the address alone, indexing of the cache arrays with the local virtual address is usually identical to cache arrays indexed by the global virtual address. However, indexing cache arrays by the global virtual address rather than the physical address produces a coherence issue if the mapping from global virtual address to physical is many-to-one.","Starting from a local virtual address, the memory management system performs three actions in parallel: the low-order bits of the virtual address are used to directly access the data in the cache, a low-order bit field is used to access the cache tag, and the high-order bits of the virtual address are translated from a local address space to a global virtual address space.","Following these three actions, operations vary depending upon the cache implementation. The cache tag may contain either a physical address and access control information (a physically-tagged cache), or may contain a global virtual address and global protection information (a virtually-tagged cache).","For a physically-tagged cache, the global virtual address is translated to a physical address by the GTB, which generates global protection information. The cache tag is checked against the physical address, to determine a cache hit. In parallel, the local and global protection information is checked.","For a virtually-tagged cache, the cache tag is checked against the global virtual address, to determine a cache hit, and the local and global protection information is checked. If the cache misses, the global virtual address is translated to a physical address by the GTB, which also generates the global protection information.","Local Translation Buffer","The 64-bit global virtual address space is global among all tasks. In a multitask environment, requirements for a task-local address space arise from operations such as the UNIX \u201cfork\u201d function, in which a task is duplicated into parent and child tasks, each now having a unique virtual address space. In addition, when switching tasks, access to one task's address space must be disabled and another task's access enabled.","Zeus provides for portions of the address space to be made local to individual tasks, with a translation to the global virtual space specified by four 16-bit registers for each local virtual space. The registers specify a mask selecting which of the high-order 16 address bits are checked to match a particular value, and if they match, a value with which to modify the virtual address. Zeus avoids setting a fixed page size or local address size; these can be set by software conventions.","A local virtual address space is specified by the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1077","num":"1076"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00053","num":"00053"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["field name","size","description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["lm","16","mask to select fields of local virtual address to perform"]},{"entry":[{},{},"match over"]},{"entry":["la","16","value to perform match with masked local virtual"]},{"entry":[{},{},"address"]},{"entry":["lx","16","value to xor with local virtual address if matched"]},{"entry":["lp","16","local protection field (detailed later)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"There are as many LTB as threads, and up to 2(8) entries per LTB.

A single low-privilege (0) task can be safely permitted to have global access, as accesses are further limited by the rwxg privilege fields. A concrete example of this is an emulation task, which may use global addresses to simulate segmentation, such as an x86 emulation. The emulation task then runs as privilege 0, with ga0 set, while most user tasks run as privilege 1, with ga1 clear. Operating system tasks then use privilege 2 and 3 to communicate with and control the user tasks, with ga2 and ga3 set.","For tasks that have global access disabled at their current privilege level, failure to match a LTB entry causes an exception. The exception handler may load an LTB entry and continue execution, thus providing access to an arbitrary number of local virtual address ranges.","When failure to match a LTB entry does not cause an exception, instructions may access any region in the local virtual address space, when a LTB entry matches, and may access regions in the global virtual address space when no LTB entry matches. This mechanism permits privileged code to make judicious use of local virtual address ranges, which simplifies the manner in which privileged code may manipulate the contents of a local virtual address range on behalf of a less-privileged client. Note, however, that under this model, an LTB miss does not cause an exception directly, so the use of more local virtual address ranges than LTB entries requires more care: the local virtual address ranges should be selected so as not to overlap with the global virtual address ranges, and GTB misses to LVA regions must be detected and cause the handler to load an LTB entry.","Each thread has an independent LTB, so that threads may independently define local translation. The size of the LTB for each thread is implementation dependent and defined as the LE parameter in the architecture description register. LE is the log of the number of entries in the local TB per thread; an implementation may define LE to be a minimum of 0, meaning one LTB entry per thread, or a maximum of 3, meaning eight LTB entries per thread. For the initial Zeus implementation, each thread has two entries and LE=1.","A minimum implementation of an LTB context is a single set of lm\/la\/lx\/lp registers per thread. However, the need for the LTB to translate both code addresses and data addresses imposes some limits on the use of the LTB in such systems. We need to be able to guarantee forward progress. With a single LTB set per thread, either the code or the data must use global addresses, or both must use the same local address range, as must the LTB and GTB exception handler. To avoid this restriction, the implementation must be raised to two sets per thread, at least one for code and one for data, to guarantee forward progress for arbitrary use of local addresses in the user code (but still be limited to using global addresses for exception handlers).","A single-set LTB context may be further simplified by reserving the implementation of the lm and la registers, setting them to a read-only zero value: Note that in such a configuration, only a single LA region can be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1092","num":"1091"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00041","num":"00041"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00041","he":"9.74mm","wi":"66.04mm","file":"US08289335-20121016-C00041.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"If the largest possible space is reserved for an address space identifier, the virtual address is partitioned as shown below.

For sequential (stride 1) memory references of 128 bits (16 bytes), an MTB miss occurs every 16 cycles with one reference per cycle. As the MTB write does not occur until cycle 5, which is three cycles after the MTB xlate in cycle 1, there are 4 cycles in which a memory request occurs to the same cache block as the original MTB miss. Since these requests are to addresses that are not yet resolved, the MTB miss causes these references to stack up in cycle 1. Even if these references are queued, performance is not enhanced unless they can be completed in out-of-order fashion with respect to future references.","A four-cycle delay every 16 cycles is not so bad, but for two interleaved sequential references, the figure could easily be 8 cycles for every 16, or 50% degradation. Non-unit strides would induce further degradation of available rate.","To continue operation through the MTB miss, we need to detect that these additional references are to the same address as the original MTB miss, and buffer the requests accordingly. Note that after cycle 2, the address has been translated by the GTB and is known, though we do not know whether the cache block is present, or which set is employed until cycle 5. The LOC address used in cycle 6 can be employed simultaneously for all LOC banks that have been referenced, thus allowing the memory system to catch up with the references.","To implement this, we need only keep track of the attachment of these additional references to the original MTB-miss causing reference, and keep a bitwise map of which banks are to be read upon verification of the cache hit. If not all banks are successfully allocated to the reference, additional cycles are then employed until the group reference is satisfied. If the cache misses, the bitwise map can again be employed to determine which sub-blocks to fill.","To attach these references to the original MTB miss, the virtual address of the MTB miss must be compared against each additional memory reference address that is attempted. A match causes the bitwise map to be set for the indicated reference.","Since there are 8 banks in the LOC, only half of the cache line can be simultaneously referenced. This overlapped handling may be limited to one-half of the cache line, which still allows for as many as eight cycles to be handled in this way.","One way to handle the comparison is to create a matching MTB entry with the virtual address filled in, but a distinct state showing an unresolved MTB miss. The bitwise map may be retained in the tv bits of the MTB. The state may use bits - otherwise currently unspecified. This MTB entry could be filled in as soon as the MTB miss is detected, though this risks burning out a valid MTB entry whenever there is a BTB miss. (Otherwise this can be performed as soon as the GTB contents indicate a cacheable MTB miss.) By immediately filling in the MTB, up to two simultaneous MTB misses can be handled on each cycle, so that address generation need not stop for MTB misses. The two addresses generated on one cycle must also be compared against each other so that a single MTB entry is created with two simultaneous references experience the same MTB miss.","If the reference turns out to be a BTB miss or uncached memory reference, the MTB data can be used to keep appropriate LOC bank or sub-line information.","Memory Banks","The LZC has two banks, each servicing up to four requests. The LOC has eight banks, each servicing at most one request.","Assuming random request addresses,  shows the expected rate at which requests are serviced by multi-bank\/multi-port memories that have 8 total ports and divided into 1, 2, 4, or 8 interleaved banks. The LZC is 2 banks, each with 4 ports, and the LOC is 8 banks, each 1 port.","Note a small difference between applying 12 references versus  references for the LOC (6.5 vs 5.2), and for the LZC (7.8 vs. 6.9). This suggests that simplifying the system to produce two address per thread (program+load\/store or two load\/store) will not overly hurt performance. A closer simulation, taking into account the sequential nature of the program and load\/store traffic may well yield better numbers, as threads will tend to line up in non-interfering patterns, and program microcaching reduces program fetching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1199","num":"1199"},"figref":"FIG. 104"},"Note significant differences between 8-port systems and 16-port systems, even when used with a maximum of 8 applied references. In particular, a 16-bank 1-port system is better than a 4-bank 2-port system with more than 6 applied references. Current layout estimates would require about a 14% area increase (assuming no savings from smaller\/simpler sense amps) to switch to a 16-port LOC, with a 22% increase in 8-reference throughput.","Wide Microcache","A wide microcache (WMC) holds only data fetched for wide (W) instructions, for each unit which implements one or more wide (W) instructions.","The wide (W) instructions each operate on a block of data fetched from memory and the contents of one or more general registers, producing a result in a general register. Generally, the amount of data in the block exceeds the maximum amount of data that the memory system can supply in a single cycle, so caching the memory data is of particular importance. All the wide (W) instructions require that the memory data be located at an aligned address, an address that is a multiple of the size of the memory data, which is always a power of two.","The wide (W) instructions are performed by functional units which normally perform execute or \u201cback-end\u201d instructions, though the loading of the memory data requires use of the access or \u201cfront-end\u201d functional units. To minimize the use of the \u201cfront-end\u201d functional units, special rules are used to maintain the coherence of a wide microcache (WMC).","Execution of a wide (W) instruction has a residual effect of loading the specified memory data into a wide microcache (WMC). Under certain conditions, a future wide (W) instruction may be able to reuse the WMC contents.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1205","num":"1205"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"First of all, any store or cache coherency action on the physical addresses referenced by the WMC will invalidate the contents of the WMC. The minimum translation unit of the virtual memory system, 256 bytes, defines the number of physical address blocks which must be checked by any store. A WMC for the W.TABLE instruction may be as large as 4096 bytes, and so requires as many as 16 such physical address blocks to be checked for each WMC entry. A WMC for the W.SWITCH or W.MUL.* instructions need check only one address block for each WMC entry, as the maximum size is 128 bytes.","By making these checks on the physical addresses, we do not need to be concerned about changes to the virtual memory mapping from virtual to physical addresses, and the virtual memory state can be freely changed without invalidating any WMC.","Absent any of the above changes, the WMC is only valid if it contains the contents relevant to the current wide (W) instruction. To check this with minimal use of the front-end units, each WMC entry contains a first tag with the thread and address general register for which it was last used. If the current wide (W) instruction uses the same thread and address general register, it may proceed safely. Any intervening writes to that address general register by that thread invalidates the WMC thread and address general register tag.","If the above test fails, the front-end is used to fetch the address general register and check its contents against a second WMC tag, with the physical addresses for which it was last used. If the tag matches, it may proceed safely. As detailed above, any intervening stores or cache coherency action by any thread to the physical addresses invalidates the WMC entry.","If both the above tests fail for all relevant WMC entries, there is no alternative but to load the data from the virtual memory system into the WMC. The front-end units are responsible for generating the necessary addresses to the virtual memory system to fetch the entire data block into a WMC.","For the first implementation, it is anticipated that there be eight WMC entries for each of the two X units (for W.SWITCH instructions), eight WMC entries for each of the two E units (for W.MUL instructions), and four WMC entries for the single T unit. The total number of WMC address tags requires is 8*2*1+8*2*1+4*1*16=96 entries.","The number of WMC address tags can be substantially reduced to 32+4=36 entries by making an implementation restriction requiring that a single translation block be used to translate the data address of W.TABLE instructions. With this restriction, each W.TABLE WMC entry uses a contiguous and aligned physical data memory block, for which a single address tag can contain the relevant information. The size of such a block is a maximum of 4096 bytes. The restriction can be checked by examining the size field of the referenced GTB entry.","Referring to , the following data structures are employed to implement the wide microcache.","The flow chart in  illustrates the algorithm employed by the wide microcache control logic to ensure that the microcache is valid.","The diagrams in  illustrate the implementation of the microcache control:","Level Zero Cache","The innermost cache level, here named the \u201cLevel Zero Cache,\u201d (LZC) is fully associative and indexed by global address. Entries in the LZC contain global addresses and previously fetched data from the memory system. The LZC is an implementation feature, not visible to the Zeus architecture.","Entries in the LZC are also used to hold the global addresses of store instructions that have been issued, but not yet completed in the memory system. The LZC entry may also contain the data associated with the global address, as maintained either before or after updating with the store data. When it contains the post-store data, results of stores may be forwarded directly to the requested reference.","With an LZC hit, data is returned from the LZC data, and protection from the LZC tag. No LOC access is required to complete the reference.","All loads and program fetches are checked against the LZC for conflicts with entries being used as store buffer. On a LZC hit on such entries, if the post-store data is present, data may be returned by the LZC to satisfy the load or program fetch. If the post-store data is not present, the load or program fetch must stall until the data is available.","With an LZC miss, a victim entry is selected, and if dirty, the victim entry is written to the LOC. An entry allocated as store buffer, but that has not yet been retired, is not a suitable choice as victim entry. The LOC cache is accessed, and a valid LZC entry is constructed from data from the LOC and tags from the LOC protection information.","All stores are checked against the LZC for conflicts, and further allocate an entry in the LZC, or \u201ctake over\u201d a previously clean LZC entry for the purpose of store buffering. Unaligned stores may require two entries in the LZC. At time of allocation, the address is filled in.","Two operations then occur in parallel\u20141) for write-back cached references, the remaining bytes of the hexlet are loaded from the LOC (or LZC), and 2) the addressed bytes are filled in with data from data path. If an exception causes the store to be purged before retirement, the LZC entry is marked invalid, and not written back. When the store is retired, the LZC entry can be written back to LOC or external interface.","Physical Address Coherency","When the mapping from global address to physical address is many-to-one, that is more than one global address may map to a single physical address, special consideration must be given to coherence of memory transactions. For each LZC entry, either the physical address (for references that are not cached) or the cache physical address (for cache or niche references) is retained. Each store operation produces the niche address from the BTB or the cache address from the MTB, or the physical address from the GTB, and a comparison of physical tags is used to serialize references for which the physical tags match.","When a store address matches an LZC entry, even though the global address did not match, the matching LZC entry must be retired or purged. When a load address matches an LZC entry, even though the global address did not match, the matching LZC entry must be retired, purged, or retagged with the global address.","Each of the WMC entries must be checked for coherency as well\u2014this is performed with a similar structure (and similar timing) as the LZC physical tag check. The effect of a match is to invalidate the WMC when such a store address matches the WMC physical address.","Structure","The eight memory addresses are partitioned into up to four odd addresses, and four even addresses.","The LZC contains 16 fully associative entries that may each contain a single hexlet of data at even hexlet addresses (LZCE), and another 16 entries for odd hexlet addresses (LZCO).

The access protection information (pr and rwxg) is supplied from the MTB.","With an MTB (and BTB) miss, a victim entry is selected for replacement. The MTB and BTB are always clean, so the victim entry is discarded without a writeback. The GTB (described below) is referenced to obtain a physical address and protection information. Depending on the access information in the GTB, either the MTB or BTB is filled.","Note that the processing of the physical address paagainst the niche limit nl can be performed on the physical address from the GTB, producing the LOC address, ci. The LOC address, after processing against the nl is placed into the MTB directly, reducing the latency of an MTB hit.","Four tags are fetched from the LOC tags and compared against the PA to determine which of the four sets contain the data.

MTB flushing is accomplished by searching MTB entries for values that match on the gi field with the GTB entry that has been modified. Each such matching MTB entry is flushed.","The MTB is kept synchronous with the LOC tags, particularly with respect to MESI state. On an LOC miss or LOC snoop, any changes in MESI state update (or flush) MTB entries which physically match the address. If the MTB may contain less than the full physical address: it is sufficient to retain the LOC physical address (ci\u2225v\u2225si).","Block Translation Buffer","Zeus has a per thread \u201cBlock Translation Buffer\u201d (BTB). The BTB retains GTB information for uncached address blocks. An implementation may limit use of the BTB to address blocks that reference the LOC niche, as is done in the first implementation, or alternatively may permit the BTB to contain any uncache address block. The BTB is used in parallel with the MTB\u2014at most one of the BTB or MTB may translate a particular reference. When both the BTB and MTB miss, the GTB is consulted, and depending on the result, the block is filled into either the MTB or BTB as appropriate. In the first Zeus implementation, the BTB has 2 entries for each thread.","BTB entries cover any power-of-two granularity, as they retain the size information from the GTB. BTB entries contain no MESI state, as they only contain uncached blocks.","Each BTB entry consists of 128 bits of information, containing the same information in the same format as a GTB entry, although if limited in use to the LOC niche, only the LOC physical address must be maintained, and sufficient block size to cover the LOC niche.","The operation of the BTB is largely not visible to software\u2014hardware mechanisms are responsible for automatically initializing, filling and flushing the BTB. Activity that modifies the GTB may require that one or more BTB entries are flushed.","A write to the GTBUpdate register that updates a matching entry, a write to the GTBUpdateFill register, or a direct write to the GTB all flush relevant entries from the BTB. BTB flushing is accomplished by searching BTB entries for values that match on the gi field with the GTB entry that has been modified. Each such matching BTB entry is flushed.","Niche blocks are indicated by GTB information, and correspond to blocks of data that are retained in the LOC and never miss. A special physical address range indicates niche blocks. For this address range, the BTB enables use of the LOC as a niche memory, generating the \u201cset select\u201d address bits from low-order address bits. There is no checking of the LOC tags for consistent use of the LOC as a niche\u2014the nl field must be preset by software so that LOC cache replacement never claims the LOC niche space, and only BTB miss and protection bits prevent software from using the cache portion of the LOC as niche.","Other address ranges include other on-chip resources, such as bus interface registers, the control register and status register, as well as off-chip memory, accessed through the bus interface. Each of these regions are accessible as uncached memory.","Program Translation Buffer","Later implementations of Zeus may optionally have a per-thread \u201cProgram Translation Buffer\u201d (PTB). The PTB retains GTB and LOC cache tag information. The PTB enables generation of LOC instruction fetching in parallel with load\/store fetching. The PTB is updated when instruction fetching crosses a cache line boundary (each 64 instructions in straight-line code). The PTB functions similarly to a one-entry MTB, but can use the sequential nature of program code fetching to avoid checking the 56-bit match. The PTB is flushed at the same time as the MTB.","The initial implementation of Zeus has no PTB\u2014the MTB suffices for this function.","Global Virtual Cache","The initial implementation of Zeus contains cache which is both indexed and tagged by a physical address. Other prototype implementations have used a global vitual address to index and\/or tag an internal cache. This section will define the required characteristics of a global vitually-indexed cache. TODO","Memory Interface","Dedicated hardware mechanisms are provided to fetch data blocks in the levels zero and one caches, provided that a matching entry can be found in the MTB or GTB (or if the MMU is disabled). Dedicated hardware mechanisms are provided to store back data blocks in the level zero and one caches, regardless of the state of the MTB and GTB. When no entry is to be found in the GTB, an exception handler is invoked either to generate the required information from the virtual address, or to place an entry in the GTB to provide for automatic handling of this and other similarly addressed data blocks.","The initial implementation of Zeus accesses the remainder of the memory system through the \u201cSocket 7\u201d interface. Via this interface, Zeus accesses a secondary cache, DRAM memory, external ROM memory, and an I\/O system The size and presence of the secondary cache and the DRAM memory array, and the contents of the external ROM memory and the I\/O system are variables in the processor environment.","Snoop","The \u201cSuper Socket 7\u201d bus requires certain bus accesses to be checked against on-chip caches. On a bus read, the address is checked against the on-chip caches, with accesses aborted when requested data is in an internal cache in the M state, and the E state, the internal cache is changed to the S state. On a bus write, data written must update data in on-chip caches. To meet these requirements, physical bus addresses must be checked against the LOC tags.","The SS7 bus requires that responses to inquire cycles occur with fixed timing. At least with certain combinations of bus and processor clock rate, inquire cycles will require top priority to meet the inquire response timing requirement.","Synchronization operations must take into account bus activity\u2014generally a synchronization operation can only proceed on cached data which is in Exclusive or Modified\u2014if cached data in Shared state, ownership must be obtained. Data that is not cached must be accessed using locked bus cycles.","Load","Load operations require partitioning into reads that do not cross a hexlet (128 bit) boundary, checking for store conflicts, checking the LZC, checking the LOC, and reading from memory. Execute and Gateway accesses are always aligned and since they are smaller than a hexlet, do not cross a hexlet boundary.","Note: S7 processors perform unaligned operations LSB first, MSB last, up to 64 bits at a time. Unaligned 128 bit loads need 3 64-bit operations, LSB, octlet, MSB. Transfers which are smaller than a hexlet but larger than an octlet are further divided in the S7 bus unit.","Definition",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1264","num":"1271"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00073","num":"00073"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"def data \u2190 LoadMemoryX(ba,la,size,order)"},{"entry":"\u2003assert (order = L) and ((la and (size\/8\u22121)) = 0) and (size = 32)"},{"entry":"\u2003hdata \u2190 TranslateAndCacheAccess(ba,la,size,X,0)"},{"entry":"\u2003data \u2190 hdata"},{"entry":"enddef"},{"entry":"def data \u2190 LoadMemoryG(ba,la,size,order)"},{"entry":"\u2003assert (order = L) and ((la and (size\/8\u22121)) = 0) and (size = 64)"},{"entry":"\u2003hdata \u2190 TranslateAndCacheAccess(ba,la,size,G,0)"},{"entry":"\u2003data \u2190 hdata"},{"entry":"enddef"},{"entry":"def data \u2190 LoadMemory(ba,la,size,order)"},{"entry":"\u2003if (size > 128) then"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003data0 \u2190 LoadMemory(ba, la,size\/2, order)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003data1 \u2190 LoadMemory(ba, la+(size\/2), size\/2, order)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003case order of"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003L:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data \u25a1 data1 || data0"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003B:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data \u25a1 data0 || data1"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003endcase"},{"entry":"\u2003else"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003bs \u2190 8*la"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003be \u2190 bs + size"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003if be > 128 then"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data0 \u2190 LoadMemory(ba, la, 128 \u2212 bs, order)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data1 \u2190 LoadMemory(ba, (la+ 1) || 0, be \u2212 128, order)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003case order of"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003L:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data \u2190 (data1 || data0)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003B:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003data \u2190 (data0 || data1)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003endcase"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003else"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003hdata \u2190 TranslateAndCacheAccess(ba,la,size,R,0)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003for i \u2190 0 to size\u22128 by 8"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003j \u2190 bs + ((order=L) ?

A three-bit field indicates the choice of caching, according to the table above. The maximum of the three-bit cache control field (cc) values of the LTB and GTB indicates the choice of caching, according to the table above.","No Cache","No Cache (NC) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that the cache is to be not to be consulted. No changes to the cache state result from reads or writes with this attribute set, (except for accesses that directly address the cache via memory-mapped region).","Cache Disable","Cache Disable (CD) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that the cache is to be consulted and updated for cache lines which are already present, but no new cache lines or sub-blocks are to be allocated when the cache does not already contain the addressed memory contents.","The \u201cSocket 7\u201d bus also provides a mechanism for supporting chip sets to decide on each access whether data is to be cached, using the CACHE# and KEN# signals. Using these signals, external hardware may cause a region selected as WT, WA or PF to be treated as CD. This mechanism is only active on the first such access to a memory region if caching is enabled, as the cache may satisfy subsequent references without a bus transaction.","Write Through","Write Through (WT) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that the writes to the cache must also immediately update backing memory. Reads to addressed memory that is not present in the cache cause cache lines or sub-blocks to be allocated. Writes to addressed memory that is not present in the cache does not modify cache state.","The \u201cSocket 7\u201d bus also provides a mechanism for supporting chip sets to decide on each access whether data is to be written through, using the PWT and WB\/WT# signals. Using these signals, external hardware may cause a region selected as WA or PF to be treated as WT. This mechanism is only active on the first write to each region of memory; as on subsequent references, if the cache line is in the Exclusive or Modified state and writeback caching is enabled on the first reference, no subsequent bus operation occurs, at least until the cache line is flushed.","Write Allocate","Write allocate (WA) is an attribute that can be set of a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that the processor is to allocate a memory block to the cache when the data is not previously present in the cache and the operation to be performed is a store. Reads to addressed memory that is not present in the cache cause cache lines or sub-blocks to be allocated. For cacheable data, write allocate is generally the preferred policy, as allocating the data to the cache reduces further bus traffic for subsequent references (loads or stores) or the data. Write allocate never occurs for data which is not cached. A write allocate brings in the data immediately into the Modified state.","Other \u201csocket 7\u201d processors have the ability to inhibit write allocate to cached locations under certain conditions, related by the address range. K6, for example, can inhibit write allocate in the range of 15-16 Mbyte, or for all addresses above a configurable limit with 4 Mbyte granularity. Pentium has the ability to label address ranges over which write allocate can be inhibited.","PreFetch","Prefetch (PF) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that increased prefetching is appropriate for references in this region. Each program fetch, load or store to a cache line that or does not already contain all the sub-blocks causes a prefetch allocation of the remaining sub-blocks, Cache misses cause allocation of the requested sub-block and prefetch allocation of the remaining sub-blocks. Prefetching does not necessarily fill in the entire cache line, as prefetch memory references are performed at a lower priority to other cache and memory reference traffic. A limited number of prefetches (as low as one in the initial implementation) can be queued; the older prefetch requests are terminated as new ones are created.","In other respects, the PF attribute is handled in the manner of the WA attribute. Prefetching is considered an implementation-dependent feature, and an implementation may choose to implement region with the PF attribute exactly as with the WA attribute.","Implementations may perform even more aggressive prefetching in future versions. Data may be prefetched into the cache in regions that are cacheable, as a result of program fetches, loads or stores to nearby addresses. Prefetches may extend beyond the cache line associated with the nearby address. Prefetches shall not occur beyond the reach of the GTB entry associated with the nearby address. Prefetching is terminated if an attempted cache fill results in a bus response that is not cacheable. Prefetches are implementation-dependent behavior, and such behavior may vary as a result of other memory references or other bus activity.","SubStream","SubStream (SS) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that references in this region are to be selected as the next victim on a cache miss. In particular, cache misses, which normally place the cache line in the last-to-be-victim state, instead place the cache line in the first-to-be-victim state, except relative to cache lines in the I state,","In other respects, the SS attribute is handled in the manner of the WA attribute. SubStream is considered an implementation-dependent feature, and an implementation may choose to implement region with the SS attribute exactly as with the WA attribute.","The SubStream attribute is appropriate for regions which are large data structures in which the processor is likely to reference the memory data just once or a small number of times, but for which the cache permits the data to be fetched using burst transfers. By making it a priority for victimization, these references are less likely to interfere with caching of data for which the cache performs a longer-term storage function.","LineStream","LineStream (LS) is an attribute that can be set on a LTB or GTB translation region to indicate that references in this region are to be selected as the next victim on a cache miss, and to enable prefetching. In particular, cache misses, which normally place the cache line in the last-to-be-victim state, instead place the cache line in the first-to-be-victim state, except relative to cache lines in the I state.","In other respects, the LS attribute is handled in the manner of the PF attribute. LineStream is considered an implementation-dependent feature, and an implementation may choose to implement region with the SS attribute exactly as with the PF or WA attributes.","Like the SubStream attribute, the LineStream attribute is particularly appropriate for regions for which large data structures are used in sequential fashion. By prefetching the entire cache line, memory traffic is performed as large sequential bursts of at least 256 bytes, maximizing the available bus utilization.","Cache Coherence","Cache coherency is maintained by using MESI protocols, for which each cache line (256 bytes) the cache data is kept in one of four states: M, E, S, I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1314","num":"1323"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00083","num":"00083"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["State",{},"this Cache data","other Cache data","Memory data"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Modified","3","Data is held","No data is present in","The contents of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"exclusively in","other caches.","main memory are"]},{"entry":[{},{},"this cache.",{},"now invalid."]},{"entry":["Exclusive","2","Data is held","No data is present in","Data is the same"]},{"entry":[{},{},"exclusively in","other caches.","as the contents of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"this cache.",{},"main memory"]},{"entry":["Shared","1","Data is held","Data is possibly in","Data is the same"]},{"entry":[{},{},"in this cache,","other caches.","as the contents of"]},{"entry":[{},{},"and possibly",{},"main memory."]},{"entry":[{},{},"others.",{},{}]},{"entry":["Invalid","0","No data for this","Data is possibly in","Data is possibly"]},{"entry":[{},{},"location is","other caches.","present in main"]},{"entry":[{},{},"present in",{},"memory."]},{"entry":[{},{},"the cache."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The state is contained in the mesi field of the cache tag.","In addition, because the \u201cSocket 7\u201d bus performs block transfers and cache coherency actions on triclet (32 byte) blocks, each cache line also maintains 8 bits of triclet valid (tv) state. Each bit of tv corresponds to a triclet sub-block of the cache line; bit  for bytes  . . . , bit  for bytes  . . . , bit  for bytes  . . . , etc. If the tv bit is zero (0), the coherence state for that triclet is I, no matter what the value of the mesi field. If the tv bit is one (1), the coherence state is defined by the mesi field. If all the tv bits are cleared (0), the mesi field must also be cleared, indicating an invalid cache line.","Cache coherency activity generally follows the protocols defined by the \u201cSocket 7\u201d bus, as defined by Pentium and K6-2 documentation. However, because the coherence state of a cache line is represented in only 10 bits per 256 bytes (1.25 bits per triclet), a few state transistions are defined differently. The differences are a direct result of attempts to set triclets within a cache line to different MES states that cannot be represented. The data structure allows any triclet to be changed to the I state, so state transitions in this direction match the Pentium processor exactly.","On the Pentium processor, for a cache line in the M state, an external bus Inquiry cycle that does not require invalidation (INV=0) places the cache line in the S state. On the Zeus processor, if no other triclet in the cache line is valid, the mesi field is changed to S. If other triclets in the cache line are valid, the mesi field is left unchanged, and the tv bit for this triclet is turned off, effectively changing it to the I state.","On the Pentium processor, for a cache line in the E state, an external bus Inquiry cycle that does not require invalidation (INV=0) places the cache line in the S state. On the Zeus processor, the mesi field is changed to S. If other triclets in the cache line are valid, the MESI state is effectively changed to the S state for these other triclets.","On the Pentium processor, for a cache line in the S state, an internal store operation causes a write-through cycle and a transition to the E state. On the Zeus processor, the mesi field is changed to E. Other triclets in the cache line are invalidated by clearing the tv bits; the MESI state is effectively changed to the I state for these other triclets.","When allocating data into the cache due to a store operation, data is brought immediately into the Modified state, setting the mesi field to M. If the previous mesi field is S, other triclets which are valid are invalidated by clearing the tv bits. If the previous mesi field is E, other triclets are kept valid and therefore changed to the M state.","When allocating data into the cache due to a load operation, data is brought into the Shared state, if another processor reports that the data is present in its cache or the mesi field is already set to S, the Exclusive state, if no processor reports that the data is present in its cache and the mesi field is currently E or I, or the Modified state if the mesi field is already set to M. The determination is performed by driving PWT low and checking whether WB\/WT# is sampled high; if so the line is brought into the Exclusive state. (See page 202 (184) of the K6-2 documentation).","Strong Ordering","Strong ordering (so) is an attribute which permits certain memory regions to be operated with strong ordering, in which all memory operations are performed exactly in the order specified by the program and others to be operated with weak ordering, in which some memory operations may be performed out of program order.","The Zeus processor controls strong ordering as an attribute in the LTB and GTB, thus software may set this attribute for certain address ranges and clear it for others. A one bit field indicates the choice of access ordering. A one (1) bit indicates strong ordering, while a zero (0) bit indicates weak ordering.","With weak ordering, the memory system may retain store operations in a store buffer indefinitely for later storage into the memory system, or until a synchronization operation to any address performed by the thread that issued the store operation forces the store to occur. Load operations may be performed in any order, subject to requirements that they be performed logically subsequent to prior store operations to the same address, and subsequent to prior synchronization operations to any address. Under weak ordering it is permitted to forward results from a retained store operation to a future load operation to the same address. Operations are considered to be to the same address when any bytes of the operation are in common. Weak ordering is usually appropriate for conventional memory regions, which are side-effect free.","With strong ordering, the memory system must perform load and store operations in the order specified. In particular, strong-ordered load operations are performed in the order specified, and all load operations (whether weak or strong) must be delayed until all previous strong-ordered store operations have been performed, which can have a significant performance impact. Strong ordering is often required for memory-mapped I\/O regions, where store operations may have a side-effect on the value returned by loads to other addresses. Note that Zeus has memory-mapped I\/O, such as the TB, for which the use of strong ordering is essential to proper operation of the virtual memory system.","The EWBE# signal in \u201cSocket 7\u201d is of importance in maintaining strong ordering. When a write is performed with the signal inactive, no further writes to E or M state lines may occur until the signal becomes active. Further details are given in Pentium documentation (K6-2 documentation may not apply to this signal.)","Victim Selection","One bit of the cache tag, the vs bit, controls the selection of which set of the four sets at a cache address should next be chosen as a victim for cache line replacement. Victim selectrion (vs) is an attribute associated with LOC cache blocks. No vs bits are present in the LTB or GTB.","There are two hexlets of tag information for a cache line, and replacement of a set requires writing only one hexlet. To update priority information for victim selection by writing only one hexlet, information in each hexlet is combined by an exclusive-or. It is the nature of the exclusive-or function that altering either of the two hexlets can change the priority information.","Full Victim Selection Ordering for Four Sets","There are 4*3*2*1=24 possible orderings of the four sets, which can be completely encoded in as few as 5 bits: 2 bits to indicate highest priority, 2 bits for second-highest priority, 1 bit for third-highest priority, and 0 bits for lowest priority. Dividing this up per set and duplicating per hexlet with the exclusive-or scheme above requires three bits per set, which suggests simply keeping track of the three-highest priority sets with 2 bits each, using 6 bits total and three bits per set.","Specifically, vs bits from the four sets are combined to produce a 6-bit value:\n\n","The highest priority for replacement is set vsc, second highest priority is set vsc, third highest priority is set vsc, and lowest priority is vsc^vsc^vsc. When the highest priority set is replaced, it becomes the new lowest priority and the others are moved up, computing a new vsc by:\n\n","When replacing set vsc for a LineStream or SubStream replacement, the priority for replacement is unchanged, unless another set contains the invalid MESI state, computing a new vsc by:\n\n","Cache flushing and invalidations can cause cache lines to be cleared out of sequential order. Flushing or invalidating a cache line moves that set to highest priority. If that set is already highest priority, the vsc is unchanged. If the set was second or third highest or lowest priority, the vsc is changed to move that set to highest priority, moving the others down.\n\n","When updating the hexlet containing vs[0] and vs[0], the new values of vs[1] and vs[0] are:\n\n","When updating the hexlet containing vs[3] and vs[2], the new values of vs[3] and vs[2] are:\n\n","Software must initialize the vs bits to a legal, consistent state. For example, to set the priority (highest to lowest) to (0, 1, 2, 3), vsc must be set to 0b100100. There are many legal solutions that yield this vsc value, such as vs[3]\u21900, vs[2]\u21900, vs[1]\u21904,vs[0]+4.","Simplified Victim Selection Ordering for Four Sets","However, the orderings are simplified in the first Zeus implementation, to reduce the number of vs bits to one per set, keeping a two bit vsc state value:\n\n","The highest priority for replacement is set vsc, second highest priority is set vsc+1, third highest priority is set vsc+2, and lowest priority is vsc+3. When the highest priority set is replaced, it becomes the new lowest priority and the others are moved up. Priority is given to sets with invalid MESI state, computing a new vsc by:\n\n","When replacing set vsc for a LineStream or SubStream replacement, the priority for replacement is unchanged, unless another set contains the invalid MESI state, computing a new vsc by:\n\n","Cache flushing and invalidations can cause cache sets to be cleared out of sequential order. If the current highest priority for replacement is a valid set, the flushed or invalidated set is made highest priority for replacement.\n\n","When updating the hexlet containing vs[1] and vs[0], the new values of vs[1] and vs[0] are:\n\n","When updating the hexlet containing vs[3] and vs[2], the new values of vs[3] and vs[2] are:\n\n","Software must initialize the vs bits, but any state is legal. For example, to set the priority (highest to lowest) to (0, 1, 2, 3), vsc must be set to 0b00. There are many legal solutions that yield this vsc value, such as vs[3]\u21900, vs[2]\u21900, vs[1]\u21900, vs[0]\u21900.","Full Victim Selection Ordering for Additional Sets","To extend the full-victim-ordering scheme to eight sets, 3*7=21 bits are needed, which divided among two tags is 11 bits per tag. This is somewhat generous, as the minimum required is 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1=40320 orderings, which can be represented in as few as 16 bits. Extending the full-victim-ordering four-set scheme above to represent the first 4 priorities in binary, but to use 2 bits for each of the next 3 priorities requires 3+3+3+3+2+2+2=18 bits. Representing fewer distinct orderings can further reduce the number of bits used. As an extreme example, using the simplified scheme above with eight sets requires only 3 bits, which divided among two tags is 2 bits per tag.","Victim Selection Without LOC Tag Bits","At extreme values of the niche limit register (nl in the range 121 . . . 124), the bit normally used to hold the vs bit is usurped for use as a physical address bit. Under these conditions, no vsc value is maintained per cache line, instead a single, global vsc value is used to select victims for cache replacement. In this case, the cache consists of four lines, each with four sets. On each replacement a new si valus is computed from:\n\n","The algorithm above is designed to utilize all four sets on sequential access to memory.","Victim Selection Encoding LOC Tag Bits","At even more extreme values of the niche limit register (nl in the range 125 . . . 127), not only is the bit normally used to hold the vs bit is usurped for use as a physical address bit, but there is a deficit of one or two physical address bits. In this case, the number of sets can be reduced to encode physical address bits into the victim selection, allowing the choice of set to indicate physical address bits  or bits  . . . . On each replacement a new vsc valus is computed from:\n\n","The algorithm above is designed to utilize all four sets on sequential access to memory.","Detail Access","Detail access is an attribute which can be set on a cache block or translation region to indicate that software needs to be consulted on each potential access, to determine whether the access should proceed or not. Setting this attribute causes an exception trap to occur, by which software can examine the virtual address, by for example, locating data in a table, and if indicated, causes the processor to continue execution. In continuing, ephemeral state is set upon returning to the re-execution of the instruction that prevents the exception trap from recurring on this particular re-execution only. The ephemeral state is cleared as soon as the instruction is either completed or subject to another exception, so DetailAccess exceptions can recur on a subsequent execution of the same instruction. Alternatively, if the access is not to proceed, execution has been trapped to software at this point, which can abort the thread or take other corrective action.","The detail access attribute permits specification of access parameters over memory region on arbitrary byte boundaries. This is important for emulators, which must prevent store access to code which has been translated, and for simulating machines which have byte granularity on segment boundaries. The detail access attribute can also be applied to debuggers, which have the need to set breakpoints on byte-level data, or which may use the feature to set code breakpoints on instruction boundaries without altering the program code, enabling breakpoints on code contained in ROM.","A one bit field indicates the choice of detail access. A one (1) bit indicates detail access, while a zero (0) bit indicates no detail access. Detail access is an attribute that can be set by the LTB, the GTB, or a cache tag.","The table below indicates the proper status for all potential values of the detail access bits in the LTB, GTB, and Tag:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1354","num":"1392"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00084","num":"00084"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["LTB","GTB","Tag","status"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","0","0","OK - normal"]},{"entry":["0","0","1","AccessDetailRequiredByTag"]},{"entry":["0","1","0","AccessDetailRequiredByGTB"]},{"entry":["0","1","1","OK - GTB inhibited by Tag"]},{"entry":["1","0","0","AccessDetailRequiredByLTB"]},{"entry":["1","0","1","OK - LTB inhibited by Tag"]},{"entry":["1","1","0","OK - LTB inhibited by GTB"]},{"entry":["1","1","1","AccessDetailRequiredByTag"]},{"entry":["0","Miss",{},"GTBMiss"]},{"entry":["1","Miss",{},"AccessDetailRequiredByLTB"]},{"entry":["0","0","Miss","Cache Miss"]},{"entry":["0","1","Miss","AccessDetailRequiredByGTB"]},{"entry":["1","0","Miss","AccessDetailRequiredByLTB"]},{"entry":["1","1","Miss","Cache Miss"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The first eight rows show appropriate activities when all three bits are available. The detail access attributes for the LTB, GTB, and cache tag work together to define whether and which kind of detail access exception trap occurs. Generally, setting a single attribute bit causes an exception, while setting two bits inhibits such exceptions. In this way, a detail access exception can be narrowed down to cause an exception over a specified region of memory: Software generally will set the cache tag detail access bit only for regions in which the LTB or GTB also has a detail access bit set. Because cache activity may flush and refill cache lines implicity, it is not generally useful to set the cache tag detail access bit alone, but if this occurs, the AccessDetailRequiredByTag exception catches such an attempt.","The next two rows show appropriate activities on a GTB miss. On a GTB miss, the detail access bit in the GTB is not present. If the LTB indicates detail access and the GTB misses, the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB exception should be indicated. If software continues from the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB exception and has not filled in the GTB, the GTBMiss exception happens next. Since the GTBMiss exection is not a continuation exception, a re-execution after the GTBMiss exception can cause a reoccurence of the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB exception. Alternatively, if software continues from the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB exception and has filled in the GTB, the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB exception is inhibited for that reference, no matter what the status of the GTB and Tag detail bits, but the re-executed instruction is still subject to the AccessDetailRequiredByGTB and AccessDetailRequiredByTag exceptions.","The last four rows show appropriate activities for a cache miss. On a cache miss, the detail access bit in the tag is not present. If the LTB or GTB indicates detail access and the cache misses, the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB or AccessDetailRequiredByGTB exception should be indicated. If software continues from these exceptions and has not filled in the cache, a cache miss happens next. If software continues from the AccessDetailRequiredByLTB or AccessDetailRequiredByGTB exception and has filled in the cache, the previous exception is inhibited for that reference, no matter what the status of the Tag detail bit, but is still subject to the AccessDetailRequiredByTag exception. When the detail bit must be created from a cache miss, the initial value filled in is zero. Software may set the bit, thus turning off AccessDetailRequired exceptions per cache line. If the cache line is flushed and refilled, the detail access bit in the cache tag is again reset to zero, and another AccessDetailRequired exception occurs.","Settings of the niche limit parameter to values that require use of the da bit in the LOC tag for retaining the physical address usurp the capability to set the Tag detail access bit. Under such conditions, the Tag detail access bit is effectively always zero (0), so it cannot inhibit AccessDetailRequiredByLTB, inhibit AccessDetailRequiredByGTB, or cause AccessDetailRequiredByTag.","The execution of a Zeus instruction has a reference to one quadlet of instruction, which may be subject to the DetailAccess exceptions, and a reference to data, which may be unaligned or wide. These unaligned or wide references may cross GTB or cache boundaries, and thus involve multiple separate reference that are combined together, each of which may be subject to the DetailAccess exception. There is sufficient information in the DetailAccess exception handler to process unaligned or wide references.","The implementation is free to indicate DetailAccess exceptions for unaligned and wide data references either in combined form, or with each sub-reference separated. For example, in an unaligned reference that crosses a GTB or cache boundary, a DetailAccess exception may be indicated for a portion of the reference. The exception may report the virtual address and size of the complete reference, and upon continuing, may inhibit reoccurrence of the DetailAccess exception for any portion of the reference. Alternatively, it may report the virtual address and size of only a reference portion and inhibit reoccurrence of the DetailAccess exception for only that portion of the reference, subject to another DetailAccess exception occurring for the remaining portion of the reference.","Microarchitecture","This section discusses details of the initial implementation that are not generally visible to software and do not affect its function, other than performance rates. The details in this section are specific to the initial implementation of the Zeus architecture; other implementations may be markedly different without affecting software compatibility. Certain aspects that may vary between implementations are described by the value of architectural parameters in the ROM, so that software may adjust itself to these parameters.","Overview","One embodiment of Zeus provides four threads of simultaneous instruction execution\u2014each thread has distinct general register file, program counter, and local TB storage. Each thread has distinct address units that perform the A, L, S, B classes of instructions, but share other aspects of the memory system and share functional units that perform the more resource-intensive G, X, E, and W classes of instructions.","Referring to , the microarchitecture of the initial implementation is indicated by the diagram.","Referring to , four copies of an access unit are shown, each with an access instruction fetch queue A-Queue, coupled to an access general register file AR, each of which is, in turn, coupled to two access functional units A. The access units function independently for four simultaneous threads of execution. These eight access functional units A produce results for access general register files AR and addresses to a shared memory system. The memory contents fetched from the memory system are combined with execute instructions not performed by the access unit and entered into the four execute instruction queues E-Queue. Instructions and memory data from the E-queue are presented to execution general register files, which fetch execution general register file source operands. The instructions are coupled to the execution unit by arbitration unit Arbitration, that selects which instructions from the four threads are to be routed to the available execution units E, X, G, and T. The execution general register file source operands ER are coupled to the execution units using the source operand buses and to the execution units using the source operand buses. The function unit result operands from execution units are coupled to the execution general register file using the result bus. The function units result operands from the execution units are coupled to the execution general register file using the result bus.","Instruction Scheduling","The detailed pipeline organization for Zeus has a significant influence on instruction scheduling. Here we elaborate some general rules for effective scheduling by a compiler. Specific information on numbers of functional units, functional unit parallelism and latency is quite implementation-dependent: values indicated here are valid for Zeus's first implementation.","Separate Addressing from Execution","Zeus has separate function units to perform addressing operations (A, L, S, B instructions) from execution operations (G, X, E, W instructions). When possible, Zeus will execute all the addressing operations of an instruction stream, deferring execution of the execution operations until dependent load instructions are completed. Thus, the latency of the memory system is hidden, so long as addressing operations themselves do not need to wait for memory operands or results from the execution operations.","Software Pipeline","For best performance, instructions should be scheduled so that previous dependent operations can be completed at the time of issue. When this is not possible, the processor inserts sufficient empty cycles to perform the instructions as if performed one after the other\u2014explicit no-operation instructions are not required.","Multiple Issue","Zeus can issue up to two addressing operations and up to two execution operations per cycle per thread. Considering functional unit parallelism, described below, as many of four instruction issues per cycle are possible per thread.","Functional Unit Parallelism","Zeus has separate function units for several classes of execution operations. An A unit performs scalar add, subtract, boolean, and shift-add operations for addressing and branch calculations. The remaining functional units are execution resources, which perform operations subsequent to memory loads and which operate on values in a parallel, partitioned form. A G unit performs add, subtract, boolean, and shift-add operations. An X unit performs general shift operations. An E unit performs multiply and floating-point operations. A T unit performs table-look-up operations.","Each instruction uses one or more of these units, according to the table below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1371","num":"1409"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00085","num":"00085"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Instruction","A","G","X","E","T"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"A.","x",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"B","x",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"L","x",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"S","x",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"G",{},"x",{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"X",{},{},"x",{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"E",{},{},{},"x",{}]},{"entry":[{},"W.TRANSLATE","x",{},{},{},"x"]},{"entry":[{},"W.MULMAT","x",{},{},"x",{}]},{"entry":[{},"W.SWITCH","x",{},"x"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The latency of each functional unit depends on what operation is performed in the unit, and where the result is used.

In the following discussion, the general characteristics of all Zeus implementations precede discussion of specific choices for specific implementations.","Classical Pipeline Structures","Pipelining in general refers to hardware structures that overlap various stages of execution of a series of instructions so that the time required to perform the series of instructions is less than the sum of the times required to perform each of the instructions separately. Additionally, pipelines carry to connotation of a collection of hardware structures which have a simple ordering and where each structure performs a specialized function.","The diagram below shows the timing of what has become a canonical scalar pipeline structure for a simple RISC processor, with time on the horizontal axis increasing to the right, and successive instructions on the vertical axis going downward. The stages I, R, E, M, and W refer to units which perform instruction fetch, general register file fetch, execution, data memory fetch, and general register file write.

Also, it can be seen that the result of a load operation executing in stages E and M (bold in line 3) is not available in the immediately following instruction (line 4), but may be used two cycles later (line 5); this is the cause of the load delay slot seen on some RISC processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1382","num":"1420"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00058","num":"00058"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00058","he":"23.45mm","wi":"63.75mm","file":"US08289335-20121016-C00058.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"In the diagrams below, we simplify the diagrams somewhat by eliminating the pipe stages for instruction fetch, general register file fetch, and general register file write, which can be understood to precede and follow the portions of the pipelines diagrammed.

For a particular ordering of instruction types, one instruction of each type may be issued in a single clock cycle. The ordering required is A, L, E, S, B; in other words, a general register-to-general register address calculation, a memory load, a general register-to-general register data calculation, a memory store, and a branch.

The Zeus \u201csuperthread\u201d pipeline provides for very highly pipelined implementations by alternating execution of two or more independent threads. In this context, a thread is the state required to maintain an independent execution; the architectural state required is that of the general register file contents, program counter, privilege level, local TB, and when required, exception status. Ensuring that only one thread may handle an exception at one time may minimize the latter state, exception status. In order to ensure that all threads make reasonable forward progress, several of the machine resources must be scheduled fairly.","An example of a resource that is critical that it be fairly shared is the data memory\/cache subsystem. In a prototype implementation, Zeus is able to perform a load operation only on every second cycle, and a store operation only on every fourth cycle. Zeus schedules these fixed timing resources fairly by using a round-robin schedule for a number of threads that is relatively prime to the resource reuse rates. For this implementation, five simultaneous threads of execution ensure that resources which may be used every two or four cycles are fairly shared by allowing the instructions which use those resources to be issued only on every second or fourth issue slot for that thread.

In designs employing simultaneous multithreading, instruction issue for each thread must be modified to incorporate arbitration between threads as they compete for access to shared functional units. Simultaneous multithreaded pipelines enhance the utilization of data path units by allowing instructions to be issued from one of several execution threads to each functional unit (Eggers, Susan, University of Washington).","The initial Zeus implementation performs simultaneous multithreading among 4 threads. Each of the 4 threads share a common memory system, a common T unit. Pairs of threads share two G units, one X unit, and one E unit. Each thread individually has two A units. A fair allocation scheme balances access to the shared resources by the four threads.","In Zeus, simultaneous multithreading is combined with the \u201cSuperString\u201d pipeline in a unique way. Compared to conventional pipelines, prior simultaneous multithreading designs used an additional pipeline cycle before instructions could be issued to functional units, the additional cycle needed to determine which threads should be permitted to issue instructions. Consequently, relative to conventional pipelines, this design had additional delay, including dependent branch delay.","Zeus contains individual access data path units, with associated general register files, for each execution thread. These access units produce addresses, which are aggregated together to a common memory unit, which fetches all the addresses and places the memory contents in one or more buffers. Instructions for execution units, which are shared to varying degrees among the threads are also buffered for later execution. The execution units then perform operations from all active threads using functional data path units that are shared.","For instructions performed by the execution units, the extra cycle required for prior simultaneous multithreading designs is overlapped with the memory data access time from decoupled access from execution cycles, so that no additional delay is incurred by the execution functional units for scheduling resources. For instructions performed by the access units, by employing individual access units for each thread the additional cycle for scheduling shared resources is also eliminated.","This is a favorable tradeoff because, while threads do not share the access functional units, these units are relatively small compared to the execution functional units, which are shared by threads.","With regard to the sharing of execution units, the Zeus implementation employs several different classes of functional units for the execution unit, with varying cost, utilization, and performance. In particular, the G units, which perform simple addition and bitwise operations is relatively inexpensive (in area and power) compared to the other units, and its utilization is relatively high. Consequently, the design employs four such units, where each unit can be shared between two threads. The X unit, which performs a broad class of data switching functions is more expensive and less used, so two units are provided that are each shared among two threads. The T unit, which performs the Wide Translate instruction, is expensive and utilization is low, so the single unit is shared among all four threads. The E unit, which performs the class of Ensemble instructions, is very expensive in area and power compared to the other functional units, but utilization is relatively high, so we provide two such units, each unit shared by two threads.","Branch\/Fetch Prediction","Zeus does not have delayed branch instructions, and so relies upon branch or fetch prediction to keep the pipeline full around unconditional and conditional branch instructions. In the simplest form of branch prediction, as in Zeus's first implementation, a taken conditional backward (toward a lower address) branch predicts that a future execution of the same branch will be taken. More elaborate prediction may cache the source and target addresses of multiple branches, both conditional and unconditional, and both forward and reverse.","The hardware prediction mechanism is tuned for optimizing conditional branches that close loops or express frequent alternatives, and will generally require substantially more cycles when executing conditional branches whose outcome is not predominately taken or not-taken. For such cases of unpredictable conditional results, the use of code that avoids conditional branches in favor of the use of compare-set and multiplex instructions may result in greater performance.","Under some conditions, the above technique may not be applicable, for example if the conditional branch \u201cguards\u201d code which cannot be performed when the branch is taken. This may occur, for example, when a conditional branch tests for a valid (non-zero) pointer and the conditional code performs a load or store using the pointer. In these cases, the conditional branch has a small positive offset, but is unpredictable. A Zeus pipeline may handle this case as if the branch is always predicted to be not taken, with the recovery of a misprediction causing cancellation of the instructions which have already been issued but not completed which would be skipped over by the taken conditional branch. This \u201cconditional-skip\u201d optimization is performed by the initial Zeus implementation and requires no specific architectural feature to access or implement.","A Zeus pipeline may also perform \u201cbranch-return\u201d optimization, in which a branch-link instruction saves a branch target address that is used to predict the target of the next returning branch instruction. This optimization may be implemented with a depth of one (only one return address kept), or as a stack of finite depth, where a branch and link pushes onto the stack, and a branch-register pops from the stack. This optimization can eliminate the misprediction cost of simple procedure calls, as the calling branch is susceptible to hardware prediction, and the returning branch is predictable by the branch-return optimization. Like the conditional-skip optimization described above, this feature is performed by the initial Zeus implementation and requires no specific architectural feature to access or implement.","Zeus implements two related instructions that can eliminate or reduce branch delays for conditional loops, conditional branches, and computed branches. The \u201cbranch-hint\u201d instruction has no effect on architectural state, but informs the instruction fetch unit of a potential future branch instruction, giving the addresses of both the branch instruction and of the branch target. The two forms of the instruction specify the branch instruction address relative to the current address as an immediate field, and one form (branch-hint-immediate) specifies the branch target address relative to the current address as an immediate field, and the other (branch-hint) specifies the branch target address from a general register. The branch-hint-immediate instruction is generally used to give advance notice to the instruction fetch unit of a branch-conditional instruction, so that instructions at the target of the branch can be fetched in advance of the branch-conditional instruction reaching the execution pipeline. Placing the branch hint as early as possible, and at a point where the extra instruction will not reduce the execution rate optimizes performance. In other words, an optimizing compiler should insert the branch-hint instruction as early as possible in the basic block where the parcel will contain at most one other \u201cfront-end\u201d instruction.","Additional Load and Execute Resources","Studies of the dynamic distribution of Zeus instructions on various benchmark suites indicate that the most frequently-issued instruction classes are load instructions and execute instructions. In a high-performance Zeus implementation, it is advantageous to consider execution pipelines in which the ability to target the machine resources toward issuing load and execute instructions is increased.","One of the means to increase the ability to issue execute-class instructions is to provide the means to issue two execute instructions in a single-issue string. The execution unit actually requires several distinct resources, so by partitioning these resources, the issue capability can be increased without increasing the number of functional units, other than the increased general register file read and write ports.","The partitioning in the initial implementation places all instructions that involve shifting and shuffling in one execution unit, and all instructions that involve multiplication, including fixed-point and floating-point multiply and add in another unit. Resources used for implementing add, subtract, and bitwise logical operations are duplicated, being modest in size compared to the shift and multiply units, or shared between the two units, as the operations have low-enough latency that two operations might be pipelined within a single issue cycle. These instructions must generally be independent, except perhaps that two simple add, subtract, or bitwise logical instructions may be performed dependently, if the resources for executing simple instructions are shared between the execution units.","One of the means to increase the ability to issue load-class instructions is to provide the means to issue two load instructions in a single-issue string. This would generally increase the resources required of the data fetch unit and the data cache, but a compensating solution is to steal the resources for the store instruction to execute the second load instruction. Thus, a single-issue string can then contain either two load instructions, or one load instruction and one store instruction, which uses the same general register read ports and address computation resources as the basic 5-instruction string. This capability also may be employed to provide support for unaligned load and store instructions, where a single-issue string may contain as an alternative a single unaligned load or store instruction which uses the resources of the two load-class units in concert to accomplish the unaligned memory operation.","Result Forwarding","When temporally adjacent instructions are executed by separate resources, the results of the first instruction must generally be forwarded directly to the resource used to execute the second instruction, where the result replaces a value which may have been fetched from a general register file. Such forwarding paths use significant resources. A Zeus implementation must generally provide forwarding resources so that dependencies from earlier instructions within a string are immediately forwarded to later instructions, except between a first and second execution instruction as described above. In addition, when forwarding results from the execution units back to the data fetch unit, additional delay may be incurred.","Overall Pipeline","Starting with the thread program counter, instructions are prefetched into the program microcache (PMC or A-queue), read from the program microcache (PMC), aligned into bundles of up to four instructions, and decisions are made to issue up to four instructions. Two initial instructions are sent to the address unit, and two additional instructions are sent to the execution unit queue (E-queue, or spring). The addresses from the address units are fetched from the memory system. Results from the address units or from the memory system are also placed into the E-queue. Instructions and data are read from the E-queue and issued to the execution units (G, X, E, T). Results from the address units and execution units are stored into memory.","The following sections describe the major units for the pipeline described above.","Program Microcache","The initial implementation includes a program microcache (PMC or A-queue or AQ) which holds only program code for each thread. The program microcache is flushed by reset, or by executing a B.BARRIER instruction. The program microcache is always clean, and is not snooped by writes or otherwise kept coherent, except by flushing as indicated above. The microcache is not altered by writing to the LTB or GTB, and software must execute a B.BARRIER instruction before expecting the new contents of the LTB or GTB to affect determination of PMC hit or miss status on program fetches.","In the initial implementation, the program microcache holds simple loop code. The microcache holds two separately addressed cache lines: 512 bytes or 128 instructions. Branches or execution beyond this region cause the microcache to be flushed and refilled at the new address, provided that the addresses are executable by the current thread. The program microcache uses the B.HINT and B.HINT.I to accelerate fetching of program code when possible. The program microcache generally functions as a prefetch buffer, except that short forward or backward branches within the region covered maintain the contents of the microcache.","Program fetches into the microcache are requested on any cycle in which less than two load\/store addresses are generated by the address unit, unless the microcache is already full. System arbitration logic gives program fetches lower priority than load\/store references when first presented, then equal priority if the fetch fails arbitration a certain number of times.

For cycles in which more d0\/d1 slots are available, this facility can be used to copy general registers that have A (address-unit only) status into the EQ, thus permitting more room in the EQ when otherwise more than two general registers would require copying.","Address Generation","The goal of the memory system is to provide high-bandwidth access to each of the four threads of execution for both instruction and data reads and data writes, over a wide variety of access patterns, yet consume a minimum amount of area and use a minimum of external bandwidth. To build a system that is robust in this way turns out to be surprisingly intricate. Simple designs of such a system that perform well for random access patterns tend to perform poorly for sequential access patterns, and vice-versa. The memory system design presented here employs multiple caching strategies to avoid poor performance pitfalls.","The performance of the memory system for several different patterns form a model of the combined patterns that we expect to encounter in general programs:","Instruction sequence or program code references tend to be relatively sequential and consume bandwidth at the rate of 32 bits per instruction. With a peak execution rate of four instructions per cycle, this pattern can consume as much as 128 bits per cycle. We assume that branch prediction mechanisms and prefetching allow the memory system to perform program code reads using otherwise available bandwidth. To attain an average rate of 128 bits per cycle, peak rates must sometime be well above this rate.","Sequential data reads occur frequently, using data sizes of 128 bits or less. For data sizes less than 128 bits, the LZC holds previously read hexlets of data that reduces the strain on the LOC. Note that for sequential byte reads, the LZC hits up to 15\/16 of the time, while for sequential octlet reads, the LZC hits up to \u00bd of the time, and the sequential hexlet reads, the LZC is of no use at all, except to buffer data between the LOC and the KillerBus. A particular problem of sequential references is that most exceptional conditions in the cache affect not just one reference, but several of the references that follow, when more than one cycle is required to recover.","Sequential data writes are also frequent, and the LZC is used to buffer the LOC's 128 bit reads and writes and perform byte merging. By buffering data in the LZC, a single LOC write may retire information for several sequential stores. Stores must not be committed into the memory system until all previous instructions are retired (or we know that they will be eventually retired), so the LZC plays an important role in holding store data until commitment.","Random data reads will likely miss in the LZC, and get their data from the LOC. The MTB may hit or miss\u2014a miss will require the use of more resources: the GTB, and LOC tags to resolve the reference. Making such references non-blocking with respect to the address unit allows the LOC to receive a high request rate that is essential to maintaing a high average throughput.","Random data writes require the use the LZC for byte merging and buffering. There are several independent activities that must each be completed before retiring a store, including resolving the cache status, reading surrounding bytes into the LZC, obtaining the store data itself from the address or execution unit, and retiring or clearing all previous instructions. Only then can the write of the LZC into the LOC be scheduled.","The address units of each of the four threads provide up to two global virtual addresses of load, store, or wide instructions, for a total of eight addresses. LTB units associated with each thread translate the local addresses into global addresses. The LZC operates on global addresses. MTB, BTB, and PTB units associated with each thread translate the global addresses into physical addresses and cache addresses. (A PTB unit associated with each thread produces physical addresses and cache addresses for program counter references.\u2014this is optional, as by limiting address generation to two per thread, the MTB can be used for program references.) Cache addresses are presented to the LOC as required, and physical addresses are checked against cache tags as required.","Each thread has two address generation units, capable of producing two aligned, or one unaligned load or store operation per cycle. Alternatively, these units may produce a single load or store address and a branch target address.","Each thread has a LTB, which translates the two addresses into global virtual addresses.","Each thread has a MTB, which looks up the two references into the LOC. The optional PTB provides for additional references that are program code fetches.","In parallel with the MTB, these two references are combined with the six references from the other threads and partitioned into even and odd hexlet references. Up to four references are selected for each of the even and odd portions of the LZC. One reference for each of the eight banks of the LOC (four are even hexlets; four are odd hexlets) are selected from the eight load\/store\/branch references and the PTB references.","Some references may be directed to both the LZC and LOC, in which case the LZC hit causes the LOC data to be ignored. An LZC miss which hits in the MTB is filled from the LOC to the LZC. An LZC miss which misses in the MTB causes a GTB access and LOC tag access, then an MTB fill and LOC access, then an LZC fill.","At the LOC, a number of competing references may attempt to access a single LOC cache bank, and a fair but effective arbitration scheme is required to determine which reference to select. Fairness is important so that no thread consistently receives more access to shared resources than the others. There are also constraints introduced by the bus interface (Inquiry cycles must be responded to immediately; limited FIFO space in the bus interface may require high priority to avoid FIFO overrun), and demands for optimizing forward progress (Store should have high priority to release pipeline resources, program fetch low priority to avoid delaying loads).

In addition, there are (4) external events that cause scheduling of a computational process, such as clock events or completion of a disk transfer.","Each of these types of events require the interruption of the current flow of execution, handling of the exception or event, and in some cases, descheduling of the current task and rescheduling of another. The Zeus processor provides a mechanism that is based on the multi-threaded execution model of Mach. Mach divides the well-known UNIX process model into two parts, one called a task, which encompasses the virtual memory space, file and resource state, and the other called a thread, which includes the program counter, stack space, and other general register file state. The sum of a Mach task and a Mach thread exactly equals one UNIX process, and the Mach model allows a task to be associated with several threads. On one processor at any one moment in time, at least one task with one thread is running.","In the taxonomy of events described above, the cause of the event may either be synchronous to the currently running thread, generally types , , and , or asynchronous and associated with another task and thread that is not currently running, generally type .","For these events, Zeus will suspend the currently running thread in the current task, saving a minimum of general registers, and continue execution at a new program counter. The event handler may perform some minimal computation and return, restoring the current threads' general registers, or save the remaining general registers and switch to a new task or thread context.","Facilities of the exception, memory management, and interface systems are themselves memory mapped, in order to provide for the manipulation of these facilities by high-level language, compiled code.

The Zeus processor uses a fast software-based exception handler to fill in a missing GlobalTB entry.","There are several possible ways that software may maintain page tables. For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that a virtual page table is maintained, in which 128 bit GTB values for each 4 k byte page in a linear table which is itself in virtual memory. By maintaining the page table in virtual memory, very large virtual spaces may be managed without keeping a large amount of physical memory dedicated to page tables.","Because the page table is kept in virtual memory, it is possible that a valid reference may cause a second GTBMiss exception if the virtual address that contains the page table is not present in the GTB. The processor is designed to permit a second exception to occur within an exception handler, causing a branch to the SecondException handler. However, to simplify the hardware involved, a SecondException exception saves no specific information about the exception\u2014handling depends on keeping enough relevant information in general registers to recover from the second exception.","Zeus is a multithreaded processor, which creates some special considerations in the exception handler. Unlike a single-threaded processor, it is possible that multiple threads may nearly simultaneously reference the same page and invoke two or more GTB misses, and the fully-associative construction of the GTB requires that there be no more than one matching entry for each global virtual address. Zeus provides a search-and-insert operation (GTBUpdateFill) to simplify the handling of the GTB. This operation also uses hardware GTB pointer registers to select GTB entries for replacement in FIFO priority.","A further problem is that software may need to modify the protection information contained in the GTB, such as to remove read and\/or write access to a page in order to infer which parts of memory are in use, or to remove pages from a task. These modifications may occur concurrently with the GTBMiss handler, so software must take care to properly synchronize these operations. Zeus provides a search-and-update operation (GTBUpdate) to simplify updating GTB entries.","When a large number of page table entries must be changed, noting the limited capacity of the GTB can reduce the work. Reading the GTB can be less work than matching all modified entries against the GTB contents. To facilititate this, Zeus also provides read access to the hardware GTB pointers to further permit scanning the GTB for entries which have been replaced since a previous scan. GTB pointer wraparound is also logged, so it can be determined that the entire GTB needs to be scanned if all entries have been replaced since a previous scan.","In the code below, offsets from r1 are used with the following data structure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1585","num":"1640"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00109","num":"00109"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Offset","Meaning"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u20020 . . . 15","r0 save"]},{"entry":["16 . . . 32","r1 save"]},{"entry":["32 . . . 47","r2 save"]},{"entry":["48 . . . 63","r3 save"]},{"entry":["512 . . . 527","r4 save"]},{"entry":["528 . . . 535","BasePT"]},{"entry":["536 . . . 543","GTBUpdateFill"]},{"entry":["544 . . . 559","DummyPT"]},{"entry":["560 . . . 639","available 96 bytes"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"BasePT = 512 + 16"},{"entry":"GTBUpdateFill = BasePT + 8"},{"entry":"DummyPT = GTBUpdateFill + 8"}]}}}}},"On a GTBMiss, the handler retrieves a base address for the virtual page table and constructs an index by shifting away the page offset bits of the virtual address.

The code at the start vector address is responsible for initializing these remaining system facilities, and reading further bootstrap code from an external ROM.","Power-on Reset","A reset occurs upon initial power-on. The cause of the reset is noted by initializing the Status Register and other registers to the reset values noted below.","Bus Reset","A reset occurs upon observing that the RESET signal has been at active. The cause of the reset is noted by initializing the Status Register and other registers to the reset values noted below.","Control Register Reset","A reset occurs upon writing a one to the reset bit of the Control Register. The cause of the reset is noted by initializing the Status Register and other registers to the reset values noted below.","Meltdown Detected Reset","A reset occurs if the temperature is above the threshold set by the meltdown margin field of the configuration register. The cause of the reset is noted by setting the meltdown detected bit of the Status Register.","Double Check Reset","A reset occurs if a second machine check occurs that prevents recovery from the first machine check. Specifically, the occurrence of an exception in event thread, watchdog timer error, or bus error while any machine check cause bit is still set in the Status Register results in a double machine check reset. The cause of the reset is noted by setting the double check bit of the Status Register.","Machine Check","Detected hardware errors, such as communications errors in the bus, a watchdog timeout error, or internal cache parity errors, invoke a machine check. A machine check will disable the MMU, to translate all local virtual addresses to equal physical addresses, note the cause of the exception in the Status Register, and transfer control of the all threads to the start vector address. This action is similar to that of a reset, but differs in that the configuration settings, and thread state are preserved.","Recovery from machine checks depends on the severity of the error and the potential loss of information as a direct cause of the error. The start vector address is designed to reach internal ROM memory, so that operation of machine check diagnostic and recovery code need not depend on proper operation or contents of any external device. The program counter and general register file state of the thread prior to the machine check is lost (except for the portion of the program counter saved in the Status Register), so diagnostic and recovery code must not assume that the general register file state is indicative of the prior operating state of the thread. The state of the thread is frozen similarly to that of an exception.","Machine check diagnostic code determines the cause of the machine check from the processor's Status Register, and as required, the status and other registers of external bus devices.","Recovery code will generally consume enough time that real-time interface performance targets may have been missed. Consequently, the machine check recovery software may need to repair further damage, such as interface buffer underruns and overruns as may have occurred during the intervening time.","This final recovery code, which re-initializes the state of the interface system and recovers a functional event thread state, may return to using the complete machine resources, as the condition which caused the machine check will have been resolved.","The following table lists the causes of machine check errors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1645","num":"1700"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00113","num":"00113"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Parity or uncorrectable error in on-chip cache"]},{"entry":[{},"Parity or communications error in system bus"]},{"entry":[{},"Event Thread exception"]},{"entry":[{},"Watchdog timer"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{}},"When a parity or uncorrectable error occurs in an on-chip cache, such an error is generally non-recoverable. These errors are non-recoverable because the data in such caches may reside anywhere in memory, and because the data in such caches may be the only up-to-date copy of that memory contents. Consequently, the entire contents of the memory store is lost, and the severity of the error is high enough to consider such a condition to be a system failure.","The machine check provides an opportunity to report such an error before shutting down a system for repairs.","There are specific means by which a system may recover from such an error without failure, such as by restarting from a system-level checkpoint, from which a consistent memory state can be recovered.","Parity or Communications Error in Bus","When a parity or communications error occurs in the system bus, such an error may be partially recoverable.","Bits corresponding to the affected bus operation are set in the processor's Status Register. Recovery software should determine which devices are affected, by querying the Status Register of each device on the affected MediaChannel channels.","A bus timeout may result from normal self-configuration activities.","If the error is simply a communications error, resetting appropriate devices and restarting tasks may recover from the error. Read and write transactions may have been underway at the time of a machine check and may or may not be reflected in the current system state.","If the error is from a parity error in memory, the contents of the affected area of memory is lost, and consequently the tasks associated with that memory must generally be aborted, or resumed from a task-level checkpoint. If the contents of the affected memory can be recovered from mass storage, a complete recovery is possible.","If the affected memory is that of a critical part of the operating system, such a condition is considered a system failure, unless recovery can be accomplished from a system-level checkpoint.","Watchdog Timeout Error","A watchdog timeout error indicates a general software or hardware failure. Such an error is generally treated as non-recoverable and fatal.","Event Thread Exception","When an event thread suffers an exception, the cause of the exception and a portion of the virtual address at which the exception occurred are noted in the Status Register.
