No. 10\/063,802, filed May 14, 2002, entitled \u201cMethod and System for Capturing, Managing and Disseminating Manufacturing Knowledge,\u201d which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/291,298, filed May 15, 2001, entitled \u201cA Method for Capturing, Managing, and Disseminating Manufacturing Knowledge.\u201d","Both of the above-referenced applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to extracting and managing knowledge regarding a manufacturing process, and more particularly to externalizing manufacturing strategy and know how from engineering design, analysis and manufacturing and planning systems and to integrate knowledge, standards and applications for the manufacturing process.","2. Brief Description of the Related Arts","The design of parts, tools, computer chips etc. have seen incredible advances, especially in the time it takes to go from the design phase to actually manufacturing the part or tool. This renaissance has been brought about mainly by the advent of the computer and specialized software. Conventionally, there are four important types of software programs that are used to facilitate the process from the design phase to the manufacturing phase, as shown in Prior Art .","In a design phase, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software combines the techniques of drafting and computer graphics to produce models of parts and tools to be manufactured and represents the part or tool geometry in computer language. These models can be manipulated and tested via video display screens until they incorporate the best attainable balance of features, as well as including ease of production and lower cost.","Popular CAD programs include CATIA, Unigraphics, Pro Engineer, AutoCad and Solidworks among others. The CAD program stores the shapes entered as computer files generally in a proprietary format.","A CAD system typically includes the CAD software, a high-end computer workstation, a high-quality graphics monitor, a mouse, light pen, or digitizing tablet for drawing and a printer or plotter for printing design specifications and is often coupled with Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software through shared databases. CAM systems provide the ability to convert the geometry generated by the CAD program into machining or tool path instructions to make the part on a router, milling machine, lathe or any Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC or NC) machine.","The primary function of CAM programs is the generation of machining instructions to produce parts, tools, etc., taking into account tool or part features such as shape, diameter, thickness, etc. CAM systems are offered by leading CAD vendors such as CATIA, Unigraphics, Pro-Engineer and various independent system vendors such as MasterCam, SurfCam and Gibbs among others.","CAM programs store tool path information, in a file, as a set of executable motion instructions. The format for these commands can be unique to a particular program or a universally accepted standard. The most common standard format is the APT machine tool command language. APT is a common format that can be converted into a set of unique commands used by each CNC machine. The tool path created in the CAM software package is translated into a machine specific G-Code format with the application of a post-processor. Post-processing software accepts the tool path information and allows the user to customize the tool path commands for a particular CNC controller or machine. This post-processing allows for machine specific instructions such as startup and shut down, tool changers, canned cycles or special format requirements.","Process planning systems capture high level steps necessary to create the part. This includes material information, general manufacturing processes, company standards to apply, general instructions, and quality assurance steps.","Process planning systems generally capture \u201cwhat\u201d each step is as opposed to the details of how each step is performed. For example, a typical system will call out \u201cSet up 1: Rough Part features on Datum A side\u201d. The exact instructions, such as what cutters to use, what machining strategies to implement, and the cutting computation, are not captured.","Process planning is usually performed on many different software applications of varying capability. This can be as simple as a standard word processor, an internally developed software tool, or a commercial tool such as HMS-CAPP from HMS Software Inc.","Despite the advances in CAD, CAM, NC machines and process planning systems, as described above, the traditional process still imbeds detailed manufacturing strategies within the NC program, process planning system and is also scattered among other documents, such as engineering drawings, local best practices, mental impressions, trade secrets, etc. Since this valuable knowledge on how the part or object should be optimally manufactured can only be defined within a multitude of proprietary systems, the prior art has several deficiencies in this regard, such as: a) NC programming cannot begin until CAD geometry is released; b) moving parts between suppliers requires significant rework to \u201creinvent\u201d the manufacturing strategies because there is currently no way to communicate the proven method; c) manufacturing strategy is \u201cburied\u201d in software system settings and data files which are not easily transferable between users; d) the best practices are extremely difficult to capture, share, and implement; e) ensuring standards are being adhered to is difficult; and f) controlling the quality across the NC programmer staff which is dependent solely on programming experience.","The prior art is deficient in providing a manufacturing strategy that is externalized from the multitude of manufacturing software systems and expertise that is capable of providing system manufacturing optimization, cost estimates, and tool path instruction, from among a host of functions, and is available for review, optimization, and communication concurrently with the design phase, thus allowing for more accurate cost estimates, identification of producibility issues and the quantification of each issue, the selection of manufacturing centers with capabilities necessary to optimize part manufacturing, and the implementation of automated machining instructions, that all can be generated and\/or accessed from a library of proven manufacturing strategies. The prior art is also deficient in not providing a method for outsourcing that can be controlled by providing suppliers a proven manufacturing strategy to follow.","The prior art also does not address issues regarding quality of NC programmers and other post operations and does not ensure quality control providing for \u201cbest-in-class\u201d templates to support the manufacturing process.","The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances wherein manufacturing strategy is externalized and is capable of being shared anywhere in the world independent of manufacturing systems and tools (e.g. CAM, CAPP . . . ). In the present invention, standards are automatically implemented and Numerical Control (NC) programming can begin concurrently with design before final geometry is released. The present invention also brings together and integrates \u201cbest practices\u201d into day-to-day actions in the production of a part or object. Manufacturing knowledge in the present invention is also integrated from early on in the design and can be utilized in reoccurring manufacturing procedures in the future.","By creating a meta-data file, manufacturing strategy is externalized from manufacturing systems design files and Is available for review, optimization, and communication. The present invention facilitates accurate cost estimates that can be generated using proven manufacturing strategies. The present invention further supports outsourcing, which can be controlled by providing suppliers a proven manufacturing strategy to follow. The present invention further provides quality control of NC programmers and other post operations by introducing and providing \u201cbest-in-class\u201d meta-data file templates into the manufacturing processes. By virtue of decoupling the critical data from the CAD or manufacturing systems, the externalized manufacturing strategy can be shared anywhere in the world independent of CAD or manufacturing systems or planning systems utilized in creating the initial design data files.","To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the present invention can be characterized according to one aspect of the present invention as including a method for configuring detailed manufacturing knowledge for fabricating an object, the method including the extraction of design criteria from one or more a design data files.

The overall package and concepts may have been modified by numerous vendors, incorporated in to suites and customized for third parties, yet they retain their core attributes and function substantially the same in that they assist the user in the design, analysis and manufacture of an object, part or tool.","Finite-element Analysis (FEA) is one example of a commonly used software analysis tool. It generally provides for mechanical simulation of a part or object in which the structure or part is divided into small elements with easily defined stress and deflection characteristics. It can be utilized to provide dynamic, thermal and fluid analysis.","Product data management (PDM) software and systems organize, manage and track products, drawings and design or model data via a database management system and is utilized to control information, files, documents and work processes necessary to design, manufacture, support, distribute and maintenance of a product. The information typically managed by the PDM includes, but is not limited to, design geometry, engineering drawings, project plans, part files, assembly diagrams, product specifications, NC machine-tool programs, analysis results, correspondence, bills of material (BOMs) and engineering change orders (ECOs). Essential PDM software provides the conduit for ideas, information and changes throughout supply and manufacturing chains.","Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are primarily utilized to plan and manage manufacturing operations and Supply Chain Management (SCM) systems let suppliers play a role in the manufacturing process.","One aspect of the present invention is the ability to manage the manufacturing knowledge external from typical software programs and data files and planning systems, which allows dissemination of the knowledge without requiring users to have the same underlying proprietary software system.","The MDF file can be created, matured, and released concurrent with engineering design activities to capture manufacturing requirements, material preparation activities, support producibility and costing applications. After design release, the MDF is populated with actual manufacturing elements to drive automated manufacturing and status tracking applications. The present invention is also capable of providing a vehicle for reuse of standards and distribution of proven manufacturing methods.","By capturing the manufacturing methods for a part in an independent way, new processes can be implemented to optimize internal manufacturing centers as well as in the exchange of work between suppliers, in the multi-sourcing of parts and in the integration of the supply chain.","MDF files can be populated through user interactions via a MDF Editor, which provides users with the ability to create, modify, manage, and release the MDF file by extracting data from a completed CAM NC or similar type program through a system interface. A host of system interfaces are provided by the present invention initially to meet third party needs. The present invention contemplates the addition of and the incorporation of additional system interfaces to accommodate various manufacturing systems, CAM programs and NC machines of the end user. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the system interfaces can be readily modified to keep pace with evolving technology and equipment updates by the vendor\/supplier.","The MDF further includes Internet viewing functionality that allows even the smallest vendor or manufacturer, anywhere in the world, to evaluate and implement proven manufacturing methods, standards, best practices etc.","The information managed in the MDF matures from early part design, when the information is basic manufacturing requirements and recommendations (e.g. machine envelope requirements, cutting tools recommendations, etc.) to the actual management of manufacturing center specific data (e.g. the actual machine envelope of the machine where the part is to be manufactured and the cutting tool for a specific shop by tracking number) later in the process.","The MDF file can be formatted in an XML format or HTML format or similar data structure or file that captures information and relationships between information as necessary.","A library of MDF files, in multiple file formats, can be managed to provide proven methods for manufacturing parts within a part family, category, sub-category or grouping. These proven methods can then be transferred to suppliers, anywhere in the world, and implemented in the manufacturing methods applied to build the part.","The MDF provides the basis for a series of enhanced manufacturing processes and applications. The process and applications include, among others, detailed part cost estimation (Cost Advisor), producibility feedback (Producibility Advisor), searching for the most capable suppliers (Supplier Search Advisor), concurrent and enhanced NC programming (Tool Path Advisor), and integrating manufacturing experts into an Internet community (Knowledge Associates Network).","The MDF can be integrated with CAM systems (e.g. CATIA MFGPROG, UG Manufacturing Module, etc.) and process planning systems through Application Programming Interfaces (API) to provide a complete end-to-end integrated solution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["205","210"]},"At step  the design criteria extracted in step  is further parsed to determine if the design criteria can be further reduced into simpler units such as manufacturing building modules, basic building blocks, etc. By way of analogy, this would be like taking a molecule and breaking into its constituent atoms. Therefore, in the above example the three 1\u2033H\u00d71\u2033W\u00d71\u2033D cut-outs would not be integrated together as in the conventional data file but be parsed into a single 1\u2033H\u00d71\u2033W\u00d71\u2033D cut-out being performed three times. This allows for ease of design manipulation. In the present invention if one of the cut-outs is altered only that cut-out need be modified. In the engineering designing system of the prior art the single entry for the three 1\u2033H\u00d71\u2033W\u00d71\u2033D cut-outs must be modified.","At step  it is determined if the elemental module, unit or building block is already within the database. Typically, after a period of use, the user will have built-up a library of elements, parts, tools, etc. with attendant manufacturing know how, mental impressions, and expertise in the fabrication of that part. If it is determined that the elemental module or building block is in the database then the elemental manufacturing building block is selected along with its attendant manufacturing information, step . If the elemental manufacturing building block is not found in the database, it is stored in the database and is incorporated as shown at step .","At step , depending on the outcome of the search performed at step , manufacturing knowledge, if any, is extracted from the database and at step  the design criteria, incorporating any elemental modules and manufacturing knowledge, is incorporated into the meta-data file.","The MDF is an organized and quantified collection of manufacturing \u201celements\u201d. These elements are assembled and managed in the MDF file to define the detailed manufacturing approach for metallic, plastic, ceramic or composite parts and tools. The elements are managed in such a way as to allow population of manufacturing requirements early in the designing process and then the instantiation of specific information to support the down stream manufacturing processes.","The MDF includes at least one Part Level Strategy, as shown in , or Header Section contains the general part level attributes and requirements. The Header section, not shown, contains attributes that apply to the entire MDF and manages the order and organization. The Part Level Strategy section includes, but is not limited to, attributes such as material, part type, stock type, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},"As previously stated, with the MDF of the present invention, the manufacturing strategy is externalized from the designing system and is available for review, optimization, and communication. The MDF supports accurate cost estimates that can be generated using proven manufacturing strategies. Outsourcing can be controlled by providing suppliers a proven manufacturing strategy to follow. Quality control of NC programs and other post operations can be managed by providing \u201cbest-in-class\u201d MDF templates to the manufacture of the particular object or parts.","The manufacturing strategy is externalized and can be shared anywhere in the world independent of the original authoring tools or the software packages and programs utilized by the manufacturer or supplier. In the present invention, standards are automatically implemented, thus detailed manufacturing activities such as NC programming can begin concurrently with the engineering design and before final geometry is released. By virtue of this functionality, best practices are capable of being integrated into the day-to-day operations of the manufacture. With the advent of manufacturing knowledge being integrated from early in the design phase, the best configuration of equipment, supplier and practices can be incorporated initially in to the overall design.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"A detailed description of another aspect of the present invention will be undertaken regarding the path flow and logic of the invention. The designer via part definition module  defines the preliminary definition of the part, as shown in . Depending on the design phase, this may be a simple sketch or a preliminary solid model definition. The design makes the part definition available to a manufacturing focal. In the initial analysis module  retrieves the part design. The part is either analyzed via automated part analysis module , or is completed manually by the user. A basic manufacturing approach is determined at this point, if multiple approaches are available they can be generated and explored at a later time or the user can be provided with multiple scenarios if the differences in cost and production time fall within a predetermined range range of each other.","The manufacturing focal determines whether an existing meta-data file (MDF) input exists for the manufacturing approach via module . If a MDF does exist, the MDF is retrieved by retrieval module  from a MDF library as defined by MDF library module . For instance, if the CAD design calls for the fabrication of a titanium spar with pockets on both sides, the present invention determines if it has within its database an exact match for the desired manufacturing approach or a manufacturing approach or template in close proximity to the desired manufacturing approach. In this example the database will most likely find a design for a titanium plate part with a best in class manufacturing approach for cutting titanium. The approach defines the best manufacturing practice for cutting the pockets, but does not specify the number of pockets. Based on the design, the number of pockets are entered.","In the standard CAM case, the know how associated with the cutting of the pockets has to be determined and relearned for every part. The machining instructions are also determined for each part independently and are dependant on the skills, knowledge and experience of the manufacturing focal. The conventional CAD and CAM designs do not break the design into individual elemental modules or building blocks that can be used independently of the current design. All knowledge is imbedded in the design parameters and is not easily extracted for future use.","If the library does not contain a MDF with an appropriate manufacturing approach, the producibility analyst via module , as shown in , creates a new MDF, typically starting with the closest available MDF in the library, and modifying it for the specific design.","Modules ,  and  describe the high level processes utilized to support the calculation of a cost estimate utilizing the selected MDF. Module  defines feature attributes and describes the user action of entering basic part parameters, such as material and stock type, defining part features, like pockets and holes and describing post processes-like cleaning and shot peening.","Estimating the cost of a part is performed by module , which directs the cost engine analyzing part attributes and the MDF file and utilizes a series of cost rules to calculate a cost estimate for recurring and non-recurring manufacturing activities. A detailed cost report is generated via module .","The Supplier Advisor application, as shown in , embodied in module  analyzes part manufacturing requirements defined in the MDF definition and the user entered part attribute information to: 1) determine possible suppliers with the manufacturing capabilities necessary to manufacture the part; and 2) analyze particular supplier capabilities to document possible limitations and issues. The Integrated Producer (VIP) Supplier Capability Database, defined in module , contains detailed manufacturing capabilities of suppliers, worldwide. This includes number and type of machines, post processing operations available, and machines and engineering capabilities. Module  generates a detailed supplier report based on this data.","In the Producibility Advisor application, manufacturing rules from using companies Best Practices Knowledge Base module  and from Manufacturing Knowledge Base module  along with the MDF and manufacturing attribute data are analyzed and part producibility violations, limitations and constraints are identified via modules  and . A detailed producibility report is generated and configured by module . The producibility analyst (i.e. user or designer or engineer) interacts with the designer, over the Internet or other communication network, using the Producibility Advisor, to track all issues to closure. Designer\/fabrication interaction module  describes and facilitates the interaction between the designer and producibility analyst.","In module  a determination of whether a real time collaborative review is needed. The real time collaboration is accomplished utilizing a Virtual Collocation Advisor application of module . This occurs if issues cannot be resolved through the standard producibility process or if issues require multiple parties interacting in real time. The real time collaboration session brings together all needed designers and manufacturing experts into a \u201cvirtual\u201d session to review and close producibility issues. This session integrates the cost study , producibility report , MDF, part attributes, and part geometry into a shared user session on multiple Internet, WAN, LAN, or communications network connected via computers and workstations.","If the part is released by the design group via module , the manufacturing processes will begin. If the part is still undergoing iterations by the designers, the part is analyzed by the producibility expert each time a change is identified by module , as shown in . The analysis focuses on what changed between design iterations. If a change in the part requires the manufacturing strategy to be modified, the MDF is updated as required via module . The process iterates again as required until the part design is completed and released.","Utilizing the MDF, producibility report, and part attributes, suppliers with the capabilities required to produce the part are identified in the Supplier Search Advisor application of module , as shown in  and . The VIP Suppliers Capability Database module , is used as a reference on what capabilities each supplier has available. A detailed report is generated for suppliers via module , as shown in .","Once the design company selects a supplier via module , the MDF and supporting knowledge is made available to the supplier, over the web or other global communication network, anywhere in the world.","The supplier can then access the MDF Viewer application module , to review the manufacturing strategy developed throughout the process. The MDF is then tailored for the specifics of the selected supplier in module . This is accomplished in the Tool Path Advisor application utilizing the Integrated Producers (VIP)\u2014Suppliers Capabilities Database as defined by module . Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) operations are created, in the suppliers desired CAM system software, by linking the MDF to the CAM system through Application Programming Interfaces (API) links module .","An MDF is tailor made via module  for supplier. The MDF is then utilized to create a CAD or CAM or software data file via module . The MDF is used to define the basic structure of a Build Status framework module . Each major element of manufacturing, (i.e. each NC setup, CMM operation, and post processing step) is listed and the supplier defines a planned start and end dates for each. As the manufacturing proceeds, the supplier maintains the report updating status of each of the major tasks via module . Modules  and  comprise part of the Status Tracking advisor .","At module  a determination is made whether a real-time collaboration session is required. A collaboration session via Virtual Planning module  may be set-up to resolve a particular problem, review a part design, or review status. Collaboration Advisor  and real time collaboration module  are capable of integrating a video image from the suppliers shop with all other configured part knowledge.","Once the part is completed and the manufacturing approach is proven, a determination of whether the MDF should be stored as either a new standard, variant of the standard or alternate standard in the MDF library is performed via module . In module , the manufacturing expert reviews the MDF and takes out all part specific items and stores the MDF in the MDF library module .","In the Cost Advisor application , detailed cost reports are generated for the manufacturing processes encapsulated in the MDF. The user can either start a new cost run via module , or review an existing cost run, module , as shown in . When the cost advisor is executed, the application first determines whether a link to the users Product Data Management (PDM) system module  exists. This link is capable of being accomplished by creating an XML, HTML or similar interface to the programs specific data.","If there is a link to the users PDM system, module  retrieves the cost attributes from the PDM, described in program PDM module , and is loaded into the Cost Advisor application . If no link exists, then via module , the user is prompted to enter cost attributes. These attributes include material type, stock, type, number of part produced, complexity of the part, etc.","In module , the user is then prompted to select a meta-data file (MDF) file from either the MDF library module , or from a personal or shared file module . The MDF describes the detailed manufacturing methodology to apply in the cost run. This includes the order of operations, cutting tools, feeds\/speeds, among other parameters. In module , the user is then presented with a list of post processing operations to consider. These include operations like cleaning, painting, heat treating, shoot peening, etc. The user selects the post operation type that applies and the number of operations required.","The MDF is parsed, and all referenced feature groups along with their related feature types are extracted. Based on the feature types and the corresponding manufacturing operation defined in the MDF, the user is presented a list of feature definitions to define. In module , the user enters the associated feature information such as length, width, and depths of pockets, diameter and depths of holes, and lengths, widths, depths of profiles, and etc.","The part definition, including the part features, MDF methodology, and post processing operations are analyzed via module . The feature analysis evaluates factors such as appropriate cutter selection given the feature dimensions and whether the offset values, step over, and depths of cut are appropriate. The manufacturing knowledge used in determining the possible overrides is contained in the Manufacturing Knowledge Base module .","In module , the user is presented with the current values along with the suggested overrides. The user can select none, one, many, or all of the override conditions to apply. If override values are selected, then in module , the MDF is updated with these values. The cost engine is then executed via module . The cost engine uses the MDF and feature attributes to determine the run times for each operation of the MDF. A Manufacturing Knowledge Base, as defined in module , is the repository for the run time calculation rules and methods. The costing engine also creates a detailed cost report with non-recurring and recurring costs segmented into major categories and visual pie charts.","For example, a roughing operation for a group of pockets defined in the MDF has a defined cutting tool, depth of cut, tool motion definition, feed\/speed, and entry\/exit method. Using this information along with the feature definition defining the size of the pockets, the estimated run time can be calculated by mathematically estimating the tool path motion and speed.","The cost engine also uses information about the overall size of the part, the complexity, number of features, MDF complexity, the number of operations in the MDF, and other part attribute information, to determine all other recurring and non-recurring cost estimates for the part. In module , the user can review a detailed cost report and the user has the option to begin the entire cost process again, or via module , generate a cost iteration. A cost iteration is the ability to change one or more values from the cost run and generate another report as defined by module .

The manufacturing expert enters each item into the Producibility Advisor application via module .","For each item, a \u201cnext action\u201d user is added to each item in module . This is the party that is required to continue the item. This may include the designer, another producibility expert, purchasing, or internal manufacturing experts. When this item is set, an e-mail is sent to that person requesting them to access that producibility session to resolve a producibility issue. The \u201cnext action\u201d user module  selects a link in the e-mail, and enters into the Producibility Advisor session, directly into the item in question. The user then reviews the items and develops a response.","The user has the option to close the item module . If the user does not close the item, a response to the item is generated and entered into the producibility Advisor application in module . The user also sets a new \u201cnext action\u201d participant in module . If the user decides to close the item in module , then the user can decide whether or not to enter the decision into the companies best practice knowledge base via module .","In module , the user selects whether to enter the item in the best practices knowledge base. The user employs the Producibility Advisor application  to enter a description of the issue and resolution, and select key words and attributes that will be used in future retrievals of knowledge by designers. The data item is then stored in the company's best practices knowledge base in module .","The system manages all items identified by the manufacturing producibility expert. If all items have not been closed, as determined by module , the application continues to work each item. If all items have been closed for the part, the application is complete.","When issues in a producibility session cannot be resolved in the general session, a Virtual Co-location Advisor session can be established to resolve issues with many participants in real time, co-located virtually by looking at the same information on several computers.","A Virtual Co-Location application (VCLA)  first converts all CAD system geometry, usually solid models, into what is required for the geometry viewing systems via module , as shown in . In module  the converted geometry is added to the Viewing Database module . A session is scheduled with all participants via module . The VCLA  contains scheduling tools to help participants select potential times. Every participant will either be categorized as \u201crequired\u201d, meaning the session will not occur without them, \u201cimportant\u201d, where the session can continue but every effort should be exercised to include them, or \u201coptional\u201d.","At the prescribed time, the participants log-on to the session, as provided by module . Each will have access to see the geometry, the producibility reports, and the cost sessions. These sessions can also include video. This usually occurs in cases where a part is being reviewed in a shop remotely. In module , the participants work each issue to a conclusion and the session is closed via module .","The ability to view MDFs is accomplished through a MDF viewer . The MDF viewer is Internet enabled software that can be accessed from the host website, anywhere in the world. The viewer allows review of MDF data, but not updates or changes. It is determined via module , as shown in , if the user does not have access to a MDF viewer, the user is prompted to download a version. Via module , the user accesses the host web site and downloads an appropriate viewer. The user then configures the viewer via module .","The MDF file is accessed via module . This can be as an e-mail attachment, directly from the host server, or from a flat file as define by module . The MDF values can then be reviewed via module . The user can traverse selectable fields, review order and details of the manufacturing strategy, and understand manufacturing intent. The viewer does not allow the user to make or save updates to the MDF. Access to the MDF Advisor application is required to modify MDF data.","The Tool Path Advisor application  tailors the MDF with a suppliers specific cutting tools, standards, and processes. The MDF is then integrated with the suppliers CAM or similar type system to create NC operations and tool path instructions, as shown in .","In module  the MDF file is accessed and retrieved. The MDF can be in a file format, retrieved from a PDM system, retrieved from the host server, or retrieved from a local file as defined by module . Module  determines whether a VIP  database exists and whether local standards are managed. If no VIP  database exists, then the MDF Advisor application is tailored in module . This includes defining local cutters and entering shop standard information. If an integrated VIP database exists, then the system automatically integrates shop standards into the MDF via module . Local standards and cutting tools are retrieved from the Integrated Producers (VIP)  byway of module .","The Tailored MDF is reviewed by the user in module . If the local substitution is not acceptable in module , the user can manually modify the MDF using the MDF Advisor application module .
