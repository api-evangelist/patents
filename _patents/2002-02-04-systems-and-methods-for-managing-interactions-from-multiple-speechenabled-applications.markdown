title: Systems and methods for managing interactions from multiple speech-enabled applications
abstract: Systems and methods are described for speech systems that utilize an interaction manager to manage interactions—also known as dialogues—from one or more applications. The interactions are managed properly even if multiple applications use different grammars. The interaction manager maintains an interaction list. An application wishing to utilize the speech system submits one or more interactions to the interaction manager. Interactions are normally processed in the order in which they are received. An exception to this rule is an interaction that is configured by an application to be processed immediately, which causes the interaction manager to place the interaction at the front of the interaction list of interactions. If an application has designated an interaction to interrupt a currently processing interaction, then the newly submitted application will interrupt any interaction currently being processed and, therefore, it will be processed immediately.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLE","CONCLUSION "],"p":["The systems and methods described herein relate to speech systems and speech-enabled applications that run on speech systems. More particularly, the described invention relates to managing interactions from multiple speech-enabled applications that utilize more than one grammar.","Speech systems have been incorporated into many useful applications so that users may utilize the applications without having to manually operate an input device, such as a mouse or a keyboard. Personal computer systems (desktop, laptop, handheld, etc.) and automobile systems are only two examples of systems, or platforms, that may include integrated speech recognition functions.","A single platform may have several applications executing at a given time. For example, in an automobile computer system that utilizes speech recognition software, there may be speech-enabled applications for radio operation, navigational tools, climate controls, mail, etc. Personal computers may include word processors, spreadsheets, databases and\/or other programs that utilize speech recognition. Each speech-enabled application has a grammar associated with it that is a set of commands that the application is attempting to detect at any one time.","Different applications may have different grammars. For instance, a word processing speech-enabled application may use a grammar that enables it to detect the command \u201cprint.\u201d However, an automobile speech-enabled application that controls a car radio would not have such a command. On the other hand, the car radio application may have a grammar that enables the speech system to recognize the command \u201cFM\u201d to set the radio to the FM band. The word processor would not waste overhead by including an \u201cFM\u201d command in its relevant grammar.","As the number of speech-enabled applications and grammars has increased, it has become increasingly problematic to run multiple speech-enabled applications on a single platform. Although each speech-enabled application may have its own unique grammar, certain commands may be used in more than one grammar, e.g., \u201cstop.\u201d When a speech system receives such a command, it must be able to determine which application the speaker directed the command to and which application should respond to the user.","Similarly, multiple speech-enabled applications may attempt to deliver speech feedback simultaneously. This can result in a garbled communication that a user cannot understand. Such a result renders one or more of the applications useless. Also, if speech feedback from one speech-enabled application interrupts speech feedback from another similar application, the feedback from one or both applications may not be understandable to a user.","For example, suppose a first application asks a question of the user and awaits a response. But before the user responds to the first application, a second application asks the user a question. Which application will accept the user's first answer? Will one of the applications accept an answer intended for the other application? Will either application be able to function properly with the response(s) it receives? With no control over specific interactions between the system and the user, there is no certain answer to any of these questions.","One method that has been devised to handle this problem is to create a \u2018token\u2019 that indicates which application has the right to execute at any given time. When an application is ready to execute it requests a token. When the application receives the token, the application may execute.","One of several drawbacks of such a system is that applications may crash or hang. If an application that currently holds the token crashes, then the system may not recover unless the system is prepared for application crashes. If the application hangs, then the system may never be able to regain control. Therefore, a token system is an inadequate solution to the problems encountered when attempting to execute multiple speech-enabled applications.","Another problem that is encountered by speech-enabled applications is that when a command is given to an application that is not currently running, the command simply falls on deaf ears, so to speak, and there is no response to the command. Therefore, a user must first manually or vocally launch the application, then speak the desired command for the application. This means that a user must always be aware of which applications are running and which are not, so that the user knows whether she must launch an application before issuing certain commands. For example, if an automobile driver wants to play \u201csong_A.mp3\u201d on a car radio, the driver must first issue a command or manually launch an MP3 player, then command the player to play \u201csong_A.\u201d It would be desirable to minimize the actions required to launch an application and subsequently issue a command.","Systems and methods are described for managing interactions in a speech system that utilizes more than one grammar from more than one speech-enabled application. Multiple speech-enabled applications executing on a platform typically means that the platform must recognize and prioritize different grammars. The invention described herein addresses the problem of managing and prioritizing different grammars on a single platform so that a user can understand the applications and vice-versa.","In one or more implementation, a speech system interaction manager (hereinafter, an \u201cinteraction manager\u201d) is described. An \u201cinteraction\u201d as used herein is defined as a complete exchange between a user and a speech system. The interaction manager manages interactions between multiple speech applications and a user so that (a) it is clear to the user which application the user is speaking to, and (b) it is clear to the applications which application is active.","When an application wishes to utilize a speech system, the application submits an interaction to the interaction manager. The submitted interaction is placed at the end of an interaction list containing interactions to be processed by the speech system. The only time that an interaction is placed anywhere other than at the end of the interaction list is when an application indicates in the interaction that the interaction is to be placed at the top of the interaction list, i.e., the interaction is to be processed immediately. If this is indicated, the interaction is placed at the top of the interaction list. In one implementation, this indication is made by the application designating a particular grammar to be used with the interaction that is configured to be processed immediately. This type of grammar is referred to as a global grammar.","If an interaction is added to the interaction list while another interaction is being processed, then the interaction waits until the current interaction has concluded processing unless the application specifies in the interaction that the interaction is to interrupt any interaction currently being processed. If this is so indicated, then the current interaction is interrupted so that the interrupting interaction can be processed. After the interrupting interaction is processed, the interrupted interaction may be configured to pick up where it left off, start over, re-prompt somewhere in the middle of the interaction, or cancel itself. Interaction processing then proceeds normally.","An application may also indicate that an interaction is not to be added to the interaction list if the interaction list is not empty at the time the interaction is submitted. Such an indication may be used on an interaction that pertains to time-sensitive data that may be stale if it is not processed immediately, but is not of an importance such that it should interrupt another interaction.","The interaction manager keeps applications informed as to the status of interactions belonging to the applications. For example, the interaction manager sends messages to applications, such as an interaction activated message, an interaction interrupted message, an interaction self-destructed message, an interaction re-activated message, and an interaction completed message.","The interaction manager keeps track of the interactions being processed by the speech system so that the speech system only processes one interaction at a time. In this way, the interactions are processed in an orderly manner that allows multiple applications to run concurrently on the speech system, even if the multiple applications each use a different grammar. As a result, a user can better communicate with each of the applications.","This invention concerns a speech system that is able to manage interactions from multiple speech-enabled applications to facilitate meaningful dialogue between a user and the speech system. This invention speech system may be applied to a continuous speech system as well as a discrete speech system.","Furthermore, the invention may be described herein as an automobile speech system or systems. However, the invention may also be implemented in non-automobile environments. Reference may be made to one or more of such environments. Those skilled in the art will recognize the multitude of environments in which the present invention may be implemented.","General Terms","Following is a brief description of some of the terms used herein. Some of the terms are terms of art, while others are novel and unique to the described invention. Describing the terms initially will provide proper context for the discussion of the invention, although the descriptions are not meant to limit the scope of the terms in the event that one or more of the descriptions conflict with how the terms are used in describing the invention.","Grammars","As previously stated, each speech-enabled application likely has its own specific grammar that a speech system must recognize. There are a variety of different things that applications will want to do with their grammars, such as constructing new grammars, using static grammars, enable\/disable rules or entire grammars, persist grammars, make the grammars continually available, etc. The speech system described herein exposes methods to accomplish these things and more.","Different grammars can have different attributes. A static grammar is one that will not change after being loaded and committed. A dynamic grammar, to the contrary, is a grammar that may change after a commit. Whether a grammar is static or dynamic must be known when the grammar is created or registered with the speech system. Rules may also be static or dynamic. A static rule cannot be changed after it is committed, while a dynamic rule may be changed after it is committed. A static rule can include a dynamic rule as a part of the static rule.","A grammar may, at any time, be an enabled grammar or a disabled grammar. A disabled grammar is still within the speech system, but is not being listened for by the system. An enabled grammar may also be called an active grammar; a disabled grammar may also be referred to as an inactive grammar.","Reference is made herein to transient and persistent grammars. A transient grammar is a grammar that is only active while its corresponding application is executing. When the application halts execution, i.e., shuts down, the grammar is removed from the speech system. A persistent grammar is always present in the speech system, whether the application to which the grammar belongs is present in the system. If an utterance is heard that belongs to a persistent grammar and the application is not running to handle it, the speech system launches the application.","Furthermore, reference is made herein to global and yielding grammars. A global grammar contains terms that the speech system is always listening for. Global grammars are used sparingly to avoid confusion between applications. An example of a global grammar is a \u201ccall 9-1-1\u201d command. A yielding grammar is active unless another grammar takes focus. The reason that another grammar would take focus is that a conversation unrelated to the grammar becomes active and yielding grammars outside the conversation are disabled.","Interaction","The term \u201cinteraction\u201d is used herein to refer to a complete exchange between a speech-enabled application and a user. An interaction is a context of communication that unitizes one or more elements of a dialogue exchange. For example, an application developer may want to program a speech-enabled application to alert a user with a tone, ask the user a question, and await a response from the user. The developer would likely want these three events to occur sequentially, without interruption from another application in order for the sequence to make sense to the user. In other words, the developer would not want the alert tone sounded and the question asked only to be interrupted at that point with a communication from another application. The user may then not know how or when to respond to the question. Therefore, with the present invention, the developer may include the three actions in one interaction that is submitted to a speech system for sequential execution. Only in special circumstances will an interaction be interrupted. Interactions will be discussed in greater detail below.","Conversation","A series of related interactions may be referred to herein as a \u201cconversation.\u201d A conversation is intended to execute with minimal interruptions.","Computer-Executable Instructions\/Modules","The invention is illustrated in the drawings as being implemented in a suitable computing environment. Although not required, the invention is described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, to be executed by a computing device, such as a personal computer or a hand-held computer or electronic device. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc. that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.","Exemplary Speech System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","100","106","108","110","112","114","116","100","100"]},"The speech system  includes a speech engine  having a text-to-speech (TTS) converter  and a speech recognizer (SR) . The TTS converter  and the speech recognizer  are components typically found in speech systems. The speech recognizer  is configured to receive speech input from the microphone  and the TTS converter  is configured to receive electronic data and convert the data into recognizable speech that is output by the speaker .","The speech system  also includes a speech server  that communicates with the speech engine  by way of a speech application programming interface (SAPI) . Since the speech engine  is separate from the speech server , the speech server  can operate with any number of vendor-specific speech engines via the speech API . However, such a specific configuration is not required.","The SAPI  includes a vocabulary  that is the entire set of speech commands recognizable by the speech system . It is noted that speech engine  may include the vocabulary  or a copy of the vocabulary  that is contained in the SAPI . However, the present discussion assumes the vocabulary  is included in the SAPI .","Several applications may be stored in the memory , including application_ , application_  and application_n . Depending on the components that make up the computer system , virtually any practical number of applications may be stored in the memory  for execution on the speech server . Each application \u2013 is shown including at least one control: Application_  includes a question control ; application_ includes an announcer control ; and application_n includes a command control  and a word trainer control .","Each control \u2013 uses a specific grammar: the question control  uses grammar_ ; the announcer control  uses grammar_ ; the command control  uses grammar_ ; and the word trainer control  uses grammar_ .","The controls \u2013 are designed to provide application developers a robust, reliable set of user-interface tools with which to build applications. The controls \u2013 are code modules that perform recurring functions desired by application developers. The controls \u2013 decrease the programming effort required by an original equipment manufacturer or an independent vendor to create a rich application user interface.","The question control  gives an application developer an easy way to create various system-initiated interactions, or dialogues. The announcer control  provides a developer a simple way to deliver verbal feedback to users, including short notices and long passages of text-to-speech. The command control  provides a way for applications to specify what grammar it is interested in listening to, and communicates to the applications if and when a recognition occurs. The word trainer control  provides an easy way to implement a speech-oriented word-training interaction with a user. These controls will be discussed in greater detail below.","It is noted that the speech server  and the applications \u2013 are separate processes. In most modem operating systems, each process is isolated and protected from other processes. This is to prevent one application from causing another application that is running to crash. A drawback with utilizing separate processes is that it makes sharing data between two processes difficult, which is what the speech server  needs to do in this case. Therefore, data must be marshaled between the applications \u2013 and the speech server .","There are various ways to marshal data across process boundaries and any of those ways may be used with the present invention. A common way to marshal data is with the use of a proxy and a stub object. A proxy resides in the application process space. As far as the proxy is concerned, the stub object is the remote object it calls. When an application calls some method on a proxy object, it does so internally, which is necessary to package data passed by the application into the speech server process space, the stub object receives the data and calls a target object in the speech server. However, it is noted that any method known in the art to marshal data between processes may be used.","The speech server  also includes an interaction manager  and a master grammar table . The master grammar table  contains one or more grammars that are registered with the speech server  by one or more applications. The master grammar table  and the registration of grammars will be discussed in greater detail below, with reference to .","The interaction manager  maintains an interaction list  of one or more interactions (interaction_ , interaction_ , interaction_ , interaction_n ) from one or more applications in a particular order for processing by the speech server . As previously discussed, an interaction is a logical context used by an application to communicate with a user. At any given time, there can be, at most, one active interaction between the user and an application. The interaction manager  processes the interactions \u2013 in order. Interactions can be inserted at the front of the interaction list , i.e., before interaction_ , or at the end of the interaction list , i.e., interaction_n. If an interaction is inserted at the front of the interaction list , the processing of interaction_  will be interrupted. In one implementation, the interrupting interaction will only interrupt a current interaction if the interrupting interaction is configured to take precedence over a currently executing interaction.","The interaction manager  is also configured to notify the applications \u2013 of the following transitions so that the applications \u2013 may modify the state or content of an interaction as it is processed in the interaction list : interaction activated, interaction interrupted, interaction self-destructed, interaction re-activated, and interaction completed. As a result, the applications \u2013 can be aware of the state of the speech system  at all times.","As previously noted, an interaction contains one or more elements that represent a \u201cturn\u201d of communication. A turn is a single action taken by either the system of the user during an interaction. For example, the system may announce \u201cFast or scenic route?\u201d during a turn. In response, the user may answer \u201cFast,\u201d which is the user's turn.","Exemplary Interactions",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"a ","b":["200","200","200","210","210","102","212","214","164","200","102"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["220","222","224","226","226"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"c ","b":["230","232","234","230","102"]},"There is another type of element (not shown) that may be inserted into an interaction to cause a delay, or time out, before the system processes subsequent elements. This type of element is referred to as a NULL element. A NULL element would be inserted into an interaction to allow additional time for the interaction to be processed.","Referring now back to , the interaction manager  provides for the ordering of interactions, including the elements (EC, TTS, WT, NULL, SR) discussed above. This prevents more than one application from addressing the user simultaneously. The interaction manager  processes the interactions \u2013 in the interaction list  in the order in which the interactions are sudmitted to the interaction manager  (i.e., on a first-in-first-out basis). An exception to this is that an application is provided the ability to submit an interaction directly to the beginning of the interaction list  in situations where the application considers the interaction a high priority.","Interaction Management: Methodological Implementation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["168","170","176","168"]},"At block , interaction_A  is active, while interaction_B  and interaction_C  wait in the interaction list  to be processed. At block , interaction_n  is added to the end of the interaction list . Interaction_A  continues processing at block  (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ) until it concludes. Then, interaction_B  becomes active, i.e., begins processing at block  (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ).","Interruption occurs when an application places an interaction at the beginning of the interaction list  without regard to an interaction already active there. When an interruption occurs, the active interaction is deactivated, and the interrupting interaction is activated.","Interaction Interruption: Methodological Implementation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["168","400","170","172","174","168","170","176","130","134","402","176","168","176","160","176"]},"Interaction_n  is then processed at block  (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ) until it has completed, i.e., actions related to any and all elements contained in interaction_n  have been performed. Only when interaction_n  has completed processing (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ), does interaction_A  have the capability to process again.","However, interactions submitted to the interaction list  have a self-destruct option that, when used, terminates the interaction in the event that the interaction is interrupted. In some cases, an interaction may need to self-destruct due to internal failure. In such cases, the situation is treated the same as a normal self-destruction.","At block , it is determined whether interaction_A  has set a self-destruct flag that indicates the interaction should self-destruct upon interruption. If the self-destruct flag (not shown) is set (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ), interaction_A  terminates (block ). If the self-destruction flag is not set (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ), then interaction_A  finishes processing at block .","Interactions do not have an inherent \u201cpriority.\u201d The applications only have an absolute ability to place an interaction at the front of the interaction list . Such a placement results in interruption of a current interaction being processed.","In another implementation, not shown, an interrupting interaction will not be processed until a current interaction has concluded if the current interaction will conclude in a pre-determined period of time. If the current interaction will take a longer amount of time than the pre-determined time to conclude, it is interrupted as described above.","For example, suppose that an interrupting interaction will only interrupt a current interaction if the current interaction will not complete within three seconds. If a driver is just completing a long interaction that has taken thirty seconds to process but will conclude in two seconds, it may be desirable to let the interaction finish before interrupting with, say, an engine overheating announcement. If the current interaction is not self-destructing, the driver may have to endure another thirty-two seconds of interaction that he doesn't want to hear if the current interaction is repeated after the overheating announcement concludes. This would become even more irritable if another engine overheating announcement interrupted the current interaction again and the current interaction repeated again.","Interaction Chaining: Methodological Interaction","Interactions may also be \u201cchained\u201d together by speech-enabled applications using the speech server . An application may want a certain interaction to establish a chain of interactions that constitutes a conversation. When this is the case, when an interaction concludes processing, the speech server  will wait a pre-determined grace period, or time out, before processing the next interaction in the interaction list . During the grace period, the application may submit a subsequent interaction.","An example of when interaction chaining may be used is when an automobile navigation system queries a driver for a destination. The navigation application may submit an interaction that asks for a destination state. If the state is submitted, the application may then submit an interaction that asks for a destination city. If the driver submits the city, the application may then submit an interaction that asks for the destination address.","It is easy to understand why a navigation application would not want these interactions broken up. If the interactions are separated, the driver or the speech system  may become confused as to where the other is in the dialogue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["168","130","134","170","176"]},"At block , interaction_A  is active while interaction_B  and interaction_C  are inactive and waiting in the interaction list  to be processed. After interaction_A  concludes processing at block , the interaction manager  waits for the pre-determined grace period before moving on to processing interaction_B  (block ).","At block , the application that submitted interaction_A  submits interaction_n  to be processed to complete the conversation. The submission of interaction_n  occurs before the grace period has expired. If interaction_n  is not submitted before the grace period expires, interaction_B  will begin processing.","When interaction_n  is submitted before the grace period expires (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ), interaction_n  is processed immediately at block . There are no additional interactions to be processed after interaction_n  has completed processing (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ), so interaction_B  begins processing at block . The desired result is achieved, because the complete conversation (interaction_A  and interaction_n ) was processed without separating the interactions.","Although it is not typically desired, chained interactions may be interrupted by another application. If an application submits an interaction that is flagged to be processed immediately, that interaction will be placed at the front of the interaction list , even if doing so will interrupt a conversation. This is one reason that use of the \u2018process immediately\u2019 option should be used sparingly by applications. An example of when the \u2018process immediately\u2019 option may be used is when an automobile engine is overheating. It is probably desirable to interrupt any interactions being processed to tell the driver of the situation since the situation requires immediate attention.","Chained Interaction Interruption: Methodological Implementation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["168","170","176"]},"At block , interaction_A  is active while interaction_B  and interaction_C  are inactive and waiting in the interaction list  to be processed. When interaction_A  concludes processing at block , a grace period is established at block .","If no interaction is submitted by the same application (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ), then interaction_B  is processed at block . However, in this example, interaction_n  is submitted before the grace period expires (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ). Therefore, interaction_n  begins processing at block . At block , interaction_m  is submitted and is flagged to be processed immediately, so it begins processing at block . Interaction_m  continues to be processed until it is completed (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ). When interaction_m  has concluded (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ), the interaction manager  determines if interaction_n  (which was interrupted) is set to self-destruct in the event that it is interrupted. If interaction_n  is to self-destruct (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ), then interaction_B  begins to be processed at block . If interaction_n  does not self-destruct (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ), then interaction_n  finishes processing at block .","Grace Period Interruption: Methodological Implementation","Interruptions may also occur during a grace period, because the grace period does not preclude any application from interrupting.  is a flow diagram that depicts the process that takes place when an application submits an interrupting interaction during a grace period. As before, a current state of the interaction list  is shown corresponding to the blocks of the flow diagram.","At block , interaction_A  is active while interaction_B  and interaction_C  are inactive and waiting in the interaction list  to be processed. When interaction_A  concludes processing at block , a grace period is established at block .","Before the grace period has timed out, interaction_n  interrupts and is placed at the front of the interaction list  (block ). It is noted that interaction_n  is not a part of the conversation that began with interaction_A . Interaction_n  is processed at block  for as long as the interaction needs to run (\u201cNo\u201d branch, block ). Only when interaction_n  has concluded processing (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ) will interaction_B \u2014the second interaction of the conversation\u2014be processed (block ).","Do Not Add Interaction to Non-Empty List","An application may also indicate that an interaction is not to be added to the interaction list if the interaction list is not empty at the time the interaction is submitted. One scenario in which this might be desirable is in the event that an application included a verbal clock that announced a current time every minute. If, during the time where the minute would normally be announced, another application was speaking to the user, the announcement interaction would not be added to the interaction list, because the announcement might be out of date by the time it is processed.","Another scenario might be a navigation application that announces a current location, block by block, as one drives, e.g., \u201cYou are on 1and Main\u201d . . . \u201cYou are on 2and Main,\u201d etc. It would not be desirable to add such interactions to the interaction list if the driver were speaking to another application.","Exemplary Grammar(s) & Grammar Attributes","The interaction manager  must also use specific attributes of each grammar that it processes to process grammar interactions correctly. When the speech system  is initially booted, any applications that are present at startup are registered with the master grammar table  (whether running or not) so that the speech system  is aware of each grammar that may possibly be active. Additionally, if an application launches or is added while the speech system  is running, the application will register its grammar in the master grammar table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"i":"a ","b":["800","162","800"]},"As shown in , a grammar table  for grammar_  is included in the master grammar table . Similarly, a grammar table  for grammar_ , a grammar table  for grammar_  and a grammar table  for grammar_  are included in the master grammar table . It is noted that practically any number of grammar tables may be stored in the master grammar table  between grammar table  and grammar table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"i":["b ","a"],"b":["810","802","806","810","820","822","826","828","830","832","820","832","810","810"]},"The grammar identifier  is a value that is uniquely associated with a grammar that corresponds to the grammar table . The grammar identifier  is used with interactions to identify a grammar that is associated with the grammar identifier. Including the grammar identifier  with an interaction solves a problem of latency that is inherent in the speech system . After an application submits an interaction that is placed in the interaction list  of the interaction manager , the application must wait until the interaction reaches the front of the interaction list  before it is processed. When the interaction finally reaches the front of the interaction list , the speech server  immediately knows which grammar from the master grammar table  is associated with and, therefore used with, the interaction. If the grammar identifier  were not included in the interaction, the speech server  would first have to notify the application that the interaction submitted by the application is about to be processed. Then, the speech server  would have to wait for the application to tell it which grammar to utilize. Since the grammar identifier  is included with a submitted interaction, the speech server can begin processing the interaction immediately.","The executable command  is a command (including a path if necessary) that may be used to launch an application associated with the grammar table . This allows the speech server  to launch an application with the executable command  even though the corresponding application is not loaded into the system. If the speech server  receives an indication that a recognition occurs for a particular grammar, the speech server  passes the recognition to an application that has registered the grammar if such an application is running. If, however, no application using the identified grammar is running, the speech server  launches the application and passes the recognition to the application. This solves the problem of having to first launch an application manually before it may receive a command.","The Speech","For example, suppose an automobile driver is driving down the road when she decides she wants to play an MP3 file by, say, David Bowie, on the automobile radio. Assume for this example, that the executable command  is a typical path such as \u201c\\win\\ . . . \\mp3.exe\u201d and that the recognition term  is \u201cplay mp3.\u201d","Instead of having to manually activate an MP3 player and then command it to \u201cplay David Bowie,\u201d the driver simply commands the system to \u201cplay MP3 David Bowie.\u201d Even though the MP3 player may not be running, the speech server  will recognize the command \u201cplay MP3\u201d and execute the executable command  to start the MP3 player. The grammar associated with the MP3 player (not shown) will recognize \u201cDavid Bowie\u201d and play the desired selection that is associated with that command.","The global flag  is a value that, when set, indicates that the grammar associated with the grammar table  is a global grammar that may not be interrupted by another application or the speech system  (but only the same application). If the global flag  is not set, then the grammar is a yielding grammar that can be interrupted by other applications or by the speech system . As will be discussed in greater detail below, a global grammar is always active, although parts of it may be deactivated by the application to which it corresponds.","It is noted that the global flag  may be implemented as a yielding flag (not shown) which, when set, indicates that the grammar is not a global grammar. The logic described for utilizing the global flag  would, in that case, simply be reversed.","The persistent flag  is a value that, when set, indicates that the grammar associated with the grammar table  is persistent and not transient. A persistent grammar is a grammar that is loaded by default when the speech system  is running, irrespective of the run state of its corresponding application. If the persistent flag  is set, then the grammar associated with the grammar table should not be removed from the master grammar table .","The active flag  is a value that, when set, indicates that the grammar associated with the grammar table  is currently active. When a grammar is active, the speech recognitions system  actively listens for the commands included in the grammar. When an interaction is submitted to the interaction manager , the interaction manager  indicates to the speech server  that other grammars should yield to a certain grammar if applicable. The speech server  sets the active flag  to a value that indicates the grammar associated with the grammar table  is active. Simultaneously, the interaction manager  will clear the active flag  for each yielding grammar in the master grammar table . As a result, the set of commands that the speech system  listens for is reduced.","When the yielding grammars are de-activated, i.e., the active flags are cleared, any grammar that is global (i.e., the global flag  is set) remains active. This is because a global grammar is always active. Therefore, at any given time that an application is executing, the speech system  is listening for all global grammars in the master grammar table  and one yielding grammar that is currently active (i.e., is associated with the application that is currently executing) in the master grammar table . If no application is currently executing, the speech system  listens for all grammars, whether global or yielding.","In one implementation, the speech server  does not de-activate all yielding grammars other than a grammar associated with a currently executing application unless an interaction in the interaction list  includes a method that informs the speech server  that all other yielding grammars should be de-activated. When the interaction manager  identifies such a method, the interaction manager  sends a message to the speech server  to de-activate all other yielding grammars in the master grammar table .","Finally, the static flag  is a value that, when set, indicates that the grammar associated with the grammar table  is a static grammar and, therefore, will not change after it is registered in the master grammar table .","Miscellaneous Functional Scenarios","The functional scenarios that follow are not discussed in detail with respect to the speech system , but may also be implemented with the features described above. The functional scenarios merely require that the interaction manager  be configured to handle the scenarios.","Push-to-Talk","Push-to-talk (PTT) is used to indicate that a command from the user is imminent, which allows a user to initiate a command. For example, a user may PTT and say \u201clock the doors\u201d to actuate a vehicle's door locks. A push-to-talk (PTT) event instantiated by a user interrupts any current interaction.","PTT may also be used to provide a response to a system-initiated interaction. For example, if a navigation application asks \u201cFast or scenic route,\u201d the user pushes push-to-talk and answers \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cscenic.\u201d","Barge-in","The speech server  may also be configured to allow a user to \u201cbarge in\u201d with a response. For example, if a navigation application asks \u201cFast or scenic route,\u201d the user may interrupt\u2014without PTT\u2014and answer \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cscenic.\u201d","Immediate Response to User Command","The speech server  may be configured to provide an immediate response to a user command. For example, while an automobile system is announcing a driving instruction to a driver, the driver commands the system to \u201cdisconnect.\u201d The speech server  either disconnects immediately or confirms the disconnect command by stating \u201cOK to disconnect\u201d, interrupting the original driving instruction.","Application-Aborted Interaction","The applications \u2013 may also abort an interaction in certain circumstances. For example, a navigation application needs to tell a driver that a point of interest is drawing near, but other applications are currently talking to the driver. By the time the other applications have concluded, the point of interest is passed. The navigation application aborts the announcement interaction before it begins. If the point of interest has not been passed, the announcement is made, delaying only until the other applications have concluded.","Interaction-Specific Grammar","The speech server  may also de-activate some grammars and leave active an interaction-specific grammar. For example, a navigation application asks a driver \u201cfast or scenic route.\u201d Since the interaction is expecting a specific reply for a specific grammar, the specific grammar is activated (or remains active) to give the words \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cscenic\u201d priority over other grammars. This reduces the overhead required to process the driver's response, since the speech server  does not have to listen for as many terms.","Enhanced Prompt After Interruption","The speech server  may also be configured to enhance a prompt during an interrupted conversation. If, for example, a navigation application asks for the driver's destination by stating first \u201cplease say the state.\u201d The driver responds with the destination state. The navigation application then asks \u201cplease say the city.\u201d However, during the announcement or before the driver answers with the destination city, the question is interrupted with an important announcement. After the announcement concludes, the original conversation resumes. To make up for the lost context, the speech server  is configured to revise the question to \u201cfor your destination, please say the city.\u201d By re-focusing the driver on the navigation application conversation, the driver is less likely to be confused about what the system is saying.","Speech Controls","The speech controls \u2013 are provided in the speech server  to provide timesaving tools to developers who create applications to run with the speech server . The speech controls \u2013 are computer-executable code modules that provide canned functions for developers to use for common interactions utilized in speech-enabled applications, thereby saving the developers the time and effort required to code the interaction for each use.","Question Control","The question control  gives an application developer an easy way to create various modal, system-initiated interactions, or dialogues. Such interactions are used to obtain information from a user by asking the user a question. The following scenarios exemplify common uses of the question control to obtain desirable characteristics.","User Interface Consistency: A user tries an in-car computer system in his friend's car. He then goes out to shop for a new car. He notices that although other systems sound a little different, working with their speech user interface dialogues is just the same.","Application Compatibility: A user buys a full-featured navigation system software package for her car computer. She then buys a new car of a different make. She is still able to install her navigation software in her new car and it works the same as it did in her old car.","Hardware\/Software Compatibility: A developer can design a unique speech hardware and\/or software subsystem to work in conjunction with the question control without compromising application compatibility or user interface consistency.","The question control allows flexible programming so that a variety of question scenarios can be implemented. For example, the question control may be used to ask a driver a simple question that may be answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, or a more complex question such as \u201cfast or scenic route\u201d and receive \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cscenic\u201d as appropriate answers.","The question control also allows greater flexibility by allowing the use of dynamic grammars. A question control has a grammar associated with it. In the above examples, the grammar may only consist of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d or \u201cfast\u201d or \u201cscenic.\u201d The question control can be configured by a developer or OEM to standardize behavior of certain types of questions that can't be provided with a simple list. For example, a hierarchical grammar such as a time or date grammar may be associated with a question control. Such types of grammars involve too many list choices to practically list for a user.","The question control may also be used to provide an interrupting question. For example, while a system is reading a news story via TTS, a car application asks \u201c<ding>\u2014Your gas tank is close to empty; do you want instructions to the nearest gas station?\u201d Similarly, a question programmed with the question control may be interrupted. For example, while an e-mail application is asking \u201cYou have mail; do you want to read it now?\u201d a car application announces, \u201c<ding>\u2014Your engine is overheating.\u201d","Table 1 lists question control properties and types.

The Type property ultimately determines properties used in defining the application's behavior.","INTERRUPTING PROPERTY\u2014The Interrupting property determines whether the application will interrupt other interactions in the interaction list  of the interaction manager . If the Interrupting property value is true, then the application (i.e., the question created with the question control) interrupts any other interaction in the interaction list . If the Interrupting property is false, then the application does not interrupt other interactions, but places its interactions at the end of the interaction list .","PROMPT PROPERTY\u2014The question control is able to verbally prompt a user in order to solicit a response. The Prompt property contains what is announced when the application\/question is started. The Prompt property value is interpreted according to the value of a PromptType property, which is text-to-speech or pre-recorded. If the prompt is TTS, then the prompt announces the TTS string. If the prompt is pre-recorded, then the prompt announces the contents of a file that contains the recording.","PROMPT VERBOSE PROPERTY\u2014The Prompt Verbose property is a prompt that an interaction plays if the application\/question is re-activated after it is interrupted. This property may be NULL and, if so, the interaction plays whatever is specified by the Prompt property (the prompt initially stated at the beginning of the interaction (i.e., application\/question). Similar to the Prompt property, the Prompt Verbose property includes a PromptType that may be a TTS string or a string stored in a file.","EARCON MODE PROPERTY\u2014The Earcon Mode property determines if the question control will play an audio file when the question control is activated or re-activated. The audio file played is determined by a currently selected Type property. The Type property may be \u201cAlways,\u201d \u201cAfter Interruption\u201d or \u201cNever.\u201d","If the Type property is \u201cAlways,\u201d then the audio file always plays on activation or re-activation. For example, if the audio file is a \u201cding\u201d then the \u201cding\u201d will be played when the system initiates a sole interaction or a first interaction in a conversation.","If the Type property is \u201cAfter Interruption,\u201d then the audio file is only played on re-activation. For example, if a car system asks a user \u201cFast or scenic route\u201d after first being interrupted by a global announcement, the audio file (i.e., \u201cding\u201d) sounds before the question repeats after the interruption.","If the Type property is \u201cNever,\u201d then the audio file is never played. The application may modify the Type property between \u201cAlways\u201d and \u201cNever.\u201d The \u201cNever\u201d Type property may be set by an application when the application has a special need not to play the audio file.","APPLICATION-PROVIDED GRAMMAR\u2014An application can provide the question control with a list of options from which the user may choose. For each option offered, the application may provide one or more phrases whose recognition constitutes that choice. Any choices added are in addition to any grammars implemented in the question control. For example, a navigation application may provide a list having two options, \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cscenic.\u201d If the words \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cscenic\u201d are not already included in an active grammar, then they are automatically added.","In one implementation, the question control provides a \u2018spoken choice\u2019 feature. The spoken choice feature may be used when a question is configured to have two or more possible answers for one answer choice. For example, a question may ask \u201cWhat is the current season?\u201d The answers may be \u201cSpring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.\u201d In addition, the word \u201cFall\u201d may be used instead of \u201cAutumn.\u201d The question control may be configured to respond to a user inquiry as to possible answers as including either \u201cAutumn\u201d or \u201cFall.\u201d As a result, the list choices provided to a user would be \u201cSpring, Summer, Autumn and Winter,\u201d or \u201cSpring, Summer, Fall and Winter.\u201d","Another user for the spoken choice feature is for speech systems that may mispronounce one or more words. For example, many speech systems will mispronounce Spokane, Washington as having a long \u201ca\u201d sound, since that is how phonetics rules dictate (instead of the correct short \u201ca\u201d sound). If a speech system is to announce the word \u201cSpokane\u201d to a user, the question control (or another control) can be programmed to play a designated audio file that correctly pronounces Sp\u014d-kan instead of using a standard TTS. In another implementation, the correct pronunciation may be specified as a spoken choice string, as described above.","The application's various grammars are activated in the system immediately upon starting the control. This provides for the user's ability to barge in (using push-to-talk) and respond to the question control before it is finished.","LIST CHOICES PROPERTY\u2014The List Choices property determines whether the question control will automatically TTS the list of valid choices to a user after playing the prompt. This option is particularly useful when the user is likely to be unaware of the valid responses. For example, a navigation application may ask a driver who has just entered a destination \u201cWhich route would you like to take, fast or scenic?\u201d","SELECTION FEEDBACK PROPERTY\u2014The Selection Feedback property determines if the question control will play feedback automatically when the user answers one of the application-provided or system-provided options that are enumerated by the List Choices property. If the Selection Feedback property has a value of \u201cNone,\u201d no feedback is played when the user makes a choice. If the Selection Feedback property has a value of \u201cEarcon,\u201d then a designated satisfaction earcon is played when the user makes a choice. If the Selection Feedback property has a value of \u201cEcho Choice\u201d value, then a TTS of the user's choice is played when the user makes a choice.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0163","num":"0162"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"]},"At block , the question control is launched.

The question prompt is then played at block .","The choices with which the user may respond to the question prompt may be announced for the user at block  (\u201cYes\u201d branch, block ).

Other implementations may handle the process of the control differently.","Announcer Control","The announcer control  provides a developer an easy way to deliver verbal feedback to users, including short notices and long passages of text-to-speech. The announcer control  implements a simple mechanism for playing pre-recorded speech or TTS text, and for giving a user standardized control of such playback.

The interfaces \u2013 of each object \u2013 will be discussed separately in greater detail.","The command manager object interface  has three properties: Persistence ID ; Grammar ID ; and Grammar . The Persistence ID  is used to identify the application for persistence purposes. The Persistence ID  must be unique in the system. The Persistence ID  may be blank if the associated grammar is not persistent. In one implementation, the Persistence ID  is a ProgID (Microsoft WINDOWS implementation).","The Grammar ID  is an identifier that is used by with interactions \u2013 submitted to the interaction manager .

The Grammar  property is a pointer to the Grammar Object  that is associated with the Command Control .","The command manager object interface also includes several methods: Create Grammar , Persist , Remove Grammar , Start  and Event: Recognition . Create Grammar  is a function that is used to create a new grammar object from a grammar file. A grammar file may be an XML (extended markup language) file or a compiled grammar file (.cfg) or NULL, indicating that a new grammar is to be built. Parameters for Create Grammar  include a path of a file to be opened or NULL for a new grammar (file), a value that indicates whether a grammar is static or dynamic (Load Options), a value that indicates whether a grammar is yielding or global (Context Options), and a pointer that receives the grammar object (ppGrammar).","Persist  is a method that indicates that a grammar is to be persisted. Persisted grammars recognize even if the application with which they are associated are not running. If a recognition occurs, the application is launched. Persist  includes two parameters: the grammar under which the ID should be persisted (Persistence ID); and a complete path for an executable that will handle grammar recognitions (Application Path).","Remove Grammar  is a method that removes a grammar from the speech server . If the grammar is persistent, Remove Grammar  un-persists the grammar. Start  is a method that is called to let the speech server  know that an application is ready to start handling events. Event: Recognition is a method that is called by the speech server  when a speech recognition occurs so that an appropriate application may be so notified.","A specific implementation of the command manager object interface  is shown below.
