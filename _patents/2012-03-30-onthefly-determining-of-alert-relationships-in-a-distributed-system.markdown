title: On-the-fly determining of alert relationships in a distributed system
abstract: A system provides a controller user interface control and/or display of aspects of a storage area network (SAN) and components thereof, including performance characteristics and alert relationship analyses. The controller enables determinations of alert relationships “on-the-fly” for alerts affecting and affected by multiple causes, symptoms and impacts in the SAN, including on-the-fly determinations of root causes. The on-the-fly determinations of the controller provide that the alert relationships may be determined in response to a query or request by the user without requiring the maintaining of a large stored hierarchical relationship structure of alerts.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to storage area networks and, more particularly, to the field of on-the-fly determining of alert relationships in a distributed system, such as a storage area network.","Host processor systems may store and retrieve data using storage devices (also referred to as storage arrays) containing a plurality of host interface units (host adapters), disk drives, and disk interface units (disk adapters). Such storage devices are provided, for example, by EMC Corporation of Hopkinton, Mass. and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,939 to Yanai et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,394 to Galtzur et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,147 to Vishlitzky et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,208 to Ofek, which are incorporated herein by reference. The host systems access the storage device through a plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and access control information through the channels of the storage device and the storage device provides data to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems do not address the disk drives of the storage device directly, but rather, access what appears to the host systems as a plurality of logical volumes. Different sections of the logical volumes may or may not correspond to the actual disk drives. The hosts, storage devices and\/or other elements, such as switches and\/or array components, may be provided as part of a storage area network (SAN).","Performance characteristics of the storage devices and\/or other elements of the SAN may be monitored according to different performance statistics and measures. Performance characteristics may include, for example, performance data, capacity data, and\/or discovery data, including configuration data and\/or topology data, among other characteristics. As an example, performance characteristics of input\/output (I\/O) data paths among storage devices and components may be measured and may include I\/O operations (e.g., measured in I\/Os per second and Mbs per second) initiated by a host that will result in corresponding activity in SAN fabric links, storage array ports and adapters, and storage volumes. Other characteristics may similarly be measured. Such characteristics may be significant factors in managing storage system performance, for example, in analyzing use of lowering access performance versus more expensive higher performance disk drives in a SAN, or by expanding number of SAN channels or channel capacity. Users may balance performance, capacity and costs when considering how and whether to replace and\/or modify one or more storage devices or components.","Known techniques and systems for performing root cause and impact analysis of events occurring in a system may provide automated processes for correlating the events with their root causes. Such automation techniques address issues of an outage causing a flood of alarms in a complex distributed system comprised of many (e.g., thousands) of interconnected devices. Reference is made, for example, to: U.S. Pat. No. 7,529,181 to Yardeni et al., entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Adaptive Monitoring and Management of Distributed Systems,\u201d that discloses a system for providing adaptive monitoring of detected events in a distributed system; U.S. Pat. No. 7,003,433 to Yemini et al., entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Event Correlation and Problem Reporting,\u201d that discloses a system for determining the source of a problem in a complex system of managed components based upon symptoms; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,965,845 to Ohsie et al., entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for System Management Using Codebook Correlation with Symptom Exclusion,\u201d that discloses a system for correlating events in a system and provides a mapping between each of a plurality of groups of possible symptoms and one of a plurality of likely problems in the system, all of which are assigned to EMC Corporation and are incorporated herein by reference. However, it is noted that such known techniques and systems may involve the maintaining of a large hierarchical relationship structure of alerts that may cause undesirable performance bottlenecks in some circumstances, such as in connection with the processing of updates in the distributed system.","Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a system that may be advantageously and efficiently used to determine alert relationships in a SAN, including relationships among root causes, symptoms and impacts of events on various components of the SAN.","According to the system described herein, a method for determining alert relationships in a distributed system includes receiving an alert for the distributed system.

The alert relationship path is traversed to obtain alert relationship information responsive to the query, wherein the traversing of the alert relationship path is performed on-the-fly. The alert relationship information responsive to the query is displayed. The distributed system may include a storage area network. The method may be performed using a controller having a console providing a user interface. The console may include a RESTful interface. The alert relationship information may include at least one root cause of the received alert and\/or at least one impact caused by the received alert. The alert relationship path may include at least alert beyond immediate preceding or subsequent relationship alerts of the received alert.","According further to the system described herein, a non-transitory computer readable medium stores software for determining alert relationships in a distributed system.

An RDF product produced by EMC Corporation, may be used to copy data from one storage device to another. For example, if a host writes data to a first storage device (e.g., a local storage device), it may be desirable to copy that data to a second storage device provided in a different location (e.g., a remote storage device). The RA's -are coupled to an RDF link  and are similar to the HA's -, but are used to transfer data between the storage device  and other storage devices that are also coupled to the RDF link . The storage device  may be coupled to additional RDF links (not shown) in addition to the RDF link . For further discussion of RDF and the use thereof in data recovery and storage techniques, see, for example, U.S. Pat.

The disks -may include any appropriate storage medium or mechanism, including hard disks, solid-state storage (flash memory), etc. Note that, in some embodiments, it is possible for more than one disk to be serviced by a DA and that it is possible for more than one DA to service a disk. It is noted that the term \u201cdata\u201d as used herein may be appropriately understood, in various embodiments, to refer to data files, extents, blocks, chunks and\/or other designations that indicate a unit, segment or collection of data.","The logical storage space in the storage device  that corresponds to the disks -may be subdivided into a plurality of volumes or logical devices. The logical devices may or may not correspond to the physical storage space of the disks -. Thus, for example, the disk may contain a plurality of logical devices or, alternatively, a single logical device could span both of the disks , . The hosts -may be configured to access any combination of logical devices independent of the location of the logical devices on the disks -. A device, such as a logical device described above, has a size or capacity that may be expressed in terms of device geometry. The device geometry may include device geometry parameters regarding the number of cylinders in the device, the number of heads or tracks per cylinder, and the number of blocks per track, and these parameters may be used to identify locations on a disk. Other embodiments may use different structures.","One or more internal logical data path(s) exist between the DA's -, the HA's -, the RA's -, and the memory . In some embodiments, one or more internal buses and\/or communication modules may be used. In some embodiments, the memory  may be used to facilitate data transferred between the DA's -, the HA's -and the RA's -. The memory  may contain tasks that are to be performed by one or more of the DA's -, the HA's -and the RA's -and a cache for data fetched from one or more of the disks -. Use of the memory  is further described elsewhere herein in more detail. The storage device  may be provided as a stand-alone device coupled to the hosts -as shown in  or, alternatively, the storage device  may be part of, and\/or otherwise coupled to, a storage area network (SAN) that may include a plurality of other storage devices as well as switches, routers, network connections, etc., as further discussed elsewhere herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","24","52","52","26","52","52","28","28","32","32","38","38","26"],"i":["a","c ","a","c ","a","c","a","c","a","c"]},"The diagram  also shows an optional communication module (CM)  that provides an alternative communication path between the directors -. Each of the directors -may be coupled to the CM  so that any one of the directors -may send a message and\/or data to any other one of the directors -without needing to go through the memory . The CM  may be implemented using conventional MUX\/router technology where a sending one of the directors -provides an appropriate address to cause a message and\/or data to be received by an intended receiving one of the directors -. Some or all of the functionality of the CM  may be implemented using one or more of the directors -so that, for example, the directors -may be interconnected directly with the interconnection functionality being provided on each of the directors -. In addition, a sending one of the directors -may be able to broadcast a message to all of the other directors -at the same time.","In some embodiments, one or more of the directors -may have multiple processor systems thereon and thus may be able to perform functions for multiple directors. In some instances, at least one of the directors -having multiple processor systems thereon may simultaneously perform the functions of at least two different types of directors (e.g., an HA and a DA). Furthermore, in some embodiments, at least one of the directors -having multiple processor systems thereon may simultaneously perform the functions of at least one type of director and perform other processing with the other processing system.

Thus, the system described herein may be implemented using a platform like that described in connection with  or may be implemented using a platform that is somewhat or even completely different from any particular platform described herein.","A storage area network (SAN) may be used to couple one or more host devices with one or more storage devices in a manner that allows reconfiguring connections without having to physically disconnect and reconnect cables from and to ports of the devices. A storage area network may be implemented using one or more switches to which the storage devices and the host devices are coupled. The switches may be programmed to allow connections between specific ports of devices coupled to the switches. A port that can initiate a data-path connection may be called an \u201cinitiator\u201d port while the other port may be deemed a \u201ctarget\u201d port.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["80","60","1","22","1","24","22","24","60","22","24","22","24","22","24","60","22","22","24"],"i":["a","c ","a","c","a","c","a","c ","a","c","a","c ","a ","a","a ","a ","a ","a ","a"]},"In various embodiments, the system described herein may be used in connection with performance data collection for data migration and\/or data mirroring techniques using a SAN. Data transfer among storage devices, including transfers for data migration and\/or mirroring functions, may involve various data synchronization processing and techniques to provide reliable protection copies of data among a source site and a destination site. In synchronous transfers, data may be transmitted to a remote site and an acknowledgement of a successful write is transmitted synchronously with the completion thereof. In asynchronous transfers, a data transfer process may be initiated and a data write may be acknowledged before the data is actually transferred to directors at the remote site. Asynchronous transfers may occur in connection with sites located geographically distant from each other. Asynchronous distances may be distances in which asynchronous transfers are used because synchronous transfers would take more time than is preferable or desired. Examples of data migration and mirroring products includes Symmetrix Remote Data Facility (SRDF) products from EMC Corporation.","For further discussion of techniques involving the configuration and use of storage area networks, including virtual storage area networks, reference is made, for example, to U.S. Pat.

The controller may then pop alert S from the stack, and traverse a path through tree  beginning with node S. In this example, the controller  will traverse S back through S to R to determine that R is the root cause via the S path. The controller  may determine from the RootCauseList that R has already been determined as a root cause for the alert S. If the controller  determines that there are no further alerts from the stack to be traversed, the controller may then return to the requesting user the RootCauseList alerts for S; specifically, return that R is the root cause alert for alert S. It is noted that a similar algorithm as that noted above may be applied in reverse to determine impact alerts caused by a particular alert. For example, for a received alert S, for which the user desires to know impact alerts caused thereby, the controller  may traverse the tree  in a manner similar to that noted discussed above but in a different direction (e.g., paths beginning with alerts S and S, respectively) to determine that impact alerts  and  (e.g., which may be stored in a ImpactCausedList) are caused by the alert S.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["400","100","400","400","410","410","420","430","400"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["500","502","502","504","504","506","506","506","508"]},"After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where an alert relationship path is determined for traversal. For example, to determine a root cause of a received alert, the beginning of the traversal path will be an immediately preceding cause of the received alert. In the case where there are more than one preceding causes, all but one of the causes will be temporarily suspended (e.g., pushed onto a stack and\/or other software structure for later retrieval) and the remaining cause will indicate the beginning of the path for traversal. A similar but reverse process may be used for obtaining a desired impact of a received alert. After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where the selected alert relationship path is traversed. After the step , processing proceeds to a step  where desired alert relationship information (e.g., root cause or impact) is obtained and stored.","After the step , processing proceeds to a test step  where it is determined if another path exists for received alert. For example, if the received alert was caused by two different alerts, and a first one of the causality alerts was initially used to establish the path for traversal, then the second of the causality alerts may be used to establish another path. Accordingly, if, at the test step , it is determined that another path exists then processing proceeds back to the step  to determine the (next) alert relationship path for traversal. For example, the next causality alert may be popped from the software stack where it has been temporarily stored. If, at the test step , it is determined that another path does not exist for the received alert, then processing proceeds to a step  where the obtained and stored alert relationship information is displayed using a console of a controller, for example, responsive to a user's query. After the step , processing is complete.","Various embodiments discussed herein may be combined with each other in appropriate combinations in connection with the system described herein.
