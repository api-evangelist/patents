The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating and identifying estrogen-related medical disorders such as cancer, inflammation, osteoporosis, vaginal atrophy, central nervous diseases, and cardiovascular system diseases.","The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen (TAM) is the most widely prescribed endocrine therapy for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The development of resistance to TAM, either de novo or acquired, limits its clinical effectiveness, leading to disease progression. Before the introduction of TAM, breast cancer patients received high-dose 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) or diethystilbesterol (DES) treatment. Although similar response rates were observed (9, 10), TAM treatment became the mainstay due to a lower incidence of side effects.","Protein kinase C \u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) belongs to a family of serine\/threonine protein kinases (1, 2). The expression of PKC\u03b1 is associated with disease outcome for breast cancer patients on endocrine therapy. A shorter duration of response to endocrine therapy was associated with PKC\u03b1 expression (3) and patients whose primary tumors overexpress PKC\u03b1 were more likely to experience disease recurrence when treated with TAM (4). PKC\u03b1 positivity is also associated with poor patient survival and breast cancer aggressiveness (5).","Provided herein is a method for treatment of an estrogen-related medical disorder. The method may comprise administering to a subject in need of such treatment a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"23.28mm","wi":"58.59mm","file":"US09475791-20161025-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,","wherein","Ris selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, \u2014SOR, \u2014PORR, and \u2014C(\u2550O)R;","Ris selected from the group consisting of halo and \u2014OR;","Ris selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, \u2014SOR, \u2014PORR, and \u2014C(\u2550O)R;","Ais H, alkyl, \u2014R, \u2014OR, or \u2014C(\u2550O)R;","R, R, and Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of is alkyl, cycloalkyl, and phenyl substituted with 1, 2, or 3 substituents independently selected from halo and \u2014OR;","Ris selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, \u2014SOR, \u2014PORR, and \u2014C(\u2550O)R;","R, at each occurrence, is independently selected from the group consisting of \u2014OH and alkyl; and","R, Rand Rare, at each occurrence, independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a pharmaceutically acceptable cation;","provided that the compound of formula (I) contains at least one group selected from \u2014ORand \u2014OR.","In certain embodiments, 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-hydroxyphenoxyl)benzo[b]thiophen-6-ol (HP-BTF) is excluded as a compound of formula (I).","In certain embodiments, the compound of formula (I) has formula (I-i), formula (I-ii), formula (I-iii), formula (I-iv), formula (I-v), or formula (I-vi),",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"180.00mm","wi":"65.96mm","file":"US09475791-20161025-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1","2","3","1","4","3 ","4"],"sup":["b1","b2","b3","a","x1","y1 ","z1 "]},"In certain embodiments, Ris hydrogen.","In certain embodiments, Ris halo.

In Examples below, the in vivo effects of two novel benzothiophene SERMs, BTC [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophen-6-ol] () and TTC-352 [3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxyl)benzo[b]thiophen-6-ol] () that in contrast to RAL were observed to act as estrogen agonists in T47D:A18 as reflected by proliferation and ERE-luciferase reporter assays. Remarkably, both of these SERMs were able to induce regression of TAM-resistant, hormone-independent T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 xenograft tumors in vivo, but neither compound was able to support the growth of hormone-dependent, TAM-sensitive T47D:A18\/neo tumors. Importantly, neither SERM caused any significant increase in the uterine weights of these mice. These data indicate that benzothiophene SERMs can be designed for the treatment of endocrine resistant breast cancers as they are estrogenic antitumor agents in the TAM-resistant T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 breast cancer model, are devoid of significant estrogenic action in the uterus, and are unable to support the growth of estrogen-sensitive T47D:A18 breast cancer xenografts.","Reagents.","DMSO, E2 and TAM were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo. USA). RAL (Evista\u00ae, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Ind. USA) was purchased from the University of Illinois at Chicago Hospital Pharmacy. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, Calif. USA). Tissue culture plasticware was purchased from Becton-Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, N.J. USA). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal ER\u03b1 (SP 1, Lab Vision, Thermo Scientific, Kalamazoo, Mich. USA), mouse monoclonal 3-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. USA), anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif. USA) and anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.).","Cell Culture Conditions.","Stable transfectant cell lines T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 (6) were maintained in RPMI1640 (phenol red) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing G418 (500 \u03bcg\/ml). Prior to treatment cell lines were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% 3\u00d7 dextran-coated charcoal treated FBS (E2-depleted media) for 3 days. Cell lines were routinely tested for Mycoplasm contamination (MycoAlert\u2122 Mycoplasm Detection Kit, Lonza Ltd., Rockland, Me., USA). No authentications of cell lines were preformed by the authors.","Synthesis and Oral Bioavailability of Benzothiophene SERMs.","The synthesis of BTC and HP-BTF has been previously described (12). Dansyl derivatization of BTC was employed to increase limits of detection and quantitation for LC-MS\/MS analysis of plasma samples (). Working solutions of BTC and internal standard (3-Br-BTC) were prepared by serial dilution of 1 mg\/mL acetonitrile stocks. Calibration standards were prepared by spiking BTC or 3-Br-BTC (20 ng\/mL) into blank mouse plasma to give a final concentration range of 5-100 ng\/mL (). After addition of cold acetonitrile, samples were kept at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 h, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, and supernatants were concentrated under Nstream. Resulting residues were reconstituted in 0.1 mL of 100 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH=10.5) and derivatized by addition of 0.1 mL dansyl chloride (2 mg\/mL in acetone) followed by incubation at 60\u00b0 C. for 5 min. After removal of solvent, residues were reconstituted in 0.25 mL acetonitrile\/water (1:1, v\/v) and analyzed by LC-MS\/MS.","BTC was administered in ethanol using a vehicle of propylene glycol\/carboxymethylcellulose (10 mg\/kg p.o) to ovariectomized 4-6 week old athymic mice (Harlan-Sprague-Dawley) (n=3). Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes at 20 min, 2 h, and 6 h after treatment. Plasma was separated from whole blood by centrifugation at 4\u00b0 C. Prior to analysis, plasma was spiked with internal standard and extracted 3\u00d7 with cold acetonitrile. Recovery of analyte was measured by spiking known amounts of BTC into blank plasma samples. Work up of plasma samples were identical to that described above for standard curve determination.","LC-MS\/MS analysis was performed using an API 3000 (Applied Biosystems) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with Agilent 1200 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif. USA). Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) for the dissociations of m\/z 709\u2192171 and m\/z 789\u2192171 (loss of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene) were optimized to measure dansyl-BTC and dansylBr-BTC, respectively (). Separation was performed using a Hypersil BDS C18 (2.1 mm\u00d730 mm; 3 \u03bcm) column (Thermo Quest Corporation, MA) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL\/min. The elution solvent consisted of water with 10% MeOH and 0.3% formic acid (A) and MeCN with 0.3% formic acid (B). The mobile phase was initially held at 10% B for 5 min, increased to 60% B over 1.5 min, and then increased to 90% B over 15 min, with dansyl-BTC and dansylBr-BTC eluting at 17.8 and 19.7 min, respectively ().","DNA Growth Assay.","T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells were maintained in E2-depleted media 3 days before plating in 24-well plates (15,000 cells\/well).

Treatment medium was changed every 2-3 days.","Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays.","Cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 5 \u03bcg ERE-tk-Luc plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene controlled by a triplet vitellogenin consensus ERE (13) and 1 \u03bcgpCMV \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) expressing plasmid. After 24 hours the cells were treated and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity and \u03b2-gal signals were read by a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.

Twelve-well plates were coated with 200 \u03bcL MATRIGEL\/well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Cells were suspended at 5\u00d710in 400 \u03bcL of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 and spread onto pre-gelled MATRIGEL and allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, and 360 \u03bcL of treatment media containing 40 \u03bcL MATRIGEL was then added. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 days; medium containing 10% MATRIGEL was replaced to the top of the MATRIGEL every 3 days. Colonies were stained with crystal violet on day 10 and each well was counted by light microscopy (20\u00d7).","Growth of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 and T47D:A18\/Neo Tumors In Vivo.","T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 and T47D:A18\/neo tumors were established as previously described (7). E2 was administered via silastic capsules (1.0 cm) implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae, producing a mean serum E2 level of 379.5 pg\/mL (14). BTC and TTC-352 were administered p.o. at a dose of 1.5 mg\/animal daily for 2 weeks as previously described for other SERMs (7). RAL was administered p.o. at a dose 1.5 mg\/animal daily for 2 weeks. Tumor cross-sectional area was determined weekly using Vernier calipers and calculated using the formula: length\/2\u00d7width\/2\u00d7\u03c0. Mean tumor area was plotted against time in weeks to monitor tumor growth. The mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation, and tumors and uteri were excised, cleaned of connective tissue, and immediately weighed. The Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois at Chicago approved all of the procedures involving animals.","Tumor Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy and Co-Localization Analysis.","Tumor sections (4 \u03bcm) were cut from paraffin blocks and prepared for IF staining by deparaffinization and rehydration. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating slides in Tris-EDTA (pH=9.0) buffer at 90\u00b0 C. and allowed to cool at room temperature for 45 min. Slides were blocked with antibody diluent (DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif. USA) for 20 min followed by primary antibody at 1:100 in antibody diluent for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:100 in antibody diluent for 45 min at room temperature followed by DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole[1 \u03bcg\/mL], DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif.

Confocal analysis was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Incorporated, North America, Thornwood, N.Y. USA).","Statistical Analyses.","Statistics were run using GraphPad Prism Version 5.0. Statistical analyses used were one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test where appropriate.","We have previously reported that E2 inhibits the growth of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors in vivo and inhibits colony formation in 3D MATRIGEL culture, but has no inhibitory effect in 2D culture. Conversely, the parental empty vector control T47D:A18\/neo cell line is growth stimulated by E2 in vitro and in vivo (7, 15). In an effort to find a potential alternative to E2, and to expand on positive data obtained in vivo with RAL (11), two benzothiophene SERMs were selected from a library of SERMs and screened by DNA growth assay in our 2D in vitro model. We have previously reported on examples of this library using: radioligand displacement assays; ERE-luciferase reporter assays in MCF-7 human mammary cancer cells; and alkaline phosphatase activation in Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cells (12, 16-19). In accord with previous data, both BTC and TTC-352 acted as estrogen agonists in T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells, stimulating proliferation in 2D cultures. Cells were grown in E2-free media, treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control), E2, BTC or TTC-352 and DNA content was measured as an index of proliferation. T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells proliferated in the presence of BTC and TTC-352 at all concentrations tested (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM) and maximal efficacy was similar to that of E2 (1 nM) observed in vitro (). Interestingly, only the higher concentrations of BTC (100 nM) and TTC-352 (100 nM) showed effects on the proliferation of T47D:A18\/neo cells comparable to E2 (1 nM) treatment ().","E2 inhibits T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 colony formation in MATRIGEL (15), in part recapitulating the E2 inhibitory effect on tumor establishment (7). To determine if BTC and TTC-352 similar to E2, can inhibit the growth of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 colonies in 3D culture, colony formation in MATRIGEL was examined. Cells were plated in phenol red-free MATRIGEL containing vehicle (0.1% DMSO), E2 (1 nM), BTC (100 nM), or TTC-352 (100 nM) and allowed to grow for 10 days. These concentrations were selected on the basis of proliferative effects in 2D cultures. T47D:A18\/neo colony growth was stimulated by E2, BTC, and TTC-352 treatment (), while T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 colony formation was inhibited in the presence of E2, BTC, and TTC-352 (). These results indicate that BTC and TTC-352 are estrogenic in vitro and if observations in the 3D culture are predictive of the in vivo outcome, that these SERMs inhibit the growth of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells in xenografts.","RAL is an estrogen antagonist in MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells, whereas TTC-352 is an estrogen agonist, and BTC is an estrogen agonist in MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells. Although BTC and TTC-352 are nanomolar estrogen agonists in Ishikawa cells, it should be noted that potency is three orders of magnitude below that of E2 (16-19). To fully characterize the estrogenic activity of BTC and TTC-352 in T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells, we examined transcriptional activation of ER\u03b1 using an estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase reporter construct. Following transient co-transfection of the ERE-tk-luc and pCMV\u03b2-galactosidase plasmids, cells were treated with vehicle control (0.1% DMSO), E2 (1 nM), BTC (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM), or TTC-352 (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM) 24 hours prior to determining luciferase and \u03b2-gal activities. We have previously reported that the basal ERE activity is elevated in T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells compared to the parental T47D:A18\/neo cells (6). In T47D:A18\/neo cells, BTC and TTC-352 treatment resulted in an increase in ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity at the highest concentration of 100 nM (). T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells were more sensitive than T47D:A18\/neo cells to BTC ERE-luciferase induction at 100 nM and 10 nM (). These data suggest that BTC and TTC-352 act as ER agonists in both T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cell lines in vitro, however relative to E2, BTC has enhanced potency and\/or efficacy in T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells.","In humans, the absolute bioavailability of orally administered RAL is reported as 2%, with oral clearance of 44 l\/kg\/h (20, 21). Desmethylarzoxifene (DMA) is a more potent estrogen antagonist in the breast and maintains estrogen agonist actions in bone tissues, however, it also has poor bioavailability (22). Arzoxifene was designed as a DMA prodrug to overcome the problems associated with low bioavailability (23-26). As part of a comparative study of biological activity of DMA, arzoxifene and F-DMA in juvenile female rats, metabolism was assessed by quantification of remaining drug in plasma after 3 days of drug administration: DMA was not observed above detection limits (16, 18, 19). BTC is the benzothiophene core of both DMA and RAL, whereas TTC-352 bears structural similarity with F-DMA. Study of the comparative metabolism of DMA and F-DMA suggests that BTC would have low bioavailability on account of metabolism and clearance, in contrast to TTC-352 that is predicted to be stable (18, 19, 26, 27). Therefore, plasma levels of BTC were measured after oral administration to ovariectomized athymic nude mice. Since BTC ionizes poorly by electrosparay ionization ESI-MS, a chemical derivatization method was developed using tandem mass spectroscopic MRM analysis. Drug was detected in plasma at a peak concentration of 40 ng\/mL at 30 min, which fell to 10 ng\/mL after 6 h (). Given the observation of BTC well above detection limits in mouse plasma, it was decided to compare the effects of BTC and TTC-352 with RAL and E2 in the T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 xenograft model using oral delivery.","We have recently reported that RAL treatment results in significant regression of TAM-resistant T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors. However, RAL did not produce an effect as robust as E2 on tumor regression and was unable to inhibit MATRIGEL colony formation (11). In contrast to RAL, BTC and TTC-352 are estrogens in 2D culture and like E2 have the ability to inhibit T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 colony formation in MATRIGEL (). Therefore we next examined if these compounds could initiate T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumor regression. T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells were injected into 40 athymic mice and were left untreated for seven weeks, at which time the mean tumor size was \u02dc0.5 cm(100%). At seven weeks, the mice were randomized to either continue on the untreated control arm (9 mice), received implants of an E2 capsule (9 mice), oral RAL 1.5 mg\/day (9 mice), oral BTC 1.5 mg\/day (9 mice), or oral TTC-352 1.5 mg\/day (4 mice). Following two weeks, all treatments significantly reduced tumor volume compared to non-treated controls (P<0.05). BTC treated T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors regressed by \u02dc88% to a size of \u02dc0.07 cm() at two weeks. Mice treated with TTC-352 also exhibited a decrease in tumor volume at two weeks regressing by \u02dc70% with a mean tumor volume of \u02dc0.18 cm(). The effect of BTC and HP-BTC was only surpassed by E2 treatment which resulted in \u02dc98% regression at 2 weeks. Both BTC and TTC-352 resulted in a decrease in T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumor volume that surpassed regression exhibited by RAL (\u02dc50%). Furthermore, unlike RAL, regression induced by BTC and TTC-352 was sustained for at least four weeks post-treatment ().","Regression of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors induced by both RAL and E2 is accompanied by the exit of the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) from the nucleus (11). We have previously reported the possible involvement of an extranuclear ER in E2-induced tumor regression (11, 15). Here we show that when tumors treated with BTC and TTC-352 are regressing there is an exit of ER\u03b1 from the nucleus () suggesting that the mechanism underlying regression by benzothiophene SERMs may be similar to that of E2 and RAL and involve extranuclear ER\u03b1. Together these results indicate that BTC and TTC-352, like E2, cause T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumor regression through a mechanism possibly involving extranuclear ER\u03b1.","The ER positive hormone-dependent T47D:A18\/neo empty vector control breast cancer cell line requires E2 for growth in vitro and in vivo (6, 7). Since BTC and TTC-352 treatment result in growth of T47D:A18\/neo cells in 2D culture () and in 3D MATRIGEL (), we next sought to determine if BTC and TTC-352 could sustain the growth of T47D:A18\/neo tumors in vivo. T47D:A18\/neo cells were bilaterally injected into the mammary fat pads of 20 athymic mice and divided into six treatment groups (3 non-treated control, 3 E2 capsule, 3 oral TAM 1.5 mg\/day, 3 oral RAL 1.5 mg\/day, 4 oral BTC 1.5 mg\/day, or 4 oral TTC-352 1.5 mg\/day). Following seven weeks of treatment, mice treated with E2, as expected, harbored T47D:A18\/neo tumors that reached an average size of \u02dc0.35 cm(100%), tumors treated with BTC and TTC-352, grew to an average size of \u02dc0.04 cm2 and \u02dc0.1 cm, respectively (). Although at higher concentrations, BTC and TTC-352 () stimulated the growth of T47D:A18\/neo cells in vitro, neither compound was able to significantly stimulate the growth of T47D:A18\/neo xenograft tumors in vivo. Interestingly, the dose capable of causing robust regression of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors had no effect on the growth of T47D:A18\/neo tumors in vivo. Additionally, no significant weight loss was observed over the seven week treatment period ().","E2 has a proliferative effect on the endometrium resulting in an increase in uterine weight. TAM has an estrogenic effect on endometrial growth, which leads to an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (28). In ovariectomized rats at a minimally effective dose, RAL did not increase uterine weight in contrast to E2 and TAM, and at doses up to 10 mg\/kg\/day did not increase luminal epithelial cell thickness (29-32). Mindful of the estrogen agonist actions of BTC and TTC-352 in Ishikawa cells, we sought to compare the effects of BTC and TTC-352 on uterine weight with those of RAL, TAM and E2. Following 7 weeks of treatment the uteri from ovariectomized mice in A were excised and weights determined. Interestingly, there was no significant increase in the uterine weights of mice treated with BTC or TTC-352 (). The significant proliferative actions associated with both TAM and E2 were absent from BTC and TTC-352, indicating that these SERMs deliver an improved safety profile compared to TAM and E2.","Resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer, whether de novo or acquired, is a major clinical obstacle. The use of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) or an alternative estrogen has re-emerged as a potential treatment option following exhaustive use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), antiestrogens, and aromatase inhibitors. Protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1) expression was shown to be a predictor of disease outcome for patients on endocrine therapy and may predict a positive response to an estrogenic treatment. We have previously reported that the ectopic overexpression of PKC\u03b1 in T47D:A18 breast cancer cells leads to a hormone-independent, tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant, and E2 inhibited phenotype in vivo, recapitulating observations made in the clinic. Here, using our clinically relevant T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 model, we have investigated novel benzothiophene SERMs for the treatment of TAM-resistant breast cancer. Treatment with these SERMs resulted in significant regression of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors following two weeks of treatment accompanied by translocation of ER\u03b1 to extranuclear sites. Importantly, SERM treatment did not result in growth of parental E2-dependent T47D:A18\/neo tumors, suggesting that these SERMs do not act as estrogen agonists in parental, hormone-dependent cells in vivo. Additionally, treatment with SERMs did not stimulate uterine weight gain.","Resistance to endocrine therapies is a major obstacle encountered in the clinical setting. Currently there is a lack of effective therapeutic options for women who no longer respond to conventional endocrine therapy approaches. Our findings and those of others suggest that PKC\u03b1 expression is a predictive marker of disease outcome for patients on endocrine therapy (3-5). Further its expression may predict a positive response to E2 or an E2-like compound (7). E2 has clinical efficacy (9, 10, 33, 34), but due to unfavorable side effects it is no longer used for treatment. In the present study, we sought to identify possible alternative therapeutic options for TAM-resistant breast cancers, especially those overexpressing PKC\u03b1.","We screened a number of benzothiophene analogs and based on their in vitro estrogenic activity we chose two analogs, BTC and TTC-352, for further study. In both T47D:A18\/neo and T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 cells, BTC and TTC-352 treatment led to increased proliferation and activation of ERE in vitro (). Although E2 induced the growth of hormone-dependent, TAM-sensitive, parental T47D:A18\/neo tumors in vivo, neither BTC nor TTC-352 were able to support T47D:A18\/neo tumor growth (). Interestingly, the TAM-resistant T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors that were shown previously to regress upon E2 treatment (7), also regress when treated with BTC or TTC-352 (). Similar to E2, regression is also accompanied by exit of ER\u03b1 from the nucleus to extranuclear sites () suggesting a potential role for extranuclear ER\u03b1 in BTC and TTC-352 induced tumor regression. Extranuclear ER\u03b1 non-genomic responses are generally associated with a proliferative response through activation of various signaling cascades (35-38). We have previously shown that as T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors regress in the presence of E2 there is a downregulation of the AKT pathway (15) as well as exit of ER\u03b1 from the nucleus to extranuclear sites (11), suggesting that extranuclear ER\u03b1 may have a novel anti-proliferative role in SERM induced T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumor regression. It is interesting to postulate a mechanism in which extranuclear ER\u03b1 either directly or indirectly associates with PKC\u03b1 leading to its inactivation as T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors regress. These possibilities are currently being explored in our laboratory. However, unlike E2, neither BTC nor TTC-352 treatment resulted in an increase in the uterine weights of mice () indicating that BTC and TTC-352, unlike E2, has enhanced tissue specificity.","Translocation of ER\u03b1 from the nucleus to cytoplasm is a common feature of treatments that cause regression of T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 tumors, but not those that are ineffective, i.e. TAM (11). The similarity with the diarylthiohydantoin antiandrogens (e.g. MDV3100, ARN509, RD 162) that cause a similar translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells is of interest, in particular because this feature is seen as a clinical advantage over older antiandrogens (39, 40). MDV3100 is anticipated shortly to receive approval for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. The mechanism by which these antiandrogens cause translocation have not been defined, and as for benzothiophene SERMs could include stabilization of cytoplasmic or destabilization of nuclear receptor complexes.","It is fascinating that structurally related SERMs, variously showing classical ER\u03b1 antagonist activity (RAL), or classical agonist activity (BTC, TTC-352) should elicit the same tumor regressing actions in T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 xenografts, although the failure of RAL-induced regression to persist after drug withdrawal is noted. That the estrogen agonists, BTC and TTC-352, did not stimulate growth of estrogen-sensitive T47D:A18\/neo xenografts or uterine tissues is most simply rationalized by the relatively low potency of these agonists, again indicating involvement of a pathway that is not simply classical ER\u03b1 mediated in T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 xenografts.","Recently, the use of E2 or an E2-like compound has re-emerged as a possible treatment strategy for patients exhibiting endocrine therapy resistant breast cancers (41-44). Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of E2 in this setting (33, 34). In fact, a long-term follow up study indicated a survival advantage for patients treated with the synthetic estrogen DES compared to patients treated with TAM (45). The basis for the clinical use of estrogens is supported by a number of preclinical laboratory models (7, 8, 46-52). Shim and colleagues showed that long term E2 deprived MCF-7 cells form tumors that are inhibited by E2 (52). RAL resistant MCF-7 cells undergo apoptosis following E2 exposure (48). The serial transplantation of TAM-stimulated MCF-7 tumors for 5 years also led to an E2 inhibitory phenotype (8) as well as the over-expression of PKC\u03b1 (7). The ability to predict a patient's response to therapy prior to treatment would be a very attractive clinical option. Patients presenting with tumors overexpressing PKC\u03b1 would likely benefit from an E2-like therapy, of which there are currently few options.","The results of the present study support the use of a second-line SERM with selective estrogenic effects on the breast for use in patients that no longer respond to conventional endocrine therapy and whose tumors overexpress PKC\u03b1. We have described two novel benzothiophene SERMs that cause tumor regression in the TAM-resistant T47D:A18\/PKC\u03b1 model, while having little effect on the growth of parental hormone-dependent T47D:A18\/neo tumors. As the presence of PKC\u03b1 dictated an enhanced estrogenic response to BTC and TTC-352 as well as a tumor regressing phenotype, these compounds have potential clinical value in the TAM-resistant setting. Importantly treatment with BTC and TTC-352 had minimal effects on proliferation within the uteri of mice in vivo indicating that the estrogenic effects of these agents are specific to the breast. Both BTC and TTC-352 are potential alternatives to E2 treatment and represent chemical probes and lead compounds for further optimization towards new treatment options in the management of endocrine resistant breast cancer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0261","num":"0265"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00024","num":"00024"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00024","he":"241.13mm","wi":"157.99mm","file":"US09475791-20161025-C00024.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Acetyl chloride (0.312 mmol) was added in one portion to a stirred solution of 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-hydroxyphenoxyl)benzo[b]thiophen-6-ol (BM2-153, 50 mg, 0.142 mmol) and triethylamine (0.355 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane (1 mL) at 0\u00b0 C.
