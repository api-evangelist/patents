COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LOCATE DEVICES AND MARKING DEVICES","V. COMBINED LOCATE AND MARKING DEVICE","VI. COMPUTER-GENERATED VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF LOCATE AND MARKING OPERATIONS","VII. CONCLUSION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e), of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/102,122, filed on Oct. 2, 2008, entitled \u201cCombination Locate and Marking Device With a Data Acquisition System Installed Therein, and Associated Methods,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.","Field service operations may be any operation in which companies dispatch technicians and\/or other staff to perform certain activities, for example, installations, services and\/or repairs. Field service operations may exist in various industries, examples of which include, but are not limited to, network installations, utility installations, security systems, construction, medical equipment, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and the like.","An example of a field service operation in the construction industry is a so-called \u201clocate and marking operation,\u201d also commonly referred to more simply as a \u201clocate operation\u201d (or sometimes merely as \u201ca locate\u201d). In a typical locate operation, a locate technician visits a work site in which there is a plan to disturb the ground (e.g., excavate, dig one or more holes and\/or trenches, bore, etc.) so as to determine a presence or an absence of one or more underground facilities (such as various types of utility cables and pipes) in a dig area to be excavated or disturbed at the work site. In some instances, a locate operation may be requested for a \u201cdesign\u201d project, in which there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground, but nonetheless information about a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities at a work site may be valuable to inform a planning, permitting and\/or engineering design phase of a future construction project.","In many states, an excavator who plans to disturb ground at a work site is required by law to notify any potentially affected underground facility owners prior to undertaking an excavation activity. Advanced notice of excavation activities may be provided by an excavator (or another party) by contacting a \u201cone-call center\u201d. One-call centers typically are operated by a consortium of underground facility owners for the purposes of receiving excavation notices and in turn notifying facility owners and\/or their agents of a plan to excavate. As part of an advanced notification, excavators typically provide to the one-call center various information relating to the planned activity, including a location (e.g., address) of the work site and a description of the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed at the work site.","A locate operation typically is initiated as a result of an excavator providing an excavation notice to a one-call center. An excavation notice also is commonly referred to as a \u201clocate request,\u201d and may be provided by the excavator to the one-call center via an electronic mail message, information entry via a website maintained by the one-call center, or a telephone conversation between the excavator and a human operator at the one-call center. The locate request may include an address or some other location-related information describing the geographic location of a work site at which the excavation is to be performed, as well as a description of the dig area (e.g., a text description), such as its location relative to certain landmarks and\/or its approximate dimensions, within which there is a plan to disturb the ground at the work site. One-call centers similarly may receive locate requests for design projects (for which, as discussed above, there may be no immediate plan to excavate or otherwise disturb the ground).","Once underground facilities implicated by the locate request are identified by a one-call center, the one-call center generates a \u201clocate request ticket\u201d (also known as a \u201clocate ticket,\u201d or simply a \u201cticket\u201d). The locate request ticket essentially constitutes an instruction to inspect a work site and typically identifies the work site of the proposed excavation or design and a description of the dig area, typically lists on the ticket all of the underground facilities that may be present at the work site (e.g., by providing a member code for the facility owner of an underground facility), and may also include various other information relevant to the proposed excavation or design (e.g., the name of the excavation company, a name of a property owner or party contracting the excavation company to perform the excavation, etc.). The one-call center sends the ticket to one or more underground facility owners and\/or one or more locate service providers (who may be acting as contracted agents of the facility owners) so that they can conduct a locate and marking operation to verify a presence or absence of the underground facilities in the dig area. For example, in some instances, a given underground facility owner may operate its own fleet of locate technicians, in which case the one-call center may send the ticket to the underground facility owner. In other instances, a given facility owner may contract with a locate service provider to receive locate request tickets and perform a locate and marking operation in response to received tickets on their behalf.","Upon receiving the locate request, a locate service provider or a facility owner (hereafter referred to as a \u201cticket recipient\u201d) may dispatch a locate technician to the work site of planned excavation to determine a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities in the dig area to be excavated or otherwise disturbed. A typical first step for the locate technician includes utilizing an underground facility \u201clocate device,\u201d which is an instrument or set of instruments (also referred to commonly as a \u201clocate set\u201d) for detecting facilities that are concealed in some manner, such as cables and pipes that are located underground. The locate device is employed by the technician to verify the presence or absence of underground facilities indicated in the locate request ticket as potentially present in the dig area (e.g., via the facility owner member codes listed in the ticket). This process is often referred to as a \u201clocate operation.\u201d","In one example of a locate operation, an underground facility locate device is used to detect electromagnetic fields that are generated by an applied signal provided along a length of a target facility to be identified. In this example, a locate device may include both a signal transmitter to provide the applied signal (e.g., which is coupled by the locate technician to a tracer wire disposed along a length of a facility), and a signal receiver which is generally a hand-held apparatus carried by the locate technician as the technician walks around the dig area to search for underground facilities.  illustrates a conventional locate device  (indicated by the dashed box) that includes a transmitter  and a locate receiver . The transmitter  is connected, via a connection point , to a target object (in this example, underground facility ) located in the ground . The transmitter generates the applied signal , which is coupled to the underground facility via the connection point (e.g., to a tracer wire along the facility), resulting in the generation of a magnetic field . The magnetic field in turn is detected by the locate receiver , which itself may include one or more detection antenna (not shown). The locate receiver  indicates a presence of a facility when it detects electromagnetic fields arising from the applied signal . Conversely, the absence of a signal detected by the locate receiver generally indicates the absence of the target facility.","In yet another example, a locate device employed for a locate operation may include a single instrument, similar in some respects to a conventional metal detector. In particular, such an instrument may include an oscillator to generate an alternating current that passes through a coil, which in turn produces a first magnetic field. If a piece of electrically conductive metal is in close proximity to the coil (e.g., if an underground facility having a metal component is below\/near the coil of the instrument), eddy currents are induced in the metal and the metal produces its own magnetic field, which in turn affects the first magnetic field. The instrument may include a second coil to measure changes to the first magnetic field, thereby facilitating detection of metallic objects.","In addition to the locate operation, the locate technician also generally performs a \u201cmarking operation,\u201d in which the technician marks the presence (and in some cases the absence) of a given underground facility in the dig area based on the various signals detected (or not detected) during the locate operation. For this purpose, the locate technician conventionally utilizes a \u201cmarking device\u201d to dispense a marking material on, for example, the ground, pavement, or other surface along a detected underground facility. Marking material may be any material, substance, compound, and\/or element, used or which may be used separately or in combination to mark, signify, and\/or indicate. Examples of marking materials may include, but are not limited to, paint, chalk, dye, and\/or iron. Marking devices, such as paint marking wands and\/or paint marking wheels, provide a convenient method of dispensing marking materials onto surfaces, such as onto the surface of the ground or pavement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIGS. 1B and 1C","b":["50","50","38","36","40","36","56","54","40","54"]},"In , the mechanical actuation system of the marking device  includes an actuator or mechanical trigger  proximate to the handle  that is actuated\/triggered by the technician (e.g., via pulling, depressing or squeezing with fingers\/hand). The actuator  is connected to a mechanical coupler  (e.g., a rod) disposed inside and along a length of the elongated shaft . The coupler  is in turn connected to an actuation mechanism , at the distal end of the shaft , which mechanism extends outward from the shaft in the direction of the spray nozzle . Thus, the actuator , the mechanical coupler , and the actuation mechanism  constitute the mechanical actuation system of the marking device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1C","FIG. 1B"],"b":["50","42","58","54","50","42","42","52","58","54","42"]},"In some environments, arrows, flags, darts, or other types of physical marks may be used to mark the presence or absence of an underground facility in a dig area, in addition to or as an alternative to a material applied to the ground (such as paint, chalk, dye, tape) along the path of a detected utility. The marks resulting from any of a wide variety of materials and\/or objects used to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities generally are referred to as \u201clocate marks.\u201d Often, different color materials and\/or physical objects may be used for locate marks, wherein different colors correspond to different utility types. For example, the American Public Works Association (APWA) has established a standardized color-coding system for utility identification for use by public agencies, utilities, contractors and various groups involved in ground excavation (e.g., red=electric power lines and cables; blue=portable water; orange=telecommunication lines; yellow=gas, oil, steam). In some cases, the technician also may provide one or more marks to indicate that no facility was found in the dig area (sometimes referred to as a \u201cclear\u201d).","As mentioned above, the foregoing activity of identifying and marking a presence or absence of one or more underground facilities generally is referred to for completeness as a \u201clocate and marking operation.\u201d However, in light of common parlance adopted in the construction industry, and\/or for the sake of brevity, one or both of the respective locate and marking functions may be referred to in some instances simply as a \u201clocate operation\u201d or a \u201clocate\u201d (i.e., without making any specific reference to the marking function). Accordingly, it should be appreciated that any reference in the relevant arts to the task of a locate technician simply as a \u201clocate operation\u201d or a \u201clocate\u201d does not necessarily exclude the marking portion of the overall process. At the same time, in some contexts a locate operation is identified separately from a marking operation, wherein the former relates more specifically to detection-related activities and the latter relates more specifically to marking-related activities.","Inaccurate locating and\/or marking of underground facilities can result in physical damage to the facilities, property damage, and\/or personal injury during the excavation process that, in turn, can expose a facility owner or contractor to significant legal liability. When underground facilities are damaged and\/or when property damage or personal injury results from damaging an underground facility during an excavation, the excavator may assert that the facility was not accurately located and\/or marked by a locate technician, while the locate contractor who dispatched the technician may in turn assert that the facility was indeed properly located and marked. Proving whether the underground facility was properly located and marked can be difficult after the excavation (or after some damage, e.g., a gas explosion), because in many cases the physical locate marks (e.g., the marking material or other physical marks used to mark the facility on the surface of the dig area) will have been disturbed or destroyed during the excavation process (and\/or damage resulting from excavation).","Previous efforts at documenting locate operations have focused primarily on locate devices that employ electromagnetic fields to determine the presence of an underground facility. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,973, naming inventor Alan Haddy and entitled \u201cApparatus and Method for Obtaining Geographical Positional Data for an Object Located Underground\u201d (hereafter \u201cHaddy\u201d), is directed to a locate device (i.e., a \u201clocator\u201d) that receives and stores data from a global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) to identify the position of the locate device as an underground object (e.g., a cable) is detected by the locate device. Haddy notes that by recording geographical position data relating to the detected underground object, there is no need to physically mark the location of the underground object on the ground surface, and the recorded position data may be used in the future to re-locate the underground object.","Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 7,319,387, naming inventors Willson et al. and entitled \u201cGPS Interface for Locating Device\u201d (hereafter \u201cWillson\u201d), is directed to a locate device for locating \u201cposition markers,\u201d i.e., passive antennas that reflect back RF signals and which are installed along buried utilities. In Willson, a GPS device may be communicatively coupled to the locate device, or alternatively provided as an integral part of the locate device, to store GPS coordinate data associated with position markers detected by the locate device. Electronic memory is provided in the locate device for storing a data record of the GPS coordinate data, and the data record may be uploaded to a remote computer and used to update a mapping database for utilities.","U.S. Publication No. 2006\/0282280, naming inventors Stotz et al. and entitled \u201cTicket and Data Management\u201d (hereafter \u201cStotz\u201d), also is directed to a locate device (i.e., a \u201clocator\u201d) including a GPS receiver. Upon detection of the presence of a utility line, Stotz' locate device can update ticket data with GPS coordinates for the detected utility line. Once the locate device has updated the ticket data, the reconfigured ticket data may be transmitted to a network.","U.S. Publication No. 2007\/0219722, naming inventors Sawyer, Jr. et al. and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Collecting and Updating Geographical Data\u201d (hereafter \u201cSawyer\u201d), is directed to collecting and recording data representative of the location and characteristics of utilities and infrastructure in the field for creating a grid or map. Sawyer employs a field data collection unit including a \u201clocating pole\u201d that is placed on top of or next to a utility to be identified and added to the grid or map. The locating pole includes an antenna coupled to a location determination system, such as a GPS unit, to provide longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates of the utility under or next to the end of the locating pole. The data gathered by the field data collection unit is sent to a server to provide a permanent record that may be used for damage prevention and asset management operations.","Applicants have recognized and appreciated that uncertainties which may be attendant to locate and marking operations may be significantly reduced by collecting various information particularly relating to the marking operation, and in some cases both the marking operation and the corresponding locate operation, rather than merely focusing on information relating to detection of underground facilities via a locate device. In many instances, excavators arriving to a work site have only physical locate marks on which to rely to indicate a presence or absence of underground facilities, and they are not generally privy to information that may have been collected previously during the locate operation. Accordingly, the integrity and accuracy of the physical locate marks applied during a marking operation arguably is significantly more important in connection with reducing risk of damage and\/or injury during excavation than the location of where an underground facility was detected via a locate device during a locate operation.","More specifically, Applicants have recognized and appreciated that conventional techniques for using a locate device to detect underground facilities are sometimes tentative and typically iterative in nature, and use of locate devices with GPS capabilities may result in redundant, spurious and\/or incomplete geographic location data collection. For example, during a typical locate operation, a technician attempting to locate an underground facility with a locate device often needs to sweep an appreciable area around a suspected underground facility, and make multiple passes with the locate device over the underground facility to obtain meaningful detection signals. Furthermore, the technician often needs to rely significantly on visual observations of the area, including relevant landmarks such as facility connections to buildings, transformer boxes, maintenance\/public access points, curbs, sidewalks, roadways, etc., to effectively deduce a sensible path of an underground facility to be located. The foregoing is particularly true if at some point during the locate operation the technician loses a signal from an underground facility in the process of being detected (e.g., due to a broken transmitter circuit path from a damaged tracer wire, and loss of the transmitter's applied signal). In view of the foregoing, it may be readily appreciated that collecting and logging geographic location information throughout this process may result in excessive and\/or imprecise data, or in some instances incomplete relevant data (e.g., in the case of signal loss\/broken tracer wire), from which it may be difficult to cull the data that is truly complete and representative of where the underground facility ultimately was detected.","Yet, Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting location data, such as GPS data, in connection with use of a locate device may be valuable for reasons other than marking a location of an underground facility. For example, the data may be valuable in monitoring the performance of a technician (e.g., by comparing performance to a known \u201csignature\u201d of a technician's historical performance), mapping areas of poor signal strength, or for other reasons. The data may be processed in various manners of use to various parties, depending on their particular interest in a locate operation. In addition, as described further below, the collection of GPS data with respect to both locate and marking operations, as opposed to locate operations alone, may also provide valuable insight and analysis potential with respect to various aspects (e.g., technician performance, comparison to historical data, etc.) of a locate operation.","Furthermore, Applicants have recognized and appreciated that the location at which an underground facility ultimately is detected during a locate operation is not always where the technician physically marks the ground, pavement or other surface during a marking operation; in fact, technician imprecision or negligence, as well as various ground conditions and\/or different operating conditions amongst different locate devices, may in some instances result in significant discrepancies between detected location and physical locate marks. Accordingly, having documentation (e.g., an electronic record) of where physical locate marks were actually dispensed (i.e., what an excavator encounters when arriving to a work site) is notably more relevant to the assessment of liability in the event of damage and\/or injury than where an underground facility was detected prior to marking.","Examples of marking devices configured to collect some types of information relating specifically to marking operations are provided in U.S. publication no. 2008-0228294-A1, published Sep. 18, 2008, filed Mar. 13, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method With Location and\/or Time Tracking,\u201d and U.S. publication no. 2008-0245299-A1, published Oct. 9, 2008, filed Apr. 4, 2007, and entitled \u201cMarking System and Method,\u201d both of which publications are incorporated herein by reference. These publications describe, amongst other things, collecting information relating to the geographic location, time, and\/or characteristics (e.g., color\/type) of dispensed marking material from a marking device and generating an electronic record based on this collected information. Applicants have recognized and appreciated that collecting information relating to both geographic location and color of dispensed marking material provides for automated correlation of geographic information for a locate mark to facility type (e.g., red=electric power lines and cables; blue=portable water; orange=telecommunication lines; yellow=gas, oil, steam); in contrast, in conventional locate devices equipped with GPS capabilities as discussed above, there is no apparent automated provision for readily linking GPS information for a detected facility to the type of facility detected.","In view of marking devices configured to collect information relating specifically to marking operations, Applicants have further appreciated that collecting information relating to both locate operations and corresponding marking operations further facilitates ensuring the accuracy of such operations; to this end, Applicants have recognized that various advantages may be obtained via communication and sharing of information between locate devices and marking devices, and\/or combining the respective functionalities of such devices into an integrated instrument.","In view of the foregoing, various inventive embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to systems, methods and apparatus for collecting, logging (electronically storing), formatting, processing, and\/or electronically analyzing a variety of information relating to both locate operations and marking operations. More specifically, some exemplary embodiments described herein are directed to systems, methods and apparatus for acquiring information relating to both locate operations and marking operations, generating comprehensive electronic records of the acquired information, and storing and\/or transmitting one or more electronic records for subsequent access, processing and\/or analysis.","One illustrative embodiment of the various concepts discussed herein is directed to a combined locate and marking apparatus configured to perform various functions attendant to both locate and marking operations and configured to generate electronic records of both locate information and marking information relating to these respective operations.","During and\/or following collection and\/or storage of locate information and\/or marking information, data compiled in one or more electronic records of acquired information may be accessed, processed and\/or analyzed to provide further information relating to the performance of the locate and marking operation. For example, in other embodiments disclosed herein, data from one or more electronic records of locate information and\/or marking information is processed so as to electronically render (visually recreate) various aspects of the locate and\/or marking operations (e.g., on a display device associated with the combined locate and marking apparatus or other display device).","In sum, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a combination locate and marking apparatus. The apparatus comprises an actuation mechanism to control dispensing of a marking material, at least one receiver antenna to detect a magnetic field from a target object, a memory to store processor-executable instructions, and a processor coupled to the memory and the at least one receiver antenna.

As discussed further below, the local memory may store a marking data algorithm , which may be a set of processor-executable instructions that when executed by the processor  causes the processor to control various other components of the marking device  so as to generate an electronic record  of a marking operation, which record also may be stored in the local memory  and\/or transmitted in essentially real-time (as it is being generated) or after completion of a marking operation to a remote device (e.g., remote computer ).","In one exemplary implementation, a Linux-based processing system for embedded handheld and\/or wireless devices may be employed in the marking device  to implement various components of the control electronics . For example, the Fingertip4\u2122 processing system, including a Marvell PXA270 processor and available from InHand Electronics, Inc. (www.inhandelectronics.com\/products\/fingertip4), may be used. In addition to the PXA270 processor (e.g., serving as the processor ), the Fingertip4\u2122 includes flash memory and SDRAM (e.g., serving as local memory ), multiple serial ports, a USB port, and other I\/O interfaces (e.g., to facilitate interfacing with one or more input devices and other components of the marking device), supports a variety of wired and wireless interfaces (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, Ethernet, any IEEE 802.11 interface, or any other suitable wireless interface) to facilitate implementation of the communication interface , and connects to a wide variety of LCD displays (to facilitate implementation of a user interface\/display).","Communication interface  of marking device  may be any wired and\/or wireless communication interface by which information may be exchanged between marking device  and an external or remote device, such as a remote computing device that is elsewhere in the dig area (i.e., not a part of the marking device ) or outside the dig area. For example, data that is provided by components of data acquisition system  and\/or stored in local memory  (e.g., one or more electronic records ) may be transmitted via communication interface  to a remote computer, such as remote computer , for processing. Examples of wired communication interfaces may include, but are not limited to, USB ports, RS232 connectors, RJ45 connectors, Ethernet, and any combination thereof.

The wireless interface may be capable of capturing signals that reflect a user's intent. For example, the wireless interface may include a microphone that can capture a user's intent by capturing the user's audible commands. Alternatively, the wireless interface may interact with a device that monitors a condition of the user, such as eye movement, brain activity, and\/or heart rate.","User interface  of marking device  may be any mechanism or combination of mechanisms by which a user may operate data acquisition system  and by which information that is generated by data acquisition system  may be presented to the user. For example, user interface  may include, but is not limited to, a display device (including integrated displays and external displays, such as Heads-Up Displays (HUDs)), a touch screen, one or more manual pushbuttons, a microphone to provide for audible commands, one or more light-emitting diode (LED) indicators, one or more toggle switches, a keypad, an audio output (e.g., speaker, buzzer, and alarm), and any combination thereof. In one implementation, the user interface  includes a \u201cmenu\/on\u201d button to power up the marking device and provide a menu-driven graphical user interface (GUI) displayed by the display device (e.g., menu items and\/or icons displayed on the display device) and navigated by the technician via a joystick or a set of four \u201cup\/down\/left\/right\u201d buttons, as well as a \u201cselect\/ok\u201d button to take some action pursuant to the selection of a menu item\/icon.

As another example, using an interface such as the user interface , service-related information may be input, including an identifier for the marking device used by the technician, an identifier for a technician, and\/or an identifier for the technician's employer. Alternatively, some or all of the service-related information similarly may be received via the communication interface  (and likewise some or all of the ticket information may be received via the user interface ).","The actuation system  of marking device  shown in the block diagram of  may include both electrical and mechanical elements according to various embodiments discussed in further detail below, and for purposes of illustration is shown in  as included as part of the control electronics . The actuation system  may include a mechanical and\/or electrical actuator mechanism (e.g., see the actuator  shown in ) to provide one or more signals or stimuli as an input to the actuation system . Upon receiving one or more signals or stimuli (e.g., actuation\/triggering by a locate technician or other user), the actuation system  causes marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser . In various embodiments, the actuation system  may employ any of a variety of mechanical and\/or electrical techniques (e.g., one or more switches or other circuit components, a dedicated processor or the processor  executing instructions, one or more mechanical elements, various types of transmitters and receivers, or any combination of the foregoing), as would be readily appreciated by those of skill in the relevant arts, to cause the marking dispenser  to dispense marking material in response to one or more signals or stimuli. The actuation system  also provides one or more output signals in the form of an actuation signal  to the processor  to indicate one or more actuations of the marking device, in response to which the processor  may acquire\/collect various marking information and log data into the electronic record . Additional details of exemplary actuation system implementations are provided below in connection with .","In some embodiments, the actuation system  may be configured so as not to cause marking material to be dispensed from marking dispenser  in response to one or more signals or stimuli; rather, the actuation system may merely facilitate a logging of data from one or more input devices in response to operation of an actuator\/trigger, without necessarily dispensing marking material. In some instances, this may facilitate \u201csimulation\u201d of a marking operation (i.e., simulating the dispensing of marking material) by providing an actuation signal  to the processor  indicating one or more simulated actuation events, in response to which the processor may cause the logging of various data for creating an electronic record without any marking material actually being dispensed.","Location tracking system  of marking device  constitutes another type of input device that provides marking information, and may include any device that can determine its geographical location to a certain degree of accuracy. For example, location tracking system  may include a global positioning system (GPS) receiver or a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. A GPS receiver may provide, for example, any standard format data stream, such as a National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) data stream, or other data formats. An error correction component  may be, but is not limited to, any mechanism for improving the accuracy of the geographic information provided by location tracking system ; for example, error correction component  may be an algorithm for correcting any offsets (e.g., due to local disturbances in the atmosphere) in the geo-location data of location tracking system . While shown as part of a local location tracking system of the marking device , error correction component  alternatively may reside at a remote computing device, such as remote computer . In other embodiments, location tracking system  may include any device or mechanism that may determine location by any other means, such as performing triangulation by use of cellular radiotelephone towers.","In one exemplary implementation, the location tracking system  may include an ISM300F2-C5-V0005 GPS module available from Inventek Systems, LLC of Westford, Mass. (see www.inventeksys.com\/html\/ism300f2-c5-v0005.html). The Inventek GPS module includes two UARTs (universal asynchronous receiver\/transmitter) for communication with the processor , supports both the SIRF Binary and NMEA-0183 protocols (depending on firmware selection), and has an information update rate of 5 Hz. A variety of geographic location information may be requested by the processor  and provided by the GPS module to the processor  including, but not limited to, time (coordinated universal time\u2014UTC), date, latitude, north\/south indicator, longitude, east\/west indicator, number and identification of satellites used in the position solution, number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation, azimuth and SNR values, and dilution of precision values. Accordingly, it should be appreciated that in some implementations the location tracking system  may provide a wide variety of geographic information as well as timing information (e.g., one or more time stamps) to the processor .","In another embodiment, location tracking system  may not reside locally on marking device . Instead, location tracking system  may reside on any on-site computer, which serves as a location reference point, to which the location of marking device  may be correlated by any other means, such as, but not limited to, by a triangulation technique between the on-site computer and marking device .","With respect to other input devices of the marking device  that may provide marking information, the control electronics  may also include a timing system  having an internal clock (not shown), such as a crystal oscillator device, for processor . Additionally, timing system  may include a mechanism for registering time with a certain degree of accuracy (e.g., accuracy to the minute, second, or millisecond) and may also include a mechanism for registering the calendar date. In various implementations, the timing system  may be capable of registering the time and date using its internal clock, or alternatively timing system  may receive its time and date information from the location tracking system  (e.g., a GPS system) or from an external timing system, such as a remote computer or network, via communication interface . In yet other implementations, a dedicated timing system for providing timing information to be logged in an electronic record  may be optional, and timing information for logging into an electronic record may be obtained from the location tracking system  (e.g., GPS latitude and longitude coordinates with a corresponding time stamp). Timing information may include, but is not limited to, a period of time, timestamp information, date, and\/or elapsed time.","Marking material detection mechanism  of the marking device  shown in  is another type of input device that provides marking information, and may be any mechanism or mechanisms for determining a presence or absence of a marking dispenser  in or otherwise coupled to the marking device , as well as dertermining certain attributes\/characteristics of the marking material within marking dispenser  when the dispenser is placed in or coupled to the marking device. As shown in , in some embodiments the marking material detection mechanism  may be disposed generally in an area proximate to a marking material holder  in which a marking dispenser  may be placed.","For example, in one embodiment, the marking material detection mechanism  may include one or more switch devices (e.g., a make\/break single pole\/single throw contact switch) disposed at one or more points along the marking material holder  and electrically coupled to the processor . The switch device(s) may also be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage, such that when the switch device is in a first state (e.g., closed\/making contact) the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor  (e.g., via an I\/O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to, or is periodically monitored by, the processor), and when the switch is in a second state (e.g., open\/no contact) the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor . When the marking dispenser  is present in the holder , the switch device(s) is in one of two possible states and when there is no marking dispenser the switch device(s) is in another of the two possible states (e.g., the marking dispenser, when present, may depress the switch device(s) so as to make contact and pass the ground\/DC voltage to the processor). In this manner, the marking material detection mechanism  may provide a signal to the processor indicating the presence or absence of the marking dispenser  in the marking device .","The marking material detection mechanism  also or alternatively may include a barcode reader to read barcode data from a dispenser  and\/or a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader for reading information from an RFID tag that is provided on marking dispenser . The RFID tag may include, for example, a unique serial number or universal product code (UPC) that corresponds to the brand and\/or type of marking material in marking dispenser . The type of information that may be encoded within the RFID tag on marking dispenser  may include product-specific information for the marking material, but any information of interest may be stored on an RFID tag. For example, user-specific information and\/or inventory-related information may be stored on each RFID tag for a marking dispenser  to facilitate inventory tracking of marking materials. In particular, an identifier for a technician may be stored on an RFID tag when the technician is provided with a marking dispenser , and information relating to weight, amount dispensed, and\/or amount remaining may be written to the RFID tag whenever the marking dispenser is used.","In one exemplary implementation, the marking material detection mechanism  may include a Micro RWD MIFARE-ICODE RFID reader module available from IB Technology (Eccel Technology Ltd) of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, UK (see www.ibtechnology.co.uk\/products\/icode.htm). The Micro RWD reader module includes an RS232 communication interface to facilitate communication between the processor  and the reader module (e.g., via messages sent as a string of ASCII characters), and supports both reading information from an RFID tag attached to a marking dispenser as well as writing information to an RFID tag attached to the marking dispenser. In one aspect of an exemplary implementation, an antenna constituted by one or more turns of wire (e.g., two turns of awg 26 wire, 6.5 cm in diameter, about 1 uH) is coupled to the Micro RWD reader module and disposed in the marking material holder  of the marking device  (see ), proximate to a marking dispenser  when placed in the holder , so as to capture close near field signals (e.g., from an RFID tag on the dispenser, within about 2 inches) and exclude far field signals. In another aspect, the Micro RWD reader module may be configured to read RFID tags having an ICODE SLI format (e.g., ISO 15693 ICODE SLI). In yet another aspect, an RFID tag may be affixed to an aerosol paint can serving as the marking dispenser, such that the tag conforms to a plastic cap of the paint can and is disposed at a particular location relative to a notch in the cap (e.g., 90 degrees +\/\u221215 degrees from the notch) that allows access to the spray nozzle of the can and is in a relatively predictable position substantially aligned with the antenna when the paint can is placed in the marking material holder . Examples of RFID tags suitable for this purpose are available from BCS Solutions, Inc. (see www.bcssolutions.com\/solutions\/rfid) and include, but are not limited to, the HF Bullseye Wet Inlay SLA Round .","In yet other embodiments, marking material detection mechanism  may alternatively or further be configured to detect properties of marking material as it is dispensed. For example, the marking material detection mechanism may include one or more of an optical sensor, an olfactory sensor, an auditory sensor (e.g., a microphone), a weight sensor, and any combination thereof. For example, in one embodiment an optical sensor in the marking device may be used to identify the composition and\/or type of marking material in the marking dispenser by analyzing light reflected by the material as it is dispensed. Similarly, an olfactory sensor may be used to identify one or more characteristics of the marking material based on an odor profile of the material, and an auditory sensor may be used to identify the difference between paint being sprayed from an aerosol can and aerosol without paint being sprayed from a can (e.g., as the dispenser becomes emptied of paint).","In one embodiment, information provided by one or more input devices of the marking device  (e.g., the timing system , the location tracking system , the marking material detection mechanism , the user interface , the communication interface ) is acquired and logged (stored in memory) upon actuation of the actuation system  (e.g., triggering an actuator). Some embodiments of the invention may additionally or alternatively acquire\/log information from one or more input devices at one or more times during or throughout an actuation, such as when a technician is holding a mechanical or electrical actuator for some period of time and moving to dispense marking material in a line (e.g., see ). In various aspects of such embodiments, marking information derived from one or more input devices may be collected at a start time of an actuation, at one or more times during an actuation, and in some cases at regular intervals during an actuation (e.g., several times per second, once per second, once every few seconds). Further, some marking information may be collected at an end of an actuation, such as time information that may indicate a duration of an actuation.","Additionally, it should be appreciated that while some marking information may be received via one or more input devices at the start of each marking operation and upon successive actuations of the marking device, in other cases some marking information may be collected by or provided to the marking device once, prior to a marking operation (e.g., on power-up or reset of the marking device, as part of an electronic instruction or dispatch by a locate company, and\/or in response to a request\/query from a locate technician), and stored in local memory  for later incorporation into an electronic record. For example, prior to a given marking operation and one or more actuations of the marking device, ticket information and\/or service-related information may have already been received (e.g., via the communication) interface  and\/or user interface ) and stored in local memory . Upon generation of an electronic record of a given marking operation, information previously received via the interface(s) may be retrieved from the local memory (if stored there initially) and entered into an electronic record, in some case together with information collected pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device. Alternatively, ticket information and\/or service-related information may be received via the interface(s) and stored in an entry in the electronic record  \u201cdirectly\u201d in response to one or more actuations of the marking device (e.g., without being first stored in local memory).","In sum, according to embodiments of the present invention, various marking information from one or more input devices, regardless of how or when it is received, may be stored in an electronic record of a marking operation, in which at least some of the marking information is logged pursuant to one or more actuations of the marking device.","In one embodiment, the optional remote computer  of the data acquisition system  may be a centralized computer, such as a central server of an underground facility locate service provider. In another embodiment, remote computer  may be a computer that is at or near the work site (i.e., \u201con-site\u201d), e.g., a computer that is present in a locate technician's vehicle.","Whether resident and\/or executed on either the marking device  or the remote computer , as noted above the marking data algorithm  includes a set of processor-executable instructions (e.g., stored in memory, such as local memory  of the marking device) that, when executed by processor  of the marking device  or another processor, processes information (e.g., various marking information) collected in response to (e.g., during) one or more actuations of the marking device , and\/or in some cases before or after a given actuation or series of actuations. As also discussed above, according to various embodiments the actuations of marking device  may effect both dispensing marking material and logging of marking information, or merely logging of marking information for other purposes (e.g., simulating the dispensing of marking material) without dispensing marking material. In either situation, marking data algorithm , when executed by the processor , may cause the processor to perform collection, logging\/storage (creation of electronic records), and in some instances further processing and analysis of various marking information with respect to marking device actuations. For example, as discussed in further detail below in connection with , the operations of marking data algorithm  as effected by the processor  may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n","It should also be appreciated that the marking data algorithm  may include one or more adjustable parameters that govern various aspects of the collection and logging of marking information (e.g., the rate at which various marking information is collected from one or more input devices), and that these parameters may be adjusted or set, for example, by an administrator at a remote computer, after which the marking data algorithm is downloaded to the marking device for execution by the processor . Alternatively, in other implementations, adjustable parameters of a marking data algorithm already resident on a marking device may in some cases be adjusted remotely via the communication interface, or locally via the user interface.","While the functionality of various components of the marking device  was discussed above in connection with ,  shows some structural aspects of the marking device  according to one embodiment. For example, the marking device  may include an elongated housing  in which is disposed one or more elements of the actuation system , one or more elements of the control electronics  and the power source . Elongated housing  may be hollow or may contain certain cavities or molded compartments for installing any components therein, such as the various components of marking device  that are shown in . The elongated housing  and other structural elements associated with the housing, as discussed below, may be formed of any rigid, semi-rigid, strong, and lightweight material, such as, but not limited to, molded plastic and aluminum.","Incorporated at a proximal end of elongated housing  may be a handle , which provides a convenient grip by which the user (e.g., the locate technician) may carry the marking device  during use (i.e., the exemplary marking device depicted in  is intended to be a hand-held device). In one implementation, the power source  may be provided in the form of a removable battery pack housing one or more rechargeable batteries that are connected in series or parallel in order to provide a DC voltage to marking device , and disposed within a compartment in the handle . Such an arrangement facilitates use of conventional removable\/rechargeable battery packs often employed in a variety of cordless power tools, in which the battery pack similarly is situated in a handle of the tool. It should be appreciated, however, that the power source  in the form of a battery pack may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .","As also shown in , mounted near handle  is user interface , which may include a display . The display  may be a touch screen display to facilitate interaction with a user\/technician, and\/or the user interface also may include one or more buttons, switches, joysticks, a keyboard, and the like to facilitate entry of information by a user\/technician. One or more elements of the control electronics  (e.g., the processor , memory , communication interface , and timing system ) also may be located in the proximal end of the elongated housing in the vicinity of the user interface  and display . As with the power source , it should be appreciated that one or more elements of the control electronics  may be disposed in any of a variety of locations within or coupled to the elongated housing .","In the embodiment of , the location tracking system  similarly may be positioned on the proximal end of the elongated housing  to facilitate substantially unobstructed exposure to the atmosphere; in particular, as illustrated in , the location tracking system  may be situated on an a ground plane  (providing an electrical ground at least at the antenna frequency of the location tracking system, e.g., at approximately 1.5 GHz) that extends from the proximal end of the housing  and is approximately parallel to the ground, surface or pavement when the marking device is being normally operated by a technician (so as to reduce signal modulation with subtle movements of the marking device).","As also shown in , incorporated at the distal end of elongated housing  is a marking dispenser holder  for holding one or more marking dispensers  (e.g., an aerosol paint canister). Dispenser  may be one or more replaceable dispensers or one or more reusable refillable dispensers (including a fixed reservoir forming a part of the device ) or any other suitable dispenser. Also situated at the distal end of the housing is the marking material detection mechanism  to detect a presence or absence of the marking dispenser  in the marking material holder , and\/or one or more characteristics of the marking material , as well as an actuation mechanism , which in some implementations may constitute part of the actuation system  and be employed to interact with the marking dispenser  so as to effect dispensing of the marking material .","With respect to the actuation system , as shown in , at least a portion of the actuation system  is indicated generally along the length of the elongated housing for purposes of illustration. More specifically, however, in various implementations the actuation system  may include multiple components disposed in various places in, on or coupled to the marking device . For example, in the embodiment of , the actuation system  includes an actuator , which for example may be a mechanical mechanism provided at the handle  in the form of a trigger that is pulled by a finger or hand of an user\/technician. The actuation system  further includes the actuation mechanism  disposed at the distal end of the marking device that is responsive to the actuator  to dispense marking material. In general, in various exemplary implementations as discussed in further detail below, the actuation system  may employ any of a variety of mechanical and\/or electrical techniques to cause the marking dispenser  to dispense marking material  in response to one or more signals or stimuli. In the embodiment shown in , the signal\/stimulus is initially provided to the actuation system via the mechanical actuator ; i.e., a locate technician or other user triggers (e.g., pulls\/depresses) the actuator  to provide a signal\/stimulus to the actuation system , which in turn operates the actuation mechanism  to dispense marking material in response to the signal\/stimulus.","In response to the signal\/stimulus provided by the actuator , as discussed above the actuation system may also provide an actuation signal  to the processor  to indicate an actuation. As discussed in further detail below in connection with , pursuant to the execution by the processor  of the marking data algorithm , the actuation signal  may be used to cause the logging of information that is provided by one or more components of the marking device  so as to generate an electronic record of the marking operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 1B and 1C","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":["120","142","142","142","152","158","120","160","121","118","142"]},"In one implementation, the sensor  may include a switch device (e.g., a make\/break single pole\/single throw contact switch) disposed along the handle  of the marking device such that, when pulled, the actuator contacts (e.g., depresses) the switch causing a state of the switch to toggle. In another implementation, the sensor  may include a switch device such as a reed (magnetic) switch disposed at some point along the length of the elongated housing; in such an implementation, the mechanical coupler  may have a magnet disposed along it at an appropriate position relative to the reed switch, such that movement of the mechanical coupler  upon actuation of the actuator  causes a state of the reed switch to toggle. Electrically, a switch device serving as the sensor  may be coupled to ground or a DC supply voltage, such that when the switch device is in a first state (e.g., closed\/making contact) the ground or DC supply voltage is passed to the processor  (e.g., via an I\/O pin of the processor which provides an interrupt to, or is periodically monitored by, the processor), and when the switch is in a second state (e.g., open\/no contact) the ground or DC supply voltage is not passed to the processor .

More specifically, while in some implementations dispensing of marking material may be directly responsive to actuation of the actuator (and cease upon release of the actuator), in other implementations dispensing of marking material may be initiated in some manner upon actuation of the actuator, but then continued dispensing of marking material may not necessarily be dictated by continued actuation, or release, of the actuator. Rather, the processor  may provide one or more signals or commands to the link transmitter  to govern dispensing of marking material in some manner that does not necessarily track each actuation and release of the actuator.","For example, in one implementation the processor  may execute instructions such that, once the actuation signal  from the sensor  indicates actuation of the actuator, the processor  provides a signal to the link transmitter  that causes dispensing of marking material for some predetermined or user-defined amount of time, irrespective of release of the actuator. Additionally or alternatively, the processor may provide one or more signals to the link transmitter  that causes dispensing of marking material for multiple discrete amounts of time with a single actuation (e.g., three bursts of 1 second each per actuation). From the foregoing, it should be generally appreciated that a wide variety of marker sizes and patterns may be generated from the marking device in an automated or semi-automated manner based on processor-based control of the actuation system . It should also be appreciated that automated or semi-automated processor-based control of the dispensing of marking material may also govern in some fashion how, how often, and\/or what type of marking information is collected and logged to generate an electronic record of a marking operation, as discussed further below in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0144"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIGS. 2 and 3","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["110","110","310","312","314","110","314","312","314","110"]},"Referring now to , a perspective view of marking device  when in use for marking a \u201clines pattern\u201d is presented.

In one embodiment, the processor initially opens up a \u201cflat file\u201d for collection and logging of marking information to facilitate generation of an electronic record. As known in the art, a flat file is a plain text or mixed text\/binary file containing one entry (data record) per line, in which each entry may have multiple fields containing respective values, and wherein the respective values may be separated by delimiters (e.g., commas) or have a fixed length. In one exemplary implementation, the processor  logs data into a flat file opened for the electronic record as a succession of time stamped \u201cevent entries.\u201d Some event entries may be related specifically to actuation and\/or logged in response to actuation of the marking device (e.g., the processor  receiving an actuation signal ). Other event entries may be more generally related in some manner to overall operation of the marking device or the marking operation itself, but not necessarily associated with one or more particular actuations (e.g., start\/pause\/stop marking operation, power\/battery status, communication link\/network connection status, etc.), and these other event entries may be logged at virtually any time (in some cases irrespective of one or more actuations).","Accordingly, it should be appreciated that in one aspect of this embodiment a flat file for an electronic record may contain a succession of time stamped event entries on respective lines, in which one or more event entries may have multiple delimited fields\/values and at least some of the event entries relate to actuation of the marking device. In another aspect, one or more fields\/values in a given event entry may specifically indicate in some manner whether or not the event is associated with an actuation of the marking device. In general, an \u201cactuation event entry\u201d constitutes an entry in a file for an electronic record that is in some manner specifically related to, and\/or logged in response to or during, actuation of the marking device, and multiple actuation event entries for a given actuation constitute an actuation data set for that actuation. Again, it should be appreciated that a file for an electronic record may include one or more other event entries that may not be particularly associated with an actuation.","In other embodiments, the file for an electronic record may or may not be a flat file, and event entries associated with actuations (actuation event entries) may be somehow identified and differentiated from other event entries that are not associated with an actuation. For example, a file for an electronic record may include a particular data structure or format that segregates or separates in some manner event entries associated with successive actuations from those event entries that are not particularly associated with actuations (and\/or may be common to multiple actuations or a group of actuations). In yet other embodiments, as discussed below, marking information may be initially collected and logged in a first file for an electronic record in a first format (e.g., a flat file including a succession of time-stamped event entries as \u201craw data\u201d for the marking operation) that may be stored and\/or transmitted for any of a variety of purposes, and then reformatted and\/or reorganized in some manner in one or more subsequent files (e.g., a file having a particular data structure that segregates\/separates actuation-related information from other information in different fields\/elements of a data structure) for archiving and\/or transmission to one or more other devices\/processors.","Once a file for an electronic record is opened in block , in block  the processor can begin collecting and logging various marking information, i.e., logging in the electronic record (and\/or transmitting via the communication interface) actuation event entries and\/or other event entries. In one exemplary implementation, the processor may be programmed so as to poll one or more input devices and\/or other components of the marking device to receive information, either once or multiple times\/periodically following the job initiation signal, and log responses to these polls (\u201cpolling events\u201d) as event entries with associated time stamps. Examples of entries corresponding to polling events that may be logged into the file for the electronic record (and\/or transmitted) include, but are not limited to, one or more \u201cpower status event entries\u201d including power information associated with the power source , one or more \u201cticket information event entries\u201d including ticket information (e.g., as received from the user interface or the communication interface, retrieved from local memory, etc.), one or more \u201cservice-related information event entries\u201d including the service-related information (e.g., as received from the user interface or the communication interface, retrieved from local memory, etc.), and one or more \u201ccommunication interface event entries\u201d including status information regarding operation of the communication interface (e.g., network communication available\/unavailable).","Additionally or alternatively, the processor may be programmed so as to respond to one or more signals designated as \u201cinterrupt events\u201d from one or more components of the marking device. Such interrupt events cause logging of information in the electronic record (and\/or transmission of information) upon\/following the processor detecting the corresponding signal(s). For example, the \u201cjob initiation signal\u201d itself may constitute an interrupt event, in response to which the processor  not only opens a file for the electronic record but, once the file is opened, the processor may request timing information from the timing system  and log into the electronic record a \u201cstart job event entry\u201d including a job initiation time stamp associated with receipt of the job initiation signal.","In a similar manner, following commencement of a marking operation, the locate technician may utilize the user interface  (e.g., press a button, operate a joy-stick, or touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface) to pause, restart, and\/or indicate completion of the marking operation, and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example, as indicated in block  of , a \u201cpause signal\u201d may be provided by the user interface to the processor, in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a \u201cpause job event entry\u201d including a pause job time stamp associated with the at least one pause signal. When the technician is ready to continue, as shown in block  of  the technician may indicate this via the user interface and a \u201crestart job event entry\u201d similarly may be logged. When the marking operation is deemed by the technician to be completed, as noted in block  of  the technician may utilize the user interface so as to provide a \u201cstop signal\u201d to the processor, in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a \u201cstop job event entry\u201d including a stop job time stamp associated with the stop signal.","Additionally, the locate technician may utilize the user interface  to denote the beginning and end of a marking operation for a particular facility type, and these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example, upon beginning a marking operation for a given facility type, the technician may select \u201cline start\u201d from the user interface, and a corresponding \u201cline start signal\u201d may be provided by the user interface to the processor, in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a \u201cline start event entry.\u201d Similarly, when the technician wishes to indicate completion of the marking operation for a given facility type, the technician may select \u201cline stop\u201d from the user interface, and a corresponding \u201cline stop signal\u201d may be provided by the user interface to the processor, in response to which the processor may request timing information from the timing system and log a \u201cline stop even entry.\u201d","While various events are noted above as examples of \u201cpolling events\u201d as opposed to \u201cinterrupt events,\u201d it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited in these respects, and that the marking data algorithm  executed by the processor  may be configured in any of a variety manners to designate various functions performed by and\/or information provided by various components of the marking device as polling events or interrupt events. For example, the power source  may be configured to provide a \u201clow battery signal\u201d to the processor, which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event that may be logged by the processor and\/or that may cause the processor to take some particular action (e.g., provide an audible\/visible alert; disable logging of further data, etc.). In one aspect, absent the \u201clow battery signal,\u201d the processor may request status information from the power source once or occasionally as a polling event. Similarly, the communication interface  may be configured to provide a \u201cno network connection available signal\u201d to the processor, which when present is treated by the processor as an interrupt event (that is logged and\/or causes the processor to take some action), and when not present, the processor may poll the communication interface to request status information as a polling event.","Another example of an interrupt event is given by the actuation signal  provided by the actuation system  upon actuation of the actuator  (i.e., a signal change-of-state indicating a transition from a non-actuated state to an actuated state), in response to which the processor logs one or more actuation event entries in the electronic record. More specifically, in one implementation, the receipt of a non-actuated to actuated transition state of the actuation signal  by the processor may cause an initial actuation event entry to be logged as a \u201cstart actuation event entry\u201d having an associated time stamp (i.e., a start time for the corresponding actuation) and also cause the processor to subsequently poll one or more input devices for information during the corresponding actuation and until release of the actuator (i.e., subsequent change of state of the actuation signal ). In this manner, an actuation data set for a given actuation may include multiple actuation event entries.","For example, during actuation of the actuator, the processor may poll the location tracking system  so as to receive geographic information, and in turn log one or more \u201cgeo-location data event entries\u201d in the actuation data set for the corresponding actuation. As discussed above in connection with , in one exemplary implementation the location tracking system is configured to provide geographic information at an information update rate of approximately 5 Hz, and the processor may log respective updates of geographic information provided by the location tracking system at this update rate during an actuation as multiple geo-location data event entries of the actuation data set. It should be appreciated, however, that methods and apparatus according to various embodiments of the present invention are not limited in this respect, and that other geographic information update rates may be employed in various implementations (e.g., update rates of up to approximately 100 Hz), based in part on the particular location tracking system employed. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that in some implementations the geographic information provided by the location tracking system  may include one or more longitude coordinates, latitude coordinates, and a corresponding geo-location data time stamp at which a given set of longitude\/latitude coordinates are obtained by the location tracking system; accordingly, a given geo-location data event entry in an actuation data set may include a longitude coordinate, a latitude coordinate, and the corresponding geo-location data time stamp.","Similarly, in some implementations, pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal , the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the timing system  and the marking material detection mechanism  so as to receive timing information and\/or marking material information during a corresponding actuation, and in turn log one or more of a \u201ctiming event entry,\u201d and a \u201cmarking material detection event entry\u201d as part of the actuation data set. Any of a variety of marking material information as discussed above may be collected and logged during actuation in response to processor polling of the marking material detection mechanism (e.g., causing an RFID tag reader to read various information from an RFID tag affixed to the marking dispenser).","Additionally, in some implementations, pursuant to an interrupt provided by the actuation signal , the processor may subsequently poll one or more of the user interface , the communication interface , and the local memory  to retrieve ticket information and\/or service-related information for logging into an actuation data set. As discussed above, in some implementations the receipt\/retrieval of ticket information and\/or service-related information may be treated as a polling event not necessarily associated with actuations, and this information need not be included in one or more actuation data sets. However, in other implementations it may be desirable to include at least some aspect of ticket information and\/or service related information in each actuation data set, notwithstanding the possible redundancy of data content in respective actuation data sets (e.g., see Table 6, discussed further below in connection with ).","Another example of an interrupt event is given by a change-of-state of the actuation signal  indicating a transition from the actuated state to the non-actuated state, i.e., release of the actuator . In response to this event, the processor may request information from the timing system  and log an \u201cend actuation event entry\u201d including an end time stamp.","Yet another type of interrupt event causing the processor to log one or more event entries may be provided by the marking material detection mechanism  in the form of a signal that indicates whether or not a marking dispenser is contained in or appropriately coupled to the marking device. To this end, as discussed above in connection with , the marking material detection mechanism may include a toggle switch that provides a two-state signal to the processor (e.g., dispenser in\/dispenser out) as an interrupt. Upon receiving an interrupt indicating a transition from \u201cdispenser out\u201d to \u201cdispenser in,\u201d the processor may collect and log this event as a \u201cdispenser in event entry\u201d with a corresponding time stamp, and then request other marking material information relating to the marking material in the dispenser from the marking material detection mechanism. In view of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments, marking material information may not necessarily be collected during one or more actuations of the marking device, but alternatively may be collected only upon a \u201cdispenser in\u201d event being detected. Upon detection of an interrupt event indicating a transition from \u201cdispenser in\u201d to \u201cdispenser out,\u201d the processor similarly may collect and log this event as a \u201cdispenser out event entry.\u201d","In yet another embodiment, the processor , executing marking data algorithm , may be configured to repeatedly\/regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the marking device (e.g., in a predetermined order, in response to receipt of the job initiation signal) and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including marking information received pursuant to these polling events. In one aspect of this embodiment, each data packet of marking information may include a header, one or more flag fields, and one or more information payload fields. For example, in one implementation, the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID (e.g., ticket identifier), technician ID, device ID (e.g., serial number), packet type ID, and\/or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information\/generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device(s) or components, and one or more flag fields that are set (or reset) upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events (e.g., pull\/depress actuator, release actuator, marking dispenser in, marking dispenser out, low power, communication link fail, etc.). In this manner, a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor, in which certain interrupt events, such as an actuation and\/or release of the actuator, \u201ctag\u201d certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and\/or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time; alternatively, only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and\/or transmitted.","Table 1 below illustrates an example of a portion of the contents of a

Alternatively, in a \u201clandmark mode,\u201d marking material is not necessarily dispensed with an actuation of the marking device (and in some instances the dispensing of marking material is specifically precluded); instead, a technician positions the marking device proximate to an environmental landmark of interest and, upon actuation, the marking device collects various information about the landmark (hereafter referred to as \u201clandmark information\u201d), which information may include, but is not limited to, geo-location data of an environmental landmark, type of environmental landmark, and a time stamp for any acquired information relating to an environmental landmark.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0199","num":"0207"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B","FIGS. 11A and 11B"],"b":["120","152","110","142","142","142"]},"More specifically, as shown in , in this embodiment the marking device  further includes a mode selector device in the form of a bypass device  that is operated so as to impact and deflect the mechanical coupler  of the actuation system , such that the mechanical coupler  fails to cause the dispensing of a marking material upon actuation of the actuator . In , the bypass device is shown in a first state (e.g., released) which allows the marking device to operate in marking mode as described above (i.e., the mechanical coupler is allowed to be displaced essentially vertically with actuation of the actuator  and thereby dispense markers). In , the bypass device is shown in a second state (e.g., depressed) which allows the marking device to operate in landmark mode; in particular, the mechanical coupler  is deflected by the bypass device such that upon actuation of the actuator , the mechanical coupler  is not displaced vertically. In one example, with reference again to , when the mechanical coupler  is deflected by the bypass device , actuations of the actuator  do not effect full essentially up\/down vertical movement of the mechanical coupler ; as a result, the mechanical coupler fails to displace the actuation mechanism, and no pressure is applied to the spray nozzle of a paint dispenser (or dispensing mechanism of other types of marker dispensers). At the same time, however, actuation of the actuator  nonetheless provides an actuation signal  to the processor  (which may provide for logging of an actuation event entry as discussed above).","In various implementations, the bypass device  may be a locking and\/or spring-loaded switching device (e.g., a press\/release locking thumb switch) appropriately positioned along the housing of the marking device (e.g., near or on the handle), wherein the bypass device provides for both deflection of the mechanical coupler as well as opening\/closure of electrical contacts so as to provide a mode signal  to the processor . For example, as shown in , the first state (released) of the bypass device  may include an open contact state and no deflection of the mechanical coupler, whereas the second state shown in  (depressed) may include a closed contact state (e.g., in which the mode signal  is provided to the processor  as an interrupt event to indicate \u201clandmark mode\u201d) when the bypass device deflects the mechanical coupler .","In response to the mode signal  indicating landmark mode, the processor  may request timing information from the timing system and log into an electronic record a \u201clandmark mode event entry\u201d including a landmark mode time stamp associated with the landmark mode signal. Additionally, or alternatively, the processor may respond to the landmark mode signal by taking one or more other actions pursuant to execution of a portion of the marking data algorithm  including particular instructions to implement the landmark mode, such as providing for the selection of landmark categories and\/or types (via the user interface  and menus provided on the display ), and logging actuation event entries in an electronic record as \u201clandmark event entries.\u201d Further details of landmark mode operation of the marking device are discussed below in connection with .","In another exemplary implementation, rather than employing the bypass device  shown in  as a mode selector device, a marking device configured to implement a landmark mode in which no marker or marking material is dispensed may be modified to include an actuator locking device as a mode selector device to prevent operation of the actuator . In essence, such a device would function in a manner similar to a \u201ctrigger lock.\u201d Like the bypass device, the actuator locking device or \u201ctrigger lock\u201d may not only mechanically impede operation of the actuator, but also include electrical switch contacts (opened\/closed) so as to provide a mode signal to the processor to indicate a landmark mode when the actuator locking device is engaged to impede actuation. Because such an actuator locking device impedes operation of the actuator, the actuator itself cannot be employed to provide an actuation signal  to the processor to facilitate the logging into an electronic record of actuation event entries as \u201clandmark event entries.\u201d Accordingly, in implementations involving an actuator locking device, another aspect of the user interface (e.g., a button, switch, portion of the touch screen display, microphone to provide for voice-activation, etc.) is employed to provide a signal to the processor  to facilitate logging of an event (e.g., a \u201clandmark event\u201d) by the technician. Further details of logging of landmark events are discussed below in connection with .","Yet another exemplary implementation of a marking device modified to operate in landmark mode is based on the general implementation of an actuation system  shown in , in which the landmark mode is selected via the user interface  and\/or display  (e.g., menu-driven GUI) rather than via a bypass device or actuator locking device; i.e., some functionality of the user interface itself provides for a mode selector device. With reference again to , dispensing of marking material in this implementation is controlled by a link transmitter . As discussed above in connection with , the link transmitter  may be responsive to the actuation signal  provided by sensor  with operation of the actuator , for example, or alternatively responsive to a signal provided by the processor  (such that dispensing of marking material may in part be under the control of the processor  executing particular instructions for this purpose). Accordingly, in this implementation, when a landmark mode is selected via the user interface , the marking device may be configured to either dispense marking material (by not impeding any control signals to the link transmitter ) (e.g., so as to form one or more \u201clandmark locate marks\u201d on or near a target environmental landmark), or not to dispense marking material (by impeding control signals to the link transmitter  or otherwise controlling the link transmitter to not dispense marking material). In either case, the actuation signal  output by sensor  may nonetheless be provided to the processor  so as to facilitate logging of an actuation event entry upon actuation of the actuator , which in landmark mode may be designated as a \u201clandmark event entry,\u201d as discussed further below in connection with .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0205","num":"0213"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 9","FIGS. 9 and 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1200","1200","602","614","616","618","620","1200"]},"In the process  outlined in , following commencement of a marking operation the locate technician may utilize the user interface  (e.g., press a button, operate a joy-stick, touch a touch screen display portion of a graphical user interface, speak into a microphone to provide a voice-activated command, etc.) to not only pause, restart, and\/or indicate completion of the marking operation, but further to select a landmark mode of operation for the marking device. As noted above in the discussion of , any one or more of these actions may constitute interrupt events. For example, as indicated in block  of , if a technician selects \u201clandmark mode\u201d via the user interface, the user interface may provide a \u201clandmark mode signal\u201d to the processor.

To this end, in one implementation the processor  controls the user interface  (including display ) so as to display information to the technician to facilitate such a selection. In particular, a landmark selection submenu may be displayed, including one or more categories of landmarks displayed in any of a variety of manners (e.g., as a list of text entries, an arrangement of icons symbolizing respective categories, labeled symbols, etc.). Examples of landmark categories that may be displayed in such a submenu include, but are not limited to: 1) \u201cNatural Gas;\u201d 2) \u201cWater\/Sewer;\u201d 3) \u201cPower Line;\u201d 4) \u201cPhone Line;\u201d 5) \u201cCATV Line;\u201d and 6) \u201cOther.\u201d","Upon selection via the user interface of one of the landmark categories displayed on the submenu, the processor may control the user interface so as to display yet another submenu indicating various types of landmarks that fall within the selected category, so as to facilitate selection of a particular type of landmark for which information is to be collected. Examples of types of landmarks that may be displayed and available for selection via the user interface, for each of the above identified categories, include, but are not limited to:\n\n","While the foregoing discussion of landmark categories and types provides one construct in which a wide variety of landmarks are made available for selection by the technician, it should be appreciated that in other implementations, options for landmark selection may be presented in different manners. For example, a more succinct list of landmark types may be presented to the technician to facilitate easy selection (e.g., a more limited set of about a dozen more common landmark types that might be encountered in the field, such as \u201ctelephone pole,\u201d \u201cfire hydrant,\u201d \u201cmeter,\u201d \u201cmanhole,\u201d \u201ccurb,\u201d etc.). More generally, any number and variety of landmark types may be presented to the technician via the user interface in alphabetically ordered lists, numerically ordered lists, or other types of ordered text-based or symbolic arrangements, for example.","In another exemplary implementation, the categories and\/or types of landmarks made available for selection via the user interface may be based at least in part on a type of facility being marked when the marking device was in a marking mode prior to selection of the landmark mode. For example, consider a technician using the marking device in the marking mode and in the process of marking a power line. In one implementation, upon switching to landmark mode, the user is first presented with selection options for landmark category and\/or type that are more closely related to a power line (e.g., a more limited subset of option types including \u201cpole,\u201d \u201ctransformer,\u201d \u201cpedestal,\u201d etc.). In one aspect, the technician may nonetheless still have the option to select other categories and\/or types of landmarks, but as a default the technician is first presented with options related to the type of facility last being marked. In another aspect, the selection options for landmark category and\/or type may be specifically and intentionally limited to those options that are most germane to the type of facility last being marked in the previous marking mode (i.e., immediately prior to entry into the landmark mode).","In yet another exemplary implementation, the user interface may include a microphone and the processor may be configured to accept and process audible commands, such that landmark category and\/or type selection may be accomplished via voice-activated commands. For example, once landmark mode is selected, the technician may select a particular landmark category or type by simply speaking into the microphone (e.g., \u201ctelephone pole,\u201d \u201cfire hydrant,\u201d \u201cmeter,\u201d \u201cmanhole,\u201d \u201ccurb,\u201d etc.).","In addition to, or as an alternative to, selection of landmark category and\/or type, block  may provide for the entry of any of a variety of text information for inclusion as part of the landmark information in an electronic record. For example, in some exemplary implementations, via the user interface and\/or display the technician may enter text-based information relating to an environmental landmark (e.g., as an offset to another topological, architectural, or infrastructure feature in proximity to the environmental landmark\u2014\u201ctelephone pole 5 ft. from back of curb\u201d). Additionally, in a manner similar to landmark type selection, the user interface\/display may provide for menu-driven selection via a GUI of predetermined options for additional text-based information to be included as part of the landmark information (e.g., a set of \u201cstock\u201d text messages for selection to be included as part of landmark information).","Following selection of landmark category and\/or type in block  of the process  shown in , and\/or entry\/section of any text-based information in block  of the process  shown in , in block  actuations of the actuator  in landmark mode cause the processor to collect various \u201clandmark information\u201d with each actuation, which information is logged in an electronic record as a \u201clandmark event entry\u201d (rather than an actuation event entry, as noted in Table 3 above). Furthermore, as noted above, the processor  and\/or the link transmitter  of the actuation system  may be particularly configured to either dispense or not dispense marking material upon actuations in landmark mode. Essentially, in landmark mode, the technician positions the marking device proximate to a selected category\/type of landmark and actuates the actuator to acquire various information relating to the landmark (e.g., geo-location data, type, time stamp).","In general, the processor may be configured to communicate with (e.g., poll) any of a variety of input devices to collect landmark information to be logged in an electronic record. As discussed above in connection with the marking mode (refer again to ), such information may be acquired from any of a variety of input devices including, but not limited to, the location tracking system , the timing system , the communications interface  (e.g., a USB port or other port), the user interface , and the local memory .","In particular, any data that is available from the location tracking system (e.g., any information available in various NMEA data messages, such as coordinated universal time, date, latitude, north\/south indicator, longitude, east\/west indicator, number and identification of satellites used in the position solution, number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation, azimuth and SNR values, dilution of precision values) may be collected as landmark information and logged in an electronic record as part of a landmark event entry. Additionally, information collected from the user interface in the form of a text entry by the technician may be included in a landmark event entry; for example, in one implementation, upon actuation of the actuator, the processor may prompt the technician via the display of the user interface to enter text notes, if desired (e.g., the technician may describe an offset of a target environmental landmark from an architectural, topographical, or infrastructure feature to compliment geographic information provided by the location tracking system), and this textual information may serve as landmark information. In view of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that \u201clandmark information\u201d may include a wide variety of information components including, but not limited to, one or more of geographical information (e.g., from the location tracking system), timing information (e.g., from the location tracking system and\/or the timing system), landmark category and\/or type information (e.g., selected or entered via the user interface), textual information (e.g., entered via the user interface), or other information (e.g., received from the local memory and\/or the communications interface).","Table 9 below provides an example of content and format for a landmark event entry that may be logged in a file for an electronic record and\/or transmitted by the marking device when in landmark mode.

For example, various other information that may be common to multiple (or all) actuation data sets of a given electronic record may be stored in one or more additional elements of the electronic record that are not contained within one or more of the actuation data sets themselves (e.g., one or more of the ticket information field , the service-related information field , and the marking material properties field , which are shown as part of the data structure for a given actuation data set of the electronic record, may instead be elements of the electronic record that are common to all actuation data sets of a given electronic record).","Once an actuation of the marking device in landmark mode has been logged as a landmark event entry, the process  shown in  returns to block . At this point, the technician is provided (via the user interface\/display) with the options of pausing the job (block ), restarting the job if previously paused (block ), stopping the job and indicating completion (block ) or selecting landmark mode again (block ) for the next actuation. If the technician selects none of these options, the process returns to block , at which point further polling and\/or interrupt events are logged (i.e., an actuation event entry capturing marking information is logged with the next actuation of the actuator), as discussed above in connection with , Accordingly, after an actuation in landmark mode, in one exemplary implementation the marking device defaults back to the marking mode, unless and until the technician selects the landmark mode again for a subsequent actuation.","In an alternative implementation not shown in , following actuation of the marking device in landmark mode, the processor may control the user interface\/display to provide an option to the technician to exit landmark mode (rather than automatically presenting the options of pause job, restart job, stop job, or landmark mode). In this manner, the marking device remains in landmark mode for subsequent actuations until the technician makes a menu selection to exit landmark mode, at which point the process  returns to block .","In yet another embodiment, the processor , executing marking data algorithm  in landmark mode, may be configured to generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets representing various event entries logged by the marking device (e.g., as shown above in Tables 2-9). As discussed above in connection with the marking mode, each data packet may include a header, one or more flag fields, and one or more information payload fields. To accommodate both a marking mode and a landmark mode, one flag field may be set or reset upon selection of the landmark mode so as to identify the contents of any information payload field in the data packet as landmark information as opposed to marking information. Similarly, as discussed above, one or more other flag fields may be set (or reset) upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events (e.g., pull\/depress actuator, release actuator, marking dispenser in, marking dispenser out, low power, communication link fail, etc.). In this manner, a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor, in which certain interrupt events, such as an actuation and\/or release of the actuator, \u201ctag\u201d certain data packets via an interrupt flag, and certain data packets also may be tagged as generated in marking mode or landmark mode. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and\/or transmitted from the marking device in essentially real time; alternatively, only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and\/or transmitted.","Thus, in landmark identification mode, a locate technician may employ an appropriately configured marking device to capture the types and locations of environmental landmarks of interest that are present at the work site and\/or in the general environs of a dig area. While in landmark mode, the locate technician may approach a certain environmental landmark, then select the type of the environmental landmark via user interface, position the marking device (e.g., place the tip of marking device) proximate to the target environmental landmark, and then actuate the marking device. In doing so, the marking device logs in an electronic record landmark information including, for example, the type of the target environmental landmark, the geo-location of the target environmental landmark, and a time stamp in an electronic record. The locate technician may move from one environmental landmark to the next until information about all environmental landmarks of interest has been captured. Additionally, one or more data points (e.g., \u201clandmark event entries\u201d) may be captured for any given environmental landmark.","Other embodiments of the present invention relate to locate devices, the collection of \u201clocate information\u201d associated with a locate operation, and generation of an electronic record of such locate information. With reference again to , as discussed above a locate device (or so-called \u201clocate set\u201d) may include at least one transmitter and a locate receiver. In one embodiment of the present invention, one or both of a locate transmitter and a locate receiver may be particularly configured, according to various concepts discussed above in connection with marking devices and other concepts discussed in further detail below, to acquire locate information relating to a locate operation, generate an electronic record of the acquired locate information, and store, transmit, analyze or otherwise process the acquired locate information.","Various types of locate information may be generated during, or otherwise associated with, the use of a locate set to perform a locate operation. For example, locate information related to the use of the transmitter may include, but is not limited to, information about the applied signal power, the applied signal frequency, the location of the transmitter, the connection point type (i.e., the manner in which connection is made to the target object, such as direct connection, inductive coupling, etc.), an identification of the transmitter unit (e.g., serial number), information about how the transmitter unit is grounded (if at all), and an indication of whether a sufficient electrical connection has been made to the target object (e.g., some transmitters produce a \u201ccontinuity signal\u201d indicative of the quality of the connection between the transmitter and the target object). Locate information related to the use of the locate receiver may include, but is not limited to, an identification of the locate receiver (e.g., a serial number), the mode of operation of the locate receiver (e.g., peak mode v. null mode), the frequency to which the locate receiver is tuned, the gain of the locate receiver, the frequency of a detected magnetic field, the amplitude\/strength of a detected magnetic field, the electrical current of the detected signal, the location of the locate receiver, and a depth measurement taken by the locate receiver (which may be used, for example, as additional information regarding a target object).

It should be provided that these examples of user actions are non-limiting, and furthermore that in some embodiments one or more of the pieces of information listed may be detected automatically and not be input\/selected by the user.","Once the target object\/facility type and any other relevant or desired information is input and\/or selected by the technician, and the applied signal from the transmitter is coupled to the target object, the locate receiver may be used in a variety of manners by the technician for a locate operation, in which the technician generally positions (e.g., sweeps) the locate receiver over an area in which they expect to detect an underground facility. More specifically, the technician positions the locate receiver such that the RF antenna  (which may include more than one antenna, as described further below) may receive\/detect a magnetic field emitted by the target object (see underground facility  in ).","In some embodiments, the locate receiver  is capable of operating in a null mode (e.g., capable of detecting a null signal when positioned over an object (e.g., facility) emitting a magnetic field), such that RF antenna  may comprise a null detection antenna. Alternatively, the locate receiver  is capable of operating in a peak detection mode (e.g., capable of detecting a peak signal when over an object (e.g., facility) emitting a magnetic field), and the RF antenna  comprises two peak detection antennae, which may be positioned substantially parallel to each other but at different positions within the locate receiver (e.g., at different heights). In some embodiments, the locate receiver  is capable of operating in both peak detection and null detection modes, and the RF antenna  may comprise three antennae, e.g., one null detection antenna and two peak detection antennae. However, RF antenna  may comprise any other number, type, and orientation of antennae, as the locate receivers described herein are not limited in these respects.","The RF antenna  may be coupled to the detection circuit  such that the signal(s) received\/detected by the RF antenna  may be provided to the detection circuit  as an output signal of the RF antenna. The output signal of the RF antenna may be any frequency detectable by the antenna, and in some embodiments may be between approximately 512 Hz and 1 MHz, although these non-limiting frequencies are provided primarily for purposes of illustration. As mentioned, the output signal of the RF antenna , which in some embodiments is an analog signal, may be provided to detection circuit , which may perform various functions. For example, the detection circuit  may perform various \u201cfront-end\u201d operations on the output signal of RF antenna , such as filtering, buffering, frequency shifting or modulation, and\/or pre-amplifying the output signal. Furthermore, the detection circuit  may perform additional functions, such as amplifying and\/or digitizing the output signal provided by RF antenna . It should be appreciated, however, that the types of functions described as being performed by detection circuit  are non-limiting examples, and that other functions may additionally or alternatively be performed.","After detection circuit  has operated on the signal from RF antenna  (e.g., by filtering, buffering, amplifying, and\/or digitizing, among other possible operations), it may provide a signal to processing circuit . The processing circuit  may process the signal(s) provided by detection circuit  in any suitable manner to determine any information of interest. For example, according to one embodiment, the processing circuit  may process the signal(s) from detection circuit  to determine a magnetic field strength of a magnetic field detected by RF antenna . The processing circuit  may process the signal(s) from detection circuit  to determine an amplitude and\/or direction of the electrical current creating the magnetic field(s) detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit  may perform operations to calculate, for example, the depth and location of the target facility based on the electromagnetic fields detected by RF antenna . Processing circuit  may be an analog circuit or a digital microprocessor, or any other suitable processing component for performing one or more of the operations described above, or any other operations of interest with respect to signals detected by RF antenna . Also, it should be appreciated that processing circuit  and processor  (described in further detail below) may be a single processor in some embodiments, as the illustration of them as distinct in  is only one non-limiting example.","Processor  of control electronics  may be any suitable processor for controlling and\/or coordinating operation of the detection electronics  and\/or control electronics . For example, the processor  may be any general-purpose processor, controller, or microcontroller device. In some embodiments, controls logging of data (e.g., locate information) from the processing circuit , timing system , and\/or location tracking system  to the local memory . The manner in which such data may be logged to the local memory  may depend on the type of data being logged, as the operation of locate receiver  is not limited in this respect.","For example, data from timing system  and\/or location tracking system  may be automatically logged continuously (e.g., in the form of streaming packets with flag fields, as described below, or in any other continuous form) or periodically to the local memory , may be logged in response to one or more types of events (e.g., may be logged automatically when a particular event occurs), and\/or may be logged at any suitable times. In particular, in one implementation, logging may occur at periodic intervals during performance of a locate operation, such as every second, every five seconds, every minute, or at any other suitable time interval. According to another embodiment, timing information and\/or geographic information from timing system  and location tracking system , respectively, may be logged in response to particular types of events, such as detecting an underground facility or detecting the absence of an underground facility. Such events may be identified by signals output by processing circuit  to processor . As a non-limiting example, timing information and\/or geographic information may be logged when a characteristic (e.g., magnetic field strength) of a signal detected by RF antenna  is greater than a particular threshold value, which may be indicated by a signal output from processing circuit  to processor , and which occurrence may be indicative of the presence of an underground facility. Similarly, in some embodiments time timing information and\/or geographic information may be logged when a signal detected by RF antenna  has a magnitude above a first threshold and the gain of the locate receiver  is above a second threshold. It should be appreciated that various combinations of detected signals detected by locate receiver  may be used to trigger logging of information (e.g., timing information and\/or geographic information) to local memory. It should also be appreciated that any information available from the location tracking system  (e.g., any information available in various NMEA data messages, such as coordinated universal time, date, latitude, north\/south indicator, longitude, east\/west indicator, number and identification of satellites used in the position solution, number and identification of GPS satellites in view and their elevation, azimuth and SNR values, dilution of precision values) may be included in geographic information constituting all or a portion of logged locate information.","In some embodiments, information (e.g., timing information and\/or geographic information) may be logged in response to detection of a pattern of events, or deviation from a pattern of events. For example, a pattern of magnetic field strength magnitudes (e.g., a relatively constant magnetic field strength for a given time, an increasing magnetic field strength, a decreasing magnetic field strength, etc.) may be detected by the locate receiver, which may trigger logging of timing information and\/or geographic information. Deviation from a pattern, such as a historical pattern or expected pattern may also trigger logging of information. For example, a user's historical use patterns of a locate receiver may be compared to information collected about the use of the locate receiver during a given job, and if a deviation is detected then logging of timing and\/or geographic information may be triggered. The patterns or deviations from patterns may relate to patterns in magnetic field strength, magnetic field frequency, signal gain, user operation, any other information described herein, or any combination of such information.","In some embodiments, alternatively or in addition to \u201cautomatic\u201d logging of locate information based on some condition or event, a user of the locate receiver  may \u201cmanually\u201d trigger logging of timing information, geographic information, and\/or any other data associated with a locate operation or locate receiver (locate information), for example by manipulating a control (e.g., button, knob, joystick) of the user interface , or by actuating an actuator  (e.g., a trigger-pull mechanism similar to the actuator  of the marking device  shown in ) integrated or otherwise associated with the locate receiver (as shown in ), which may be part of the actuation system  and which may cause a signal to be sent to the processor  to initiate logging of locate information. For example, according to some embodiments a user may initiate the locate receiver  taking a depth measurement by depressing a pushbutton of the user interface , or pulling\/squeezing the actuator , which may also trigger the logging of timing information and\/or geographic information from timing system  and location tracking system . The depth measurement data, time data, and\/or location data may then be logged in an electronic record in local memory .","It should be appreciated that while the foregoing discussion focuses on logging locate information to local memory , the locate information may also, or alternatively, be transmitted to remote computer  via communication interface . As with logging locate information to local memory , the transmission of locate information to remote computer  may be performed continuously, periodically in response to one or more types of events, in response to user input or actuation of an actuator, or in any other suitable manner.","As discussed above in connection with the marking device , in yet another embodiment, the processor  of the locate receiver  may be configured to continuously collect various available locate information (e.g., repeatedly\/regularly poll all available input devices and other components of the locate receiver) and generate an essentially continuous stream of data packets including locate information. In one aspect of this embodiment, each data packet of locate information may include a header, one or more flag fields, and one or more information payload fields. For example, in one implementation, the header for each packet may include one or more of a job ID (e.g., ticket identifier), technician ID, device ID (e.g., serial number), packet type ID, and\/or a time stamp corresponding to logging of information\/generation of the packet. Each packet also may include one or more payload fields for carrying information provided by the polled device(s) or components of the locate receiver, and one or more flag fields that are set (or reset) upon occurrence of one or more predetermined interrupt events (e.g., signal strength from receiver antenna exceeding a predetermined threshold, low power, communication link fail, etc.). In this manner, a continuous stream of data may be provided as an output by the processor, in which certain interrupt events, such as an actuation and\/or release of an actuator, or other event-based logging of locate information, \u201ctag\u201d certain data packets via an interrupt flag. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, all data packets thusly generated may be stored in the file opened for the electronic record and\/or transmitted from the locate device in essentially real time; alternatively, only certain data packets with one or more predetermined flags set may be stored and\/or transmitted.","As with those embodiments relating to a marking device previously described in section II of this application, various \u201clocate event entries\u201d including locate information corresponding to different events relating to use and operation of one or more locate devices may be logged in a file for an electronic record and\/or transmitted by the locate device(s) described herein. Various exemplary formats for these locate event entries are now described, although it should be appreciated that various other entries and formats are possible, as those shown and described below are provided primarily for purposes of illustration.","Job Started\/Paused\/Restarted\/Completed Events: As with the marking devices described above, one event entry format for a locate receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention provides information about when a locate operation (\u201cjob\u201d) was started and completed in addition to capturing details about if and when the job was paused and restarted. Such an entry may substantially take the form of the analogous entry in Table 2, understanding that the \u201cWAND_ID\u201d portion of the entry may be replaced by a \u201cLOCATE_RECEIVER_ID\u201d portion.","Actuation Events: As has been described, according to at least one embodiment of the present invention, a locate receiver may be operated to collect and\/or transmit locate information upon actuation by a user.

For example, while Table 14 illustrates an electronic record including a single GPS data point, it should be appreciated that multiple GPS data points may be taken and stored within a single electronic record. The multiple GPS data points may be taken in response to a single actuation event (e.g., single actuator pull by a technician), in response to multiple actuation events (e.g., multiple actuator pulls by a technician), or in other manners.

When switched into the landmark mode, the locate receiver may stop detecting a magnetic field, e.g., the RF antenna of the locate receiver may be temporarily disabled in some embodiments.

The combined locate and marking device may function as both a locate receiver for locating objects (e.g., underground facilities) and a marking device, as discussed herein in the preceding sections.","According to one aspect of such embodiments, a combination locate and marking device is provided which is configured to collect, store, transmit to an external device and\/or analyze\/process any of the data types described previously herein (locate information, marking information, and\/or landmark information), any combination of such data types, or any other information of relevance to the operation of the combined locate and marking device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0279","num":"0301"},"figref":["FIGS. 17 and 18","FIG. 17","FIG. 17","FIGS. 2 and 14","FIG. 14","FIG. 17","FIG. 2","FIG. 14"],"b":["1800","1810","150","112","1630","112","118","118","1632"]},"The operation of the components of combination locate and marking device  may be coordinated in various manners. As has been described previously herein, the detection electronics may operate to detect the presence or absence of a target object, such as an underground facility. The marking-related components (e.g., actuation system , marking dispenser , etc.) may be used in connection with dispensing a marking material, for example to mark the location of an underground facility once detected. In practice, the two activities (detecting a target object and marking a location of the target object) may not coincide temporally. Rather, a locate technician may scan an area one or more times to detect the presence of the target object, or may have to scan over a large area to determine the extent of the target object, utilizing the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device. In some embodiments, the locate technician may operate the combination locate and marking device to dispense a marking material after the target object is detected, or in some instances intermittently while detecting the target object (e.g., while following the length of an underground facility). Thus, various schemes may be employed to coordinate the object detection functionality and the marking functionality.","According to some embodiments, the object detection functionality and the marking functionality may operate at separate times. For example, in one such embodiment, the combination locate and marking device may separately operate in a detection mode and a marking mode, and a user (e.g., locate technician) may select which mode to use, for example by selecting the mode from the user interface. In such an embodiment, the user may operate the combination locate and marking device as a locate receiver until the target object is detected, and then may switch modes to a marking mode, in which the user may operate the combination locate and marking device to dispense marking material. In another such embodiment, the combination locate and marking device may operate substantially continuously as a locate receiver until the user actuates the actuation system , at which time the locate receiver functionality may automatically be suspended and the combination locate and marking device may shift to a marking mode for dispensing marking material. Other manners of coordinating the functionality of a combination locate and marking device are also possible, as those manners explicitly listed herein are provided primarily for purposes of illustration.","In addition, as described further below, a combination locate and marking device is further configurable to operate in a landmark mode, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In some such embodiments, the landmark mode may be a distinct mode which may selected by the user, much like the above-described selection of the object detection functionality and the marking functionality. However, other manners in which the combination device may be placed into a landmark mode of operation are also possible.","It should be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that locate information generated in connection with the object detection functionality of a combination locate and marking device may not coincide temporally with the generation of marking information associated with the marking functionality of the combination locate and marking device. The logging and\/or transmission of locate and\/or marking information generated by a combination locate and marking device may be coordinated in various manners, and the aspects of the invention relating to combination locate and marking devices are not limited to any particular manner of logging and\/or transmitting such information. Table 15 illustrates some exemplary schemes for coordinating logging and\/or transmission of information relating to both the locate and marking functionality of a combination locate and marking device.

In others of such embodiments in which locate information relating to the locate functionality is logged and\/or transmitted in response to detection of an event of interest, marking material may be dispensed only upon actuation by a user (e.g., a locate technician), and marking information relating to the marking functionality may be logged in local memory  and\/or transmitted to remote computer  via communication interface  upon actuation of the actuation system . In some embodiments, the actuation system may be disabled until the one or more types of events (e.g., detection of a magnetic field of suitable magnitude, detection of the presence of an applied signal from a transmitter, etc.) occurs, at which time the actuation system may be enabled and a user may choose whether or not to actuate the system.","In yet other embodiments, locate information relating to the locate receiver functionality of the combination locate and marking device and marking information relating to the marking functionality are both logged in local memory and\/or transmitted (e.g., to a remote computer) upon actuation of the actuation system . In some embodiments, both types of information are logged and\/or transmitted for a same actuation of the actuation system . In other embodiments, separate actuations are used to log and\/or transmit locate information relating to the locate receiver functionality and marking information relating to the marking functionality, which in some embodiments may depend at least partially on whether the combination device is in a locate mode or a marking mode of operation.","While various schemes have been described by which information relating to both the locate receiver functionality and the marking functionality of combination locate and marking device may be logged and\/or transmitted, it should be appreciated that other schemes are also possible.

If the locate operation is not complete, method  returns to act .","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a combination locate and marking device may be configurable to operate in a landmark mode, substantially the same as the landmark mode described previously herein in connection with marking devices and with locate receivers. The combination locate and marking device may include any components and circuitry suitable to allow for operation in a landmark mode, such as the bypass components, actuation locking components, and\/or user interface components previously described with respect to a marking device providing landmark functionality, or any other suitable components and circuitry. Similarly, the types of information collected and the manner of operation of a combination locate and marking device exhibiting landmark functionality may be substantially the same as that previously described with respect to marking devices having landmark functionality.","With reference to the marking device illustrated in , the locate device illustrated in , the data acquisition system of , or the combined locate and marking device illustrated in , in yet another embodiment the processor associated with any of these devices (and\/or one or more remote computers ) may additionally process various locate information, marking information and\/or landmark information, provided in real time from one or more of these devices and\/or stored in one or more electronic records, and control a display device (e.g., display  or some other display device) to render a computer-generated visual representation of locate information, marking information and\/or landmark information. Such a visual representation may be used, for example, to provide immediate feedback to the locate technician, provide essentially real-time feedback to a supervisor monitoring the technician from a remote location, provide a visual record of the locate information, marking information and\/or landmark information (e.g., for archiving purposes, once one or more electronic records are generated), and\/or to verify the quality (e.g., accuracy and completeness) of work performed during the locate and\/or marking operation. It should be appreciated that in various exemplary implementations of a computer-generated visual representation according to the present invention, any one or combination of locate information, marking information and landmark information may be visually rendered in a display field.","In various aspects of this embodiment, a visual representation may be static in that all available information is presented in a display field at one time after collection of the information (e.g., completion of the locate and\/or marking operation and generation of an electronic record); alternatively, the visual representation may be dynamic in that information representing successive actuations of a locate device, a marking device or a combined locate and marking device, or automatic logging of data in a locate device, is displayed in essentially real-time as it is collected, or may be displayed after collection (e.g., generation of an electronic record) in a time-sequenced animation that \u201crecreates\u201d the collection of information (e.g., recreates the locate and\/or marking operation) on the time scale in which it was originally acquired.","In other aspects, the relative positions of GPS-identified events\/objects noted in an electronic record including one or more of locate information, marking information and landmark information may be displayed (e.g., based on geo-location data and some appropriate scale of an available display field of display ) to provide a visual representation. A visual representation may also be rendered in one or more particular colors corresponding to one or more particular underground facilities located and\/or marked (e.g., see Table 7).","In one exemplary implementation relating to marking operations, such a visual representation may include one \u201celectronic locate mark\u201d displayed in a display field for each actuation\/dispensing action of a marking device or combined locate and marking device, such that there is essentially a one-to-one correspondence between electronic locate marks and physical locate marks for a given underground facility marked during a marking operation. Alternatively, in another exemplary implementation of such a visual representation for a marking operation, an essentially continuous solid line (or other line type) may be displayed in a display field to represent a given underground facility marked during a marking operation.","In another aspect of data processing for computer-aided visual rendering, the processor may process the geo-location data in electronic records from a locate device, a marking device and\/or a combined locate and marking device so as to filter, average, interpolate and\/or otherwise \u201csmooth\u201d data (e.g., so as to provide \u201ccleaner\u201d visual renderings and\/or connect successive locate marks represented by respective actuation data sets of an electronic record); alternatively, \u201craw data\u201d provided by a given device may be utilized for the visual representation. In yet another aspect of this embodiment, visual representations of multiple locate and\/or marking operations for different underground facilities within the same work site\/dig area may be generated in the same display field of a display device so as to provide a composite visual representation, in which different underground facilities may be uniquely identified in some manner (e.g., by different line types and\/or different colors), and one or more environmental landmarks in and\/or around the work site\/dig area may be identified using a variety of displayed identifiers (e.g., icons, symbols, marks, shapes, etc.).","In the following discussion, a process for generating a visual representation in a display field based on information in an electronic record is described for illustrative purposes based on marking information and\/or landmark information contained in an electronic record (as acquired using a marking device or a combined locate and marking device). However, it should be appreciated that the general concepts outlined below in connection with visual renderings may be applied similarly to locate information contained in one or more electronic records generated by a locate device or a combined locate and marking device, as well as landmark information contained in one or more electronic records generated by a locate device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0323","num":"0345"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["800","110","800","134","118","110","1810","146"]},"In block  of the process , if an electronic record has already been generated for the marking operation in which one or more underground facilities are marked and\/or environmental landmark information is acquired, the record is examined to determine the geographic extents of the locate marks and\/or environmental landmarks to be visually rendered on a display device. In particular, the processor  may review the geo-location data of all actuation data sets of the electronic record to determine (e.g., based on the respective latitude and longitude coordinates of the available geo-location data) the maximum extents of the marking operation to be visually rendered.","The maximum extents of the marking operation may be determined in any of a variety of manners according to different exemplary implementations. For example, in one exemplary implementation, in block  the processor  may determine the centroid of all electronic locate marks and\/or environmental landmarks represented by respective actuation data sets of the electronic record to be displayed. The processor then determines the geographic extent of the collection of electronic locate marks and\/or environmental landmarks by determining one or more latitude\/longitude coordinate pairs from the available data having a greatest distance from the centroid. In one example, the processor may determine a single farthest point from the centroid, and a distance between this farthest point and the centroid serves as a radius of a circle that provides an \u201cextents area circle.\u201d In another example, the \u201cfarthest opposing corners\u201d of a rectangle around the centroid may be determined by assigning the centroid as the origin of a reference coordinate system, and finding the coordinate pairs in opposing quadrants of the coordinate system having a greatest distance from the centroid (e.g., the +LAT\/+LONG and \u2212LAT\/\u2212LONG coordinate pairs at a greatest distance from the origin) to provide an \u201cextents area rectangle.\u201d Other types of polygons and closed shapes (ovals) may be employed to provide an extents area for the marking operation to be displayed.","Alternatively, if an electronic record has not been previously generated and information received in essentially real-time from the marking device or the combined locate and marking device is to be displayed in a display field, a default extents area may be selected in advance based on any of a variety of criteria. For example, address and\/or site description information provided in a ticket pursuant to which the marking operation is performed may provide a basis on which an extents area for the marking operation may be estimated a priori. Similarly, as discussed further below in connection with , an available digital image of the work site\/dig area may be employed to determine or estimate an initial extents area for the marking operation.","In block , the extents area of the marking operation to be visually rendered is then mapped to an available display field of a display device, using any appropriate scaling factor as necessary, to ensure that all of the geo-location data in the electronic record fits within the display field. For example, in one exemplary implementation, a transformation may be derived using information relating to the available display field (e.g., a reference coordinate system using an appropriate scale for a given display field of a display device) to map data points within the extents area to the available display field. In another aspect of this example, a buffer area around the extents area may be added to provide one or more suitable margins for the displayed visual representation, and\/or to accommodate different shapes of extents areas to the available display field of the display device, and an appropriate transformation may be derived based on this optional additional buffer area.","Once a transformation is derived to map the marking operation extents area to the available display field of a display device, in block  one or more electronic locate marks and\/or one or more identifiers (e.g., icons, symbols, marks, shapes, etc.) is\/are rendered in the display field based on applying the transformation to the geo-location data present in the data set of one or more corresponding actuation data sets of the electronic record. In one exemplary implementation, one electronic locate mark is rendered in the display field for each actuation data set of an electronic record. With reference again to Table 6 and , in one embodiment each actuation data set includes at least T1 geo-location data for a start of an actuation of a marking device and one or more other pieces of geo-location data during actuation. Using multiple pieces of geo-location data per actuation data set, an electronic locate mark may be rendered as a line in the display field (e.g., so as to visually represent one of the physical locate marks -, - or - shown in ). In another exemplary implementation, an electronic locate mark may be rendered for each geo-location data in a given entry, such that multiple electronic locate marks correspond to one actuation (e.g., a series of dots electronically rendered to graphically represent a line-type physical locate mark). In one aspect, as discussed above, a given electronic locate mark may be rendered in a particular color and\/or line type to represent a type of underground facility represented by the mark (e.g., as indicated by marking material information included in the electronic record).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0329","num":"0351"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 22","FIG. 22","FIG. 22","FIG. 22","FIG. 22"],"b":["900","800","1","7","910","8","14","912","15","24","914","26","34","916","950","952","954","956"]},"As noted above, while in one embodiment there may be a one-to-one correspondence between electronic locate marks rendered in a single or composite visual representation and physical locate marks placed in a dig area during a marking operation, or there may be multiple electronic locate marks for a corresponding physical locate mark, in yet other embodiments a single or composite visual representation may provide a variety of other indicators\/digital representations of marked underground facilities in a computer-generated visual rendering. For example,  illustrates another example of a composite visual representation  based on the same electronic record used to generate the composite visual representation  of , in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective marking operations. To this end, in one exemplary implementation, an additional step may be included in the process  shown in , in which the processor may process the marking geo-location data in an electronic record by filtering, averaging, interpolating and\/or otherwise \u201csmoothing\u201d the data so as to connect successive discrete locate marks represented by the respective actuation data sets of the electronic record and thereby provide a substantially smooth continuous line for display.","Similarly, filtering, averaging, interpolating, processing and\/or otherwise smoothing of data may be applied to landmark information captured in landmark event entries. For example, multiple event entries logged for a particular environmental landmark (e.g., the four corners of a pedestal) may be processed so as to provide a single point in a display field at which to display a symbol, icon or other identifier for an environmental landmark. Such processing may include, for example, selecting any one of multiple geo-location coordinates captured in multiple event entries as representative of the landmark location, calculating a centroid of all points represented by captured coordinates, \u201cpre-filtering\u201d a collection of coordinates to eliminate significant \u201coutliers\u201d and subsequently determining a centroid of the remaining coordinates, etc.","In the example of , as also noted above, different underground facility types may be indicated in different color lines, and the different colors\/facility types may be derived from the electronic record (e.g., based on the correlations provided in Table 7). Furthermore, in other aspects, text indicators may be included in the visual representation, and\/or other types of coding may be used (different line styles such as patterns, width, bold, etc.; a succession of symbols or other graphic icons, etc.) to indicate different facility types, and\/or some other aspect of a given facility (e.g., the material used for a particular pipe, conduit, cable, sheathing; the diameter of a particular pipe, conduit, cable; offsets to one or more environmental landmarks, etc.). By way of example,  indicates that the four underground facilities in the composite visual representation correspond to a power line  (which may be rendered in the color red), a first sewer line  (which may be rendered in the color green), a second sewer line  (which also may be rendered in the color green), and a telecommunications line  (which may be rendered in the color orange). An exemplary composite visual representation may include additional textual, numeric and\/or graphic elements to provide other information available in the electronic record for the marking operations (e.g., timestamp information, ID information, coordinates for location information, offset indications, etc.). For example, in  an offset  of 3 feet is indicated between the fire hydrant  and the sewer line .","In some marking operations, a technician may use the marking device not only to mark an underground facility's placement\/path relative to the ground, pavement or other surface, but also to \u201cannotate\u201d the marking operation in some fashion. For example, in some instances a technician actually \u201cwrites\u201d with the marking device (e.g., by actuating the marking device to dispense paint) to provide text annotations, offset indications, arrows, other symbols, and the like on the ground, pavement or other surface. Accordingly, the electronic record for a marking operation may include one or more actuation data sets corresponding to actuations in which the technician was \u201cwriting\u201d to annotate the marking operation in some fashion rather than marking the path of an underground facilities. In some cases, providing such technician annotations on a visual representation of a marking operation may be desirable; however, in other instances such annotations may provide erratic markings on a visual representation, in which case additional processing of geo-location data or other information in the electronic record (e.g., filtering, averaging, interpolating and\/or otherwise \u201csmoothing\u201d the data) may be employed.","In yet another embodiment, a single or composite visual representation of a marking operation, including one or both of marking information and landmark information, may rendered on a display device together with a digital image representative of at least a portion of a dig area at a work site, such that one or more electronic locate marks and\/or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks appear in appropriate relative positions overlaid on the displayed digital image.  illustrates yet another example of a composite visual representation , albeit based on an electronic record different than that used to generate the visual representations of , in which continuous lines are used to indicate the respective different underground facilities marked, and these lines are overlaid on a digital image of a dig area, together with identifiers for environmental landmarks. It should be appreciated that although continuous lines representing underground facilities are depicted on a digital image in , in other embodiments discrete electronic locate marks corresponding to successive actuations of a marking device (or multiple discrete electronic locate marks per actuation) may be overlaid on a digital image of the dig area.","In the embodiment of , a number of different image sources and image types may be employed to provide the digital image on which a visual representation of a marking operation may be overlaid. For purposes of the present disclosure, such a digital image (also referred to herein as an \u201cinput image\u201d) may be any image represented by source data that is electronically processed (e.g., the source data is in a computer-readable format) to display the image on a display device. An input image may include any of a variety of paper\/tangible image sources that are scanned (e.g., via an electronic scanner) or otherwise converted so as to create source data (e.g., in various formats such as XML, PDF, JPG, BMP, etc.) that can be processed to display the input image. An input image also may include an image that originates as source data or an electronic file without necessarily having a corresponding paper\/tangible copy of the image (e.g., an image of a \u201creal-world\u201d scene acquired by a digital still frame or video camera or other image acquisition device, in which the source data, at least in part, represents pixel information from the image acquisition device).","In some exemplary implementations, input images according to the present disclosure may be created, provided, and\/or processed by a geographic information system (GIS) that captures, stores, analyzes, manages and presents data referring to (or linked to) location, such that the source data representing the input image includes pixel information from an image acquisition device (corresponding to an acquired \u201creal world\u201d scene or representation thereof), and\/or spatial\/geographic information (\u201cgeo-encoded information\u201d).","In view of the foregoing, various examples of input images and source data representing input images according to the present disclosure, to which the inventive concepts disclosed herein may be applied, include but are not limited to:\n\n","It should also be appreciated that source data representing an input image may be compiled from multiple data\/information sources; for example, any two or more of the examples provided above for input images and source data representing input images, or any two or more other data sources, can provide information that can be combined or integrated to form source data that is electronically processed to display an image on a display device.","As noted above, in some implementations an input image may be indexed to Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates or another coordinate system that provides geo-spatial positioning. An input image may include geo-coding or other geographical identification metadata and may be provided in any computer-readable format. An input image may also include images of map symbols, such as roads and street names, that may be superimposed upon or displayed separately from an underlying geographic area when the input image is displayed on a display device.","Based on the foregoing, a digital image may be displayed in an available display field of a display device either before or after electronic locate marks and\/or identifiers for environmental landmarks are displayed in the available display field. For example, in one implementation, after the block  in , all or a portion of the digital image may be mapped to the available display field based on any relevant geographic information accompanying the digital image (e.g., GPS coordinates to which the image is indexed). Alternatively, the digital image may be mapped first to the available display field of the display device depending on appropriate scaling and\/or transformation parameters as would be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, and thereafter one or more electronic locate marks and\/or one or more identifiers for environmental landmarks similarly may be mapped to the available display field in appropriate positions relative to the underlying digital image. In the example of , a first visual representation of a gas line  is depicted, a second visual representation of a communication line  is depicted, and a third visual representation of an electric line  is depicted on an aerial image of a residential dig area for purposes of illustration. As discussed above in connection with other embodiments, these visual representations may be displayed in different colors and\/or line types to denote different types of underground facilities and\/or various attributes of a given facility. As also illustrated in , other types of markings may be included as part of the displayed image, including environmental landmarks such as junction boxes or transformers , streets, property boundaries, tie-downs (reference lines between marked facilities and environmental landmarks and\/or property boundaries) and their associated dimensions, and one or more text boxes  (e.g., to indicate an address of the work site over the residence), and the like.","As noted earlier, it should be appreciated that the general concepts outlined above in connection with visual renderings may be applied similarly to locate information contained in event entries and\/or one or more electronic records generated by a locate device or a combined locate and marking device. For example, in addition to, or alternatively to, one or both of marking information and landmark information, an electronic representation of locate information (e.g., geo-location data relating to detection of one or more underground facilities) may be visually rendered in a display field, including overlaying such an electronic representation on a digital (input) image. In this manner, a comprehensive visual representation of activity relating to a locate and marking operation may be generated. In various exemplary implementations, locate information may be filtered, interpolated, smoothed or otherwise processed, as discussed above in connection with marking information and landmark information. Additionally, locate information and marking information, if displayed together, may be differentiated in a display field in any of a variety of manners (e.g., different line types, symbols or patterns; different colors or shades of related colors; artificially offset from each other in the display field if marking information and locate information overlap or are sufficiently close to each other in some instances, etc.) to allow for visual perception of both locate information and marking information.","To this end, in one embodiment, each of locate information, marking information and landmark information, if present in a computer-aided visual rendering, as well as any constituent information forming part of the locate information, marking information and landmark information, may be displayed as separate \u201clayers\u201d of the visual rendering, such that a viewer of the visual rendering may turn on and turn off displayed information based on a categorization of the displayed information. For example, all locate information may be categorized generally under one layer designation (\u201clocate layer\u201d), and independently enabled or disabled for display (e.g., hidden) accordingly. Similarly, all marking information may be categorized generally under another layer designation (\u201cmarking layer\u201d) and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly, and all landmark information may be categorized generally under yet another layer designation (\u201clandmark layer\u201d) and independently enabled or disabled for display accordingly. Respective layers may be enabled or disabled for display in any of a variety of manners; for example, in one implementation, a \u201clayer directory\u201d or \u201clayer legend\u201d pane may be included in the display field (or as a separate window selectable from the display field of the visual rendering), showing all available layers, and allowing a viewer to select each available layer to be either displayed or hidden, thus facilitating comparative viewing of layers.","Furthermore, any of the above-mentioned general categories for layers may have sub-categories for sub-layers, such that each sub-layer may also be selectively enabled or disabled for viewing by a viewer. For example, under the general layer designation of \u201cmarking layer,\u201d different facility types that may have been marked during a marking operation (and indicated in the marking information by color, for example) may be categorized under different sub-layer designations (e.g., \u201cmarking layer\u2014electric;\u201d \u201cmarking layer\u2014gas;\u201d etc.); in this manner, a viewer may be able to hide only the electric marking information while viewing the gas marking information, or vice versa, in addition to having the option to view or hide all marking information. Sub-layer designations similarly may be employed for the locate information and the landmark information (e.g., \u201clandmark layer\u2014water\/sewer;\u201d \u201clandmark layer\u2014CATV\u201d). Virtually any characteristic of the information available for display may serve to categorize the information for purposes of display layers or sub-layers; for example, a locate sub-layer designation of \u201clocate layer\u2014battery low\u201d may be employed to specifically enable or disable for display any data points in the locate information that were collected when locate status information indicated a low battery condition (and, as a result, possibly suspect data).","Various examples of visual representations such as those illustrated in  may be used for various purposes, including, but not limited to:\n\n","Regarding the marking devices, locate devices and combined locate and marking devices according to various embodiments of the invention described herein, the data (e.g., locate information and marking information) that may be acquired and analyzed is not limited to that described with reference to the various figures and tables herein, and may be used for any purpose. The data of interest that may be acquired and analyzed may include, but is not limited to, various timestamp data, geo-location information, direction information, any information included in the standard data stream of the locate tracking system (e.g., GPS system), color\/type of marking material, amount of marking material in a marking dispenser, serial number of marking dispenser (e.g., barcode, RFID), ID information (e.g., individual, vehicle, wage and\/or hour compliance), battery status of the device, angle of spray of marking material (e.g., using an inclinometer), wired\/wireless connection status, Bluetooth\u00ae signal strength, storage capacity of the local memory, temperature, humidity, light level, movement of the device, mode of operation of the device, docking state of the device (e.g., docked\/undocked, charging\/not charging), alerts against expectations in performance (e.g., compare amount and\/or type of marking material sprayed against facility maps), and any combination thereof.","The information, such as shown in various tables herein, that may be acquired by use of the data acquisition systems, apparatus and methods described herein, may be used for any purpose. In an embodiment, the information of the data acquisition system may be analyzed against expected locate and marking operations in order to gain benefits in, for example, operating efficiency, personnel management, inventory management, quality control, training operations, safety, customer satisfaction, and the like.","Additionally, the information that is acquired by use of the data acquisition systems, apparatus, and methods of the present disclosure may be correlated to other aspects of locate and marking operations. This correlation may occur, for example, by performing complex event processing (CEP) using multiple data streams from multiple devices. For example, one or more data streams (e.g., respective event entries or one or more electronic records) transmitted by a locate device, a marking device, or a combined locate and marking device may be correlated to information obtained from one or more other devices in order to aggregate, assess, evaluate, draw insights from, take action on this information, and any combination thereof. Correlating disparate data streams may be useful in order to better interpret and\/or gain new interpretations that are useful. For example, by analyzing the aggregated data, field service providers may gain visibility into the distributed workforce, may take corrective and\/or any other constructive action to improve process management, may improve and\/or develop best practices, and any combination thereof. In an embodiment, certain trends may be identified by correlating historical records of the amount of time that is spent performing locate and marking operations to other information, such as, but not limited to, the time of day, time of year, address of the locate site, experience of the locate technician, weather conditions, heavy or light traffic times, and the like.","While various inventive embodiments have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and\/or structures for performing the function and\/or obtaining the results and\/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and\/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the inventive embodiments described herein.

In general, the term \u201cor\u201d as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. \u201cone or the other but not both\u201d) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as \u201ceither,\u201d \u201cone of,\u201d \u201conly one of,\u201d or \u201cexactly one of.\u201d \u201cConsisting essentially of,\u201d when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.","As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase \u201cat least one,\u201d in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase \u201cat least one\u201d refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, \u201cat least one of A and B\u201d (or, equivalently, \u201cat least one of A or B,\u201d or, equivalently \u201cat least one of A and\/or B\u201d) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.","In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccarrying,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d \u201cholding,\u201d \u201ccomposed of,\u201d and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases \u201cconsisting of\u201d and \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIGS. 1B and 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"120"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A and 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIGS. 14 and 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIGS. 17 and 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":"FIGS. 19 and 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":"FIG. 23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 24"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
