{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention is in the field of methods, systems, and computer program products for a centralized universal resource locator (URL) commenting service enabling metadata aggregation.","Many web sites and web-based applications allow for user commenting, which permits visitors or registered members of the web sites or users of the web applications to associate self-authored free-text with other data. For example, solutions such as Disqus (DISQUS.COM) offer web sites the ability to surface a commenting widget. The commenting widget enables users the ability to comment on the web pages of the web sites.","Commenting is a social activity, meaning more than one user has access to comment on a web page, and there are no (or relatively minor) restrictions on what constitutes a \u201ccomment\u201d\u2014a comment is just free text. Thus, users often use variants of the same words in their comments. This is especially true in a system where disparate web sites with varying user populations with varying domains of knowledge and vocabulary feed into a central comment database.","An embodiment of the invention includes a method for centralized URL commenting, wherein user-generated comment data is extracted from web pages on a plurality of web sites. Access control parameters are also obtained from the web sites. The comment data is tagged with identifiers indicating the web sites that the comment data was extracted from, URLs indicating the web pages that the comment data are on, and authors of the comment data. The comment data is stored in a repository. Keywords are extracted from the comment data; and, the keywords are normalized. The normalizing of the keywords includes creating a single normalized keyword for multiple keywords related to the same topic, and tagging comment data that include at least one of the multiple keywords with the normalized keyword. Read access and\/or write access to the repository is controlled based on the access control parameters.","Another embodiment of the invention provides a system for centralized URL commenting, wherein the system includes an aggregation module for extracting user-generated comment data from web pages of a plurality of web sites. A registration module obtains access control parameters from the web sites; and, a processor tags the comment data. The comment data is tagged with identifiers indicating the web sites that the comment data was extracted from, URLs indicating the web pages that the comment data are on, and authors of the comment data. The system further includes a repository for storing the comment data. A text analyzer extracts keywords from the comment data and normalizes the keywords to create a single normalized keyword for multiple keywords related to the same topic. The processor tags comment data that include at least one of the multiple keywords with the normalized keyword. An access controller is provided for controlling read access and\/or write access to the repository based on the access control parameters.","Exemplary, non-limiting, embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below. While specific configurations are discussed to provide a clear understanding, it should be understood that the disclosed configurations are provided for illustration purposes only. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other configurations may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","An embodiment of the invention provides a common service for aggregating commenting data and providing federated services across large numbers of web spaces. Furthermore, embodiments herein provide text indexing (extracting searchable keywords from user-authored free text) and normalization services across the extracted keyword data. For example, the word MOUSE in a comment on one site's web page is related to the word MICE in a comment on another site's web page. The commenting data aggregated from multiple sites is then exposed via a variety of services and widgets enabling the benefits of data federation\u2014i.e., the collection of commenting data from multiple sources or social web spaces into a single physical or logical repository.","At least one embodiment of the invention provides a service that enables web applications to collect and display user-authored comment data on their sites with access control using services or widgets (application services). The service enables aggregation of commenting data and normalizes keywords extracted from the user-authored comments to support federated services across all sites and comments. More specifically, a centralized service provides a browser-based interface for users of a web site to enter comments associated with URLs. The client is loaded from the service and rendered via the browser so that it appears on the third party web site. Users' comments are stored by the service in such a way that allows each web application or web site to have a distinct collection of comments with configurable access control applied to each.","For example, in one embodiment, a web site enables comment-based search across only web pages from its own sites. In another embodiment, the web site enables comment-based search across web pages from one or more other sites. Keywords extracted from comments (e.g., via known methods of unstructured text analysis) are normalized across all collections, i.e., the keywords are transformed as necessary utilizing other keywords extracted from all comments across all sites such that keyword variants are associated with a single, normalized form of the keyword.","The centralized service further offers data and\/or graphical user interface (GUI) services for accessing and interacting with the data. For instance, in one embodiment, a browser-based interface is provided for web applications and web sites to surface (i.e., retrieve) the commenting data that has been entered on their and others' sites in various forms, such as, for example, keyword \u201cclouds\u201d to highlight often-used words and concepts. A mechanism for searching the central commenting repository is also provided, subject to the configured application-specific access control. The searches utilize the normalized form of keywords to find URL matches for keyword variants across comment collections from all sites.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"110"},"In one embodiment, the comment data is extracted from widgets on the web pages, wherein the widgets are commonly used among all of the web pages, i.e., a uniform commenting widget that is standard among all of the web sites. In another embodiment, the comment data is extracted from a user interface on the web page, wherein the user interface is not commonly used among all of the web pages, i.e., a specialized user interface that is not standard among all of the web sites (e.g., a customized commenting interface that is unique to XYZNEWS.COM).","In at least one embodiment of the invention, the widgets are uploaded onto the web pages for entering and\/or viewing the comment data. In another embodiment, the widgets surface results of analysis of the comment data, e.g., query results for related content or related people.","Access control parameters are also obtained from the web sites . In at least one embodiment, the access control parameters are obtained via a registration process, wherein the web sites register with the ECS system.  illustrates an ECS system  for centralized URL commenting according to an embodiment of the invention. The system  includes an aggregation module  for extracting the comment data and a registration module  for obtaining the access control parameters. As described more fully below, the access control parameters control read and write access to the comment data. For example, a user A has authorization to read comments on web applications X, Y, and Z, but only has authorization to write comments on web application X.","The system further includes a processor  for tagging the comment data with identifiers that indicate the web sites that the comment data was extracted from . In one embodiment, the identifiers include a one or two word description of the web sites, e.g., sports, travel, news, weather, shopping, personals, social networking. In at least one embodiment, the comment data is also tagged with the URLs that indicate the web pages that the comment data are on (e.g., SPORTSNEWS.COM or SPORTSNEWS.COM\/FOOTBALLNEWS\/CHICAGO\/JOHNSMITH.20100701) and\/or the authors of the comment data (e.g., the registered user that commented on the news story). The comment data is stored in a repository , .","A text analyzer  extracts keywords from the comment data . For example, the keywords DIGITAL, CAMERA, VIDEO, MEGAPIXEL, ZOOM, BATTERY, MEMORY, and USB are extracted from an ELECTRONICS.COM web page directed towards a digital camera. In at least one embodiment, the keywords are generated by the web sites and\/or the system .","The text analyzer  also normalizes the extracted keywords by creating a single normalized keyword for multiple keywords related to the same topic . For example, the text analyzer  creates the normalized keyword PHOTO for the keywords PHOTO, PHOTOS, PHOTOGRAPH, PHOTOGRAPHS, PHOTOGRAPHIC, PHOTOGRAPHY, PICTURE, and PICTURES. Comment data that includes at least one of the multiple keywords is tagged with the normalized keyword . Thus, in the above example, comment data in the repository  that includes one or more of the keywords PHOTO, PHOTOS, PHOTOGRAPH, PHOTOGRAPHS, PHOTOGRAPHIC, PHOTOGRAPHY, PICTURE, or PICTURES, is tagged with the normalized keyword PHOTO. In at least one embodiment, the comment data is not stored in the repository  until after the comment data is tagged with the normalized keyword.","At least one embodiment of the invention replaces a normalized keyword with an updated normalized keyword. The normalized keyword is updated based on comment data in the repository  at the time the normalized keyword was created, new comment data extracted from the web sites since the normalized keyword was created, and\/or search terms used to query the repository . For example, the normalized keyword PHOTO is replaced with the updated normalized keyword IMAGE based on comment data in the repository  that includes the keywords IMAGE and\/or IMAGES at the time the normalized keyword PHOTO was created, new comment data extracted from the web sites including the keywords IMAGE and\/or IMAGES since the normalized keyword PHOTO was created, and\/or queries of the repository  including the search terms IMAGE and\/or IMAGES.","In at least one embodiment, the comment data tagged with the normalized keyword is further tagged with the updated normalized keyword, or the normalized keyword is replaced with the updated normalized keyword. In another embodiment of the invention, the normalized keyword remains the same, but now includes the new keywords related to the same topic that were discovered during the updating. Thus, in the example above, the normalized keyword PHOTO remains PHOTO after the updating, but is updated to include the keywords IMAGE and IMAGES. In other words, comment data including the keywords IMAGE and\/or IMAGES are tagged with the normalized keyword PHOTO.","In another example, comment data including the keywords CAT, KITTEN, KITTY, PET, or ANIMAL is tagged with the normalized keyword CAT . After an update is performed based on comment data in the repository  at the time the normalized keyword CAT was created, new comment data extracted from the web sites since the normalized keyword CAT was created, and\/or search terms used to query the repository , comment data including the keyword FELINE is tagged with the normalized keyword CAT.","In at least one embodiment, the comment data is not tagged with a normalized keyword; rather, the repository  is queried for a keyword and the multiple keywords related to the same topic. Thus, in the above example, when a user queries the repository  for the keyword PHOTOGRAPH, the repository  is also automatically queried for PHOTO, PHOTOS, PHOTOGRAPHS, PHOTOGRAPHIC, PHOTOGRAPHY, PICTURE, and PICTURES.","An access controller  controls access to the repository  based on the access control parameters . Access to the repository  includes read access and\/or write access. In at least one embodiment, access to the repository  is via a graphical user interface, wherein the graphical user interface and\/or the repository  are separate from the web sites.","In at least one embodiment, read access includes querying the repository . More specifically, a search engine  that includes hardware (e.g., processor, user interface) and\/or software components queries the repository  using search terms input by a user. Thus, in one embodiment, a repository query including a URL is received, wherein results of the query include comment data tagged with the URL, authors of the comment data tagged with the URL, an identifier tagged to the comment data tagged with the URL, normalized keywords tagged to the comment data tagged with the URL, keywords extracted from the comment data tagged with the URL, and\/or other data including results of analysis of the comment data (e.g., representations of sentiment associated with the URL). For example, query results for MOVIEREVIEWS.COM include comments posted by visitors of MOVIEREVIEWS.COM, the authors of the comment data, the identifier MOVIE REVIEWS, the normalized keyword MOVIE, and the keywords MOVIE, MOVIES, THEATER, CINEMA, FILM, and MOTION PICTURE.","In another embodiment, a repository query including an author (e.g., name, user name\/ID, handle, and\/or e-mail address) is received, wherein the query results include comment data tagged with the author, URLs tagged to the comment data tagged with the author, identifiers tagged to the comment data tagged with the author, normalized keywords tagged to the comment data tagged with the author, keywords extracted from the comment data tagged with the author, and\/or other data including results of analysis of the comment data (e.g., representations of sentiment associated with the author). For example, query results for BOB SMITH or BOBSMITH include comments posted by BOB SMITH, the URLs where the comments are posted (e.g., MOVIEREVIEWS.COM, CINEMA2010.COM), the identifier MOVIE REVIEWS, the normalized keyword MOVIE, and the keywords MOVIE, MOVIES, THEATER, CINEMA, FILM, and MOTION PICTURE.","In another embodiment, a repository query including a normalized keyword is received, wherein the query results include comment data tagged with the normalized keyword, authors of the comment data tagged with the normalized keyword, URLs tagged to the comment data tagged with the normalized keyword, identifiers tagged to the comment data tagged with the normalized keyword, and\/or keywords extracted from the comment data tagged with the normalized keyword. For example, query results for the normalized keyword TRAVEL include comments tagged with the normalized keyword TRAVEL (e.g., comments regarding cruise line XYZ), the authors of the comments, URLs of the web pages having the comments (e.g., TRAVEL.COM, AIRFARE.COM, AIRFARE.COM\/MIAMI, AIRFACE.COM\/MIAMI\/ 20100701), the identifier TRAVEL, and the keywords TRAVEL, VACATION, FLIGHTS, AIRFARE, CRUISES, RENTALS, CAR RENTALS, HOTELS, MOTELS, and LODGING.","In another embodiment, a repository query including an identifier is received, wherein the query results include comment data tagged with the identifier, authors of the comment data tagged with the identifier, URLs tagged to the comment data tagged with the identifier, normalized keywords tagged to the comment data tagged with the identifier, keywords extracted from the comment data tagged with the identifier, and\/or other data including results of analysis of the comment data (e.g., representations of sentiment associated with the identifier). For example, query results for the identifier JOBS include comment data tagged with the identifier JOBS (e.g., comments regarding employer XYZ, comments regarding software engineering jobs in Palo Alto, Calif.), authors of the comment data, URLs where the comment data is posted (e.g., JOBS.COM), the normalized keyword JOBS, and the keywords JOBS, CAREER, EMPLOYMENT, EMPLOYER, EMPLOYEE, EMPLOY, CLASSIFIEDS, OCCUPATION, PROFESSION, TRADE, and VOCATION.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","310","312","300","300","310","300"]},"The registration process provides the web site administrator  with a site ID (also referred to herein as an \u201cidentifier\u201d) by which data collected from the web site administrator \u2032s web site is segmented from data collected from other third party web sites. When the users  comment on pages on the third party web site, the information collected by the ECS system  is associated with the site ID. This allows for the scoping of data reads and data writes via the ECS system  to the site ID of a third party web site. In this way, the ECS system  associates comment data for any and all web sites with the source web site (via its site ID). This powers access control and other federated services provided by an ECS-provided commenting widget , a dashboard  (i.e., search interface), and a representational state transfer application program interface (REST API) .","The web site administrator  enables the users  to comment on web pages on their web site in a variety of ways. Specifically, the web site administrator  embeds the commenting widget  on their application  or creates its own commenting interface in their application  that interacts with the REST API . When the users  view the third party web site's web pages, they interact with the provided mechanisms to comment on the web pages. The act of commenting implicitly associates the comment(s) entered by the users  with the current page's URL, the identity of the user doing the commenting, and\/or the site ID issued by the registration management module .","In at least one embodiment, the third party web site has a full-service commenting component already part of their application . That is, the web site has its own commenting interface (to enable the users  to comment on web pages that are part of the web site) and commenting database (to store the comment-related data locally to the application). A data loader  provides the ability to load data from the application  such that the commenting data collected by the third party web site is aggregated in a central place in the ECS system . In at least one embodiment, the third party web site makes its commenting data available over hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) in any well-formed extensible markup language (XML) format. When registering the web site via the registration management module , the site administrator  provides a URL and other information to allow the data loader  to load data from their web site into a central electronic database  (also referred to herein as the \u201crepository\u201d). The loaded data is associated with the site ID issued by the registration management module .","The commenting data in the database \u2014added either via the commenting widget , the REST API , or the data loader \u2014undergoes processing. In at least one embodiment of the invention, the processing occurs before the commenting data is added to the database . The raw comments entered by the users  are stored in the database in their raw form, but are also analyzed via a comment text analyzer  to extract keywords from the raw comments and\/or to perform other kinds of analysis, including but not limited to sentiment analysis, etc.","A normalization module  ensures that variations of keywords are associated with one another so that, for example, comments containing the keywords \u201cCAT,\u201d \u201ccat,\u201d \u201ccaat,\u201d and \u201ccats\u201d are associated with one another. The dashboard , normalization module , and ECS comment-based search in general, first normalizes the search terms and performs the search using the normalized terms. This ensures that any URLs whose comments contain keywords matching any variants of the search terms are located and returned as results.","ECS normalization is an asynchronous process that analyzes the keywords associated with the comment data in the database  to improve the keyword normalization results. It does so by learning from the keyword data present in the database . For example, if a page has a comment by a user containing the keyword \u201cNeuralNets\u201d (one of many commonly used syntaxes for commenting) the keyword may, initially, be normalized to \u201cneuralnets\u201d. However, if another user enters a comment for a (potentially) different URL with \u201cneural\u201d in its text, for example, the next time the normalization process runs, it recognizes that \u201cneural\u201d is a word used by other commenters and re-normalizes \u201cneuralnet\u201d to \u201cneural_net\u201d. This is an example of how the asynchronous normalization process can learn from the commenting data to improve its normalization of keywords.","The commenting widget , which is loaded on a particular web page, displays existing comments that the users  have made via the commenting widget . It also provides a mechanism by which a user  can enter a new comment. In at least one embodiment, the commenting widget  enables the users  to sort comments by date or hierarchy, report \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments, create multiple levels of comments (i.e., comments on comments), and\/or edit or delete their existing comments. The commenting widget  is served by the ECS system  and the comments created via the commenting widget  are stored in the central electronic database .","In at least one embodiment of the invention, the users  consume the comment data via a related content widget. The related content widget , which is loaded on a particular page, surfaces URLs related to the current page, where \u201crelated\u201d is determined by analysis of the commenting data associated with the page. For example, the keywords derived from a web page's comments (in their normalized form) are used to find and surface pages in the database  that have similar keywords. In at least one embodiment, the related content widget surfaces a \u201ccloud\u201d of keywords scoped to either a web site ID, multiple web site IDs, or all publically-readable web site IDs (as defined by the configured access control for each third party web site at registration time). In addition, the users  request a really simple syndication (RSS)-formatted feed of URLs commented by a particular user, or an Atom-formatted feed of comments associated with a particular URL, via a REST API.","In at least one embodiment of the invention, the methods by which commenting data is surfaced are subject to the access control levels configured for the site ID that the data is associated with. Because site IDs enable commenting data to be scoped to a particular web site or application, all reads can be scoped to one site ID, many site IDs, or all publically-readable (as defined by the configured access control for each third party web site at registration time) web site data in the database . As mentioned, part of the power of aggregating commenting data across multiple third party web sites is that useful analytics can be performed on a large and disparate corpus of data. The dashboard  surfaces aspects of these analyses, such as statistics related to usage and data connected by common metadata, such as URLs commented on by users that tend to use similar keywords (as derived from the raw comments). These analyses are potentially extremely powerful.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized.
