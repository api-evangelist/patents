Field of the Invention","The present invention relates, in general, to an apparatus for measuring dimensions of a spacer grid for nuclear fuel assemblies and, more particularly, to an apparatus for measuring dimensions of a spacer grid for nuclear fuel assemblies, capable of measuring all the sides of the spacer grid that support the nuclear fuel assemblies to accurately detect abnormalities in the spacer grid, preventing the spacer grids from interfering with each other, and preventing malfunctions from occurring in the real situation of a nuclear reactor in advance to provide reliability.","2. Description of the Related Art","Atomic power generation based on a light water reactor is designed to generate energy via the fission of nuclear fuel and use the energy to heat primary cooling water, transmit the energy of the heated primary cooling water to secondary cooling water in a steam generator to generate steam, convert the generated steam into rotational energy with a steam turbine, and produce electricity with a generator.","In general, apparatuses that measure spacer grids for the light water reactor measure all the sides of a spacer grid for a plurality of nuclear fuel assemblies stored at a fuel storage place.","All the sides of the spacer grid are measured using such a spacer grid measuring apparatus, thereby detecting abnormalities in the sides of the spacer grid.","Examples of the related art include Korean Patent No. 10-0784008, entitled \u201cNUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLY LOW PRESSURE DROP TOP NOZZLE\u201d and Korean Patent Application Publication No. 10-2001-0029780, entitled \u201cFUEL ASSEMBLY MECHANICAL FLOW RESTRICTION APPARATUS FOR DETECTING FAILURE IN SITU OF NUCLEAR FUEL RODS IN A FUEL ASSEMBLY DURING REACTOR SHUTDOWN.\u201d","As shown in , an apparatus for measuring a spacer grid of the related art includes a fixing unit  fixed to a measuring table  placed on a floor and kept safe from vibrations caused by external force.","A pair of measuring units  is mounted on the fixing unit . The pair of measuring units  is capable of grasping both sides of a rectangular spacer grid  disposed therein and moving in forward and backward directions, thereby measuring the both sides of the spacer grid .","However, the measuring units are too short to measure the whole length of the sides of the spacer grid, so that there can be unmeasured portions.","Thus, abnormalities in the unmeasured portions of the spacer grid cause abnormal effects in the supported nuclear fuel assemblies when operated.","Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems of the related art, and an objective of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for measuring dimensions of a spacer grid for nuclear fuel assemblies, capable of measuring all the sides of the spacer grid for the nuclear fuel assemblies to accurately detect abnormalities in the measured spacer grid, avoiding reducing the life span of the nuclear fuel assemblies, and preventing malfunctions from occurring in the real operation of a nuclear reactor to provide reliability.","In order to achieve the above described objective, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for measuring the dimensions of a spacer grid for nuclear fuel assemblies stored at a fuel storage place for use in a light water reactor.
