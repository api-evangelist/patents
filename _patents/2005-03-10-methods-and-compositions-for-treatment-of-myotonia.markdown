The United States Government has certain rights to the invention","Microsatellite Expansion Diseases","Aberrant expansion of microsatellites in DNA is associated with a number of neurological and neuromuscular diseases (O'Donnell, W T, Warren, S T (2002), 25: 315). These diseases are caused by microsatellite repeat expansions in coding and non-coding regions. The characterized coding region expansion diseases include Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD), Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA17). The characterized non-coding region expansion diseases include Fragile XA, Fragile XE, Friedrich's ataxia, Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Myotonic Dystrophy type 2 (DM2), and Spinocerebellar ataxia types 8, 10, and 12 (SCA8, SCA10, SCA12). Huntington's disease-like type 2 (HDL2) is likewise caused by a microsatellite expansion.","Microsatellite expansion diseases have been most commonly associated with trinucleotide expansion mutations. In fact, at least 16 of the microsatellite expansion diseases reported to date have been characterized as trinucleotide expansion diseases. More recently, however, microsatellite expansion diseases have also been associated with tetranucleotide and even pentanucleotide expansion mutations. Disease severity and age of onset have both been related to the size of the expansion mutation, eventually leading to muscle weakness and premature cataract formation, and, in severe cases, to hypotonia, muscle heart block, and nervous system dysfunction (Korade-Mirnics, Z, Babitzke, P, Hoffman, E (1998) 26(6): 1363-1368).","Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica, DM) is a multisystemic, dominantly inherited disorder often characterized by myotonia, or, delayed muscle relaxation due to repetitive action potentials in myofibers, and muscle degeneration. Manifestations of DM may also include heart block, ocular cataracts, hypogonadism, and nervous system dysfunction.","Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a trinucleotide (CTG)expansion (n=50 to >3000) in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of the Dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a tetranucleotide (CCTG)expansion (n=75 to \u02dc11,000) in the first intron of zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene (Ranum, L P W, Day, J W (2002) 12:266-271).","Although the expansions are located on different chromosomes, there appears to be a common pathogenic mechanism involving the accumulation of transcripts into discrete nuclear RNA foci containing long tracts of CUG or CCUG repeats expressed from the expanded allele (Liquori C L, Ricker K, Moseley M L, Jacobsen J F, Kress W, Naylor S L, Day J W, Ranum L P (2001), 293: 864-867).","In effect, both DM1 and DM2 mutant transcripts accumulate as foci within muscle nuclei (Liquori, et al., 2001). An indication that these transcripts are pathogenic comes from studies on HSAmice, which express a large CTG repeat in the 3\u2032-UTR of a human skeletal actin transgene (Mankodi, A, Logigian, E, Callahan, L, McClain, C, White, R, Henderson, D, Krym, M, Thornton, C A (2000) 289: 1769-1773). These transgenic mice develop myonuclear RNA foci, myotonia, and degenerative muscle changes similar to those seen in human DM. The myotonia in HSAmice is caused by loss of skeletal muscle chloride (ClC-1) channels due to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing (Mankodi, A, Takahashi, M P, Jiang, H, Beck, C L, Bowers, W J, Moxley, R T, Cannon, S C, Thornton, C A (2002) 10: 35-44). Similar ClC-1 splicing defects exist in DM1 and DM2. However, the connection between accumulation of mutant DM transcripts in the nucleus and altered splice site selection has not been established (Faustino, N A, Cooper, T A (2003) 17: 419-437).","The RNA gain-of-function hypothesis proposes that mutant DM transcripts alter the function and localization of alternative splicing regulators, which are critical for normal RNA processing. Consistent with this proposal, misregulated alternative splicing in DM1 has been demonstrated for six pre-mRNAs: cardiac troponin T (cTNT), insulin receptor (IR), muscle-specific chloride channel (ClC-1), tau, myotubularin-related protein 1 (MTMR1) and fast skeletal troponin T (TNNT3) (Kanadia R N, Johnstone K A, Mankodi A, Lungu C, Thornton C A, Esson D, Timmers A M, Hauswirth W W, Swanson M S (2003), 302: 1978-1980).","In all cases, normal mRNA splice variants are produced, but the normal developmental splicing pattern is disrupted, resulting in expression of fetal protein isoforms that are inappropriate for adult tissues. The insulin resistance and myotonia observed in DM1 correlate with the disruption of splicing of two pre-mRNA targets, IR and ClC-1, respectively (Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A, Dalton J C, Moseley M L, Ranum L P, Day J W (2004), 74:1309-1313).","The mechanism by which expanded repeats alter the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing is unclear. Two families of RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in DM1 pathogenesis: CUG-BP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) and muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins (Ladd A N, Charlet-B N, Cooper T A (2001), 21: 1285-1296). Six CELF (also called BRUNOL) genes have been identified in humans (Ladd A N, Nguyen N H, Malhotra K, Cooper T A (2004), 279: 17756-17764). All six CELF proteins have been shown to regulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing and two (CUG-BP1 and ETR-3\/CUG-BP2) have been shown to have cytoplasmic RNA-associated functions (Mukhopadhyay D, Houchen C W, Kennedy S, Dieckgraefe B K, Anant S (2003), 11: 113-126).","A functional link has been established between splicing regulation by CELF proteins and DM1 pathogenesis. CUG-BP1 regulates alternative splicing of at least three of the pre-mRNAs (cTNT, IR and ClC-1) that are misregulated in DM striated muscle (Charlet-B N, Savkur R S, Singh G, Philips A V, Grice E A, Cooper T A (2002b), 10: 45-53). The splicing patterns observed for all three pre-mRNAs are consistent with increased CUG-BP1 activity and an increase in CUG-BP1 steady-state levels in DM1 striated muscle (Charlet-B N, Savkur R S, Singh G, Philips A V, Grice E A, Cooper T A (2002b), 10: 45-53).","Furthermore, cTNT minigenes expressed in DM1 muscle cultures or cTNT and IR pre-mRNAs co-expressed with CUG repeat RNA in normal cells reproduce the aberrant splicing patterns observed for endogenous genes in DM cells (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47). The trans-dominant effects of endogenous or co-expressed CUG repeat RNA on cTNT and IR splicing regulation require the intronic CUG-BP1-binding sites, indicating that binding by CUG-BP1 and\/or other CELF family members to their cognate intronic regulatory elements is required for induction of aberrant splicing regulation by CUG repeat RNA (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47).","The CNS symptoms of DM1 may include cognitive impairment, hypersomnolence, heightened sensitivity to anesthetic agents, central hypoventilation, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and effects on personality and behavior [reviewed by Harper (Harper, P. S. (2001), . Saunders London) and Ashizawa (Ashizawa, T. (1998), 55, 291-293)]. Some of these effects, such as, mental retardation in individuals with congenital DM1, occur during development (Dyken, P. R., Harper, P. S. (1973), 23, 465-473). Other symptoms, such as, hypersomnolence, appear during adult life. The mechanism and neuropathologic correlates for CNS involvement in DM1 are unknown.","It is presently unclear whether any steps in the pathogenic sequence of poly(CUG) expression, formation of RNA inclusions, sequestration of RNA binding proteins, and disruption of alternative splicing can take place in the CNS. There is controversy about which cells in the mature brain, if any, express DMPK (Lam, L. T., Pham, Y. C., Nguyen, T. M., and Morris, G. E. (2000), 9, 2167-2173).","Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced at exons 2, 3, and 10 (Goedert, M., Spillantini, M. G., Jakes, R., Rutherford, D., and Crowther, R. A. (1989), 3, 519-526). Tau transcripts in fetal brain do not include exon 10, whereas \u02dc50% of transcripts in adult brain include this exon which encodes an additional microtubule binding domain (Hong, M., Zhukareva, V., Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., Wszokek, Z., Reed, L., Miller, B. I., Geschwind, D. H., Bird, T. D., McKeel, D., Goate, A. et al. (1998), 282, 1914-1917). Alternative splicing of exons 2 and 3 also is developmentally regulated (neither exon is included in the fetus, adults mainly include exon 2).","The relative proportion of tau splice products is tightly regulated, as shown by kindreds with frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism (FTDP-17) due to mutations in MAPT. Silent mutations in MAPT exon 10, or, in the flanking intron, lead to FTDP-17 by disrupting cis elements that regulate splicing of tau pre-mRNA (D'Souza, I., Poorkaj, P., Hong, M., Nochlin, D., Lee, V. M., Bird, T. D., and Schellenberg, G. D. (1999), 96, 5598-5603). Usually these mutations lead to increased inclusion of exon 10 (Lee, V. M., Goedert, M., and Trojanowski, J. Q. (2001), 24, 1121-1159). However, some MAPT mutations that segregate with FTDP-17 have the opposite effect of reducing exon 10 inclusion (Stanford, P. M., Shepherd, C. E., Halliday, G. M., Brooks, W. S., Schofield, P. W., Brodaty, H., Martins, R. N., Kwok, J. B., and Schofield, P. R. (2003), 126, 814-826).","RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing bind to sequence-specific elements in the pre-mRNA to enhance or repress inclusion of alternative exons. Aberrant regulation of alternative splicing can cause the expression of inappropriate splicing patterns leading to human disease (Faustino and Cooper, 2003). Myotonic dystrophy constitutes an example of a disease that alters the function of RNA-binding proteins to cause misregulated alternative splicing.","The present disclosure provides methods and compositions for treating diseases associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion employing recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) expressing human muscleblind (MBNL) proteins.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method of treating a disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) containing a transgene that encodes a protein selected from the group consisting of MBNL1, MBNL2, MBNL3, and combinations thereof.

In another embodiment of the invention, the mammal in need of treatment has RNA inclusions in neuronal cells.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) containing a transgene that encodes at least one protein selected from the group consisting of MBNL1, MBNL2, MBNL3, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment of the invention, the protein is MBNL1.","The present disclosure also provides a mouse model for myotonic dystrophy, wherein the mouse has a substantial deletion of a muscleblind exon in its genome. Such an animal model for human disease allows the identification and testing of potential therapeutic and preventive agents.","Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is directed to a mouse model for disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion, comprising a mouse having a substantial deletion of Mbnl1 exon 3 (E3) in the mouse genome, wherein said mouse exhibits symptoms typical of a disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion in humans. In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a cell isolated from said mouse. In one embodiment of the invention, the mouse exhibits symptoms such as muscle weakness and ocular cataracts.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a mouse model for disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion, comprising a mouse having a substantial deletion of Mbnl1 exon 3 (E3) in the mouse genome, wherein said mouse exhibits symptoms typical of a disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion in humans, wherein the microsatellite repeat expansion disease is caused by a microsatellite expansion in a coding region of DNA. In another embodiment of the invention, the microsatellite repeat expansion disease is caused by a microsatellite expansion in a non-coding region of DNA.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a mouse model for disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion, comprising a mouse having a substantial deletion of Mbnl1 exon 3 (E3) in the mouse genome, wherein said mouse exhibits symptoms typical of a disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion in humans, wherein the mouse exhibits abnormal muscleblind proteins.

In an additional embodiment, the mouse may be monitored for effects other than those associated with the disease. In one embodiment of the invention, the disease is myotonic dystrophy.","Muscleblind Proteins","Proteins in the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family bind to expanded CUG repeats in vitro and colocalize with mutant DM and HSAtranscripts in vivo. Human muscleblind genes MBNL1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), MBNL2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), and MBNL3 (SEQ ID NO: 3) are homologous to the gene muscleblind, which is essential for muscle and eye differentiation. MBNL1, the major MBNL gene expressed in human skeletal muscle, encodes multiple protein isoforms, including some that bind to expanded CUG repeats (41 to 42 kD) and others that fail to bind (31 kD isoform), generated by exon 3 skipping.","In fact, MBNL1 was identified in HeLa cells based on its ability to bind double-stranded CUG repeats (Miller J W, Urbinati C R, Teng-Umnuay P, Stenberg M G, Byrne B J, Thornton C A, Swanson M S (2000), 19: 4439-4448). All three MBNL gene products colocalize with the expanded repeat RNA foci in vivo (Fardaei M, Rogers M T, Thorpe H M, Larkin K, Hamshere M G, Harper P S, Brook J D (2002), 11: 805-814). Loss of MBNL function due to sequestration on CUG repeat RNA is proposed to play a role in DM pathogenesis (Miller J W, Urbinati C R, Teng-Umnuay P, Stenberg M G, Byrne B J, Thornton C A, Swanson M S (2000), 19: 4439-4448). Thus, while expression of CUG and CCUG expansion RNAs induces MBNL recruitment into nuclear RNA foci, there is no evidence that this relocalization results in muscleblind depletion and functional impairment.","Recombinant Adeno-Associated Vectors","Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors have been used for expressing gene products in animals, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,193,941 and WO 94\/13788. Other patents and publications describe AAV vectors and uses, the uses generally being related to expression of gene products either in vitro (usually tissue cultures) or in vivo (usually in the lungs or oral mucosa, the normal sites of AAV infection, but expression in other tissues, such as the central nervous system and in cardiac tissue has been observed).","AAV vectors have certain advantages over other well-characterized vector systems. First, like adenovirus, AAV infects non-dividing cells. Second, all the AAV viral genes are eliminated in the vector. Since the viral gene expression-induced immune reaction is no longer a concern, AAV vectors are safer than adenovirus vectors. As AAV is an integration virus, integration into the host chromosome will maintain the transgene in the cells. AAV is an extremely stable virus, resistant to many detergents, pH changes and heat (stable at 56\u00b0 C. for about an hour). AAV can be lyophilized and redissolved without losing significant activity. Finally, AAV causes no known diseases or pathogenic symptoms in humans. Therefore, AAV is a very promising delivery vehicle for gene therapy.","Transduction of rAAV vectors harboring the bacterial \u03b2-galactosidase gene by single injection into the quadriceps of mice demonstrated that expression was maintained long-term and the expression did not decrease substantially during that time (Xiao et al., J. Virol., 70:8098-8108 (1996)). Other targets successfully transduced with rAAV vectors include: T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, human erythroleukemia cells, different regions of the rat brain, the striatum of the rat brain in a Parkinson's Disease model with the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, heart of the pig and rat with the LacZ gene, the peripheral auditory system of the guinea pig and bronchial epithelia of the rabbit and monkey.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a vector for effective expression of a protein with MBNL1, MBNL2, or MBNL3 (or combinations thereof) function to treat conditions associated with aberrant microsatellite expansions. In an additional embodiment, the vector of the invention is recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors. In one embodiment of the invention, the rAAV contains a transgene that expresses an MBNL1, MBNL2, or MBNL3 (or combinations thereof) protein. In an additional embodiment, the invention provides a rAAV containing a transgene that expresses MBNL1 (for example, the 41 kD isoform).","Isolation of the DNA encoding MBNL polypeptides allows one to use methods well-known to the person of ordinary skill in the art to make changes in the codons for specific amino acids such that the codons are \u201cpreferred usage\u201d codons for a given species.","In one embodiment, the rAAV of the invention includes a promoter, which directs the initiation of RNA transcription in the cell of interest. The promoter may be constitutive or regulated. Regulated promoters include inducible promoters and repressible promoters. In an additional embodiment of the invention, the regulation of the promoter is associated with an \u201coperator\u201d, to which an inducer or repressor binds. The promoter may be a \u201cubiquitous\u201d promoter active in essentially all cells of the host organism or may be a promoter with expression more or less specific to the target cells. Known strong promoters that find common use to obtain high levels of recombinant protein expression include the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, SV40 promoter and LTRs such as that obtained from Moloney leukemia retrovirus. For the gene to be expressed, the coding sequence must be operably linked to a promoter sequence functional in the target cell.","It is not necessary that the AAV-derived sequences correspond exactly with wild-type AAV prototypes. For example, in one embodiment, the rAAV vectors of the invention may feature modified inverted terminal repeats and other sequences, provided that the rAAV vectors can replicate and be packaged with the assistance of helper virus, and establish a nonpathogenic latent infection in target cells. Typically, because of the packaging limitations of AAV, the polynucleotides encoding MBNL1 domain sequences and the regulatory elements can have a length of up to about 5,500 bases.","Numerous applications of the present invention, e.g., making transgenic constructs, involve the cloning, synthesis, maintenance, mutagenesis, and other manipulations of nucleic acid sequences that can be performed using routine techniques in the field of recombinant genetics. Basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention include Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual (1990); and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al., eds., 1994)).","For propagation of the rAAV vectors in vitro, susceptible cells are co-transfected with an AAV-derived vector DNA and a suitable AAV-derived helper virus or plasmid harboring the AAV rep gene, AAV cap gene or both and infected by a helper virus, including herpesvirus, adenovirus or a suitable non-AAV helper plasmid using any number of transfection methods, including, inter alia, calcium-phosphate transfection, lipofection or other techniques known to those skilled in the art. The ratio of helper plasmids to the quantity of vector plasmid containing the gene of interest range from 1:1-1:10. This procedure produces recombinant AAV vectors; the vector plasmid contains the recombinant AAV genome flanked by the AAV ITRs. The AAV-derived helper virus or helper plasmid may be any virus or plasmid which is capable, on expression of the AAV genes it carries, of providing proteins necessary for the replication and packaging of the rAAV vector in a suitable host cell, for the purpose of producing rAAV vector stock.","In one embodiment, the target cells of the rAAV vectors of the invention are cells capable of expressing polypeptides with MBNL1 activity. In another embodiment of the invention, the cells are normal cells cultured in vitro. In further embodiments, the target cells of the rAAV vectors of the invention are human cells, or cells of other mammals, such as nonhuman primates and mammals of the orders Rodenta (mice, rats, rabbit and hamsters), Carnivora (cats and dogs) and Arteriodactyla (cows, pigs, sheep, goats and horses). In one embodiment of the invention, the cells are part of a living mammal at the time the rAAV vectors are delivered to the cell. The mammal may be at any stage of development at the time of delivery, e.g., embryonic, fetal, infantile, juvenile or adult. Additionally, the cells may be healthy or diseased.","In one embodiment, the rAAV vectors of the invention may be administered as viral particles alone, whether as an in vivo direct delivery to the vasculature or as an ex vivo treatment comprising administering the rAAV vector viral particles in vitro to cells from the animal receiving treatment followed by introduction of the transduced cells back into the donor. Alternatively, the rAAV vector virus particles can be used to transduce cells in conjunction with secondary agents known to enhance the efficiency of transduction, see, e.g., WO Ser. No. 95\/33824 for a variety of secondary agents. The effective amount of rAAV vectors to be administered will vary from patient to patient. Accordingly, effective amounts are best determined by the physician administering the rAAV vectors, and appropriate dosages can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art.","In one embodiment, the rAAV construct of the invention expresses human MBNL1 (rAAV-MBNL1 (rAAV-MBNL1\/41)). In an additional embodiment of the invention, injection of the rAAV-MBNL1\/41 into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of a transgenic model for DM that expresses a human skeletal \u03b1-actin transgene carrying 250 CTG repeats (HSA\u2014a mouse model which develops myotonia and muscle degeneration similar to muscle abnormalities seen in DM patients) results in a functional reversal of a DM-related phenotype, namely, reversal of mis-splicing of the Clcn1 skeletal muscle chloride channel, which results in myotonia.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods for treating or preventing various disorders and conditions associated with aberrant microsatellite expansions in a mammal, said method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of rAAV containing a transgene that encodes a protein selected from the group consisting of MBNL1, MBNL2, MBNL3, and combinations thereof. In a further embodiment of the invention, the protein is MBNL1. In another embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a human. In another embodiment, the transgene is human. In one embodiment of the invention, the disease associated with aberrant microsatellite expansion is a neurological or neuromuscular disease. In an additional embodiment of the invention, the disease is myotonic dystrophy. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the disease is SCA8.","In additional embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating or preventing a disease or condition related to any physiological process affected by MBNL1, said method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of rAAV containing a transgene that expresses the MBNL1 protein.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to methods for treating or preventing various disorders and conditions associated with aberrant microsatellite expansions in a mammal, said method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of rAAV containing a transgene that encodes a protein selected from the group consisting of MBNL1, MBNL2, MBNL3, and combinations thereof, wherein treating comprises reversing the mis-splicing of the Clcn1 skeletal muscle chloride channel.","In another embodiment of the invention, treating comprises reversing the mis-splicing of the Amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APP). The mis-splicing may correspond to alternative splicing of exon 7. In another embodiment of the invention, treating comprises reversing the mis-splicing of the NMDA receptor NR1 (GRIN1). The mis-splicing may correspond to alternative splicing of exon 5. In yet another embodiment of the invention, treating comprises reversing the mis-splicing of the Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT).

The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as injectable solutions, drug release capsules and the like.","For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.","The pharmaceutical forms suitable for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that parenteral administration is possible.

Such \u201ccombinatorial chemical libraries\u201d are then screened in one or more assays to identify those library members (particular chemical species or subclasses) that display as desired characteristic activity. The compounds thus identified can serve as conventional \u201clead compounds\u201d or can themselves be used as potential or actual therapeutics.","A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, by combining a number of chemical \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d such as reagents. Preparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries is well known to those of skill in the art. Such combinatorial chemical libraries include, but are not limited to, peptide libraries (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,175, Furka (1991) Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res., 37:487-493 and Houghton, et al.

Typically, once a \u201ctransgene\u201d is introduced into the cells of the host animal, it is maintained, either transiently or permanently, by, e.g., insertion into the host genome. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a transgene is inserted into the host genome by homologous recombination, thereby replacing the endogenous gene with the transgene. Often, a transgene contains a coding sequence, operably linked to a promoter, that encodes a protein, e.g., a marker protein that allows the detection of the transgene in the cell. \u201cTransgenic\u201d refers to any cell or organism that comprises a transgene.","A \u201chost\u201d animal or mammal refers to any animal that is used to practice the herein-described methods, i.e. animals into which a transgene is introduced to disrupt an endogenous MBNL1 gene. For use in the present invention, such animals include any non-human mammals including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, and hamsters.","\u201cNucleic acid\u201d refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA and nucleotide.","The terms \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d \u201cpeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer.","The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.","A \u201clabel\u201d or a \u201cdetectable moiety\u201d is a composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. For example, useful labels include P, fluorescent dyes, electron-dense reagents, enzymes (e.g., as commonly used in an ELISA), biotin, digoxigenin, or haptens and proteins which can be made detectable, e.g., by incorporating a radiolabel into the peptide or used to detect antibodies specifically reactive with the peptide.","The term \u201crecombinant\u201d when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.","The term \u201cheterologous\u201d when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).","A \u201cpromoter\u201d is defined as an array of nucleic acid control sequences that direct transcription of a nucleic acid. As used herein, a promoter includes necessary nucleic acid sequences near the start site of transcription, such as, in the case of a polymerase II type promoter, a TATA element. A promoter also optionally includes distal enhancer or repressor elements, which can be located as much as several thousand base pairs from the start site of transcription. A \u201cconstitutive\u201d promoter is a promoter that is active under most environmental and developmental conditions. An \u201cinducible\u201d promoter is a promoter that is active under environmental or developmental regulation. The term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to a functional linkage between a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, or array of transcription factor binding sites) and a second nucleic acid sequence, wherein the expression control sequence directs transcription of the nucleic acid corresponding to the second sequence.","The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or percent \u201cidentity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., 60% identity, optionally 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identity over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. Such sequences are then said to be \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d","The term \u201cimmunoassay\u201d is an assay that uses an antibody to specifically bind an antigen. The immunoassay is characterized by the use of specific binding properties of a particular antibody to isolate, target, and\/or quantify the antigen.","The phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds\u201d to an antibody or \u201cspecifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,\u201d when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least two times the background and do not substantially bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein For example, polyclonal antibodies raised to an MBNL1 polypeptide from specific species such as rat, mouse, or human can be selected to obtain only those polyclonal antibodies that are specifically immunoreactive with the MBNL1 protein and not with other proteins, except for polymorphic variants and alleles of the MBNL1 protein.","The term \u201ctransduction\u201d refers to the introduction of foreign DNA into cells of an organism (in vivo).","The term \u201ctransfection\u201d refers to the introduction of foreign DNA into cells in culture (in vitro).

In transient transfection, expression occurs from unintegrated foreign DNA and can be detected for a few days after transfection.","The term \u201ctiter\u201d refers to the number of virus particles produced per ml. The assay system to determine the number of virus particles produced varies considerably depending on the virus in question. High titers are generally essential for successful gene therapy since they allow introduction of the therapeutic gene carried by the virus into the maximum number of cells.","The terms \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein include any treatment of a condition or disease in a subject, and include inhibiting the disease or condition, (i.e. arresting its development), relieving the disease or condition (i.e. causing some degree of regression of the condition or delaying progression in the disease), or relieving (to some degree) the conditions caused by the disease (i.e. symptoms of the disease).","The term \u201cvector\u201d refers to a vehicle, usually a biological entity, such as a virus, used for the delivery of genes into an organism.

The term \u201ccomprising\u201d and the like are construed to encompass the phrases \u201cconsisting of\u201d and \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d.","The methods and processes described herein may be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated or clearly rendered inoperable by a modification in order.","Limited and narrow interpretation of descriptive language intended to better illustrate the invention is not to be construed as limiting in any way nor to limit the scope of the invention contemplated by the inventors.","The invention, now described generally and in some detail, will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of reference and are in no manner intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.","Targeted disruption of Mbnl1: to test whether or not sequestration of MBNL proteins contributes to DM pathogenesis, mice with a targeted deletion of MbnlI exon 3 (E3) () were generated. The pMbnl1targeting plasmid was constructed using pTKflNeo (gift of E. Scott, University of Florida), which contains the Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) negative selection marker and a loxP-flanked phosphoglycerate kinaseneomycin (PGK-Neo) positive selection cassette. A 2.5 kb Xbal fragment (5\u2032 arm of homology) corresponding to the upstream region bordering Mhnl1 exon 3, was inserted 5\u2032 of PGK-Neo. For the 3\u2032 arm of homology, a 6 kb Mbnl1 BamHI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.), excised with XhoI\/NotI, and cloned into the XhoI\/NotI sites of pTKflNeo 3\u2032 of PGK-Neo.","The pMbnl1plasmid was linearized with NotI and electroporated into CJ.7 ES cells (P. J. Swiatek, T. Gridley, & 7, 2071 (1993)). ES cells were cultured and selected as described in T. Yang et al., 19, 25 (1998). Clones resistant to G418 and FIAU were isolated and screened for homologous recombination by utilizing a forward primer (5\u2032-TGGGATGGAATTGTGGTGTGTTGTTGCTCATG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 4) outside the 5\u2032 homologous region and a reverse primer (5\u2032-TCCATTTGTCACGTCCTGCACCGACGC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 5) in PGKNeo. Amplification (25 cycles) consisted of 98\u00b0 C. for 20 s followed by 68\u00b0 C. for 4 min. Targeted ES cell clones yielded a 2.9 kb PCR product. This targeting strategy was predicted to approximate the situation in DM by eliminating synthesis of CUG-binding isoforms (Miller, et al, 2000).","Genomic DNA analysis of Mbnl1 mice: genomic blot analysis demonstrated successful deletion of Mbnl1mice (). Five ES cell clones (35, 56, 92, 111, 120) that were positive for homologous recombination were confirmed by genomic DNA blot analysis. Based on restriction map analysis of genomic fragments flanking E3, ES genomic DNA digested with EcoRV produces a 16 kb band when a 300 nt Mbnl1 BamHI\/EcoRV fragment outside the 3\u2032 arm of homology is used as a hybridization probe (probe II of ). In the targeted allele, a new EcoRV site (from pBluescript II KS) is introduced, generating a novel 6.7 kb EcoRV fragment. All five clones that were positive by PCR were also positive by genomic DNA blot analysis. When the 5\u2032 arm of homology (2.5 kb XbaI fragment) was used as probe, two bands at 16 kb (wild type) and 7.5 kb (mutant) were detected. To check for additional insertion events in these five clones, PGK-Neo fragment was used as probe on genomic DNA digested with EcoRV. A single band at 7.5 kb confirmed the absence of any additional insertion events.","One ES clone (ES.35) was expanded and transiently transfected with Crerecombinase to excise PGK-Neo. To detect PGK-Neo loss, forward (5\u2032-CTACGATGGCTGGCTGCAATATGCCTCACTGTAAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 6) and reverse (5\u2032-GGGTTGAATCTCGTTAGGGACACTGGGTGTCTGTAA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 7) primers were used for a PCR screen. PCR was performed for 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of 96\u00b0 C. for 30 see, 60\u00b0 C. for 30 sec and 72\u00b0 C. for 2 min. Clones positive for PGK-Neo deletion yielded a 1 kb band and cassette excision was confirmed by genomic DNA blot analysis. Utilization of a PCR-generated subfragment of the 5\u2032 arm of homology as a hybridization probe yielded EcoRV bands at 16 kb and 6.5 kb. The loss of PGK-Neo results in decrease in the size of the mutant allele digested with EcoRV from 7.5 to 6.5 kb. The Neo excised allele was designated Mbnl1.","Two Mbnl1ES clones (1B3, 2C1) were transferred to 3.5 dpc C57BL\/6J blastocysts which were then carried to term by B6D2F1\/J recipients. One chimeric male was obtained from each clone. Contribution of CJ.7 (129S1\/SvlmJ) ES cells to the germline was determined by mating the chimeric males with C57BL\/6J females. Agouti pups in litters sired by the 1B3 chimeric male indicated germline transmission.","To detect heterozygotes in the F1 population derived from 1 B3, a combination of one forward primer (5\u2032-CTACGATGGCTGGCTGCAATATGCCTCACTGTAAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 8) and two reverse primers [for the mutant allele (5\u2032GGGTTGAATCTCGTTAGGGACACTGGGTGTCTGTAA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 9)]; [for the wild-type allele (5\u2032-TGGCAGACCCTTTGACACCG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 10)] were used for PCR. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles, each cycle consisting of 96\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, 60\u00b0 C. for 30 sec and 72\u00b0 C. for 2 min. Heterozygotes were then mated to obtain Mbnl1mice.","Loss of Mbnl1 E3 expression in Mbnl1: loss of E3 expression was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); primers in exons 3 and 6 were used to amplify a cDNA product from either Mbnl1 or Mbnl1mice that was absent in Mbnl1mice (). To confirm loss of exon 3, an RT-PCR strategy was used with the forward primer positioned in exon 3 (5\u2032-TAGTGTCACACCAATTCGGGACACAAA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 11) and an exon 6 reverse primer (5\u2032CCCTTGATGTAATCCATGCAGACAGTGA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 12). Continued transcription of Mbnl1 in Mbnl1lines was examined using exon 10 forward (5\u2032-TGCACGGTGCTACGCCAGCC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 13) and exon 12 reverse (5\u2032GTGACGACAGCTCTACATCTGGGTAACA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 14) primers, as well as exon 13 forward (5\u2032-CCTGCTGCACACTGTTGCCTACAC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 15) and reverse (5\u2032TGTCAGTTCCCTCCCTCACCATGT-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 16) primers. For amplification, 27 cycles were performed each consisting of 45 sec at 95\u00b0 C., 45 sec at 55\u00b0 C. and 45 sec at 72\u00b0 C., followed by a final 10 min extension at 72\u00b0 C. As expected, Mbnl1 expression was not fully eliminated in Mbnl1mice; RT-PCR products were apparent with primers in constitutively spliced exons 10 and 12, or within exon 13.","Immunoblot analysis (total spleen protein): for immunological detection of Mbnl1, tissues were placed in homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH=8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 \u03bcg\/ml aprotinin, 1 \u03bcg\/ml leupeptin) and disrupted using a Polytron homogenizer and brief sonication (3\u00d75 sec using a microtip sonicator). Following addition of IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma) to 1%, homogenates were incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 10 min. Proteins (30 \u03bcg per lane) were detected following SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Mbnl1 mAb 3A4 (J. W. Miller et al., 19, 4439 (2000), A. Mankodi et al., , in press). Total spleen was analyzed (), because this tissue contains relatively high levels of both Mbnl1 and Cugbp1.","To confirm elimination of the Mbnl1 41- to 42-kD proteins in Mbnl1mice, monoclonal antibody 3A4 was used, which recognizes Mbnl1 proteins containing exon 5[MS1]. The 41- to 42-kD isoforms in Mbnl1 and Mbnl1mice were missing in Mbnl1(). Previous studies suggested that elevated levels of another RNA-binding protein, CUGBP1, are responsible for DM-associated RNA splicing changes. However, Mbnl1mice did not show increased CUGBP1 expression ().","Electromyography: electromyography was performed under general anesthesia (intraperitoneal ketamine, 100 mg\/kg; xylazine, 10 mg\/kg; and acepromazine, 3 mg\/kg) using 30 gauge concentric needle electrodes to examine three hindlimb (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, vastus), two forelimb (flexor compartment of distal forelimb, triceps), and thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles. At least 10 needle insertions were performed in each muscle and myotonic discharges were graded on a 4 point scale: 0, no myotonia; 1, occasional myotonic discharge in <50% of needle insertions; 2, myotonic discharge with >50% of insertions; and 3, myotonic discharge with nearly all insertions. The mean score across all Mbnl1limb muscles was 2.9 in mice age 7 to 11 weeks (n=10). Myotonic discharges were not observed in any muscle in heterozygous Mbnl1mice (n=9) or wild-type littermates (n=9).","Mbnl1mice display overt myotonia beginning around 6 weeks of age. Delayed muscle relaxation was most noticeable after a period of rest and showed improvement during activity. A similar \u201cwarm up\u201d phenomenon is characteristic of myotonia in human DM. Electromyographic recordings confirmed myotonic discharges in all Mbnl1mice tested (n=10) ().","ClC-1 splicing in DM mouse models: because myotonia in DM1 and DM2 muscle is associated with aberrant ClC-1 splicing, RT-PCR assays were used to investigate the effect of loss of Mbnl1 E3 on ClC-1 (encoded by Clcn1) expression (). Total cellular RNA was extracted from either quadriceps or heart muscle of Mbnl1, Mbnl1and Mbnl1mice by homogenizing the tissues in TRI-REAGENT (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) according to manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (RT) using 5 \u03bcg of total RNA and SuperScript II RNase H RT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) following the manufacturer's protocol. For subsequent PCR reactions, 20% of the RT reaction was used as template. Each PCR reaction was spiked with 10 \u03bcCi of (\u03b1P)-dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.). PCR products were resolved on 5-8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography using Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, N.Y.).","For ClC-1 mRNA analysis, the forward primer used corresponded to exon 5 (5\u2032-GGAATACCTCACACTCAAGGCC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 17) and the reverse primer to exon 8 (5\u2032-CACGGAACACAAAGGCACTGAATGT-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 18). PCR was performed for 27 cycles each consisting of 45 sec at 95\u00b0 C., 45 sec at 55\u00b0 C. and 45 sec at 72\u00b0 C., followed by a final 10 min extension at 72\u00b0 C. Full-length ClC-1 cDNA clones were generated from muscle RNA by RT-PCR as previously described (A. Mankodi et al., 10, 35 (2002)). Sequence analysis of 10 clones from Mbnl1mice revealed 6 clones with inclusion of exon 7a and 2 clones with retention of intron 2. All splice junctions were normal in 10 clones derived from wild-type littermates.","Remarkably, Mbnl1mice showed abnormal inclusion of Clcn1 cryptic exons 7a and 8a in a pattern similar to that seen in HSAmice. Also, some full-length ClC-1 cDNA clones from Mbnl1mice showed abnormal inclusion of intron 2, as has been observed in DM and HSAmuscle. Notably, these abnormal splice isoforms have premature termination codons and do not encode functional chloride channels. By contrast, splicing of the Scn4a sodium channel, the only other ion channel previously associated with myotonia was normal in Mbnl1muscle. These results suggested that changes in splice site selection result in the loss of functional ClC-1 from myofiber membranes.","ClC-1, Dys2, and \u03b1-sarcoglycan immunostaining: frozen sections of vastus (6 \u03bcm) were immunostained using polyclonal antibodies directed against the C-terminus of ClC-1 (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio) or monoclonal antibodies to dystrophin (Dys2) or a-sarcoglycan (NovoCastra, Newcastle upon Tyne) as described in A. Mankodi et al., 10, 35 (2002).","Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed a major reduction of ClC-1 protein in Mbnl1muscle relative to the muscle of wild-type sibs (, C and D), whereas the membrane-associated proteins dystrophin (, E and F) and \u03b1-sarcoglycan () were unaffected. Because abnormalities of ClC-1 splicing in Mbnl1muscle are more pronounced than in HSAmuscle, and considering that HSAmice have a >80% reduction of chloride conductance, it is likely that myotonia in Mbnl1mice is due to improper ClC-1 pre-mRNA splicing.","Analysis of muscle histology: frozen sections (10 \u03bcm) of vastus and gastrocnemius muscle were prepared for routine histologic (hematoxylin and eosin, modified Gomori trichrome, periodic acid-Schiff) and histochemical (cytochrome oxidase, acid phosphatase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase, myosin ATPase, succinate dehydrogenase) stains (V. Dubowitz, (Bailliere Tindall, London, ed. 2, 1996)).","Histological analysis of Mbnl1mice up to 11 weeks of age did not show major degeneration of muscle fibers. Pathological features in Mbnl1muscle included an increase in nuclei with an abnormal (central) position and splitting of myofibers (, G and H). Histologic abnormalities were not observed in Mbnl1 or Mbnl1muscle.","Cataract development: besides muscle abnormalities, distinctive ocular cataracts that progress from subcapsular \u201cdust-like\u201d opacities to mature cataracts are a prominent DM-associated feature. Similar cataracts were observed in all Mbnl1eyes examined (n=24; 3 to 8 months old) but not in wild-type siblings (, I to L).","For ocular lens evaluation, mice were sedated using intra-peritoneal injection of 100 mg\/kg ketamine (Ketaset, Fort Dodge, Iowa) and 10 mg\/kg xylazine (Xylaject, Phoenix, St Joseph, Mo.) and anterior chambers and lenses were examined using a slit lamp (Haag Streit, Mason, Ohio). In vivo images were obtained using a Nikon 990 digital camera attached to the slit-lamp. Immediately after euthanasia, globes were enucleated, fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin blocks before being processed overnight in a Shandon Excelsior tissue processor (Thermo Electron, Waltham, Mass.). Sections (4 \u03bcm) were cut using an HM-315 microtome (Richard-Allan, Kalamazoo, Mich.), dried and H&E stained. Sections were photographed using a Canon EOS D60 digital camera attached to an Olympus Vanox microscope.","Abnormal regulation of alternative splicing\u2014Tnnt2: abnormal regulation of alternative splicing has been observed in DM1 muscle for cardiac troponin T (TNNT2), insulin receptor (INSR), and ClC-1. Tnnt2 was analyzed using exon 2 forward (5\u2032GCCGAGGAGGTGGTGGAGGAGTA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 19) exon 6 reverse (5\u2032GTCTCAGCCTCACCCTCAGGCTCA-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 20) and 27 PCR cycles (45 sec at 96\u00b0 C., 45 sec at 58\u00b0 C. and 45 sec at 72\u00b0 C., followed by a final 10-min extension at 72\u00b0 C.). Analysis of INSR is uninformative because human patterns of INSR alternative splicing are not conserved in mice. However, Mbnl1adult heart shows abnormal retention of the Tnnt2 \u201cfetal\u201d exon 5 (), as was observed for DM1.","Abnormal regulation of alternative splicing\u2014Tnnt3: to determine whether alternative splicing of other genes is disrupted in Mbnl1, fast skeletal muscle troponin T (Tnnt3) was assessed. For mouse Tnnt3, the forward primer overlaps exons 2 and 3 (5\u2032TCTGACGAGGAAACTGAACAAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 21) while the reverse primer (5\u2032TGTCAATGAGGGCTTGGAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 22) corresponds to exon 11. For human TNNT3, exon 2 forward (5\u2032-TTCACCATGTCTGACGAGGAAG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 23) and exon 10 reverse (5\u2032CTTCTGGGATCTTAGGAGCAGTG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 24) primers were used. For mouse Tnnt3 and human TNNT3, 25 PCR cycles were performed each consisting of 45 sec at 95\u00b0 C., 45 sec at 50\u00b0 C. and 30 sec at 72\u00b0 C., followed by a final 10-min extension at 72\u00b0 C. The same amplification protocol was used to amplify the mouse Tnnt3 carboxyl terminal region using an exon 15 forward primer (5\u2032-CCTTGTACCAACTGGAGACTGAC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 25) and an exon 18 reverse primer (5\u2032-TGATGGTCTCTGCTGCAGTG-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 26).","Primers in Tnnt3 exons 2 and 11 produced a single major RT-PCR product in adult Mbnl1 and Mbnl1mice that was undetectable in Mbnl1mice (). Instead, a cluster of larger cDNAs, all containing a \u201cfetal\u201d (F) exon, was prominent. In contrast, mutually exclusive splicing of Tnnt3 exons 16 and 17 was unaffected in Mbnl1mice; this finding shows that altered Mbnl1 expression has specific effects on splice site selection even within the same pre-mRNA (). Similar alterations of TNNT3 splicing in adult DM1 muscle () were found.","Abnormal regulation of alternative splicing\u2014Scn4a: missense mutations in the Scn4a muscle-specific sodium channel are also associated with myotonia. The Scn4a pre-mRNA has two rare AT\/AC splice sites but is not known to undergo alternative splicing. To screen for abnormalities of Scn4a splicing that might contribute to myotonia, RT-PCR analysis of muscle RNA was carried out. Partial cDNAs covering the entire Scn4a coding region (GenBank accession #AJ278787) were generated by PCR using the following primers: set 1 exon 1 (GACCTGGAAGCTGGCAAGAAC) (SEQ ID NO: 27) to exon 6 (TCCCTTCGTCATTGATGTAGGC) (SEQ ID NO: 28); set 2 exon 6 (CCATGAATGACACCAACACCAC) (SEQ ID NO: 29) to exon 12 (CTGAGGGTGACGATGAAGCTG) (SEQ ID NO: 30); set 3 exon 12 (TCTTCACGGGCATCTTCACTG) (SEQ ID NO: 31) to exon 17 (CGCCGCTGTTCAATGTAGATG) (SEQ ID NO: 32); and set 4 exon 16 (TGCCTCTATGTGGACATCTCCC) (SEQ ID NO: 33) to exon 24 (CGACTCTTTCTTGACGTAGGCG) (SEQ ID NO: 34). RT-PCR products from primer sets 1, 2, 3, and 4 was analyzed on 1% agarose gels before and after restriction digest with ApaI, NcoI, BspEI and BsrGl-HindIII, respectively. Results showed no difference in the length of Scn4a cDNA fragments in Mbnl1, Mbnl11or HSAmice (data not shown).","Loss of specific Mbnl1 isoforms that associate with expanded (CUG)and (CCUG)RNAs is sufficient to cause myotonia, cataracts, and RNA splicing defects that are similar to those seen in DM. Although muscleblind-like proteins may influence gene expression at multiple levels, these proteins may play a direct role in splice site selection. Recent co-transfection analysis in HEK293 cells using a Tnnt3 mini-gene indicated that the Mbnl1 41 kDa protein regulates alternative splice site choice by binding to a discrete RNA element upstream of the fetal (F) exon. Thus, MBNL proteins bind to distinct RNA sequence elements and influence exon use during splicing.","Young Mbnl1mice do not develop the severe neonatal muscle weakness associated with congenital DM1, and it is not yet known whether cardiac conduction problems develop in this model. Thus, some aspects of the DM phenotype may not result from loss of MBNL1 function alone. Additional muscleblind proteins (MBNL2 and MBNL3) are also recruited to nuclear RNA foci. It is contemplated that their sequestration may be required to fully replicate the multisystemic DM phenotype.","HSAmice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and the left tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was injected with 13.4 \u03bcL PBS containing 1\u00d710rAAV1Myc-hMBNL1, or the right leg was injected with PBS (\u201cuninjected\u201d). Four weeks post-injection, the mice were anesthetized using 2.5% avertin, and the left and right TAs were collected for total RNA preparation and assayed for recovery of the normal Clcn1 pre-mRNA splicing pattern ()","Reverse transcription was carried out using 5 \u03bcg of total RNA and 300 ng of random hexamers in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. After, RNase H treatment for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 4 \u03bcl of cDNA was used for PCR. The final volume of the PCR reaction was 50 \u03bcl, which contained 30 pmoles of forward primer (5\u2032-TGAAGGAATACCTCACACTCAAGGCC-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO: 40) in exon 5 of Clcn1 and 30 pmoles of reverse primer (5\u2032-CACGGAACACAAAGGCACTGAATGT-3\u2032) (SEQ ID NO. 41) in exon 8 of Clcn1. In addition, the reaction was spiked with 10 \u03bcCi of dCTP-[\u03b1P]. 27 cycles were carried out at annealing and extension temperatures of 55\u00b0 C. and 72\u00b0 C., respectively. Thirty percent of the total PCR products were resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel followed by exposure of the gel to an autoradiography film.","Mice number 188 and 189 were injected on the same day and processed together. Mouse number 190 and 191 were littermates that were neither injected with virus nor with PBS (included as uninjected controls). The results show that the levels of the abnormal splicing products were decreased, while the level of the normal splicing product was increased, following rAAV1Myc-hMBNL1 injection.","The mice were also tested for myotonia by electromyography (EMG). Four weeks post-injection, EMG was performed on the injected and uninjected (the latter corresponding, for this example, to those mice not injected with virus, but, rather, with PBS alone) TA of six HSAmice. The Y-axis shows the observed severity of myotonia following insertion of the electrode. Five out of six mice showed virtual elimination of myotonia in the injected TA muscles (injected with virus), while, in the uninjected TA of the same animal, robust myotonia (grade level=3) was observed. The results show that injection of the HSAmice with rAAV1Myc-hMBNL1 (41 kDa isoform expressed) into the tibialis anterior results in reduced myotonia in as little as four weeks' time.","To determine whether MBNL proteins can alter the splicing patterns of pre-mRNAs known to be abnormally regulated in DM1 striated muscle, GFP fusion proteins of all three MBNL proteins were transiently expressed with human and chicken cTNT minigenes in primary chicken skeletal muscle cultures. GFP fusions with MBNL1, 2 and 3 were provided by Dr J D Brook (Fardaei M, Rogers M T, Thorpe H M, Larkin K, Hamshere M G, Harper P S, Brook J D (2002), 11: 805-814). The cTNT, IR and clathrin light chain B minigenes were previously described (Kosaki A, Nelson J, Webster N J (1998), 273: 10331-10337; Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Stamm S, Casper D, Hanson V, Helfman D M (1999), 64: 108-118; Ladd A N, Charlet-B N, Cooper T A (2001), 21: 1285-1296). The MBNL mutant human cTNT minigene was generated by inverse PCR.","Transient transfection and RT-PCR analysis: HEK293 cells were plated at 500 000 cells per well in a six-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Gibco penicillin-streptomycin. At 24 h after plating, the cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of minigene and 2 \u03bcg of protein expression plasmid using Fugene6 (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.), according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein and RNA were harvested 36-48 h after transfection.","Human and chicken cTNT and human IR minigenes were expressed with or without each of the three GFP-MBNL fusion proteins or with GFP alone. Duplicate transfections were used for extraction of RNA and protein. Inclusion of cTNT exon 5 or IR exon 11 was assayed by RT-PCR.","Chicken primary muscle cultures were prepared, maintained and transfected as previously described, using 0.5 \u03bcg minigene reporter and 1 \u03bcg expression plasmid Xu R, Teng J, Cooper T A (1993), 13: 3660-3674). COSM6 cells were plated at 150 000 cells per well in a six-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Gibco penicillin-streptornycin and L-glutamine. At 24 h after plating, the cells were transfected with 500 ng of minigene and 1 \u03bcg of protein expression plasmid using Fugene6 (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein and RNA were harvested 36-48 h after transfection. RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis for the cTNT, IR, and clathrin light-chain B minigenes were performed as described previously (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Stamm S, Casper D, Hanson V, Helfman D M (1999), 64: 108-118; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47).","Western blot analysis to investigate alternative splicing related to MBNL: cells were harvested in protein loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol and 5% 2-\u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and the protein concentration was quantitated with the Non-Interfering Protein Assay (Genotech, St Louis, Mo.). Total protein lysates from HEK293 (20 \u03bcg) and primary chicken skeletal (30 \u03bcg) cultures were loaded on a 12.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). GFP was detected using JL-8 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif.) at a dilution of 1:2000. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000.","To detect endogenous MBNL1, HeLa (50 \u03bcg) protein lysates were loaded on a 12.5% acrylamide gel. Blots were probed with the monoclonal 3A4 (16 mg\/ml) at a dilution of 1:500. The secondary antibody was a sheep anti-mouse HRP conjugate (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.) at a dilution of 1:5000. For GAPDH in HeLa cells, 15 \u03bcg of total protein lysates was run on a 12.5% acrylamide gel, transferred to membranes and detected using the 6G5 monoclonal (Biogenesis, Kingston, N.H.) at a dilution of 1:100 000. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse HRP conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) at a dilution of 1:5000.","GFP-MBNL1, 2 and 3 strongly repressed inclusion of both human and chicken cTNT exon 5 in primary chicken skeletal muscle cultures, while expression of GFP to levels comparable to, or greater than, GFP-MBNL fusion proteins had no effect on splicing (). Of note, GFP-MBNL1 was found to have a novel MBNL1 isoform lacking exons 7, 9 and 10 and containing a frameshift in exon 12. In addition, there were no differences in the splicing activity of GFP fusion proteins compared to Xpress epitope-tagged MBNL proteins (data not shown). Therefore, MBNL proteins are directly antagonistic to endogenous CELF activity, which activates cTNT exon inclusion in muscle (Charlet-B N, Logan P, Singh G, Cooper T A (2002a), 9: 649-658).","Another pre-mRNA target that is misregulated in DM striated muscle is the IR (Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A, Dalton J C, Moseley M L, Ranum L P, Day J W (2004), 74: 1309-1313). To test whether the MBNL family can also regulate human IR, the three MBNL family members were co-expressed with a human IR minigene. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of MBNL on cTNT splicing, coexpression of MBNL family members with an IR minigene strongly induces exon inclusion, whereas GFP alone had no effect ().","To determine whether the MBNL family has a general effect on alternative splicing, all three MBNL proteins were co-expressed with a clathrin light-chain minigene containing the neuron-specific exon EN. The EN alternative exon in this minigene strongly responds to over-expression of the SR family of proteins and htra2-\u03b21, but not CELF proteins (Stamm S, Casper D, Hanson V, Helfman D M (1999), 64: 108-118; Singh G, Charlet B N, Han J, Cooper T A (2004), 32: 1232-1241; data not shown). Over-expression of GFP-MBNL1, 2 and 3 with the clathrin light-chain minigene had no effect on alternative splicing of exon EN (). MBNL expression also did not affect splicing of an artificial alternative exon flanked by splice sites from human \u03b2-globin intron 1 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that MBNL proteins do not have a general effect on alternative splicing, but, rather regulate specific pre-mRNA targets. In summary, MBNL1, 2 and 3 regulate splicing of cTNT and IR alternative exons.","To determine whether depletion of endogenous MBNL1 protein could also affect the splicing patterns of known DM pre-mRNA targets in human cells, siRNA constructs were designed to target MBNL1, but not MBNL2 and MBNL3. To confirm the specificity of the effects, two siRNA constructs were designed to target different regions of the MBNL1 mRNA.","SiRNA construct design and transfection: two custom siRNA duplexes were designed for RNAi against human MBNL1 using the Dharmacon siDESIGN program available on the world wide web at dharmacon.com, and were synthesized by Dharmacon. The sequences are as follows: THH31 mRNA target (AA-N19 format 5\u2032\u21923\u2032) AACAGACAGACUUGAGGUAUG (SEQ ID NO: 35), THH2 mRNA target (AA-N19 format 5\u203243 3\u2032) AACACGGAAUGUAAAUUUGCA (SEQ ID NO: 36), GFP siRNA duplex (Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colo. cat. no. D-001300-01-20). 300 000 HeLa cells were plated in 2 ml of antibiotic-free growth media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) per well in a six-well plate. HeLa cells were chosen because they express MBNL1 (Miller J W, Urbinati C R, Teng-Umnuay P, Stenberg M G, Byrne B J, Thornton C A, Swanson M S (2000), EMBO J 19: 4439-4448) and are amenable to siRNA-mediated depletion (Elbashir S M, Harborth J, Lendeckel W, Yalcin A, Weber K, Tuschl T (2001), Nature 411: 494-498).","At 12 h after plating, the media was exchanged with 800 \u03bcl serum-free media (DMEM) per well. siRNA duplex (2.66 \u03bcg) was transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). 1 ml of 3\u00d7 serum-containing media (DMEM supplemented with 30% FBS) was added after 4 h. After 12 h, the 3\u00d7serum-containing media was replaced with antibiotic-free growth media and the cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of minigene and 2.66 \u03bcg of siRNA duplex using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The media was exchanged with antibiotic-free growth media 6 h later. RNA and protein were harvested 48 h after transfection of the minigene.","Independent transient transfection of each siRNA construct resulted in a knockdown of endogenous MBNL1 protein to less than 10-20%, based on comparisons to serial dilutions of the untransfected or mock-transfected lysates (; data not shown).","Immunofluorescence analysis of MBNL1 depletion: HeLa cells were grown on coverslips in six-well plates and transfected with 2.66 \u03bcg siRNA using Oligofectamine. The coverslips were washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde\/PBS for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, the cells were dehydrated with 70% ethanol overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The coverslips were then rehydrated with PBS for 10 min and incubated with 3% BSA\/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody 3A4 (10 mg\/ml) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 3% BSA\/PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (2 mg\/ml, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), at a dilution of 1:100 in 3% BSA\/PBS at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS three times, counterstained with DAPI (MolecularProbes, Eugene, Oreg.) and mounted for visualization by fluorescence microscopy.","Analysis of MBNL1 depletion by immunofluorescence demonstrated predominantly nuclear expression that was greatly reduced in the majority of cells by each siRNA construct (). In addition, the siRNA constructs silenced effectively the expression of GFP-MBNL1, but not GFP-MBNL2, GFP-MBNL3 or GFP from transiently transfected plasmids, and neither MBNL1 siRNA affected the levels of endogenous MBNL2 protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the siRNAs preferentially silence MBNL1.","MBNL1 depletion and cTNT and IR minigene splicing: to determine whether depletion of endogenous MBNL1 affected alternative splicing of cTNT, IR and clathrin light chain, the minigenes were transfected with each siRNA construct. Depletion of MBNL1 promoted exon inclusion in cTNT, exon skipping in IR and only minimal splicing changes in the clathrin light-chain minigene (). siRNA-mediated depletion of MBNL1 with two independent constructs reproduces the DM splicing patterns for cTNT and IR minigenes. GFP siRNA had no effect on splicing of any of the tested minigenes. MBNL1 siRNA had minimal effects on splicing of a rat clathrin light-chain minigene.","These splicing effects were not caused by general activation of the mammalian RNAi machinery because siRNA targeting GFP or luciferase and nonspecific pools of siRNA had minimal effects on splicing of the three minigenes (; plus data not shown). Furthermore, the alteration in cTNT splicing caused by MBNL1 depletion in HeLa cells can be reversed by expression of GFP-MBNL2 or GFP-MBNL3, but not GFP (data not shown), demonstrating that adding back MBNL isoforms not targeted by MBNL1 siRNA rescues the splicing effects of MBNL1 deficiency.","The data indicate that endogenous MBNL1 regulates the splicing of human cTNT and IR minigenes. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of MBNL1 reproduces the splicing pattern observed in DM1 for cTNT (exon inclusion) and IR (exon skipping), and is opposite to the pattern observed when MBNL1 is over-expressed. The over-expression and depletion data indicate that endogenous MBNL1 regulates the alternative splicing of cTNT and IR minigenes, and suggest that MBNL1 regulates these pre-mRNAs via specific cis-regulatory elements. The effects of MBNL on the cTNT and IR alternative exons are the opposite of the splicing patterns induced by CELF proteins, implying an antagonistic relationship between these protein families.","UV cross-linking analysis of MBNL1 binding to human cTNT: to determine whether the splicing effects of MBNL1 on pre-mRNA targets were direct or indirect, a UV-cross-linking assay was performed using purified recombinant GST-MBNL1 and uniformly labeled in vitro-transcribed segments from the human cTNT gene. Uniformly P-labeled RNAs were transcribed in vitro using [\u03b1-P]GTP and [\u03b1-P]UTP (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) from PCR products or cloned regions of the human or chicken introns 4 and 5, as represented in .","UV-cross-linking assays were performed using radiolabeled transcripts standardized for picomoles of G and U. UV-cross-linking assays included 1 \u03bcg of purified GST-MBNL1 in the presence of 1 \u03bcg BSA, 1 \u03bcg tRNA, 0.3 \u03bcg heparin, 0.3 mM magnesium acetate, in 2 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM ATP, 16 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 65 mM potassium glutamate, 0.16 mM EDTA, 0.4 mM DTT and 16% glycerol. Binding was for 10 min at 30\u00b0 C. Recombinant GST-MBNL1 protein was produced as described (Miller J W, Urbinati C R, Teng-Umnuay P, Stenberg M G, Byrne B J, Thornton C A, Swanson M S (2000), 19: 4439-4448). Competitions were performed as described previously (Singh G, Charlet B N, Han J, Cooper T A (2004), 32: 1232-1241). The indicated amounts of non-labeled competitor RNAs were added to the binding reaction 10 min prior to addition of labeled substrate RNA.","The human cTNT minigene contains a 732 nucleotide (nt) cTNT genomic fragment that is necessary and sufficient to respond to MBNL1 over-expression and depletion (). To identify MBNL1-binding sites within this cTNT pre-mRNA region, uniformly P-labeled, in vitro-transcribed RNAs covering the entire region were used for UV-cross-linking binding assays. As shown in , the binding of GST-MBNL1 on human cTNT was mapped to a 41 nt region within the 3\u2032 splice site of exon 5 (compare RNAs C, D, E and F) located between a near-consensus branch point sequence and the 3\u2032 cleavage site of the upstream intron.","Scanning mutagenesis identification of binding sites: scanning mutagenesis identified two MBNL1-binding sites located 18 and 36 nt upstream from exon 5 (). The absence of binding to long intronic segments (RNAs F and C) and RNAs containing nucleotide substitutions (RNAs H, J and M; see below) demonstrate binding specificity. This analysis indicates that, for cTNT, the MBNL1-binding site is distinct from the CUG-BP1-binding site, which is located downstream from the alternative exon (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741).","UV cross-linking analysis of binding of MBNL1 with nucleotide substitutions: nucleotide substitutions that disrupt both MBNL1-binding sites were introduced into the human cTNT minigene to test whether MBNL1 binding was required to affect responsiveness to MBNL1 expression in vivo. As the MBNL-binding site is located within the 3\u2032 splice site of intron 4, only four nucleotide substitutions were introduced to reduce the effects of MBNL-binding site mutations on basal splicing efficiency (RNA M, ). These substitutions prevented binding of recombinant MBNL1 to an RNA that is otherwise identical to RNA G containing the wild-type sequence (). In addition, non-labeled RNA M was much less efficient than RNA G in competing binding of MBNL1 to labeled RNA G ().","When introduced into the human cTNT minigene, the MBNL1-binding site mutation significantly reduced (MBNL1 and MBNL3) or eliminated (MBNL2) responsiveness to MBNL proteins (), demonstrating that loss of MBNL1 binding in vitro directly correlates with decreased responsiveness to MBNL1 in vivo. These results demonstrate that regulation by MBNL protein is mediated via binding the pre-mRNA, and suggest that all three MBNL proteins regulate human cTNT splicing by binding to the same site. In contrast, the MBNL1-binding site mutations had little effect on responsiveness to CUG-BP1 (). GFP alone had minimal effects on splicing. Thus, MBNL proteins regulate splicing by binding to the human cTNT pre-mRNA, and regulation by CUG-BP1 does not require the MBNL1-binding site.","UV cross-linking analysis of MBNL1 binding to chicken cTNT: UV-cross-linking analysis was performed to identify MBNL1-binding site(s) associated with the chicken cTNT alternative exon 5. The genomic segment of chicken cTNT that responds to MBNL expression contains 99 and 142 nt of upstream and downstream introns flanking the alternative exon, respectively. Within the intronic segments are four muscle-specific splicing enhancers (MSEs, ) previously shown to be required for enhanced exon inclusion in embryonic striated muscle (Ryan K J, Cooper T A (1996), 16: 4014-4023; Cooper T A (1998), 18: 4519-4525) and required for regulation by all the six CELF family members (Ladd A N, Charlet-B N, Cooper T A (2001), 21: 1285-1296; Ladd A N, Nguyen N H, Malhotra K, Cooper T A (2004), 279: 17756-17764). RNAs containing MSEs 1-4 or individual MSEs were transcribed in vitro as uniformly P-labeled RNAs and used for UV cross-linking. GST-MBNL1 bound strongly to MSE4 and slightly to MSE1 ().","In competition studies, non-labeled MSE1 RNA poorly competed in the binding of GST-MBNL1 to RNA containing MSE1-4, while MSE4 effectively competed in binding (), consistent with the UV-cross-linking results. The absence of competition by MSE2 or MSE3 demonstrates the sequence specificity of MBNL1 binding (). To define the MBNL1-binding site(s) within MSE4, scanning mutagenesis was performed. Two regions required for MBNL1 binding were identified at 94 and 120 nt downstream from the exon (). Alignment of the four MBNL1-binding sites in chicken and human cTNT revealed a common motif of YGCU(U\/G)Y (). Taken together, these data indicate that MBNL1 directly binds to introns adjacent to the human and chicken cTNT alternative exons.","Of note, proteins from all three MBNL genes contain two pairs of Cys3His zinc-finger-related motifs with identical spacing between cysteine and histidine residues in fingers 1 and 3 (CX7CX6CX3H) and fingers 2 and 4 (CX7CX4CX3H) (Miller J W, Urbinati C R, Teng-Umnuay P, Stenberg M G, Byrne B J, Thornton C A, Swanson M S (2000), 19: 4439-4448; Fardaei M, Rogers M T, Thorpe H M, Larkin K, Hamshere M G, Harper P S, Brook J D (2002), 11: 805-814; Squillace R M, Chenault D M, Wang E H (2002), 250: 218-230). The Cys3His-type zinc-finger is an evolutionarily conserved motif found in a number of proteins that perform diverse RNA-processing functions, and mutation of this motif results in a loss of RNA binding and disrupts protein function (Bai C, Tolias P P (1996), 16: 6661-6667; Bai C, Tolias P P (1998), 26: 1597-1604; Lai W S, Carballo E, Strum J R, Kennington E A, Phillips R S, Blackshear P J (1999), 19: 4311-4323; Stoecklin G, Colombi M, Raineri I, Leuenberger S, Mallaun M, Schmidlin M, Gross B, Lu M, Kitamura T, Moroni C (2002), 21: 4709-4718).","MBNL1 also binds to specific sequences within single-stranded RNA, consistent with the results from other Cys3His zinc-finger proteins (Cheng Y, Kato N, Wang W, Li J, Chen X (2003), 4: 53-66; Michel S L, Guerrerio A L, Berg J M (2003), 42: 4626-4630). The above-delineated results demonstrate that MBNL1 binds to cis-elements in chicken cTNT intron 5 required for muscle-specific splicing.","The CUG-BP1-binding site located downstream from exon 5 in the human cTNT minigene is required for regulation by all six CELF proteins (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741); T Ho, unpublished data), and is distinct from the MBNL-binding site mapped in . The results shown previously demonstrate that CUG-BP1 regulates minigenes in which MBNL1-binding site mutations have greatly reduced or eliminated MBNL responsiveness ().","Analysis of the importance of the CUG-BP1 binding site to minigene regulation by MBNL1: to determine whether MBNL1 can regulate minigenes lacking the CUG-BP1-binding site, GFP-MBNL1 or MBNL1 siRNA was cotransfected with a human cTNT minigene containing mutated CUG-BP1-binding sites. Plasmids expressing DMPK exons 11-15 containing 960 interrupted CUG repeats in exon 15 were cloned using techniques as previously described (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741). The over-expression and depletion results demonstrate that cTNT minigenes containing the mutant and wild-type CUG-BP1-binding sites are equally responsive to MBNL1 (). GFP-MBNL2 and 3 also showed similar regulation of wild-type and mutant human cTNT minigenes (data not shown). These results indicate that the regulation of human cTNT by MBNL1 is independent of CELF regulation.","Similarly, for the IR minigene, regulation by CUG-BP1 requires a CUG-BP1-binding site in a 110 nt region located upstream of IR exon 11 (Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47). A mutant IR minigene lacking the CUG-BP1-binding site was co-expressed with GFP-MBNL1, 2 and 3 in HEK293 cells () or MBNL1 siRNA constructs in HeLa cells () to determine whether regulation by MBNL proteins requires the CUG-BP1-binding site. The mutant IR minigenes displayed regulation by MBNL proteins, which was comparable to the wild-type IR minigenes (compare  and B and C). These results indicate that regulation of human cTNT and IR by MBNL proteins does not require the CUG-BP1-binding site. In other words, the deletion of the human IR CUG-BP1-binding site does not affect regulation by MBNL1. All three of the MBNL proteins promoted exon 11 inclusion of the mutant human IR minigene lacking the CUG-BP1-binding site in HEK293 cells (). Furthermore, RNAi depletion of MBNL1 in HeLa cells using the indicated siRNA constructs promoted exon 11 skipping in the human IR minigene lacking the CUG-BP1-binding site ().","Mutant cTNT and IR minigenes lacking the CUG-BP1-binding site respond as strongly as non-mutated minigenes to MBNL1 depletion by RNAi (). However, neither of these minigenes respond to the trans-dominant effects of co-expressed CUG repeat RNA as do the non-mutated minigenes (Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47; 960CTG, ). The RNAi results demonstrate that the mutated cTNT and IR minigenes are \u2018competent\u2019 to respond to MBNL1 depletion, and, yet, they do not respond to co-expression of CUG repeat RNA. Therefore, while it has been demonstrated that MBNL proteins are alternative splicing regulators of cTNT and IR alternative exons, these results indicate that MBNL depletion by CUG repeat RNA is not sufficient to account for the trans-dominant effect of CUG repeat RNA on splicing.","As shown previously, and in , here, the cTNT and IR minigenes made insensitive to CELF regulation by mutations in the CUG-BP1-binding site no longer respond to expanded CUG repeat RNA, suggesting that the trans-dominant effect is mediated at least in part via an intact CUG-BP1-binding site (; Philips A V, Timchenko L T, Cooper T A (1998), 280: 737-741; Savkur R S, Philips A V, Cooper T A (2001), 29: 40-47). The present results show that the mutated cTNT and IR minigenes are competent to respond to MBNL depletion by RNAi as strongly as the non-mutated minigenes, yet they do not respond to CUG repeat RNA. If expanded CUG repeats affected cTNT and IR splicing simply by sequestering and depleting MBNL, then the co-expression of CUG repeats should have affected splicing of the mutated as well as non-mutated minigenes. It is, thus, indicated that the repeats have a trans-dominant effect on splicing by a mechanism more complex than MBNL depletion alone.","Origin and preparation of tissue samples: to study the expression and distribution of expanded poly(CUG)RNA in relation to putative RNA binding proteins in the brain, autopsy materials were obtained from ten DM1 patients (mean age 56 years, range 44-78 years, 7 men and 3 women) and 13 controls (6 with no neurologic disease, 2 with Alzheimer disease, 4 with Huntington disease, and one with refractory epilepsy). The mean post-mortem interval for DM1 patients was 6 hours (range 2 to 14 hours). At the time of autopsy, coronal sections of brain were prepared and placed on aluminum slabs cooled on dry ice. In addition, selected regions were dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at \u221270\u00b0 C.","Nine of the DM1 patients had signs of classical DM1 before age  and died of complications related to the disease (respiratory failure in 7, sudden cardiac death in 2). The other DM1 patient had minimal symptoms of DM1 and died at age 78 yrs of unrelated disease. Genetic confirmation was performed as previously described by PCR or Southern blot on DNA isolated from postmortem brain tissue (Thornton, C. A., Johnson, K., an Moxley, R. T. (1994), 35, 104-107). Southern blots of cortical DNA samples showed a broad range of expanded alleles ranging in size from 5 to 12 kb (not shown). The individual with the minimal DM phenotype had a CTG repeat expansion length of 77 repeats in DNA isolated from peripheral blood, brain, and other tissues.","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of brain sections: FISH was performed as described (Mankodi, A., Urbinati, C. R., Yuan, Q. P., Moxley, R. T., Sansone, V., Krym, M., Henderson, D., Schalling, M., Swanson, M. S., and Thornton, C. A. (2001), 10, 2165-2170) with slight modifications. Frozen sections (12 \u03bcm) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde PBS for 30 min, permeabilized in 2% acetone PBS (pre-chilled at \u221220\u00b0 C.) for 5 min, and then prehybridized in 30% fornamide and 2\u00d7SSC at room temperature for 10 min. Next, sections were hybridized with probe (1 ng\/\u03bcl) for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. in buffer (30% formamide, 2\u00d7SSC, 0.02% BSA, 66 \u03bcg\/ml yeast rRNA, 2 mM vanadyl complex) and then washed for 30 min in 30% formamide\/2\u00d7SSC at 42\u00b0 C. followed by 1\u00d7SSC for 30 min at room temperature. Probes were HPLC purified 2-O-methyl RNA 20-mers (IDT, Coralville, Iowa) composed of CAG-, CUG- or GUC-repeats, and labeled with Texas Red at the 5\u2032 end. Images were obtained on an Olympus AX70 epifluorescence microscope at 1,000-fold magnification. To compare the relative fluorescence intensities for RNA foci, sections were processed on the same slide, imaged under the same illumination and exposure settings, and then analyzed using MCID v6.0 software (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catherines, Ontario).","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of brain sections with CAG repeat probes revealed nuclear RNA foci in every individual with DM1 (n=10, ) but not in controls with (n=7) or without (n=6) neurologic disease. RNA foci were not observed with CUG (sense) or GUC repeat probes. The hybridization of CAG probes to nuclear foci in DM1 did not-require denaturation of genomic DNA. These results indicate that CAG repeat probes recognize CUG expansion RNA rather than a cross-reactive RNA or DNA.","Nuclear RNA foci ranged in diameter from 0.2 to 2 \u03bcm. Resolution of these small structures required direct fluorescence detection methods. However, the autofluorescent material in brain (lipofuscin) was a complicating factor. The RNA foci were clearly distinguished from lipofuscin when the epifluorescence from three color channels was merged in a single image. As shown in , the nuclear foci appeared in a single channel determined by the probe label (Texas red). Lipofuscin, which excites and emits at a broad spectrum of wavelengths, generated signal in all channels and appeared as a different color (typically yellow-brown) in the merged image. These observations formed the basis for distinguishing RNA foci in subsequent experiments. RNA foci were red, sharply demarcated structures in the nucleus. Lipofuscin was yellow-brown perinuclear material with indistinct margins.","Immunofluorescence (IF) combined with FISH: to determine which cells express mutant DMPK and form RNA inclusions, different brain regions were surveyed using FISH in combination with antibodies that mark specific cell types. In cerebral cortex, the nuclear foci were distributed throughout all cortical layers and were confined to neurons, as determined by immunofluorescence (IF) for neuronal markers NeuN () or MAP2 ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0211","num":"0210"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Target Antigen","Final Dilution"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Muscleblind","mAb (3B10): 1:1500"]},{"entry":[{},"(MBNL1)","pAb (EXP 42): 1:1500"]},{"entry":[{},"Muscleblind","mAb (2D9): 1:10,000"]},{"entry":[{},"(MBNL2)",{}]},{"entry":[{},"CUGBP1","mAb (3B1): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"CELF4","pAb (#440): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"ERT3","pAb (#163): 1:1500"]},{"entry":[{},"PKR","pAb (pT451): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},{},"pAb (M515): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},{},"pAb (D20): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},{},"mAb (B10): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"RNA helicase A","pAb 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"ADAR1","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"HRBP","pAb (#1683): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"NF90 (DRBP76)","pAb (p90 AB4): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"Staufen","pAb 1:500 (AB 5819)"]},{"entry":[{},"Proteasome",{}]},{"entry":[{},"19S S10a","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"11S \u03b1","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"11S \u03b3","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"20S \u03b23 (HC10)","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"20S \u03b1","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"Ubiquitin","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"p80 coilin","pAb: (R288): 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"C23 nucleolin","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"PML","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"PTB","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"PM-Scl 75","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"hnRNP H",{}]},{"entry":[{},"C-terminal","pAb: 1:100"]},{"entry":[{},"N-terminal","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"hnRNP F","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"hnRNP H","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"hnRNP F","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"hnRNPI\/PTB","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"KSRP","pAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"4F4 (hnRNP C)","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"1D8 (hnRNP M)","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"CNPase","mAb: 1:1000"]},{"entry":[{},"MAP2","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"NeuN","mAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"Sp1 (sc-59)","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"RAR\u03b3(sc-550)","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"Staufen (AB5819)","pAb: 1:500"]},{"entry":[{},"SUMO-1","mAb"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Following the 1\u00d7SSC post-hybridization wash of the FISH procedure, sections were incubated in primary antibodies (Table 1, above) overnight at 4\u00b0 C., washed five times with PBS for 2 min, and then incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit polyclonal or Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse polyclonal, Molecular Probes) and 33 nM diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 min at room temperature.

Sections were washed five times in PBS prior to mounting.","To estimate relative MBNL1 concentration in nucleoplasm in DM1 nuclei vs. controls, sections of temporal cortex were processed on the same slide and imaged under the same exposure settings. Merged images for Texas red (to visualize RNA foci), Alexa 488 (for MBNL1) and DAP1 (for nuclear DNA) were obtained. Regions of interest were manually defined as nuclear area excluding nucleolus, RNA foci, and overlapping lipofuscin. MBNL1 fluorescence intensity (mean optical density in monochrome mode in arbitrary units) in the region of interest was determined for 20 cortical neuronal nuclei per subject. Because of the difficulty of estimating background fluorescence from brain sections, the results are not corrected for background. This approach provides a conservative estimate of the fold-reduction for MBNL1 in DM1 nucleoplasm.","Counts of 100 NeuN-positive cells from temporal and frontal cortex of 4 patients with classical DM1 (selected for best relative preservation of cortical architecture) showed RNA foci in >85% of cortical neurons in each case. More than one focus was visible in \u02dc30% of cortical neurons, and occasional neurons had up to 15 small foci. In contrast, the individual having a small CTG repeat expansion (77 repeats) and mild phenotype (cataracts, mild weakness, and cognitive impairment after age 60 years) had foci in only 39% of NeuN-positive neurons in temporal cortex.","RNA foci were widely distributed in other neuronal populations, including the hippocampus (all sectors), dentate gyrus, thalamus, and also the substantia nigra and brain stem tegmentum (each of 4 patients examined) (). The main exception was in cerebellar cortex, where small foci were detected in some Purkinje cells but not in neurons of the molecular or granular cell layers (n=6 patients examined) ().","RNA foci were also present in the subcortical white matter and corpus callosum in occasional cells expressing 2\u20323\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a marker for oligodendrocytes (). However, these foci were smaller and less intense than those in cortical neurons. In sections processed on the same slide and imaged under the same exposure settings, quantitation of FISH signals indicated that the amount of CUG expansion RNA in frontal cortical neurons was 2.9-fold greater (area\u00d7intensity) than in Purkinje cells (p<10) and 18-fold greater than in oligodendrocytes (p<10) within the same individual (n=3 patients, 60 nuclei per patient).","Paired samples of frontal cortex and biceps muscle were available for three patients. When sections of skeletal muscle and cerebral cortex from same patient were processed on the same slide and imaged under the same exposure settings, the RNA inclusions were larger and more intense (3.1-fold greater, area\u00d7intensity) in frontal cortical neurons than in skeletal muscle from the same individual (p<10, ).","To determine if mutant RNA resides in a previously identified nuclear domain, mutant RNA was tested for colocalization with proteins that mark different nuclear compartments. These and subsequent experiments localizing protein relative to expanded poly(CUG) RNA were performed on a subset of 4 DM1 and 3 non-disease control samples showing the best preservation of cortical architecture. In contrast to nuclear inclusions of polyglutamine proteins (Skinner, P. J., Koshy, B. T., Cummings, C. J., Klement, I. A., Helin, K., Servadio, A., Zoghbi, H. Y., and Orr, H. T. (1997), 389, 971-974), RNA foci did not colocalize with PML bodies ().","Colocalization of mutant RNA was likewise not found with the nucleolus (visualized by DNA staining or antibodies to C23 nucleolin), perinucleolar compartment (antibodies to polypyrimidine tract binding protein), or \u201cspeckles\u201d (antibodies to hnRNP C) (data not shown). The possibility of colocalization with Cajal bodies cannot be eliminated, because p80 coilin antibodies did not consistently identify Cajal bodies in cortical neurons stained by the presently described methods.","Recruitment of proteasome and exosome to nuclear RNA foci: the proteasome and exosome are multisubunit complexes responsible for protein and RNA degradation, respectively. To determine if these complexes are recruited to nuclear RNA foci, FISH analysis was combined with immunofluorescence using antibodies to components of the proteasome or exosome. Three components of the proteasome (20Sa, 11Sy and 11Sa subunits) were recruited to RNA foci in cortical neurons (; ). No evidence was found, however, for ubiquitination or sumoylation of the foci (not shown). In contrast, antibodies to the PM\/Scl75 or PM\/Scl100 components of the exosome did not colocalize with RNA foci (). This observation indicates that the proteasome may be recruited by conformational changes in MBNL1, MBNL2, or other poly(CUG) binding proteins. In such a case, loss of muscleblind function in DM1 may result from the combined effects of sequestration and accelerated degradation.","Monoclonal antibody 3B1 showed strong expression of CUGBP1 in cortical neurons (). The distribution of this protein in neuronal nucleus and cytoplasm appears similar in DM1 patients and controls, and FISH\/IF analysis shows that CUGBP1 is not recruited into RNA foci. Polyclonal antibodies to other members of the CUGBP1 family, ETR3 and CELF4, also fail to colocalize with foci (not shown). None of six different dsRNA binding proteins in neuronal nuclei (staufen, NF90, ADAR1, PACT, PKR, RNA helicase A) colocalize with RNA foci (representative images for NF90 are shown in  and ADAR1 in ).","The RNA binding proteins hnRNP Al, hnRNP I, hnRNP M, KSRP and HuR did not colocalize with RNA foci (representative image for hnRNP M is shown in ). In contrast, hnRNPs H and F colocalized with foci in cortical neurons to a limited extent (, ), and these results were verified using two different polyclonal antibodies for each protein. The intensity of immunofluorescence for these proteins was greatest at the site of RNA foci; however, there did not appear to be significant depletion of hnRNP H or hnRNP F elsewhere in the neuronal nucleoplasm.","The splicing of neuron-specific exon N1 of c-src, which is promoted by hnRNPs H and F (Min, H., Chan, R. C., and Black, D. L. (1995), 9, 2659-2671; Chou, M. Y., Rooke, N., Turck, C. W., and Black, D. L. (1999), 19, 69-77) was not reduced in DM1 cerebral cortex. Indeed, inclusion of the N1 exon showed a slight (1.3-fold, p<0.02) increase in DM1 with respect to controls, opposite to the predicted effect of hnRNP F or H depletion (not shown). This fits with expectations that the number and density of binding sites on a single transcript, hence the capacity for protein sequestration, is much greater for proteins that bind to expanded poly(CUG) than for proteins that bind DMPK mRNA outside of the repeat tract.","Mutant DMPK mRNA is reported to interact with transcription factors retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR\u03b3) and Sp1 (Ebralidze, A., Wang, Y., Petkova, V., Ebralidse, K., and Junghans, R. P. (2004), 303, 383-387). In cortical neurons, these transcription factors were readily detected by immunofluorescence but they did not colocalize with RNA foci () and their distribution was similar in DM1 patients and controls ().","Polyclonal antisera recognizing all members of the muscleblind family (MBNL1, MBNL2, and MBNL3) showed strong colocalization with RNA foci (not shown). We used monoclonal antibodies raised against epitopes specific for MBNL1 or MBNL2 to determine which muscleblind proteins interact with CUG expansion RNA in neurons. MBNL3 was not examined because its expression in adults is mainly restricted to placenta (Fardaei, M., Rogers, M. T., Thorpe, H. M., Larkin, K. Hamshere, M. G., Harper, P. S., and Brook, J. D. (2002), 11, 805-814; Kanadia, R. N., Urbinati, C. R., Crusselle, V. J., Luo, D., Lee, Y. J., Harrison, J. K., Oh, S. P., and Swanson, M. S. (2003), 3, 459-462). In normal controls, monoclonal antibody 3A4 showed expression of MBNL1 in nuclei and cytoplasm of cortical neurons ().","In DM1, MBNL1 was strongly recruited into RNA foci, whereas staining elsewhere in the nucleus was markedly reduced (). Quantitative analysis was performed on 3 DM1 patients and non-neurologic disease controls having the shortest postmortem intervals and best preservation of cortical architecture (). The mean immunofluorescence intensity for MBNL1 in the nucleoplasm (excluding RNA foci and nucleoli) was 2.3-fold lower in DM1 neurons than in non-disease controls (26\u00b19 area\u00d7intensity units in DM1 patients vs 61\u00b117 in controls, 20 neuronal nuclei per subject, p<0.00001). Monoclonal antibody 2D9 showed that MBNL2 was also recruited into RNA foci (). However, immunofluorescence signals in neurons with MoAb 2D9 were lower in relation to background staining in the neuropil, precluding a reliable quantification of its distribution. The finding of depletion of MBNL1 in the nucleoplasm of DM1 cells supports a model where CUG expansion RNA accumulates to levels sufficient to sequester and compromise the nuclear functions of MBNL1.","To determine if DM1 is associated with altered regulation of alternative splicing in brain, 45 exons (in 31 genes) known to undergo alternative splicing in brain (Table 2, below) were examined.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0227"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"List of exons screened for abnormal regulation of alternative splicing in DM1"},{"entry":"compared to control without neurologic disease. \u201cNucleotides\u201d indicates which"},{"entry":"portion of the specified cDNA (GenBank accession number) was amplified by"},{"entry":"RT-PCR."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Alternatively",{},{}]},{"entry":["Gene Name","Unigene","Spliced Exon","Acc.

The cDNA was digested with RNase H and then amplified using PCR primers flanking alternatively spliced exons (Table 2).","PCR products were resolved on agarose gels, stained with SybrGreenII (Molecular Probes), and analyzed on a fluorimager. An initial screen was performed on a subset of samples (4 DM1 and 2 control). Four exons appeared to show deregulated splicing in DM1. These differences were quantified in a second experiment including the full panel of 7 DM1 and 5 control samples. The fraction of exon inclusion was determined on triplicate reactions using ImageQuant software (Amersham, Piscataway).","For each exon, the ratio of inclusion versus exclusion isoforms was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using primers flanking the regulated exon. An initial screen was performed using total RNA extracted from superior temporal cortex from two controls without neurological disease and four DM1 patients. Among 45 exons screened, 4 appeared to show a change in the ratio of exon inclusion\/exclusion splice products in DM1. These differences were then confirmed and quantified in triplicate assays using temporal cortex RNA from 7 patients with DM1 and 5 controls (). DM1 was associated with decreased inclusion of amyloid precursor protein exon 7 (10\u00b11% in DM1, 30\u00b111% in controls, p<0.001), increased inclusion of NMDA NR1 receptor exon 5 (33\u00b111% in DM1, 11 +5% in controls, p<0.01), decreased inclusion of tau exon 2 (5\u00b11% in DM1, 36\u00b110% in controls, p<10), and decreased inclusion of tau exon 10 (21\u00b11% in DM1, 41\u00b15% in controls, p<10).","MBNL regulates fetal exon skipping in adults. The associated disease constitutes the failure in tissues to splice out specific fetal exons. Without MBNL, the fetal exons are retained. Other exons similarly regulated by MBNL remain to be identified.","Notably, DM1 is associated with reduced exon 10 inclusion (), and FTDP-17 and DM1 are both associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (Foster, N. L., Wilhelmsen, K., Sima, A. A., Jones, M. Z., D'Amato, C. J., and Gilman, S. (1997), 41, 706-715; Kiuchi, A., Otsuka, N., Namba, Y., Nakano, I., and Tomonaga, M. (1991), 82, 1-5; Yoshimura, N., Otake, M., Igarashi, K., Matsunaga, M., Takebe, K., and Kudo, H. (1990), 9, 234-239; Vermersch, P., Sergeant, N., Ruchoux, M. M., Hofmann-Radvanyi, H., Wattez, A., Petit, H., Dwailly, P., and Delacourte, A. (1996), 47, 711-717.","Neuronal intranuclear inclusions are characteristic of several neurological disorders. In the polyglutamine disorders, the core component of the inclusion is mutant protein or a cleavage product containing the polyglutamine tract (Davies, S. W., Turnaine, k M., Cozens, B. A., DiFiglia, M., Sharp, A. H., Ross, C. A., Scherzinger, E., Wanker, E. E., Mangiarini, L., and Bates, G. P. (1997), 90, 537-548; DiFiglia, M., Sapp, E., Chase, K. O., Davies, S. W., Bates, G. P., Vonsattel, J. P., and Aronin, N. (1997), 277, 1990-1993). In Fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), FMR1 mRNA having an expanded CGG repeat leads to formation of nuclear inclusions (Greco, C. M., Hagerman, R. J., Tassone, F., Chudley, A. E., Del Bigio, M. R., Jacquemont, S., Leehey, M., and Hagerman, P. J. (2002), 125, 1760-1771). The above-delineated results indicate that DM1 should be added to the list of disorders characterized by neuronal intranuclear inclusions.","Furthermore, in DM1 muscle tissue, evidence indicates that RNA inclusions are directly involved in disease pathogenesis, through a mechanism that involves sequestration of muscleblind proteins and mis-regulation of alternative splicing (Kanadia, R. N., Johnstone, K. A., Mankodi, A., Lungu, C., Thornton, C. A, Esson, D., Timmers, A. M., Hauswirth, W. W., and Swanson, M. S. (2003), 302, 1978-1980; Mankodi, A., Logigian, E., Callahan, L., McClain, C., White, R., Henderson, D., Krym, M., and Thornton, C. A. (2000), 289, 1769-1773). The strong expression of expanded poly(CUG) RNA in DM1 neurons, formation of RNA inclusions, redistribution of muscleblind proteins, and altered regulation of alternative splicing shown above indicate that CNS symptoms of DM1 may also be triggered by RNA inclusions.","Despite evidence that mutant DMPK RNA accumulates to higher levels in cortical neurons (), the cell degeneration is more severe in muscle. The present results also indicate that splicing abnormalities are less frequent and less severe in cerebral cortex than in skeletal muscle (), suggesting that muscleblind proteins are more effectively sequestered in muscle nuclei, or that compensation for muscleblind deficiency is more effective in neurons, perhaps due to expression of additional RNA binding proteins. The exact determinants of cell vulnerability in DM1 are unknown, but the stoichiometry of CUG expansion RNA in relation to muscleblind proteins is likely to play an important role. Of note, while the present studies establish that the mutant DMPK mRNA is widely expressed in cortical and subcortical neurons, the failure to detect DMPK immunologically likely reflects its relatively low concentration in brain homogenates.","The 3-fold increase in the fraction of NMDA receptor 1 (NMDAR1) mRNA that includes exon 5 observed in DM1 brain is of significance, since inclusion of this exon influences the pharmacologic behavior, gating, and cellular distribution (somatic rather than somatodendritic expression) of NMDAR1 (Pal, R., Agbas, A., Bao, X., Hui, D., Leary, C., Hunt, J., Naniwadekar, A., Michaelis, M. L., Kumar, K. N., and Michaelis, E. K. (2003), Brain Res., 994, 1-18).","NMDAR1 function is required for normal long term potentiation in the hippocampus and learning (Tsien, J. Z., Huerta, P. T. and Tonegawa, S. (1996), 87, 1327-1338). Thus, altered splicing of exon 5 may contribute to the memory impairment observed in DM1 (Rubinsztein, J. S., Rubinsztein, D. C., McKenna, P. J., Goodburn, S., and Holland, A. J. (1997), 34, 229-233).","Inclusion of tau exon 2 is reduced in DM1, confirming previous observations (Sergeant, N., Sablonniere, B., Schraen-Maschke, S., Ghestem, A., Maurage, C. A., Wattez, A., Vermersch, P., and Delacourte, A. (2001), 10, 2143-2155). These results predict that fetal isoforms of tau (excluding exons 2, 3, and 10) are inappropriately expressed in adult DM1 brain, findings that correlate well with previous studies of tau protein in DM1 brain (Sergeant, N., Sablonniere, B., Schraen-Maschke, S., Ghestem, A., Maurage, C. A., Wattez, A., Vermersch, P., and Delacourte, A. (2001), 10, 2143-2155).","Expression of human fetal tau in transgenic mice leads to formation of neurofibrillary tangles and axonopathy (Ishihara, T., Zhang, B., Higuchi, M., Yoshiyama, Y., Trojanowksi, J. Q., and Lee, V. M. (2001), 158, 555-562). It is unclear, however, whether the extent of the tau missplicing in DM1 is sufficient to cause neuronal dysfunction. Together with the above-described finding that DM1 is associated with increased expression of fetal splice isoforms for APP (exon 7 exclusion products), it is indicated that accumulation of mutant DMPK mRNA in the neuronal nucleus compromises a specific developmental program of alternative splicing.","The methods, techniques and compositions disclosed and claimed herein can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure.
