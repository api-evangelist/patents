{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This description relates to order processing.","Order processing occurs in a very wide variety of settings. In some settings, the orders are for goods or services, for example, consumer goods that are to be prepared and delivered quickly after the orders are placed.","In restaurants serving what is sometimes referred to as \u201cfast food\u201d, customers line up at one or more queues at a front counter and place orders for food items. Such restaurants are also sometimes referred to as \u201cquick-serve\u201d restaurants. The customers wait nearby until the orders are processed and delivered at the front counter. Customers then walk to tables with their delivered orders. In this scenario, workers at the restaurant's front counter enter the customer orders into registers, assemble the orders (from food items that are made in response to the orders or are prepared in advance), and deliver the orders. Food items include entrees, appetizers, beverages, and desserts, for example, and any other edible items, whether prepared to order or prepared in advance.","In general, quick-serve restaurants are distinguished from other types of restaurants by the short time interval between when a customer places an order and when the customer receives the order. In some cases this period could be as long as five or ten minutes or as short as 10 or 15 seconds.","Quick-serve restaurants also often have drive-through service that enables customers to place orders at an order point and pick up orders at a delivery point while remaining in an automobile. To reduce the delay during busy periods, multiple drive-through service lanes can be provided.","Order processing for some kinds of goods and services, for example, clothing or electronic products, is done using telephone call centers.","In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method that includes, at a place at which goods or services are offered, enabling orders for goods or services to be received from electronic devices situated at multiple points at which orders are to be placed, and receiving the orders electronically through a communication medium that enables automatic identification of the location at which each of the orders is placed.","Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. The place at which goods and services are offered includes a place at which each of the goods or services is to be provided quickly in response to the order. The place at which goods and services are offered includes a quick-serve restaurant. The electronic devices include voice receiving devices. The electronic devices are within the place at which the goods or services are being offered. In some examples, the electronic devices are not within the place at which the goods or services are being offered. The goods and services are made in response to the orders. The devices include telephone handsets. The devices include voice enabled computers using a voice over internet protocol. The multiple points at which the devices are situated are determined based on the IP addresses of the devices. The electronic devices include interactive terminals. The multiple points include points at which the goods or services are to be delivered. The points at which orders are placed include tables.","The communication medium includes a network. The network includes a telephone network. The communication medium includes a telephone switch. Information about the points at which orders are placed is provided to call management software running on a computer. Orders for the goods or services are entered at points different from the points at which the orders are placed. The goods or services are delivered at points different from the points at which the orders are placed. The points at which orders are placed include drive-through points. The points at which orders are placed include kiosks. The points at which orders are placed include areas of the place of commerce in which adults supervise children at play. The location at which an order is placed is associated electronically with a location at which the goods or services are to be delivered. The association of the order location with the delivery may be changed after the order is placed and before the order is delivered. Each of the orders is associated electronically with one of the order points and with a point at which the goods or services are to be delivered. The association may be changed after the order is placed and before the order is delivered.","A class of service is automatically inferred for each of the orders based on the point at which the order is placed. The class of service includes the urgency with which the goods or services must be delivered. The class of service depends on a status of a person who is placing an order. The status includes a mode of transportation. A class of service is associated electronically with each of the order points. The association may be changed at any time. One of the order points includes a standalone phone tree at an entrance to a play place of a quick-serve restaurant. One of the order points includes a front counter of a quick-serve restaurant.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features apparatus that includes, in a place at which goods and services are offered: a telephone switch, telephones located at multiple points at which orders for the goods or services are to be placed, a telephone network connecting the telephones to the switch, and software that uses information received from the switch about which of the telephones is a source of a call, to infer points at which the goods and services being ordered should be delivered.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features apparatus comprising stations within a place at which goods or services are offered, at least one of the stations being a station at which orders for the goods or services are entered and at least one of the stations being a station at which the goods or services are prepared for delivery, and a network interconnecting the stations within the place, the network being configured for communication among the stations using a TCP\/IP protocol.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a method that includes receiving from an electronic device located in a play place of a quick-serve restaurant, orders for meals.","Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. The orders are received by telephone. The goods include quick-serve food. The remote delivery point includes a quick-serve restaurant. Prices of goods with respect to the delivery point are available at the order entry point. There are also additional remote delivery points at which the goods are to be prepared for delivery.","In general, in other aspects, the invention features methods in which orders for goods are received electronically at an order entry point, the orders to be fulfilled by delivery of the goods at a remote delivery point at which the goods are to be quickly prepared in accordance with the orders for delivery to customers at the delivery point. In various aspects, the orders are received by telephone, the goods comprising quick-serve food, the remote delivery point comprising a quick-serve restaurant, the prices of goods with respect to the delivery point are available at the order entry point, and the goods are prepared for delivery at additional remote delivery points.","Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. Prices of the goods differ for different ones of the delivery points and the different prices with respect to the different delivery points are available at the order entry point. The prices of the goods further differ for different ones of the order points. The different delivery points are located in multiple time zones, the volume of received orders from all of the time zones varies in a predictable way during a -hour period, and staff employed at the order entry point are balanced in a manner that takes advantage of the predictable variation. Menus of goods differ for different ones of the delivery points and the different menus with respect to the different delivery points are available at the order entry point. The different delivery points are associated with different brands. The different delivery points are located in different states or territories.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a method that includes receiving orders for quick-serve meals by telephone at a call center, and sending information about the orders electronically to at least two different quick-serve restaurants at which the respective meals are to be delivered.","These and other embodiments may have one or more of the following advantages. Order processing is made simpler and less expensive. Placing orders and receiving them is made simpler, easier, and more comfortable. New modes of receiving, entering, preparing, and delivering orders are made possible. In the case of a quick-serve restaurant, customers can sit comfortably at a table to order food and while waiting for delivery. Customers can watch their children play in a play area while ordering food and then waiting for the food. The multi-lane, multi-order point drive-through food order and delivery system enables restaurant workers to match customers with customer food orders regardless of the sequence of customer arrivals at the food delivery points, through the use of customer images captured at the multiple order points, as well as other means. Using a telephone call center for order entry reduces labor cost and enables specialized call center workers to handle surges in business at meal times. Moreover, by handling calls from restaurants in different time zones, the call center staff can remain fully utilized all day long. Worker's compensation insurance is less expensive for call center workers than for in-restaurant staff because of the relatively safer work environment.","Other advantages will become apparent from the following description and from the claims.","In what follows, an \u201corder\u201d is a set of items chosen by a customer. These items can include both standard items and customized items. For example, in the context of a quick-serve restaurant, the order could include a standard \u201clarge fries\u201d and a customized \u201chamburger with pickles and onions, no mustard or mayonnaise.\u201d. An \u201corder point\u201d is a logical location where a customer places his order, for example, the order point could be at the front counter or at the drive-through lane. An \u201corder entry point\u201d is a logical location where information about the order is entered in a machine-based system that manages orders. A \u201cpayment point\u201d is a logical location at which payment is made for the order, for example, a cashier position at a front counter. \u201cMarking\u201d an order is an action that labels a customer's order with information that is useful for uniquely identifying the customer at the time of delivery. A \u201cdelivery point\u201d is a logical location where the customer receives the order, for example, at a table in a restaurant.","Referring to , in one example of a commercial context in which orders for goods or services are processed, a quick-serve restaurant  includes a front counter , an order area , and a delivery area \u2032. The restaurant  uses restaurant management software and a database to manage the placing of orders, the entry of orders, the preparation of the food in accordance with the orders, and the assembly and delivery of the orders, among other things. In one mode of operation, workers at the front counter  receive food orders and payment from customers in an order area  (which then serves as both the order entry point and the payment point) and enter them into the database using order entry terminals. Customers in the delivery area \u2032 (which then serves as the delivery point) wait for deliveries of the orders from the front counter . At a kitchen , workers produce food items to fulfill the orders and send the food items to a landing zone .","The restaurant management software determines production requirements for food items at any given time from the orders stored in the database, determines production instructions from these requirements, and displays the production instructions on kitchen video displays (not shown). The restaurant management software develops these production instructions by matching production resources with production requirements and balancing the loading of the resources. Production resources include grills for cooking food. Thus, in some examples, the restaurant management software can balance the production loading of kitchen grills by displaying different orders to be processed on kitchen video displays in front of different kitchen grills. Workers at the front counter  take food items from the landing zone  and from other supplies of prepared food items, assemble the orders according to order information presented by the restaurant management software on the kitchen video displays, and deliver the orders to customers in the delivery area \u2032. Customers leave the restaurant  with the food orders or consume the food orders in a dining room . The dining room  is divided into a seating area \u2032 and a caf\u00e9 \u2033. The restaurant may be organized in a wide variety of other configurations. And a wide variety of modes of order taking, order entry, food item preparation, order assembly, and order delivery can be used.","For example, in another mode of operation, customers place orders using telephones (not shown) while sitting at tables (the order points) in the cafe \u2033. Order takers working at an order entry area  (the order entry point) receive the calls from the telephones at the tables. Each telephone at a table in the cafe \u2033 has a unique extension identifier in a telephone switch (not shown), enabling the restaurant management software to associate an order with a specific table (order point and delivery point) automatically. When the order takers at the order entry area  enter the orders, the identities of the tables from which the orders are placed are thus automatically entered into the database from information provided by the telephone switch. Alternatively, the delivery point information may be entered manually by the order taker from information displayed at order entry stations at the order entry area . As before, workers in the kitchen  process the food items according to the orders (for example, an order may request a large hamburger, well done, with mustard and mayonnaise, on a sesame seed bun). Expeditors in the landing zone  assemble the orders and deliver the orders to tables in the cafe \u2033 according to the identities of the tables associated with each order. Customers may pay by either swiping a credit card in a machine (not shown) at the customer's table or by making a cash payment to expediters delivering the orders at tables in the cafe \u2033. Customers eat the food at tables in cafe \u2033.","Many other modes of operation are also possible, not limited to the following examples.","In another mode of operation, customers place orders at \u201cfree-standing\u201d telephone trees  and \u2032 to order takers at order entry area . The telephone trees  and \u2032 are clusters of telephones that are separate from tables or counters and are available for calls to order entry area . Because the telephones in telephone trees  and \u2032 are not associated with particular tables, a method is provided to enable the customers and the expeditors to correctly associate an order with a table at which it is to be delivered. One example method is to provide table tents to the customers to post on the table at which they are going to eat. Each table tent bears a unique number large enough to be visible at some distance. While placing an order, the customer communicates the tent number to the order taker. The order taker enters the number into the system so that it becomes associated with the order in the database. After placing the order, the customer pays at the front counter \u2032, displays the table tent on the table, and waits for the delivery of the order.","In another mode of operation, customers place orders at a telephone tree  (or simply an individual telephone) located in a playplace , where young children can play while families wait for deliveries of orders. Parents placing orders at telephone tree  can supervise their children playing in the playplace . Table tents can be used, as in the earlier example, to identify the table or other delivery point at which the customer wants to receive the order.","In some examples, customers in the restaurant  can directly place orders using customer self-service kiosks in a designated area (not shown) away from dining room . Each customer kiosk is linked to the database. While the order is being placed, the kiosk takes a picture of the customer with a digital camera and enters the image into the database, linked to the order. When the order is finished, an expeditor delivers it to the customer matching the picture and seated in dining room  and collects a cash payment, unless the customer has already made payment by swiping a credit card at the customer self-service kiosk. More details of the customer self-service kiosks are explained below.","The restaurant  also includes a manager's office  with access to real-time data describing orders and food production status presented by the restaurant management software.","In another mode of order processing, customers can place and pick up orders using a drive-through lane outside the restaurant. Using the drive-through mode, the customers place orders (with order takers in the order entry area ) through telephones at one or more order points located in one or more lanes of a drive-through , view their orders on drive-through displays (not shown), pay a cashier through a window  (the payment point), and pick up the orders through a delivery point window . Additional order points and drive-through displays are provided ahead of the lanes of the drive-through  in a so-called zoom-through . Customers who do not need extra assistance from live order takers and can pay quickly using a credit card, place orders at order points in the lanes in the zoom-through  with workers in the area . Such extra assistance includes questions about menu choices. Customers who do need the extra assistance from operators in the area  place orders at order points in the lanes of the drive-through  with operators in the order entry area . Customers who enter in the zoom-through  and need extra assistance from a live order taker are asked to move forward to the drive-through .","Cameras (not shown) at the order points in drive-through  and zoom-through  are configured to capture digital images of customers in their automobiles placing orders. For example, the digital cameras used may be part of the restaurant's security surveillance system. In such a case, the restaurant management software directs the security system to extract a still frame from the video stream coming from the appropriate one of its cameras. The same camera may thus be used for both general security purposes as well as customer identification. These digital images are stored in the database, wherein they are associated with the related orders. When a customer arrives at the cashier at the window , the cashier views a gallery of digital customer pictures on a display and identifies the customer by matching the correct displayed image with the live customer. Since there are only a few pictures on the display to compare with the customer at the window , a low-resolution image, for example, of at least 180 horizontal pixels by 135 vertical pixels, is sufficient to match the customer with a picture. Based on this match, the restaurant management software presents a bill for the order to the cashier. The cashier tells the customer the amount due, and the customer pays the cashier. When the customer arrives at a delivery point at the window , a worker views the customer picture gallery again to match the customer's picture (and related order) to the live customer. The restaurant management software presents a list of items in the order along with an indicator that the bill has been paid or not. If the bill has been paid, then the worker assembles the order and delivers it to the customer.","In some of the examples discussed above, the order takers have been removed from their usual place at the order counter of the restaurant to a place in the non-public parts of the restaurant. But the order takers need not even be in the restaurant. They could be, for example, in an adjacent or nearby building directly connected to the telephone switch of the restaurant.","In other examples, the order takers are located at a place that is remote from the restaurant  and is not directly wired to the telephone switch of the restaurant. The remote location can be a telephone call center. By locating the order entry point in a telephone call center, the process of receiving and entering the orders can be streamlined and made quicker. Hiring, management, and training of the order takers can be separated from hiring, management, and training of the workers in the restaurant. Labor costs may be reduced. For example, the workers' compensation insurance costs for employees working in the call center, an office environment, may be lower than for employees working the relatively more hazardous environment of the restaurant.","Additional efficiencies can be achieved by locating order takers for multiple restaurants in the telephone call center. By handling a larger volume of order taking, the order takers can be more highly trained and more focused on the order taking activity than may be possible in a restaurant where the order taker may have to take on additional responsibilities. Less overall staff is required because it is possible to utilize all the capacity of an order taker who services customers at multiple restaurants. Furthermore, the multiple restaurants  can be located in multiple time zones. Because the volume of received orders from each of the time zones varies in a predictable way during a twenty-four hour period, an intense order entry period in one time zone may be followed by an intense order entry period in the next time zone, and the load on the central order takers can be balanced in a manner that takes advantage of this predictable variation. The telephone call center is described in more detail below.","Referring to , view  of the restaurant  shows order terminals  for order takers at the front counter . In some examples, referring to , order takers at the front counter  use a graphical user interface  displayed on the order terminals , to enter orders. In some examples, referring to , cashiers at the front counter  use a graphical user interface  displayed on the order terminals  to enter payment for orders and provide change to customers. Drive-through cashiers in the payment area  can also use the graphical user interface  displayed on the terminals  to enter payment and provide change.","Referring to , cashiers at the front counter  can also use a graphical user interface  displayed on the order terminals  to match a customer with a food order. The graphical user interface  shows a gallery of unfilled orders each with an order number , the contents of the order , and the price  for each unfilled order. The graphical user interface  also includes an elapsed time  since a customer's order was entered.","Expeditors working at the front counter  and serving food to the dining room  view the terminals  to assemble the orders. Referring to , these expediters at the front counter  can use a graphical user interface  to match a customer with an order. The graphical user interface  shows a gallery of unfilled orders each with an order number , the contents of the order , and an indication of the delivery point, for example, delivery at a table bearing a table tent number . The expediters match a customer with an order by comparing the table tent number  or the order number  of a customer with the orders shown in the graphical user interface . Once a food order is identified on the graphical user interface , an expeditor can read the food items for the order, assemble the order accordingly, and deliver it to the location indicated.","Referring to , drive-through cashiers in the payment area  (the payment point) and drive-through presenters in the drive-through delivery area  also can use interfaces  and  to match the current customer at the window with an order. The interface  displays pictures  of customers with unfilled orders in an order gallery. The restaurant management software sorts the unfilled or pending orders in a sequence in which the customers are expected to appear at the delivery point (based on when the customers enter their orders) and puts this sequence into an order gallery. Interface  also includes an order number . The drive-through cashiers in the payment area  and the drive-through presenters in the delivery area  each click on a picture  in the interface  that matches the view of the current customer at the cashier's or presenter's window. This highlights an order in the interface . Interface  includes an order gallery with unfilled orders that includes for each unfilled order an order number , the contents of the order , and the price . The drive-through cashiers know how much to charge a customer by viewing price  of a highlighted order in interface  and the drive-through presenters know how to assemble an order by viewing contents of highlighted order  in interface .","In addition to the terminals, registers, and workstations that display and receive order information, the restaurant includes other hardware devices that interact with the restaurant management software.","For example, an automatic beverage system  () automatically dispenses the drink portion of an order. The restaurant management software manages the automatic beverage system . An example of an automatic beverage system is available from IMI Cornelius of Anoka, Minn., USA.","Kitchen video displays (KVD)  display food production requirements created by the restaurant management software. In some examples, the kitchen video displays  present the food production requirements using the interface , as illustrated in . A particular kitchen video display  is in front of grill \u201cgrill \u201d. The interface  includes an identifier  that indicates the identity of the grill \u201cgrill \u201d. The interface  also includes a customer order number  and the contents of the order . The interface  shows five of the seven orders displayed in the interface  because the restaurant management software has determined that grill \u201cgrill 01\u201d can only handle the five orders. With production resource load balancing, other grills in kitchen  are designated to handle the other orders. In some examples, the restaurant management software can be configured to display the interface  in other languages such as interface , illustrated in .","The restaurant management software uses printers  to print slips for custom orders for food item production. The slips are attached to orders throughout the process of food item production. The restaurant management software also uses the printers  to print receipts for payment for orders.","A KVD controller  is a software component of the restaurant management software that controls the KVDs .","A drive-through display  displays orders to customers in the drive-through  and zoom-through . This display enables each customer to get visual confirmation of his or her order.","A system server  manages interactions for a central computer database for the restaurant management software.","A manager station  allows a manager of the restaurant  to view food production and service activity in the restaurant. In some examples, a manager station  displays a graphical user interface , as illustrated in . The manager station  can use a broadband data line  to link the manager to the Internet. Referring to , managers can view information about the multiple restaurants  using interfaces  and  over the Internet. These managers can also modify menus and change prices using interfaces  and . An interface  shows a recipe for coffee with options at a particular restaurant . A button  enables a manager to modify the recipe. An interface  shows hot beverages, cold beverages, and shakes available at a particular restaurant . The manager's interface is linked directly to the database in the restaurant (without the intervention of any intermediary database or process), so that information presented to the manager is derived directly from the database of the restaurant and changes made by the manager through the interface are committed directly to the database in the restaurant.","Customer self-service kiosks  enable customers to enter orders without requiring a human order taker at the other end of a telephone. A customer kiosk  includes a camera that takes a digital picture of a customer (similarly to the taking of a picture for a drive-through customer as described earlier) during order entry so that expeditors in the restaurant  can identify the customer for delivery of the order. The expeditor uses an interface similar to the gallery of pictures and orders in interface  to match the customer to his or her order for payment and delivery.","In some examples, referring to , the customer kiosks  provide an interface  on a touch screen. A customer touches a button  to begin entering an order. The customer then touches a button  in an interface  to specify that the order is to be eaten in the restaurant  or the button  to specify that the order is to be eaten outside of the restaurant .","Referring to , an interface  enables the customer to add different food items to the order. Referring to , an interface  shows the customer the current order and enables the customer to enter the order by clicking on a button  or add more food to the order by clicking on a button . An interface  shows the customer that the order has been entered. Subsequently, the customer leaves the kiosk  (freeing it up for the next customer), goes to a cashier at front counter  to pay for his order, and waits for delivery at the front counter . Otherwise, the customer sits in the dining room  and waits for an expeditor to deliver the order there.","Referring to , in an example of the physical arrangement of devices in a restaurant, the front counter  includes cashier stations  and  having an order entry capability and an order taker telephone . The front counter  also includes a printer . The kitchen  includes kitchen video system monitors , , , and  and a printer . The landing zone  includes expeditor monitors  and  in addition to a printer . The seating area \u2032 includes tables  and . The caf\u00e9 \u2033 includes tables , , , and  having customer telephones , , , and , respectively. The telephone tree  includes customer telephones , , and . The telephone tree \u2032 includes customer telephones , , and . The order entry area  includes order entry stations , , and  in addition to order taker telephones , , and . The playplace telephone tree  includes telephones  and . The drive-through lanes  include speaker\/microphones  and  in addition to drive-through displays  and . The drive-through lanes  also include cameras  and . The drive-through cashier payment area  includes a cashier station  with an order entry and order taker telephone . The drive-through presenter  includes a cashier station  with an order entry and expeditor monitor , and an automatic beverage system . The zoom-through area  includes cameras  and , drive-through displays  and , and speaker\/microphones  and . The cashier stations , , , , order entry stations , , , expeditor monitors , , kitchen video system monitors , , , , and drive-through displays , , ,  are linked together using a network  (shown in ).","Referring to , customer telephones , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and  are connected to order taker telephones , , , and  using a telephone switch . The telephone lines  connect the customer telephones to the telephone switch  while the telephone lines  connect the phone switch to the order taker telephones. The telephone switch  communicates to telephone switch interface  the phone extension of a customer telephone from customer telephones , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and  every time an order taker receives an order from a customer using a customer telephone. The telephone switch interface  extracts the extension numbers of the calling and receiving phones by scanning data the phone switch  writes to its Station Message Detail Recording (SMDR) port. The switch interface  is connected to the phone switch 's SMDR port via a serial RS-232 standard printer interface . The restaurant management software running on server  receives the telephone extension information, looks the extension information up in a table linking extension numbers with order locations and order entry locations, and furnishes the resulting order point location information to an order entry terminal (from the appropriate order entry stations , , , and ) with an order entry location matching the order taker's extension. The order entry terminal then adds the order location information to the order record. In some examples, the network  is a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) network. The restaurant management software matches this location information to a number designating a table , , , or  and communicates this table number with an order record to the database on server  using network .","In some examples, the restaurant management software can be configured to use the information about the location of the customer placing the order to modify the prices charged for each item in a food order and displayed in interface . For instance, prices could be lower for customers ordering food in the drive-through  or the zoom-through  than for customers in the dining area . The software could also adjust other aspects of the order based on the identity of the order point.","In some implementations, the telephones in the restaurant  may be replaced by Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) enabled computers using a TCP\/IP network, with each of the computers having a speaker and a microphone. In these examples, the telephone switch  is not necessary and the location of a customer using a VoIP enabled computer is determined by the TCP\/IP address of the VoIP enabled computer. Other electronic devices capable of transmitting voice communications between customers and order takers can also be used.","The telephone switch  is able to monitor the availability of order taker telephones , , , and  and connects customers on the customer telephones , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and  only with available order takers. During surges in business in restaurant , there might be more customers on customer telephones than order takers able to take orders. During such surges, customers must be placed on hold until an order taker is available. To handle such situations, the telephone switch  can be configured to prioritize the customer telephones based on the classes of the customer telephones that define the context of each customer order. These classes are defined by the locations of the customer telephones and can be matched to different levels or classes of service. In some examples, the highest priority is given to the customer microphones\/speakers  and  for the zoom-through , the next priority is given to the customer telephones  and  for the drive-through , the next priority is given to the customer telephones , , , , , and  for the phone trees  and \u2032, the next priority is for the customer telephones , , , and  for caf\u00e9 \u2033, and the last priority is for the customer telephones  and  for the phone tree  in the playplace . This prioritization reflects the different anticipated needs of customers in restaurant  and can be modified. Furthermore, the prioritization can be modified based on the time of day. Based on these considerations, for each customer order, the order is marked with a set priority after the order is entered into the restaurant management software. The marking and prioritization of orders into service classes can be done whether or not there is an overload on available order takers.","For example, assume customers make the following telephone calls in the following time sequence to place orders: order A (from telephone  in phone tree ), order B (from telephone  in phone tree  in the playplace ) and order C (from microphone\/speaker  in zoom-through ). Assuming only one order taker in area , the order taker handles the calls in the following order: order C, order A, and order B. Even if there were enough order takers to handle all calls immediately, the priority information could be associated with each order and used to process the orders in different ways.","In the quick-serve restaurant , an order may be placed from the telephone trees  or \u2032 as follows. A customer picks up one of the customer telephones , , , , , or . The telephone switch  directs the new call to an available order taker using one of the telephones , , , or . The available order taker greets the customer and enters the customer's order using the interface  on one of the order entry stations , , , or . However, the restaurant management software does not yet add the order items to the production requirements. The order taker asks the customer to take an available numbered table tent. The customer tells the order taker the number on the table tent. The order taker enters the table tent number into the order and tells the customer to proceed to one of the cashier stations , , or . When the customer arrives at the cashier station , , or , the cashier asks for the table tent number and picks the customer's order from the gallery of orders using the user interface . The customer may add items to the order and the cashier can enter the items using an order entry station. The cashier accepts a cash payment from the customer and makes change. The restaurant management software is configured to add the contents of the order to the production requirements. Workers in the kitchen  process the order. An expeditor in the landing zone  assembles the order and delivers the order at the table tent indicating the customer's chosen delivery point.","In another example, in the restaurant , to order food from the caf\u00e9 \u2033 or the playplace \u2032 using a credit card, the customer picks up a telephone from one of the customer telephones , , , , , or . The telephone switch  directs the new call to an available order taker on one of the telephones , , , or . The order taker greets the customer and requests a payment method. Because the customer wishes to use a credit card for payment, the order taker directs the customer to swipe a credit card in a machine at the customer's table or at the telephone tree  and the customer swipes the credit card. The restaurant management software automatically makes a request for approval by the card issuer for a predetermined amount to be charged to the customer's credit card. The order taker enters the customer's order using the interface  on one of the order entry stations , , , or . If the customer is located at the telephone tree , the customer is also directed to choose a table tent as explained earlier. The order taker tells the customer to wait for delivery of the order. In some examples, the restaurant management software can provide a time estimate for the delivery of the food order. In such examples, the order taker can inform the customer of this time estimate. The restaurant management software waits for approval of the credit card. The restaurant management software adds the contents of the order to production requirements. The new production requirements are displayed on the kitchen video system monitors , , , and . Workers in the kitchen  produce the contents of the order according to these new production requirements. When the order is complete and payment is authorized, an expeditor assembles and delivers the order to the customer at the location from which the customer called (when seated at table , , , or ) or at which the customer has placed the table tent (at table  or ).","In the restaurant , to order food from the caf\u00e9 \u2033 or playplace \u2032 using cash, the customer indicates to the order taker that the customer intends to pay with cash. After the order taker enters the customer's order, the expeditor (or a cashier) sees an unpaid caf\u00e9 or playplace order and prints a guest check using a printer  or . The expeditor finds the customer based on a table number (indicating a table from , , , or ) or a table tent number (located on table from  or ) on the receipt and greets the customer. The expeditor accepts a cash payment from the customer and provides any necessary change to the customer. The expeditor returns to a cashier at one of the cashier stations , , or  and pays for the order. The restaurant management software adds the contents of the order to the production requirements. When the order is complete, the expeditor assembles the order in the landing zone  and finds the customer based on a table number or a table tent number on the receipt and delivers the food order to the customer.","Referring to , the drive-through entrance  includes lanes  and  that merge at a point . The zoom-through entrance  includes lanes  and . The drive-through lanes  and  merge with the lanes  and  of the zoom-through  at a point . The restaurant  includes a parking lot . The drive-through lanes  and  have sensors  and  embedded in the pavement that send a signal to the telephone switch  when an automobile enters the lanes  and . The zoom-through lanes  and  have sensors  and  embedded in the pavement that send a signal to the telephone switch  when an automobile enters the lanes  and . A stop\/go light  indicates to customers in the drive-through  whether to stop at a cashier window  or not. In the restaurant , to order food using the drive-through , the customer drives up to the drive-through  at either lane  or . The sensor  or  under the pavement signals the telephone switch . The telephone switch  sets up a new call for either microphone\/speaker  or  with an order taker at one of the order taker telephones , , , or . The order taker greets the customer and requests a payment method. If the customer is not ready, the order taker instructs the customer to signal when the customer is ready and hangs up. The process begins again when the customer calls again. If the customer wishes to use a credit card, the order taker directs the customer to swipe a credit card at a machine located beside the lane  or . Approval is sought as explained earlier, but the restaurant management software assumes that approval will be granted. The order taker receives the order from the customer and enters the order using the interface .","A camera  or  takes a digital picture of the customer when the order taker enters a first food item of the order. The restaurant management software displays the food items of the order to the customer using the drive-through display  or . The customer confirms to the order taker that the order is correct. The restaurant management software adds the contents of the order items to the production requirements and the order is produced as explained earlier.","At the cashier area  (the payment point), a cashier uses the digital picture of the customer to match the customer with his order using the interface . If the customer has not already paid with a credit card, the restaurant management software flips the stop\/go light  to \u201cstop\u201d, and the cashier accepts cash payment from the customer and makes change. If the customer has already paid with a credit card, the restaurant management software flips the stop\/go light  to \u201cgo\u201d. At the delivery window , an expeditor uses the digital picture of the customer to match the customer with his order using the interface , verifies that the customer has made payment, assembles the order according to the information displayed on the interface , and delivers the assembled food order and a receipt to the customer. To order food using the zoom-through entrance , the customer drives to the zoom-through entrance  at either lane  or . The sensor  or  signals the telephone switch . The telephone switch  sets up a new call as in the earlier example. If the customer wishes to use a credit card, the order taker directs the customer to swipe a credit card at a machine located beside lane  or . As in the earlier example, the restaurant management software assumes approval will be granted. The order taker receives the order from the customer and enters the order using the interface . A camera  or  takes a digital image of the customer when a first item is added to the order. The restaurant management software displays the contents of the food order using the drive-through display  or . The customer confirms to the order taker that the order is correct. When ordering is complete, the order taker directs the customer to proceed to merge point . The restaurant management software adds the contents of the food items to production requirements. At the delivery window , an expeditor views the digital image of the customer to match the customer with a order, verifies that the customer has made payment, assembles the order, and delivers the assembled order and a receipt to the customer. Referring to , the restaurant management software  includes a portion that runs on a central server in the restaurant and is called a restaurant management system (RMS) server . The server  stores restaurant status and order status information for local viewing at registers, stations, terminals, and other devices connected to a local area network. The RMS server  tracks the current state of restaurant  (for example, open or closed) and also tracks the state of all pending orders at all times and stores this information in a \u201cshoebox\u201d database . Since information about pending orders includes a dynamic association of each order with a delivery point, a customer can change his or her mind about the delivery point and a new delivery point can be recorded in database  for the order.","Status information to be viewed from or used by other devices or to be archived for later analysis and use are archived in a database . In some examples, the computer database  is a Structured Query Language (SQL) database, e.g., a Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) database. In effect, the shoebox database  is a redundant storage facility that holds order status information for pending and recent orders and also keeps backup copies of the orders indefinitely. The order information is updated frequently and circulated among the local devices in the restaurant (and also to the call center if one is being used). The database , on the other hand, maintains a complete history of orders for a long period of time for later analysis and display.","Each of the cashier stations , , , , and  has a restaurant management system client application  and a database . The database  stores information about cash and transactions for each cashier station in addition to information about operators at the cashier station. The databases  ensure that each of the cashier stations , , , , and  is capable of running in a standalone mode by operating on stored or cached data if any of the cashier stations become disconnected from network . It is essential that records of cash at cashier stations , , , , and  be maintained even if any cashier stations become disconnected from network . This ensures that theft of cash from cashier stations can be detected. The databases  maintain such cash records. The register-specific database  includes a shoe-box database that is a version of the shoe-box data maintained by the RMS server .","The register applications  communicate with the phone system interface  to identify the phone extensions (and locations) of customer telephones , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . When an order taker begins entering the customer's order, the register application  for the order taker's order entry station queries the phone system interface  for the extension of the telephone in restaurant  that is currently connected with the order taker's telephone. The phone system interface  returns this telephone extension to the register application  used by the order taker. The register application  then associates the customer's telephone extension with the customer's order. Using this association, the register application  can immediately classify a customer order placed over a customer telephone by its order point and in the case of customer orders from caf\u00e9 \u2033, register applications  can assign the locations of the telephones , , ,  to be the delivery points for the orders as a dynamic association.","Since the order taker's register application  also easily associates the identity of the order taker with the customer's order, data can be recorded on the order taker's productivity in handling customer orders. This data can be used to improve the productivity of order taking.","The register applications  monitor a communication channel (\u201clisten\u201d) to the RMS server  via RMS proxy server  for new pending orders entered by order takers or entered using self-service ordering . This enables the register applications  to display the latest list of pending orders on interfaces .","The interaction between the register applications  and other clients with the RMS server  is a real-time process. Each client (e.g. register applications ) of the RMS server  has one or more \u201clisteners\u201d that react to transactions sent by the RMS server  and received locally by the RMS proxy servers . The RMS proxy server  notifies its host application (e.g. register applications ) that a change has occurred via an event when the host application inspects the changed data and updates any internal structures as necessary, which infers updates to the interfaces .","The RMS server  keeps restaurant system status, receives order updates from the stations , , , , , , and , broadcasts order status changes to the stations , , , , to the order entry stations , , , to the expeditor monitors , , and to the kitchen video system monitors , , , , updates the database  and the shoebox database as required, supports shared cashless payment methods such as credit card payment, and synchronizes the register-specific databases  with shoebox database . The register applications  allow workers in the restaurant  to enter orders, accept payment, and mark orders as served. The register applications  display active orders, support cash control and basic reporting, support multi-lingual graphical user interfaces  on a station-by-station basis, and \u201clisten\u201d to orders from database .","A proxy is an intermediary between a client workstation and a main server. It supplies the application programming interface (API) that allows the client application to make use of the services provided by the main server. It implements the client side of the client server protocol. It may also maintain server-related state information and cache the results of frequently needed server queries. The RMS proxy  is a proxy for register applications  and RMS server . Information about customer orders such as the phone extension from phone system interface  and the location for an order is passed back and forth through RMS proxy  to RMS server .","Restaurant  uses a Remote Payment Service (RPS) software module to enable customers to pay for orders using credit cards and other payment cards such as debit cards. RPS is another software client of the RMS server  and can execute instructions on computer . With RPS, credit card reading devices are installed at the order points in dining area . The card reading devices can be simple magnetic stripe readers (MSR's) available from Neuron Electronics of Torrance, Calif., or the card reading devices can be payment terminals, such as the Hypercom\u00ae 6000, available from Hypercom of Phoenix, Ariz., featuring PIN pads, signature capture, and bit mapped displays that are useful for displaying prompts, order details, and advertising.","The RPS is organized such that the appropriate software driver for each installed terminal is loaded dynamically. For example, restaurant  can have one type of terminal inside the restaurant and a different type of terminal (designed for outdoors) at the drive through . In one example, a terminal has a software driver that simply reads cards and adds their information to the order. In another example, a terminal can have a software driver that interactively prompts the customer and displays the status of the charge (and possibly also the order).","In one example, the card payment terminals are passive, port powered magnetic stripe readers having a green Light Emitting Diode (LED) that lights up when the reader is ready to read a payment card. These readers can handle credit cards, but not debit cards. To accept debit cards, another example uses a terminal with a reader equipped with a Payment Identifier Number (PIN) keypad.","The RPS accesses the payment terminals via serial communication lines. Restaurant  includes a serial port expander system, for example a 32-port Stallion board available from Stallion Technologies of Santa Ana, Calif., to interface computer  with serial ports of multiple credit card payment terminals. After a customer begins placing an order with an order taker over the telephone (and the order point has a terminal managed by the RPS), the order appears in the system and the RPS waits for a payment card swipe. In one example, the RPS turns on the green LED to provide visual confirmation to the customer that the card can be swiped. At this point, the order taker will invite the customer to swipe a credit card. After the customer swipes his or her payment card, the LED will go off, and the RPS will add a cashless payment line to the order. When the order is completed, if there is a cashless line present in the order, the RMS will submit a charge against it for settlement by the store's cashless payment processor. If the charge is accepted, then the order is paid, and all that remains is for it to be prepared and delivered (with a receipt). Otherwise, the green LED light comes back on, and the customer can either try paying with another card or pay cash to an expeditor in the restaurant  or at the drive-thru window .","A production display system  displays task-specific views of order status on kitchen video system monitors , , , and  and updates order status in response to bump bar input. The production display system  supports multiple production lines in the kitchen , load balancing, multiple hardware systems, multi-lingual display on a station-by-station basis, and listens for changes to orders by monitoring a communication channel to the RMS server . The production display system  also can communicate with hardware control units that use bump bars to receive production status from workers in the kitchen . Such production status indicates completion of certain food production tasks. Thus, workers in the kitchen  communicate to the restaurant management software by pressing bump bar buttons. For example, pressing bump bar buttons can indicate that an order is finished in the kitchen  or that the language in interface  should be changed or that a full display should be scrolled forward or backward. Bump bar interface devices are available from Logic Controls of New Hyde Park, N.Y., U.S.A.","The production display system  contains the logic for business rules that define the production process for a given restaurant brand and a given restaurant. This logic is configurable in the production display system software.","A drive-through display service  shows the current customer order on the drive-through displays , , , and . The drive-through display service  also presents promotional imagery on the display and listens to orders. An automatic beverage dispenser interface  interfaces with the automatic beverage service  to pour beverages ordered in the drive-through (or from any other configurable source) and listens to orders. A user interface designer  allows management to edit the user interface of the register and self-service applications and also saves the specifications in the database . In this manner, the user interface designer  enables the restaurant management software to be configured for different stores and different brands without having to do a complete redesign. A video system interface  uploads digital images from cameras , , , and  in coordination with order entry and transmits these images to the RMS system server . A self service ordering application  handles customer service kiosks  that enable customers to enter their own orders. The self service ordering application  is a platform for promotions and loyalty programs and can be multi-lingual on a station-by-station basis. A proxy  is a proxy between the RMS server  and the self-service ordering application . A store resident web server  enables external managers to view restaurant status information in the database  using the interface . The store resident web server  also allows managers to edit the user interface of the register and self-service applications and also saves the specifications in the database . A printer service  drives serial printers , , and . The printer service  prints receipts or grill slips on demand, may be shared by multiple applications, and respects the language of client application.","Video system interface  coordinates with order entry using an order list listener to a server within the video system interface . The RMS server  informs the order list listener of changes to any active order. The order list listener instructs a digitizer to digitize a customer's picture from a camera when the video system interface 's server sees an order that should have a customer picture based on the location of the order point (e.g., locations in the drive through  or the zoom-through ), but does not have a picture, is in the entering state, or the time difference between the creation of the order, or the current time is less than a configurable maximum.","Checking if the current time is less than a configurable maximum is intended to avoid the case where for some reason a picture is not taken in a timely fashion, and despite the fact that the order taker is still entering the order, the customer has moved away from the ordering location and has been replaced by the next customer in line.","The RMS Server  (along with the RMS Proxy  and ) supports two basic kinds of listeners. An \u201corder listener\u201d is informed when a specific order is changed. An \u201corder list listener\u201d is informed when any order in a particular set of orders is changed. The server portion of the video system interface  registers itself as an order list listener for all active orders. When any active order is changed, the RMS server  sends a message to all the registered order list listeners. That message is received by the RMS Proxy  and  and converted into an event using standard Java facilities. The host application (e.g., register applications ) implements an event handler that encodes each application's reaction to the change.","The register applications , the self-service ordering application , the automatic beverage dispenser interface , the drive-through display interface , the production display system , and the video system interface send information and receive information to and from the RMS system server . Periodically, the RMS system server  updates the database  with restaurant status information. The store-resident web server  and the user interface designer  directly connect with database . The store resident web server  publishes restaurant status information (including inventory, cash management, and deposit management information) from the database  on a secure internet connection.","A Multi-Unit-Management-Interface (MUMI) software application (not shown) provides a centralized point of control for enterprise management of multiple restaurants . A restaurant resident MUMI application manages the nuts and bolts of connectivity, including guaranteed message delivery between different components of the restaurant management software for a single restaurant . At a higher level, a central MUMI server provides features to manage a set of restaurants .","Managers access information about the restaurant  using the web server  and interfaces  and . When a manager attempts to connect to the web server  from off-site (such as the manager's home or a central corporation office), the connection requires an Internet protocol (IP) address. The IP address associated with the restaurant  can dynamically change for a number of reasons. Some restaurants  can use DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) for an internet connection. For restaurants  using a DSL connection, Internet Service Providers (ISP) have different rules for when IP addresses are assigned. A restaurant  may not have an \u201calways on\u201d Internet connection because of the cost or availability in its locale, and the store must dial in to the ISP in order to have connectivity and to be assigned an IP address. Thus, an IP address is required to connect to the restaurant , but the IP address may not be known and the restaurant  may not even be connected to the Internet.","When a restaurant  is connected to the Internet, the restaurant-resident MUMI software periodically contacts the central MUMI server and identifies itself. The central MUMI server records the IP address associated with the restaurant . If the IP address changes, the central MUMI server will be informed as a result of the periodic contacts made by the restaurant-resident MUMI software.","When the off-site person (the owner or regional manager, etc.) attempts to connect to the restaurant  through the central MUMI server, the central MUMI server checks the last-known IP address for the given restaurant  to determine if the restaurant  is still available at that IP address. If the restaurant  is available at the last known address, the central MUMI software redirects the request to that address, and the off-site person proceeds to login. Otherwise, the central MUMI software connects to the store directly by calling the modem attached to the restaurant 's server. When and if a connection is established, the central MUMI system directs the restaurant 's restaurant-resident MUMI software to connect to the Internet. Both sides hang up. The restaurant  connects to the Internet using the parameters established for that purpose. When the restaurant  connects to the Internet, it then contacts the central MUMI server. The central MUMI server knows there is a pending connection request, and it responds. The central MUMI server checks whether its context information for the restaurant  is up to date and downloads current information if changes have been made at the restaurant .","In some examples discussed previously, order takers in the area  are located in a call center. In these examples, an additional telephone switch  is used at the call center. The call center telephone switch  and the restaurant telephone switch  are used to connect customers using the customer telephones , , , , , or  to order taker telephones , , , or  at the call center. When a customer begins a call to place an order using a telephone in the restaurant , the telephone switch  waits until a trunk line is available at the call center telephone switch  and then routes the call over the available trunk line to the call center telephone switch . Similarly to connecting calls to order takers in restaurant , telephone switch  prioritizes calls during busy times based on extension numbers that are linked to locations in restaurant . When the telephone switch  successfully connects the call to the trunk line to the call center telephone switch , the telephone switch  triggers the phone system interface  to lookup the extension of the call and convert it to a location point. The phone system interface  also updates its internal memory structure to reflect an active call between the customer telephone and the call center. When an order taker is available at the call center, the call center telephone switch  switches the call on the trunk line to the available order taker on telephone , , , or . When the available order taker answers the call, the phone system interface  at the call center  identifies the restaurant  from which the order is being placed by matching the number of the incoming trunk (obtained from data written by the call center switch  to its SMDR printer port) line with a table that links trunk lines to restaurants. Next, the call center switch interface  asks the restaurant's switch interface  for the specific order point location that is connected to the incoming trunk line (information it has gleaned from restaurant  switch's  SMDR output). Call center switch interface  also determines which extension (and thus which order taker) is now connected to that trunk by examining the call center switch's  SMDR output. Then, having assembled complete information about the call, the call center switch interface  notifies the call center order taker's register  to contact the restaurant's RMS server  (via a remote session established through its RMS proxy ) and to display the appropriate user interface, so that the order taker can enter the customer's order. The call information the call center switch interface  supplies to the call center register application  includes the same order point information that would be available to an in-restaurant order taker. If the order point does not specify the delivery point (e.g., a phone tree order), the order taker obtains a table tent number verbally from the customer and enters it into the order as the delivery point.","In addition to entering customer orders, register-resident applications  also handle functions at the call center such as staff order entry, cashier, order gallery, and time and attendance and are, in effect, the same as the register applications in the registers that are located in the restaurant.","A RMS proxy  is used at the call center to connect register-resident applications  with RMS server . The RMS proxy  performs all of the functionality of the RMS proxy  except that the RMS proxy  is located externally to restaurant . Thus, telephone order takers at the call center use the same interface  as order takers in restaurant  to enter customer orders. Call centers handling multiple restaurants with different RMS system servers  use multiple proxies  to communicate with the different RMS system servers . In this manner, telephone order takers at these call centers can switch between interfaces  for different restaurants by using software interfacing with different proxy servers . This enables the display of different menus and prices for the different restaurants handled by the telephone order takers. This also enables the different restaurants handled by the call centers to have different brands.","Referring to , in some examples, the restaurant management software  is executed in five areas: the office , the drive-through  or , the front counter , the kitchen , and the customer self-service kiosks . The restaurant management software  includes various components that are executed on different computers. The restaurant management software  is not limited to any specific operating system. In some examples, the restaurant management software  is implemented in a Java programming language that enables different components of the software  to run on different computer platforms and communicate via application programmer interfaces (API). In some examples, these APIs are provided by high level software tools such as Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE) available from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif. or Microsoft. NET available from Microsoft of Redmont, Wash. In other examples, these APIs are created using a proprietary communication protocol from low level Java code for higher rates of communication. This communication protocol can be created as a software layer above TCP\/IP sockets for communication between computers on TCP\/IP networks.","In office , a main server computer  runs the system server software , the database , the store-resident web server software , the production display service , and the drive-through display service .

Another computer runs the print server software  to print receipts using the printer .","In the kitchen area , computers run production display system software for the kitchen video display monitors , , , and . Another computer runs the print server software  to print custom food instructions on printer .","For customer kiosks , the computers run self-service ordering software .","Referring to , a view  represents the organization of applications and object classes for the restaurant management software. At the highest level, view  includes server applications  that include RMS server . View  also includes client applications  that include register applications , self-service ordering , automatic beverage dispenser interface , drive-through display interface , production display system , video system interface , and register resident applications (call center) . The server applications  and the client applications  include a security layer  and application objects . The application objects include logic specific to restaurant management, for example, the definition of management measures such as \u201cGross Revenue\u201d vary by organization and so they are defined in objects that can be replaced or customized as needed. Beneath the application objects  are network objects  that utilize the java.net  classes. Java.net  is a package that provides the classes for implementing networking applications. Java.net  is available from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif., as part of the standard Java software distribution. Beneath the application objects  are hardware independent device objects . The device objects  contain logic for interacting with devices such as bump bars and video display devices in a hardware independent manner. Thus, the device objects  should not have to be modified to control bump bars from vendor \u201cB\u201d instead of vendor \u201cA\u201d. Device objects  include device servers  and direct device . Device servers  provide access to a shared device through a device-independent API in restaurant . Direct device drivers  also provide dedicated access to a device through a device-independent API, but these devices can not be shared, and the interface is often embedded in a host application that uses the device as a requirement of its business function. Device servers use device drivers to control the devices to which they provide shared access. The device servers  and the direct device  employ device support software  that includes JavaPOS  and device drivers . JavaPOS  is a retail industry standard for a point-of-sale I\/O device communication that supports pure Java applications and leverages the OPOS standard. JavaPOS is available from the JavaPOS organization (http:\/\/www.javapos.org). The device drivers  each control a particular type of device such as a magnetic stripe reader or coin dispenser in restaurant . Typically, device drivers  are either supplied by the vendor of a device or are written to translate application actions to and from the serial protocol published by the device's vendor. The data objects  hold data describing the state of the restaurant , orders, and inventory. The data objects  include server proxies , , and  that insulate applications from server application failures. The RMS server  uses data objects  to store data in shoebox database  and database . The register applications  use data objects  to store data in register-specific databases . The serialization objects  contain methods for converting data objects  into serial streams for storing data objects  into databases. JDBC  is the Java Database Connectivity API (Application Program Interface). JDBC  is a programming interface that allows Java applications to access SQL database servers in a standard way. JDBC  allows the integration of Structured Query Language (SQL) calls into a Java programming environment by providing library routines that interface with the database. It provides functionality for Java that is similar to what Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provides for older programming languages. JDBC  is available from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif. ODBC is available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. Database  includes shoebox database  and database . A file system  is a file system for the operating system of main server . Graphical User Interface (GUI) design objects  implement the logic for user interface designer . GUI elements  are a library of elements useful for creating GUIs for client applications . GUI support classes  include design serialization classes  and Java Swing classes . Java Swing classes  enable the creation of GUIs for Java applications and applets using a set of components and are available from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif. Package java.awt  contains additional classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images.","One class of object among data objects  is the order class. An instance of the order class contains information about an order that has been initiated in the restaurant. The instance of the order includes a hierarchical list of lines, each of which reflects a line in the contents  of the interface  displaying orders. The base class of all order lines is OrderLine. Each line is represented by an instance of an appropriate subclass of OrderLine.","Different subtypes of OrderLine contain different data. For example, an ItemLine might indicate that a certain quantity of a certain menu item (e.g., a hamburger) is part of the order. An OptionLine may add the fact that a particular modification (e.g., no salt) applies to one of the items being ordered. Other subclasses may record the fact that a coupon, discount, or voucher has been applied to the order or to one of the items in it.","Some types of line, namely those extended from OrderLineContainer, may contain sublines, which are lines nested within, or owned by, the line.","Referring to , a table  is an example of an object-oriented data structure for an order. A class column  denotes the class name of each object representing food items or options in the order. A guest check column  denotes food items or options in the order. A level column  denotes the nesting level of the line objects (the level is not actually stored in the order, but simply depicts the nesting depth). The order as whole is represented by an instance of the Order class , at level #. The order's direct sublines are the lines at level #. The order's direct and indirect sublines are all the lines in the order. At level #, is a Big Mac item , which owns two options, no onions  and extra mustard , nested at level #. Following the Big Mac item  is the Extra Value Meal item , which has quarter pounder component , fries component , and coke component , at level #. The quarter pounder component  owns option side pickles  at level # and fries component  owns option no salt .","Orders in the database  are updated by the RMS server  as register applications , self service ordering , and register-resident applications  receive orders entered at restaurant . Orders in database  are read-only to client applications. When RMS server  finishes updating an order, RMS server  broadcasts the new version of the order to applications such as register applications , self service ordering , and register-resident applications .","The RMS server  updates an order as follows. A register application (e.g.,., the register application , the self service ordering , or the register-resident application ) receives an OrderEvent notification from the order object. The RMS server  obtains an OrderUpdate object from the newOrderUpdate method of the Order object. The RMS server  application specifies the changes to be made to the order by invoking appropriate methods of the OrderUpdate object. The RMS server  invokes the OrderUpdate object's submit method. The RMS server  receives the OrderEvent when the update is complete. The OrderEvent contains a new copy of the Order object. The RMS server  updates the display model and rebuilds the display.","Whenever an OrderUpdate object applies itself to an order, the OrderUpdate object stamps the Order object with the current time, a station (e.g., order entry station , , and ) that issued the update, and the worker using the station. Any actions specified as part of the same OrderUpdate, for which a time stamp is noted, will receive the same timestamp.","An order may be delivered in one of three service modes: EAT_IN, TAKE_OUT, and DRIVE_THRU. The service mode is entered with the order and is part of the data for an order object.","During the lifetime of an order object, the order passes through a number of states. At key state changes, the order update process notes the order's age, the worker (or customer using a self-service kiosk) who entered the change, and the order entry station from which the state change was initiated. The order object uses the recorded times to compute several time intervals which are significant to the management of the restaurant.","An order may exist in the following states: inactive, active, entering, entered, paying, paid, parked, served, held, and canceled. An order starts out in the inactive state. An order belonging to an idle station may be reside in the inactive state indefinitely. An order becomes active when the first update is posted against it. When it becomes active, an order's age is reset to zero, and it automatically enters the entering state. An order is in the entering state while a worker (or the customer) is entering items. When an order first becomes active, it goes into the entering state automatically.","An order leaves the entering state and becomes entered when the user finishes entering its contents. An order is in the paying state while the cashier collects the amount due from the customer. An order becomes paid when the cashier concludes the payment process by shutting the cash drawer. To keep the drive-thru line  moving, the RMS server  may on occasion direct a customer to park off to the side pending delayed delivery of the order. When this occurs, the order is in the parked state. An order becomes served when the food is handed to the customer. During order entry, a crew member can place an order in the held state to notify the kitchen staff to pause its preparation pending a customer decision. The order object tracks time spent in held status. An order becomes canceled if it is not to be produced after all.","The Order object tracks the following time intervals, which are crucial to measuring restaurant performance. All times are returned as floating point values in seconds. They are maintained internally with a precision that allows measurement to the nearest 0.1 second. Entry time is the total time spent entering the contents of the order into the system. Line time is the interval between the conclusion of the order entry process and the start of the payment process. For drive-thru customers, line time is the interval spent in line after giving the order at the intercom and before reaching the window. For in-store customers, line time is zero. Payment time is the time spent collecting the amount due from the customer for the order. The beginning of payment time is when the payment interface is presented to the cashier. The end of payment is when the cash drawer is closed. Delivery time is the interval extending from the end of the payment process until the order is either served or parked. Parked time is the interval, if any, extending from the time the order was parked until it is served. Held time is the total time during which the order was in held status. Elapsed time is the total time to process the order. Elapsed time extends from the time the order first becomes active until it is served.","Normally, the Order object is used to specify a list of food items to be prepared and served to a customer in return for payment. However, occasionally, a customer is due compensation for unsatisfactory food. In such cases, the restaurant needs to note which items were unacceptable, calculate their value, and possibly prepare replacements. To facilitate and account for this process, an order may take on the following attributes: An order is flagged as a refund if the price of the order is to be paid back to the customer. An order has the replacement attribute if it is to be prepared and served.","Certain types of changes to an order are considered voids. An excessive number of voids may call for employee supervision, which the RMS server  enforces by requiring a \u201cmanager swipe\u201d before making the desired change to the order. Order can record the number of voids and their total value.","Although some examples and implementations have been described, a wide variety of other examples are also within the scope of the following claims.","For example, the customer telephones , , , , , or  and order taker telephones , , , or  may be replaced with Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) enabled computers using the network  and speakers and microphones. In these examples, the telephone switches  and  are not necessary and the location of a customer using a VoIP enabled computer is determined by the address of the VoIP enabled computer. In examples where network  is a TCP\/IP network, the address is identified by a TCP\/IP address on network .","The discussion has focused on quick-serve restaurants but the techniques described are applicable to other types of restaurants, other types of quick-serve retail businesses, other types of non-quick-serve retail businesses, and other types of non-retail businesses. As one example, the techniques are also applicable to the food service component of convenience stores that also provide gasoline to automobiles. The items to be included in the orders need not be food items and need not be items that are prepared to order or on the premises where they are to be delivered.","Although many of the techniques described involve wired devices, they may also be applied using wireless devices, including wireless telephones, personal assistants, and other wireless devices.","The customers need not be physically present on the premises to order. They may place orders from other locations, for example, from a desktop computer at home or work or from a device such as a mobile phone while traveling in the vicinity of the place where delivery of the order is to occur.","Although in some examples a digital picture is used to identify the customer, it would be possible to use other features, such as the color or model of the automobile being driven by the customer."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 8\u201310"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 17"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
