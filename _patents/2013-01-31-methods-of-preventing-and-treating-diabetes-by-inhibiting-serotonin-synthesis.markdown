No. 61\/594,170, filed Feb. 2, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The invention was made with Government support under NIH 2 RO1 DK 067936 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention is in the field of the therapy of diabetes and provides methods for treating diabetes in mammals, particularly in humans.","Diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent, or Type II, diabetes) is a group of disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) that generally involves an impaired insulin secretory response to glucose as well as insulin resistance. The mechanism of insulin action is impaired in diabetes, leading to less glucose transport into muscle and fat. The elevated blood glucose levels that result can lead to a variety of serious health problems.","Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is a biogenic amine that functions both as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and as a hormone in the periphery, where most of it is produced (Gershon et al., 1990, Neuropsychopharmacology, 3:385-395). Serotonin is generated through an enzymatic cascade in which L-tryptophan is converted into L-5-hydroxytryptophan by an enzyme called tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). This intermediate product is then converted to serotonin by an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. There are two TPH encoding genes, TPH1 and TPH2, which are 71% identical in amino acid sequence and about 90% similar in their catalytic domains. While TPH1 controls serotonin synthesis in the periphery, TPH2 is responsible for serotonin synthesis in the brain (Walther et al., 2003, Science 299:76). Given that serotonin cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, these two genes are therefore solely responsible for regulating the level of this molecule in the periphery and in the brain, respectively.","TPH1 is expressed almost exclusively in cells of the duodenum, and it is responsible for the synthesis of peripheral serotonin, which represents 95% of total serotonin (Gershon & Tack, 2007, Gastroenterology 132:397-414). TPH1 expression in any tissues other than duodenum is at least 100-1000 fold lower. Thus, TPH1 can be viewed as a duodenum-specific gene and peripheral serotonin production as a duodenum-specific process.","Besides its role as a neuromediator, and because of its abundance in the general circulation, serotonin has been implicated in a variety of developmental and physiological processes in peripheral tissues, including heart development, gastrointestinal movement, liver regeneration and mammary gland development (Lesurtel et al., 2006, Science, 312:104-107; Matsuda et al., 2004, Dev. Cell, 6:193-203; Nebigil et al., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:9508-9513). To carry out its functions, serotonin can bind to at least 14 receptors, most of them being G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). One or several serotonin receptors are present in most cell types.","Mice genetically deficient for the TPH1 gene (\u201cknockout mice\u201d) have been reported. In one case, the mice reportedly expressed normal amounts of serotonin in classical serotonergic brain regions, but largely lacked serotonin in the periphery. In another, the knockout mice exhibited abnormal cardiac activity, which was attributed to a lack of peripheral serotonin (C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2003, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:13525-13530).","International Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/038817, published as WO 2009\/123978, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, is directed to methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating bone mass diseases using therapeutic agents for lowering or increasing serum serotonin levels.

Preferably, such reduction of the action or effect of the serotonin Htr2b receptor occurs by a mechanism that involves binding of the substance to the serotonin Htr2b receptor.","Methods of Treatment and Diagnosis","Adaptation to food deprivation is a regulated survival function that requires continuous mobilization of energy from various sources. The data described herein show that gut-derived serotonin (GDS) synthesis is enhanced by fasting and that this hormone promotes lipolysis by signaling in adipocytes through the Htr2b receptor to activate the lipolytic enzyme hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Additionally, GDS promotes gluconeogenesis in the liver, also by signaling through Htr2b, to increase the activity of gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Hence, GDS opposes deleterious consequences of food deprivation through two complementary mechanisms that can raise blood glucose levels. Thus, inhibition of GDS synthesis lowers blood glucose levels and improves insulin resistance and glucose intolerance caused by a high fat diet. Small molecule inhibitors of GDS synthesis such as TPH1 inhibitors therefore should be of use to treat Type II diabetes.","The results presented herein reveal that GDS is a hormone whose synthesis is induced by fasting and that opposes deleterious consequences of food deprivation. To do so, GDS favors glucose production by acting synergistically in adipocytes to promote release of glycerol, a substrate of gluconeogenesis, and in hepatocytes to actively promote gluconeogenesis (). An important feature of this regulation is that pharmacological evidence indicates that it could be manipulated advantageously to fight Type II diabetes.","The results disclosed herein show that elevated serum or plasma serotonin increases blood glucose levels, leading to diabetes. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention are directed to methods for diagnosing and treating persons at risk of developing diabetes and to methods for treating or preventing diabetes by administering therapeutic agents that decrease the level of serum or plasma serotonin and thus decrease blood glucose levels.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for determining if a patient is at risk of developing diabetes by measuring the patient's level of serum or plasma serotonin and then administering a therapeutic agent disclosed herein that is a TPH1 inhibitor to the patient if the patient's level of serum or plasma serotonin is elevated so as to indicate that the patient is at risk of developing diabetes. In one embodiment, if the patient's level of serum or plasma serotonin is known to be significantly higher (e.g., more than about 25% higher, more than about 50% higher, more than about 75% higher, more than about 100% higher) than the level in a normal subject, then the patient is at risk of developing diabetes and one or more TPH1 inhibitors that reduce serotonin synthesis, and thus serum or plasma serotonin levels, is administered to reduce (and preferably normalize) serum or plasma serotonin levels, thereby preventing diabetes from developing or minimizing the extent or the detrimental effects of diabetes, should diabetes develop. Patient monitoring will determine if an abnormal serum or plasma serotonin level is chronic. If it is chronic, then the patient may need to continue treatment over a prolonged period (e.g., for one month, six months, one year, two years, three years, or many years) to normalize serum or plasma serotonin levels and\/or maintain normal levels of serum or plasma serotonin.","When a patient's level of serum or plasma serotonin is compared to the level of serum or plasma serotonin in a normal subject, it should be understood that \u201cnormal subject\u201d refers to a person who is matched to the patient in those characteristics that would be expected to affect serum or plasma serotonin levels, e.g., gender, age, general health, medications being taken, etc.","Methods of Treatment and Prevention of Diabetes","The present invention provides a method of preventing or treating diabetes in a patient known or suspected to be in need of such prevention or treatment comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent that decreases serum or plasma serotonin levels. In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering to the patient therapeutically effective amounts of two or more therapeutic agents disclosed herein that decrease serum or plasma serotonin levels.","TPH1 inhibitors that may be used in certain of the methods of the present invention include the following, including any racemic mixtures and individual enantiomers, pharmaceutically

For example, prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors could be produced by esterifying the carboxylic acid functions of the TPH1 inhibitors with a lower alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, etc. The use of prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors that are not esters is also contemplated. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, metal salts and sulfonate esters of the TPH1 inhibitors are also contemplated. In some embodiments, the prodrugs will contain a biohydrolyzable moiety (e.g., a biohydrolyzable amide, biohydrolyzable carbamate, biohydrolyzable carbonate, biohydrolyzable ester, biohydrolyzable phosphate, or biohydrolyzable ureide analog). Guidance for the preparation of prodrugs of the TPH1 inhibitors disclosed herein can be found in publications such as , Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elsevier, 1985, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, pages 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, pages 1-38.","In certain embodiments, the TPH1 inhibitor inhibits TPH1 without significantly affecting the level of brain-derived serotonin. Methods of obtaining such inhibitors include: (1) screening for compounds that inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2; and (2) screening for compounds that, while they inhibit both TPH1 and TPH2, cannot cross the blood brain barrier and thus are effectively specific for TPH1 when administered to the patient outside the central nervous system. Of course, compounds that both inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2 and cannot cross the blood brain barrier are also suitable. Preferably, compounds that inhibit TPH1 to a much greater extent than TPH2 have an ICfor TPH2 that is at least about 10-fold greater than their ICfor TPH1.","Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns.

For example, the terms \u201cpyridine\u201d and \u201cpyridyl\u201d are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridyl\u201d and \u201cXOH, wherein X is pyridine\u201d are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol, and pyridin-4-ol.","If the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines or wedges, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it, unless the chemical name associated with the structure indicates otherwise. Similarly, names of compounds having one or more chiral centers that do not specify the stereochemistry of those centers encompass pure stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. When the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is indicated with, for example, a bold or dashed line, the use of that structure in the methods describe herein encompasses the use of the indicated stereochemistry substantially free of any of the non-indicated structure. For example, such use includes the use of the indicated structure where the indicated structure is present in an enantiomeric excess of 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 99.5%,","Notwithstanding the above, it is understood that the methods of the invention may encompass the use of pure R and S enantiomers of the compounds disclosed herein as well as racemic mixtures. Thus, the disclose of the use of a compound without indication of any particular stereochemistry should be considered a disclosure of the use of that compound in the form of all racemic mixtures (e.g., a mixture of about 50% R and 50% S enantiomers) as well as a disclosure of the use of essentially pure enantiomers (i.e., about 100% R or about 100% S enantiomers).","In certain embodiments of the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the TPH1 inhibitors described herein is administered in combination with other compounds or medications that are known to prevent or treat diabetes to a subject who has or is at risk of developing diabetes in order to treat or prevent diabetes.

Sterile injectable forms of the pharmaceutical compositions may be aqueous or oleaginous suspensions. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solutions. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.","For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions.

For example, the TPH1 inhibitors of the present invention can be derivatized by the formation of a reversible linkage with one or more suitable groups to yield \u201cpro-drugs,\u201d i.e., chemical derivatives that, after absorption by the host, are converted into the parent compound. Liberation of the parent compound may be by chemical hydrolysis or enzymatic attack. A derivative or pro-drug can have enhanced permeability for the target organ. In the case of TPH1 inhibitors, the target organ is the duodenum where 95% of peripheral serotonin is made. The prodrug has an enhanced permeability according to the present invention if, after administration of the pro-drug or derivative thereof to a living organism, a higher amount of the compound reaches the target organ, resulting in a higher level of effective therapeutic agent, as compared to administration of the base compound without derivatization.","The amount of the therapeutic agents of the present invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a pharmaceutical composition in a single dosage form may vary depending upon the patient being treated and the particular mode of administration. It should be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific therapeutic agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician, as well as the severity of the particular condition being treated. Despite their variety, accounting for these factors in order to select an appropriate dosage or treatment regimen is routinely done in the art and thus would require no more than routine experimentation.","The dosage of TPH1 inhibitor administered may also depend on whether the TPH1 inhibitor is being administered for the prevention or for the treatment of diabetes. For prevention, preferred dose ranges include from about 5 mg\/kg\/day to about 250 mg\/kg\/day; from about 5 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day; or from about 5 mg\/kg\/day to about 30 mg\/kg\/day; with about 10 mg\/kg\/day being especially preferred.","For treatment, preferred dose ranges include from about 10 mg\/kg\/day to about 250 mg\/kg\/day; from about 10 mg\/kg\/day to about 50 mg\/kg\/day; or from about 10 mg\/kg\/day to about 30 mg\/kg\/day; with about 25 mg\/kg\/day being especially preferred.","Additional drugs which are normally administered to treat diabetes may also be administered with the therapeutic agents of this invention. Those additional drugs may be administered separately from the therapeutic agents that are used to lower blood, serum, or plasma serotonin levels, as part of a multiple drug dosage regimen. Alternatively, those additional drugs may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together or otherwise combined with the therapeutic agents that are used to lower blood, serum, or plasma serotonin levels in a single pharmaceutical composition. If administered as part of a multiple drug dosage regime, the additional drugs and the therapeutic agents used to lower blood, serum, or plasma serotonin levels may be administered simultaneously, sequentially or within a selected specified period of time from one another. The amount of both the therapeutic agent that is used to lower blood, serum, or plasma serotonin levels and the additional drug (in those compositions which comprise an additional drug) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient treated and the particular mode of administration as well as on the nature of the therapeutic agent that is used to lower blood, serum, or plasma serotonin levels and the nature of the additional drug.","In the present specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.","Animal Experiments","Mice were housed under 12:12 light:dark cycle and chow and water were provided ad libitum. All animals were maintained according to NIH guidelines. The Htr2bflox\/flox, Tph1flox\/flox, and Villin-cre mice have been described previously (1). Alb-cre and aP2-cre mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. For glucose tolerance tests mice were fasted overnight before i.p. injection of 2 g\/kg body weight (BW) d-glucose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 1 g\/kg BW when mice were fed high fat diet. For pyruvate tolerance tests, mice were fasted overnight, injected i.p. with 2 g\/kg BW sodium pyruvate in PBS. Glycerol tolerance test (4 g\/kg BW) was performed after 4 h fasting. For insulin tolerance tests, mice were injected with 0.75 U\/kg of insulin after 4 h fasting. Glucose was measured by tail vein bleeds at the indicated intervals using an ACCU-CHECK\u00ae glucometer. Measurement of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol were performed in plasma using a serum triglycerides determination kit (TR0100, Sigma) and a NEFA-HR(2) kit (WAKO Diagnostics). Plasma concentration of serotonin and glucagon were determined by Glucagon ELISA (Alpco, 48-GLUHU-E01) and Serotonin (Research) ELISA, (IBL-America, IB89540). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed in the University of Massachusetts Mouse Phenotyping Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School. LP533401 was purchased from Dalton Pharma Services (Toronto, Ontario, Canada), dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400 and supplemented with 2.5% glucose, and administered daily at the dose of 100 mg\/kg by gavage.","Histology","Histological analyses were performed on paraffin embedded epididymal fat. 5 \u03bcm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed using a 20\u00d7 objective. Quantification of the size of individual adipocytes was performed using ImageJ.","Enzymatic Activity Assays","fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) enzymatic activities assays were performed as described previously (2-3). All reagents were obtained from Sigma.","In Vitro Lipolysis of Isolated Fat Pads","In vitro lipolysis assay was performed as described (4). Briefly, epididymal fat pads were isolated and washed several times in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma). Tissue pieces (\u02dc25 mg) were incubated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 h. After this preincubation, the fat explants were transferred into identical, fresh medium containing serotonin (Sigma) or 10 \u03bcM forskolin as a positive control and incubated further for the indicated time-points at 37\u00b0 C. Afterwards, aliquots of medium were taken for measurements of FFAs and glycerol using available kits (NEFA-HR(2), WAKO Diagnostics; serum triglycerides determination kit, TR0100, Sigma) and tissue was lysed with RIPA buffer for subsequent Western blot analysis or in TRIZOL\u00ae (Invitrogen) for gene expression analysis.","In Vitro Glucose Production","Production of glucose was assessed in primary, freshly isolated, attached hepatocytes. Briefly, cells were platted on 12 well plate format (200,000 cells per well). After isolation, the cells were allowed to attach and recover for 6 h in Williams E medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Then they were washed and starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's DMEM without glucose and phenol red but with 2 mM L-glutamate and 0.5% BSA (D5030, Sigma). Then the cells were switched to the same medium or the same medium containing 10 mM glycerol and stimulated with the indicated substances for 6 h. Glucose concentration was determined in the medium using Amplex Red Glucose\/Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit, (Invitrogen, A22189). Glucose production from glycerol was determined by subtracting glucose produced by the cells incubated without glycerol from this incubated with glycerol.","Western Blotting","Western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. Frozen tissues or cells were homogenized and lysed with RIPA buffer. Membranes were blocked and then incubated overnight with primary antibody in TBST-5% BSA, followed by incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Signals were visualized with ECL. The following primary antibodies were used: antiphospho-HSL(s563) (4139), antiphospho-HSL(s565) (4137), antiphospho-HSL(s660) (4126) and anti-perilipin (3470) (all from Cell Signaling); anti-HSL (ab45422), anti-ATGL (ab85348) and anti-glycerol kinase (ab70029) (all from Abcam); anti-\u03b2-actin (A5441) and anti-\u03b1-tubulin (T6199) (all from Sigma); anti-G6Pase (Aviva Systems Biology, ARP44224_P050); anti-FBPase (Abgent, AP7385c); antiphospho-perilipin(s522) (Vala Sciences, 4856).","RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR Analysis","Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL\u00ae reagent with manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) and 2 \u03bcg of total RNA was used to synthesize complementary DNA using random primers and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For quantitative PCR, FastStart SYBR Green Master (Roche) was used in an MX3000P Real-Time System thermocycler (Stratagene).

This elevation of circulating serotonin levels occurred before the elevation of glucagon, a hormone involved in the adaptation to fasting in vertebrates (7). Fasting triggers mobilization of triglycerides, in the form of glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs), through lipolysis (8, 9). Thus, the potential role of GDS in this process was determined through the study of mice lacking Tph1 only in the gut (Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice) ().","Unlike Tph1fl\/fl control littermates, Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice did not show a significant increase in circulating levels of FFAs and glycerol following a 4 h fasting period. While glycerol circulating levels did not increase even when fasting was prolonged up to 48 h, FFAs levels did increase in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice during this extended fasting but not to the same extent as in Tph1fl\/fl mice ( and D). As a consequence of this failure to induce appropriate lipolysis, Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice fasted for 48 h displayed heavier fat pads, larger adipocytes and lost significantly less weight than Tph1fl\/fl mice ( and ). These results indicate that serotonin is a physiological regulator of lipolysis.","Whether serotonin could affect lipolysis in fed mice, a situation in which this process is normally blocked (8, 9), was also tested. This was done by implanting subcutaneously serotonin releasing pellets in WT mice. These pellets increased circulating levels of serotonin approximately two-fold (). This resulted in a significant increase in circulating levels of glycerol and FFAs ( and I). Lipolysis was further enhanced if WT mice implanted with these pellets were fasted for 4 h. Hence, GDS is sufficient to induce lipolysis in fed or fasted mice.","To determine whether GDS promotes lipolysis by acting directly on adipocytes, epididymal fat pads were treated with increasing amounts of serotonin. This treatment significantly increased release of both glycerol and FFAs ( and K). Of note, there was no evidence of white fat into brown fat transformation in Tph1 gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice (10) (). In view of these results, the identity of the signaling pathway used by GDS in adipocytes was investigated. Among the fourteen known serotonin receptors (1), Htr2b was by far the most highly expressed in mouse adipocytes (). Furthermore, its expression in white adipose tissue increased upon fasting (). Hence, mice lacking Htr2b in adipocytes only were generated (Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394 mice) and their response to fasting was analyzed.","Fasting failed to increase glycerol circulating levels in Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394, as it did in Htr2bfl\/fl mice (). The increase in FFAs circulating levels observed upon fasting in Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394 mice was also significantly weaker than in Htr2bfl\/fl mice (). Consequently, Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394 mice had bigger fat pads, larger adipocytes, and lost less weight during a 48 h fasting than Htr2bfl\/fl littermates ( and ). Moreover, in cell culture, serotonin failed to enhance release of glycerol and FFAs from Htr2b-deficient fat pad explants. This was not due to the poor quality of explants because isoproterenol, used as a positive control, favored equally well FFAs and glycerol release from these explants ( and H).","To begin deciphering serotonin's molecular mode of action in adipocytes, the expression, accumulation, and phosphorylation of key lipolytic enzymes (11-14) were analyzed. There was no alteration of gene expression in Tph1 gut\u0394\/\u0394 and Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394 mice ( and ) or in the accumulation of many enzymes involved in lipolysis. In contrast, serotonin favored, in an Htr2b-dependent manner, phosphorylation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) on serine residues 563 and 660 (). Those phosphorylation events enhance HSL activity (15, 16). Taken together, these experiments indicate that serotonin promotes lipolysis by signaling in adipocytes through Htr2b to increase phosphorylation and activity of HSL.","Glycerol can be converted to glucose by the liver during fasting (7). Hence, results presented above raised the prospect that GDS may promote gluconeogenesis simply through its ability to increase glycerol circulating levels or independently of its role on lipolysis. These possibilities were tested by measuring glucose production following glycerol injection (17). In the conditions of this experiment, glycerol did not increase circulating glucose levels in Tph1 gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice to the same extent as in Tph1fl\/fl mice (FIG. A). The same was true for pyruvate, the initial substrate in liver gluconeogenesis (). Conversely, in WT mice implanted with serotonin pellets glycerol increased blood glucose levels to a higher level than in controls (). These experiments indicated that serotonin is a physiological regulator of liver gluconeogenesis and that this function is not a mere consequence of its action on lipolysis. To further test if serotonin can induce gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice were subjected to hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Hepatic glucose production was markedly reduced in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice (). Consistent with the notion that serotonin adapts the organism to food deprivation glycogen synthesis rate was also increased in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice (). That whole-body glycolysis rate was unchanged ruled out that the observed effect on gluconeogenesis might be secondary to alterations of this process ().","In cell culture, serotonin stimulated conversion of glycerol to glucose in hepatocytes to the same extent as glucagon, a positive control, did (). Since Htr2b was the most abundant serotonin receptor in the liver and its expression in this organ also increased upon fasting ( and ), whether Htr2b was mediating serotonin regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis was tested. Glycerol and pyruvate did not increase circulating glucose levels in Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 mice to the same extent as in Htr2bfl\/fl littermate controls (, H), and serotonin could not induce glucose production from glycerol when added to Htr2b\u0394\/\u0394 hepatocytes (). These data indicate that serotonin stimulates gluconeogenesis by signaling through Htr2b present in hepatocytes. That glycogen content was increased in livers of fasted Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 mice () indicated that the regulation of glycogen synthesis by serotonin previously noted (18) occurs through Htr2b. Generation of ketone bodies in Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 was normal, indicating that serotonin signaling does not affect this aspect of adaptation to fasting (). Next, the expression of key genes involved in gluconeogenesis from glycerol (FBPase, G6Pase, glycerol kinase and aquaporin 9) (7) was analyzed, but no significant change in Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 mice () was observed. In contrast, when measured through classical bioassays (19, 20), the enzymatic activity of the two rate limiting enzymes for this process, FBPase and G6Pase, were decreased 20% and 25%, respectively, in Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 mice ( and K). These results suggested that serotonin favors gluconeogenesis, in part, by enhancing activity of these enzymes.","FFAs promote insulin resistance (21, 22). Accordingly, insulin sensitivity, measured by insulin tolerance test and glucose infusion rates during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, was significantly improved in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 and in Htr2bfat\u0394\/\u0394 mice compared to controls (, , and ). The ability of serotonin to promote liver gluconeogenesis also influenced glucose homeostasis since both Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 and Htr2bliver\u0394\/\u0394 mice were significantly more tolerant to a glucose load than control littermates ( and ). On the other hand, GDS does not influence glucose stimulated insulin secretion at basal conditions (23) (). These results implied that decreasing GDS synthesis should attenuate the severity of Type II diabetes.","Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice were fed a high fat diet, inducing obesity and Type II diabetes (). Circulating glycerol and FFA levels were reduced in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice compared to control animals ( and D). Moreover, gluconeogenesis was partially normalized in Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice fed a high fat diet (). These mice were also significantly more insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant than Tph1fl\/fl mice fed the same diet (, F).","A small molecule inhibitor of TPH1, and thus GDS synthesis, LP533401, that does not cross efficiently the blood-brain barrier (24), was tested for its effect on glucose intolerance. In WT mice fed a high fat diet, LP533401 (100 mg\/kg\/day) resulted in an 80% reduction of circulating serotonin levels, a decrease in glycerol and a normalization of FFAs circulating levels (, H and ). Consequently, insulin sensitivity was normalized while gluconeogenesis and glucose tolerance were significantly improved in LP533401-treated mice fed a high fat diet (, J and ). When given to WT mice fed a normal diet, LP533401 decreased glycerol and FFA levels, decreased gluconeogenesis rate, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance to the extent shown by Tph1gut\u0394\/\u0394 mice ( and ).
