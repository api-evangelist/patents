{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention relates in general to a computer method and system for executing security trades and, in particular, to a computer method and system for the execution of security trades in user preferred securities displayed in a multi-dimensional graph.","Without limiting the scope of the present invention, its background will be described with regard to trading common stock, as an example.","In trading common stock, there are three fundamental factors an investor must consider. These factors are what stock to trade, when to open a position in the stock and when to close that position in the stock. There are enumerable models that attempt to help the investor identify these factors each of which are based upon particular criteria. Some of the models are best suited for the long term investor using a buy and hold approach. Other models are better suited for the short term investor including, for example, the active investors that open and close positions in the same day or week.","In determining what stock to trade, a typical long term investor may perform substantial research into a particular company in an effort to evaluate the future success of that company. For example, a long term investor may evaluate whether the company has products or services that are likely to have an increase in sales, the effectiveness of a company's research and development, the profit margin of the company, the size and effectiveness of the company's sales organization, labor relations within the company, the quality of management personnel at the company, the competitiveness of the company in relation to other companies in the industry and long range outlook for profits.","In addition to these business related factors, the long term investor may look at factors such as whether the company typically pays dividends on common stock, the price to earnings ratio of the stock and the market capitalization of the company as well as earnings, revenue and net income of the company. On the other hand, an investor that is interested in short term investments may not perform such detailed research and instead may focus on factors such as volume of trades, proximity to a milestone such as a fifty two week high, difference between current volume and a historical volume, number of daily highs or money flow in identifying a stock of interest.","Once an investor has identified a stock of interest, the investor must then determine when to open a position in that stock. A long term investor might, for example, buy the stock regardless of price if it is being offered by a good company in a good industry banking on long term growth. Alternatively, a long term investor may monitor factors such as business cycles, the trend of interest rates, governmental attitudes and the direction of inflation in making such a decision. The short term investor, however, may be more interested in such factors as the volatility of the stock or the liquidity of the stock in making such a decision.","The next step for an investor once they have opened a position in a stock is to determine when to close that position. A long term investor may, for example, make a decision to sell a stock based upon factors such as a fundamental change in a company that does not comport with the investor's original criteria for buying stock in that company, a change in management in the company, under performance of the stock, the stock reaching an unacceptable low, a belief that the stock has peaked or simply a belief that another investment has better long term prospects. While some of these factors may also be important to a short term investor, a short term investor may focus more heavily on such factors as the continued momentum of the stock or simply making certain all open positions are closed by the end of a day.","Regardless of the investment strategies, however, these three factors, what to stock to trade, when to open a position in that stock and when to close the position in that stock remain key elements in any successful investment strategy. Therefore, a need has arisen for a system and method for identifying stocks that meet specific criteria selected by the investor. A need has also arisen for such a system and method that allows the investor to execute trades in those stocks that meet the investor's criteria.","The present invention disclosed herein comprises a computer based system and method for executing trades in user preferred securities. The system and method enable an investor to identify securities that meet specific criteria then enable the investor to execute trades in the identified securities.","The computer based system and method of the present invention utilize a computer program embodied on a computer readable medium on a client system and a computer program embodied on a computer readable medium on a server system. The client system and the server system are in communication with one another using known communication means. The server system is also in communication with a plurality of security data sources and a plurality of trade execution locations.","The security data sources provide the server system with security data relating to a plurality of securities. The client system provides the server system with user specific criteria that the server system uses to analyze the security data and to identify the securities that meet the user specific criteria. Once these user preferred securities are identified by the server system, information relating to the user preferred securities is transmitted to the client system.","In the client system, the user preferred securities are represented in an N dimensional graph based upon N user specific parameters selected by the user. For example, the user preferred securities may be displayed in a graph having at least three dimensions, at least five dimensions or more depending upon the number of user specific parameters selected by the user. The user may then select one of the user preferred securities from the N dimensional graph and associate order parameters with the selected user preferred security. The order parameters may include the number of shares, the price per share and an execution method desired by the user. An order to trade the selected user preferred security may then be sent from the client system to a server system the order being, for example, a buy order, a sell order, a short order or a cancel order. In the server system, the order is processed, including for example performing compliance analysis, then the order is routed to one of the trade execution locations where the trade is executed. Information regarding the order and the execution of the trade may be stored in a database of the server system.","While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention is discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the invention.","Referring now to , therein is depicted a platform layout of the system for executing trades in user preferred securities of the present invention that is generally designated . System  includes a server system  and a pair of client systems . Client systems  may include any number of peripheral input, storage and display devices such as a keyboard , a mouse  and a monitor . Server system  may communicate with client system  by any suitable means. In one illustrated embodiment, server system  is in communication with a client system  via a direct connection  such as a T1 line, a frame, a dial up modem or the like. In the other illustrated embodiment, server system  is in communication with the other client system  via an internet connection .","Server system  is also in communication with one or more security data sources  via a T1 line, a high speed modem or other transmission line  using, for example, a direct socket connection such as a TCP\/IP connection. Security data sources  provide data feeds to server system  from a plurality of sources such as PC Quote, S&P Comstock, NQDS and the like that contain all types of information relating to thousands of securities that are traded, for example, on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, Electronic Communications Networks (ECN) and the like. The data feeds contain a variety of information relating to each security. For example, the data feeds may contain level one information, which is best ask and best bid information as well as time and sales information, and level two information which includes detailed market participant information. In addition, the data feeds may include fundamental information such as market capitalization, sector information, price to earning ratio, 52 week highs and lows and the like.","Server system  includes an application programming interface that takes each data feed from the various security data sources , which are typically in a proprietary format, and processes it for real-time dissemination to client systems . As the amount of information received and processed by server system  from security data sources  is voluminous, each client system  typically receives only the information that the user of that client system  requests. As such, each client system  requests and receives only a small subset of the information processed by server system . For example, one user may be interested in securities that are approaching a 52-week high and that have a five day average volume above a particular threshold. In this case, the user would make the appropriate request from a client system  to the server system  for processing. The server system  then returns only the information relating to the securities that meet this user's criteria to that client system . Likewise, another user may be interested in securities having a high current volume that fall within a particular price range. Again, in this case, the user would make the appropriate request from a client system  to server system  which would return only the information relating to the securities that meet this user's criteria to that client system .","Server system  is also in communication with one or more trade execution locations  via a T1 line, a high speed modem or other transmission line  using, for example, a direct socket connection such as a TCP\/IP connection. Trade execution locations  include the various market participants, such as, exchanges, market makers, ECNs and the like. Server system  receives orders from client systems . The orders are processed in server system  and routed to the appropriate trade execution location  where the orders may be filled.","More specifically, server system  includes an application programming interface that takes each order from the client systems  and places that order in the required format, which is typically a proprietary format, depending upon which trade execution location  is to receive the order. The specific trade execution location  to which server system  sends a particular order is determined by a number of factors. For example, the user of the client system  originating the order may request a particular execution method such as execution at a specific trade execution location  or a specific type of trade execution location . Similarly, the particular type of order place by the user of the client system  may dictate that the order be sent to a specific trade execution location . Alternatively, server system  may select a particular trade execution location  to send an order to based upon factors such as the liquidity of the security at a particular trade execution location , the speed at which a particular trade execution location  fills order, the ratio of orders filled at a particular trade execution location  and the like.","Referring now to , therein is depicted a more detailed diagram of server system  of the system for executing trades in user preferred securities. Server system comprises numerous integrated servers that enable the processing of security data received from security data sources  for dissemination to various, client systems  based upon the request made from each client system  and that enable the user of client systems  to execute trades at the various trade execution locations .","Server system  includes a quote server , a chart server  and book servers . Quote server  receives the data feed from one of the security data sources  and parses the data based upon the feed parsing API. The parsed information may be sent via direct connection to a client system  upon request by a client system . In the illustrated embodiment, however, the connection between quote server  and client system  include a boss server , a mid-level server  and an HTTP tunneling server  as will be explained in more detail below. As such, quote server  may disseminate real-time first level security data, real-time second level security data and the like to client system . For speed of delivery to client systems , some of this data preferably resides in the cache memory of quote server  or may alternatively reside in RAM.","Chart server  receives the data feed from one of the security data sources  and parses the data based upon the feed parsing API. The parsed information is further processed by database manager  such that information relating to the securities may be stored in database . Database  is used for historical charting of security data. For example, database  builds one, two, three and five minute charts for intraday activity as well as historical charts for daily volume, daily highs and lows and the like for specified time increments such as the prior week, month or year. Database  is preferably an in-memory database utilizing cache memory and RAM such that information requested by a client system  can be disseminated as fast as possible.","Book server  receives the data feed from one of the security data sources  and parses that data based upon the feed parsing API. More specifically, book server  receives data from an ECN. The ECN data feeds contain not only the first and second level security data but also information relating to all the available asks and bids of each security.","Mid-level server  monitors information on a subset of the securities on which data feeds are received. While quote server , chart server  and book server  monitor all securities, perhaps 12,000 to 15,000 or more, mid-level server  only monitors those securities that are frequently requested by a client system , perhaps several hundred to a few thousand. For example, mid-level server  monitors all open positions that users presently have as well as additional securities that are being watched by such users, i.e., those that are part of real-time user requests and historically active securities. Use of mid-level server  adds flexibility to server system  by reducing the load on the other servers. In addition, the use of mid-level server  enhances the speed at which information is disseminated to client systems  by, among other things, gathering, combining and placing in cache memory data from quote server , chart server  and book server  such that a request from a client system  does not have to be processed by more than one server.","It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the use of the term server herein may mean a single physical server, multiple physical servers or multiple instances of an execution on a single physical server. For example, it is preferable to have multiple quote servers, at least one for each exchange and multiple book servers, at least one for each ECN. Likewise, it is preferable to have multiple chart servers and multiple mid-level servers depending upon the amount of information being processed. Also, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the servers described herein that make up server system  may comprise any suitable processor. For example, a Dell dual 500 MHZ processor with 512 MB of memory operating on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 platform has been found to be suitable.","In addition to the above described servers, server system  may include a boss server  that manages the operation of the other servers. Boss server  optimizes the processing of server system  by routing connection requests from client systems  to the servers within server system , for example to a specific mid-level server , that are presently operating with appropriate capacity to handle the new connection which avoids overloading any of the servers.","For connection between server system  and client systems  over the internet, server system  may also includes HTTP tunneling server . HTTP tunneling server  allows client systems  to work through fire walls, proxy servers and the like.","Server system  includes a decision support server . As with the mid-level server , decision support server  performs specific tasks which enable server system  to be more responsive to client systems . Decision support server  provides the data feed to client systems  that enables the creation of a multi-dimensional graph on the client systems  that allows for the graphical display of user preferred securities. In the illustrated embodiment, decision support server  receives data feeds from chart server , book servers  and quote server . In addition, decision support server  receives a data feed from data compiled in database . As explained in more detail below, decision support server  receives queries that contain various criteria from users of a client system  which are processed by decision support server  to identify particular securities that are of interest to users of a client system . The criteria range from fundamental information such as the market cap, dividends, 52 week highs and lows to technical analysis including Bollinger bands, RSI, moving averages, money flow, and other charting techniques. More specifically, but by way of example only, the following is a list of some the criteria that may be utilized by decision support server :","Current Price\u2014Current market price;","Volume\u2014Number of shares placed in the market that day;","High\/Low\u2014Highest\/Lowest price a security has reached that day;","Open\/Close\u2014Price at the most recent open\/close;","Daily High\/Low Count\u2014Number of times a new High\/Low has been reached that day;","52 Week High\/Low\u2014Highest\/Lowest price a security has reached in the past 52 weeks;","Gap\u2014Difference between most recent close and open prices expressed as a dollar value or as a percentage;","Change from Close\/Open\u2014Change in the price from the Close\/Open expressed as a dollar value or as a percentage;","Change from X Day\/Month\/YTD Avg Close\u2014Difference between the average close for the last X days\/months\/YTD and the Current Price expressed as a dollar value or as a percentage;","X Day\/Month\/YTD Avg Volume\u2014Average of the volume over the last X days\/months\/YTD;","Volume Over Yesterday's Vol (%)\u2014Difference between current Volume and yesterday's volume expressed as a percentage;","Volume Over 5 Day Avg Vol (%)\u2014Difference between current Volume and the average volume for the last five days, expressed as a percentage;","X Day\/Month\/YTD High\/Low\u2014Highest\/Lowest price a security has reached over the last X days\/months\/YTD, including today;","15\/60\/120 Day SMA\u2014Average of the last 15, 60 or 120 days' close values, including today;","15\/60\/120 Day EMA\u2014While similar to the SMA above, the exponential moving average uses a \u201csmoothing factor\u201d to give more weight to recent prices, while still allowing all data in the window to influence the average;","Rate of Change\u2014Change in price between the current price and the close 6 days ago, divided by the price 6 days ago;","10\/30\/50 Day RSI\u2014Relative Strength Index indicates the degree of positive and negative movement by the stock on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 100 (strongest). Determined by figuring the ratio of the average up closes for the last 9, 29 or 49 days (using today's Current Price for the 10th, 30th or 50th day) divided by the sum of the average up closes and the average down closes for the same period. This ratio is multiplied by 100;","10\/30\/50 Day RSI from Close\u2014Relative Strength Index indicates the degree of positive and negative movement by the stock on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 100 (strongest). Determined by figuring the ratio of the average up closes for the last 10, 30 or 50 days (not including today if prior to close) divided by the sum of the average up closes and the average down closes for the same period. This ratio is multiplied by 100;","Bollinger Bands\u2014The center is an n-interval exponential moving average. The top and bottom lines are placed in standard deviations above and below the centerline. Since standard deviations are a measure of volatility, the bands widen during volatile price action and contract when the trading range tightens;","MACD\u2014Trend-following momentum indicator that uses three exponential moving averages: a short or fast average, a long or slow average and an exponential average of their difference, the last being used as a signal or trigger line;","OBV (On Balance Volume)\u2014Indicator that relates volume to price changes by adding volume to a running total when the price closes up for a period and subtracts the volume if the stock closes down for a period;","20\/40\/60 Day Momentum\u2014Measures the amount that a security's price has changed over the last 20, 40 or 60 days. If today hasn't closed yet, it uses the current price for today's close;","20\/40\/60 Day Momentum from Close\u2014Measures the amount that a security's price has changed over the last 20, 40 or 60 closes;","Money Flow\u2014Indicates with a dollar value whether money is flowing into or out of a security. Calculated by subtracting the downtick and adding the uptick for every tick of the trading day;","Money Flow (%)\u2014Indicates the percentage at which money is flowing into or out of a security;","Williams % R\u2014Measures the percentage to which a security is overbought or oversold based on the position of the current period's close to the range of prices over a time period;","PE Ratio\u2014Measures how expensive a security is based upon the cost an investor in a security must pay per dollar of current annual earnings;","EPS Ratio\u2014Net income divided by the number of shares of a company participating in the profits;","Dividend\u2014Taxable payment declared by a company's board of directors and given to its shareholders out of the company's current or retained earnings;","Market Cap\u2014Market value of all of a company's outstanding shares;","PS Ratio\u2014A security's capitalization divided by its sales over the previous 12 months;","Earnings\u2014Revenues minus cost of sales, operating expenses, and taxes, over a given period of time;","Net Income\u2014Gross sales minus taxes, interest, depreciation, and other expenses;","Revenue\u2014Total dollar amount collected for goods and services provided;","DPS Ratio\u2014Dividends Per Share Ratio indicates the dollar amount of dividends issued to stockholders per share;","Shares Outstanding\u2014Shows number of shares of a corporation which have been issued;","Stock Exchange\u2014Shows the exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.) on which a security trades;","Sector\u2014Shows the general industry classification of the company; and","Industry\u2014A specific category describing the company's business activity.","Server system  also includes a master server  and an execution server . Client systems  may connect directly to master server  or may connect through HTTP tunneling server . In either case, once a user from a client system  connects to master server , master server  loads information relating to that user into memory from a client database (not pictured). Master server  monitors orders from client system  and performs compliance checks on the orders. For example, master server  would reject an order from client system  if the user attempts a trade that exceeds the user's buying power. Likewise, master server  would disallow an order from client system  that would be in violation of securities regulations such as an order that would be in violation of the Soes five minute rule.","Execution server  receives the orders from master server . Execution server  then routes the orders to a trade execution location  based upon the particular execution method requested by the user, such as execution at a specific trade execution location  or a specific type of trade execution location . Alternatively, execution server  may select a particular trade execution location  based upon factors such as the liquidity of the security at a particular trade execution location , the speed at which a particular trade execution location  fills orders, the ratio of orders filled at a particular trade execution location  and the like. Once the trade execution location  is selected, the order is formatted for the proprietary application programming interface of that trade execution location . The order is then sent to that trade execution location  to be filled.","Referring now to , therein is depicted a more detailed diagram of the servers that comprise execution server  of the system for executing trades in user preferred securities of the present invention. As explained above, client systems  send orders to master server  wherein the orders are processed and compliance checks are performed. Master server  sends the orders, which satisfy the compliance checks, to execution server . Execution server  includes an order router server , an order execution server , an ECN router server  and an ECN execution server . The order will be sent to either the order router server  or the ECN router server  depending upon the execution method selected by the user of client system  or by server system . For example, if the execution method selected by the user of client system  is to trade on NASDAQ via Soes, master server  will send the order to order router server  which will route the order to order execution server  where the order is formatted for the application programming interface for a Soes trade. The order is then sent to Soes for an automated trade based upon the Soes trading methodology. In a similar manner, if the execution method selected by the user of client system  is to trade on the NYSE, master server  will send the order to order router server  which will route the order to order execution server  where the order is formatted and forwarded to the floor of the NYSE for a manual trade.","Alternatively, if the execution method selected by the user of client system  is to trade on an ECN, such as the trade execution location  of Isld, master server  will send the order to ECN router server  which will route the order to ECN execution server  where the order is formatted for the application programming interface for a trade on Isld. The order is then sent to Isld for an automated trade. Similarly, the user of client system  may elect to trade on any one of the other ECNs such as the trade execution location  of Inca, Arca, Redi, Attn, Btrd, Strk, Ntrd, Brut, Market XT and the like.","Execution server  also includes databases , . Database  receives and stores all of the information relating to the orders routed by order router server  and ECN routers server . Likewise, database  receives and stores all of the information relating to the orders sent to trade execution locations  by order execution server  and ECN execution server  and information received from trade execution locations .","A user of the system for executing trades in user preferred securities of the present invention interfaces with server system  using a client system . Specifically, the user of a client system  makes a request on decision support server  based upon one or more of the above described criteria. The user may select any number of criteria which will be referred to herein as M user specific criteria. Decision support server  then identifies the securities that meet these M user specific criteria which are referred to herein as user preferred securities. As best seen in , the user of client system  opens an Add query window  which allows the user to select from built-in and user constructed preloaded queries or allows the user to construct new queries. These queries define the M user specific criteria used to select the user preferred securities. More specifically, Add query window  includes an available queries selection box  that shows a list of available queries. The built-in queries are indicated by a \u201cc\u201d icon, such as 5 dayavg query . The user constructed queries are indicated by a \u201cu\u201d icon, such as hicount query .","Add query window  also includes Delete File button  that allows a user to delete user constructed queries, a Save button  that allows the user to save user constructed queries or query lists and a Load button  that allows the user to access a saved query list. Add query window  allows the user to display or hide built-in, user constructed queries or both by operating a Built-in query button  and a User constructed queries button . By selecting a particular query and pushing Description button , the detailed search criteria of the selected query is provided to the user. For example, if the user selected hicount query  and requested a description, a description dialog box would appear having a description such as \u201ctop 20 stocks hitting daily highs today.\u201d","Add query window  allows the user to construct a multi-dimensional graph that displays the user preferred securities that are identified as a result of the user specific criteria in the selected query. By pressing the Add Graph button , the user preferred securities are graphically represented to the user on client system  as will be explained in more detail below. Alternatively or additionally, the user may view the user preferred securities in a list format by pressing the Add List button .","The user may construct new queries by pushing the Advanced button  in the Add query window . This will pull up a Query Construction & Results window  as seen in . In the Query Construction & Results window , the first step in creating a query is specifying in Query box , a criteria and a condition that securities must satisfy to be included in the query results. The user may then add more filters to further refine the query. For example, a user selects a name for the query in name box . Then, the user chooses the criteria to query from the pull-down-menu in List box . The user determines how to limit the query results by selecting the Query from Top button , which returns the top X securities sorted by the query criteria that meet the query and filter requirements, the Query from Bottom button  which returns the bottom X securities sorted by the query quantity that meet the query and filter requirements or the Query by Threshold button  which prompts the user to select a relationship in Relation box  (i.e. greater, between, etc.) and enter a number in the Threshold  box  and the Threshold  box  if BETWEEN is selected in Relation box .","To add additional criteria or filters to this query, the user selects a criteria in the Available Filter box  which is used in conjunction with various factors selected in the Filtered by box  which create the criteria in the Applied Filters box . After the user selects the desired criteria from Available Filter box , the user selects whether to filter by threshold, quantity, delta or delta percent in Filtered by box . If the user selects the Threshold button , the user then must also select a relationship in Relation box  (i.e. greater, between, etc.) and enter a number in the Threshold  box  and Threshold  field  if BETWEEN is selected in Relation box . For example, to set a filter that will only list securities with a greater than 15% change from open, the user chooses Change from Open (%) in the Available Filters box , GREATER in the Relation box  and 0.15 in Threshold  box .","Selecting the Quantity button , allows the user to compare an available filter quantity against another quantity using one of the relationship operators. For example, to set a filter that will only list stocks with a Volume greater than the one month average volume, the user chooses Volume in the Available Filters box , GREATER in the Relation box  and 1 Month Avg Volume in the Quantity  box .","Selecting the Delta button , allows the user to subtract the selection in the Quantity  box  from the originally selected criteria. If the difference falls within the Relation\/Threshold entered by the user, the security will appear in the query results. For example, to set a filter that will only list stocks that are \u215bth or less off their 52-week high, the user chooses Current Price in the Available Filters box , 52-Week High in the Quantity  box , GREATER OR EQUAL in the Relation box , and \u22120.125 in Threshold  box .","Selecting the Delta % button , allows the user to subtract the selection made in the Quantity  box  from the originally selected criteria, then divide the result by the originally selected criteria. If the final result falls within the Relation\/Threshold entered by the user, the security will appear in the query results. For example, to set a filter that will only list stocks within 2% above their 60 Day Simple Moving Average, the user chooses Current Price in the Available Filters box , 60-Day SMA in the Quantity  box , BETWEEN in the Relation box , 0 (zero) in Threshold  box , and 0.02 in Threshold  box .","Once the user has selected all of the desired filters, the user presses the Apply button  to add the filter to the query. When the user is finished building the entire query, the user presses the Submit button  which saves the query and sends it to decision support server  of server system . As explained above, the user may view the textual description of the selected query in the User Query list  or Built-in Query list  by pressing Description button . Another query may be created by pressing the New button .","Use of the above described built-in queries or user constructed queries allows the user to define the M user specific criteria and design a decision support tool that provides information to the user based upon the users trading style. Once the user has selected a particular query, the user pushes the add graph button  of  to generate a multi-dimensional graph for the user that graphically displays the user preferred securities.","As seen in , a multi-dimensional graph  is depicted displaying the results of a user selected query. Graph  includes a coordinate system  that has an X-axis , a Y-axis , and a Z-axis . Displayed on graph  are a variety of icons which represent specific user preferred securities that were identified by decision support server  based upon the M user specific criteria in the user selected query. Specifically, five icons representing these user preferred securities are depicted as icon , icon , icon , icon  and icon .","In the illustrated embodiment, graph  is a three dimensional graph wherein the dimensions are represented by the three axes , ,  of coordinate system . As will be explained in more detail below, the user selects the various parameters that are represented in graph . In the illustrated embodiment, the parameter represented by X-axis  is current price, the parameter represented by Y-axis  is the prior days' close price and the parameter represented by Z-axis  is the change in price from close.","Once graph  has been generated based upon the M user specific criteria in the user selected query, the user may further define the user preferred securities using various features of the graphical user interface of client system . For example, the user may select a particular parameter in the parameter box  then modify the display on graph  by manipulating slider bar system . In the illustrated embodiment, the user has selected the current price parameter in parameter box . The end points of the scale of X-axis  are displayed in box  and box . To change this scale, the user may operate sliders  and  to adjust the scale. For example, if the user is now only interested in securities having a current price greater than 100, the user would operate slider  to the right until 100 appeared in the box .
