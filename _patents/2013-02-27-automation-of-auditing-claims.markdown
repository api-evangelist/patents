{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example One","Example Two"],"p":["This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/610,972, filed on Sep. 12, 2012, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/474,450, filed on May 29, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,346,577. The contents of each of the foregoing are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The present invention relates generally to computer-based methods and apparatuses, including computer program products, for automation of auditing claims.","Insurance claim estimates can be written by a number of different appraisal types (e.g., independent appraisers, repair shop appraisers, insurance staff appraisers). The appraiser can select the tools and\/or materials used to generate the estimates (e.g., how to write estimates, what software to use to write the estimates, what forms to use, etc.). The completed estimates are sent to the appropriate insurance company for review, approval and payment.","Completed estimates are reviewed to determine accuracy prior to approval and settlement of costs. The review includes, in part, determining liability for the claim costs. Liability either rests with the reviewing insurance company, a different insurance company, or a third party. When the liability rests with an insurance company other than the reviewing insurance company, or with a third party, all estimate repair documents are imaged and mailed (or emailed) to the liable party.","The review and settlement process for claim estimates is fundamentally consistent regardless of the claim type (e.g., a claim for a vehicle repair, a subrogation claim, a glass claim, a medical claim, a property claim, or other claim type). As such, the documents used in the processes for review and settlement of a claim are also materially similar. Some claim documents can be received electronically, while most documents used in a review are imaged, making it technically impossible today to automate the review, approval, and\/or payment process for claims.","It is estimated that, on average, claim costs for insurers are inflated by over 20% on each claim, or approximately $2.0 billion per year. To exert some control over the quality of repair operations and the accuracy of repair expenditures and claim costs, insurance companies perform audits on the repair documents and repair work associated with an insurance claim. Similarly, other businesses, such as glass companies, salvage pool businesses, rental car companies, and others, perform the same or similar auditing of documents to control quality of work performed and costs expended.","For claims undergoing an audit process auditors manually analyze parts selected, manually analyze repair operations suggested\/performed, and manually perform other proprietary business procedures and guidelines that are designed by the insurer to provide the best end-result for the vehicle owner and the business. Only limited capabilities exist in electronic auditing of estimate line items, which are limited to single line \u201cYes\/No\u201d outputs that are completely reliant upon an underlying code being associated with a data element on a specific line item of an estimate. There may not be a code for each line item. For example, if an appraisal source modifies an estimate line manually from the pre-defined input of the estimating software, those codes no longer exist. Because this occurs on almost all claim estimates, the current electronic auditing tools can be more appropriately characterized as tools that \u201cflag\u201d possible issues for auditors. The audit itself must still be completed manually. The cost and inefficiencies around this type of process enable only a minority of all claims to be reviewed for quality and accurateness.","The primary factors that affect claims cost are (1) the \u201cparts\u201d being utilized on the repair estimate, and (2) the \u201crepair operation\u201d being listed as necessary. From these two key estimate elements other costs are either incurred, or avoided. Insurance companies can reduce repair costs by having appraisers substitute higher priced original equipment parts from original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEM's\u201d) with less expensive, equivalent, aftermarket, recycled or reconditioned parts (\u201calternative parts\u201d). Advantageously, by using alternative parts, appraisers and repair shops save actual repair time, improve the quality of parts used in the repair, and accelerate the time taken to repair a vehicle. The end result is advantageous for all parties involved in the process.","For example, a claims appraiser, to save time and simplify the writing of a repair estimate, often selects higher priced OEM parts on a repair estimate, claiming no availability of approved alternative parts. Similarly a repair shop can receive payment for an OEM part from an insurance company and actually use a lower quality, less expensive, non-approved part without the insurance company having an accurate and reliable process to verify proper part utilization. Similarly, a repairer or appraiser may add repair operations onto an estimate that are not needed, based on the type of part selected. Without a manual review of the claim documents, these costs and lower quality parts can go undetected and contribute to higher repair costs and insurance rate costs, as well as poorer quality repairs for policyholders. Insurance claims and general repairs cannot be processed in an automatic process today because there is no system to accept claim documents and convert them into a usable, electronic form. There is no system capable of deciphering, or translating line items on the claim and repair documents to review accuracy and best practices. There is no system capable of reviewing and comparing various data across the documents to ensure adherence to the insurers best practices and guidelines for repairs.","For example, the subrogation of insurance claims is an extremely manual and paper based process. Assume driver A is insured by company A\u2032, and driver B is insured by company B\u2032. Driver A is involved in an accident with driver B, where A is responsible for the accident. However, B can go to his insurance company B\u2032 to repair his automobile, insurance company B\u2032 pays for the repairs, and then insurance company B\u2032 subrogates against driver A's insurance carrier for reimbursement. Insurance company A\u2032, however, will respond to insurance company B\u2032 by evaluating how the vehicle was repaired and then pay only what A\u2032 feels is the proper amount.","This process cannot be performed on every claim filed per year, and often leads to the parties going through an arbitration process with any settlement occurring, on average, over five (5) months after the initial subrogation. When sizing the automotive claims (repair claims and subrogation claims) marketplace there are approximately 30,000,000 claims that must be reviewed, approved and paid each year. Of this volume, none of the claims that can be electronically and automatically reviewed (or audited) in a manner that constitutes an audited review. This can be problematic, because the insurance company must either elect to pay the claim as received (at a 100% value) or to apply people to the review process, which is both time consuming and expensive. The cumulative claim cost for the repair estimate only (excluding rental, towing, people, etc.) is estimated at over $100 billion U.S. dollars.","The end result is a very time-consuming \u201che said, she said\u201d process. As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/928,570 (U.S. Pub. No. 2008\/0243556), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, subrogation specialists and self-insured's can gain access to real-time data that supports availability of parts on historical dates, enabling parties involved in the claims process to better identify when an appraiser did not accurately utilize parts on an estimate and\/or accurately document the cost of parts on the estimate. However, subrogation specialists must still manually analyze each operational entry in the repair documents to generate a proper settlement amount.","The invention, in one aspect, features a computerized auditing method. The auditing method includes receiving, via a processor, a data file comprising one or more auditable items, each auditable item comprising a word string having one or more words.

These identifiers are processed through one (1), or a combination of three (3), audit processes (e.g., the parts auditing application A, the ops auditing application B, and\/or the multi-point auditing application C). Advantageously, by developing multiple audit processes, the processes can work independently of each other, allowing an insurance company or other business to use them for specific needs. For example, an insurance company may desire to have an internal claims review team use the parts auditing services of the auditing system  (e.g., provided through the parts auditing application A) to confirm parts utilization on estimates. Or, the same insurance company may want to have repair estimates reviewed for accuracy of repair operations for vehicles being repaired (e.g., via the ops auditing application B). In another example, an insurance company may want to have repair estimates reviewed in a completely automated process (e.g., via the multi-point auditing process C).","With respect to step , the auditing system  applies the part identifiers to a database and application (e.g., the database  and the parts auditing application A of ) to audit for best practices and compliance to insurance policy guidelines, generating the parts audit report (\u201cparts auditing\u201d or \u201cparts auditing services\u201d). Of single repair components, parts can have a large impact on overall claim severity. The parts auditing component (e.g., the parts auditing application A, when used in conjunction with the other required components of the auditing system ) of the auditing system  ensures accuracy in parts utilization on repair estimates. Parts auditing services deliver accurate parts inventory to appraisers, confirm parts availability for insurance company review teams, automatically approve part selections on behalf of insurers, and document historical availability for subrogation reviewers.","Existing services that are known in the art can help an insurance company locate parts for use in an estimate. These services can be found online (e.g., CarPart.com) or can be found inside the estimating software solutions used by appraisers. The online services are manual and require an appraiser to manually enter a website and search for specific parts. The services inside an estimating software system are more automated, but they only work for specific parts and also require the part to be associated with an accurate OEM number from the manufacturer. This OEM number is not always available (e.g., only approximately 35% of the time), and the services are further restricted by the limited number of parts that are supported.","The parts auditing component of the auditing system  utilizes parts translators (e.g., the first parts translator  and the second parts translator B) designed and developed as a means to: (1) take inventory provided by part suppliers each day (e.g., over 140,000,000 pieces of inventory daily) and translate them so that a part identifier can be tagged on to each piece of inventory received, and (2) to take estimate line item descriptions from repair estimates (e.g., data file ) and to translate and associate those line item descriptions with a part identifier.","Once the translators translate estimated line item details for parts into a unique part identifier, the auditing system  can provide part alternatives by searching the database (e.g., database ) for matching identifiers, filter out inventory not approved by an insurer, and\/or audit for compliance to specific part use guidelines of the insurer. Advantageously, because the auditing system  does not rely on OEM numbers or a user to manually do the search, the parts auditing component can be performed on all parts listed on an estimate because the process is automatic and complete.","With respect to step , the auditing system  applies operational item identifiers to a database and application (e.g., the database  and the ops auditing application of ) to audit for best practices and compliance to insurance policy guidelines, generating the operational audit report (\u201coperational auditing\u201d or \u201crepair\/operation auditing\u201d). Operational auditing refers to the auditing of line items on a repair estimate (e.g., data file ) that do not involve a physical removal of a vehicle part (i.e. a hood) with the replacement of a replacement part in place of the removed part. For example, operational auditing includes auditing labor hours, auditing repair operations (e.g., recharging an AC compressor), auditing labor rates for a repair operation, and auditing the number of hours it takes to remove and replace a physical part (but not the audit of the part itself, just the operation). Once an estimate file (e.g., data file ) is converted (e.g., via text recognition unit , if necessary), it can be input into the automated auditing systems, and in this example the operational auditing system (e.g., the ops auditing application B of ).","Currently operational auditing system providers are limited with capabilities. Each requires that the data is received in an electronic format, the data received is associated on the same line of the estimate, and the data being audited is of a pre-defined value (e.g., not any free text, semi-structured or un-structured data). These limitations make operational auditing inefficient and impractical in attempting to audit all claim estimates. Less than 50% of the industry's claim estimates are available in an electronic form so insurance companies cannot rely on an automated auditing solution. Additionally, because the only result from current operational auditing providers is a YES\/NO result for an isolated line of an estimate data, the user encounters incomplete feedback from the auditing system and is required to review the materials manually to confirm.","For example, assume a repair estimate is received electronically (not as an image). Each line on the repair estimate identifies a repair operation that must take place during the repair of the vehicle. Assume line number fourteen (14) includes an operation code of \u201cREPAIR\u201d, a line item description inserted by the appraiser of \u201cFULL FRAME\u201d, a part type\/part number of \u201cExisting\u201d, and labor units of \u201c9.0.\u201d Current operational auditing systems can identify and understand an electronic code for REPAIR and the labor units of 9.0, but cannot interpret or understand FULL FRAME because it is a written\/typed description. As such, current operational auditing systems can only make decisions with an electronically received (formatted) repair estimate, and the result of such systems can only take place with respect to a single line item (e.g., information from other lines can not be considered). Such operational auditing systems cannot consider parts information as it relates to an operation.","Therefore, a rule that says do not allow FRAME labor to exceed 6 units would be run and line fourteen (14) would not fail because the operational auditing system would not identify the line was associated with a FRAME repair. This would cause the insurance company to incorrectly allow a repair appraiser to have increased hours on line fourteen, and ultimately this \u201cgap\u201d in capability of the auditing system providers places a burden on the insurance company to manually check each estimate even after running the rules against the audit to know if the audit rule fired correctly. Advantageously, by translating FULL FRAME into a corresponding operational identifier, the operational auditing application B of the auditing system  can properly apply operational rules, eliminating the need for manual review and improper rule firing. If a repair estimate is not received electronically (e.g., is received as an image), without the translators (e.g., the make model translator , the insurance company name translator , and the parts translator  of ) the repair estimate file would need to be processed manually. As such, the auditing system  can automatically translate both electronic and non-electronic files.","With respect to step , the auditing system combines identifiers and\/or reports (e.g., the part identifiers and the operational item identifiers and\/or the parts audit report and operational audit report) into an auditing application that would simulate a review of an estimate, as if performed by an actual person, generating a multi-point estimate (\u201cmulti-point auditing\u201d). Multi-point auditing enables real-time, fully automated review, audit and approval of a claim repair estimate, without human review.","Multi-point auditing can be achieved because the auditing system can, through it's various components, identify a data set and then understand what that data set means, for every field of every estimate detail, regardless of whether it is a part or operational line item (e.g., the translators can translate the required data into meaningful identifiers for use by the auditing system ). This capability enables not only the electronic auditing of claims or other data files, but it opens the road for complete automation of approval, procurement and payment activities between insurers, repairers and suppliers into the claims repair process.","Multi-point auditing allows multiple data points, across a repair estimate, to be considered in whole so that a decision can be made about any specific line's accuracy or appropriateness. For example, assume a data file includes multiple line items, two of which are: (1) line item=six (6), operation=CHECK\/ADJUST, line item description=HEADLAMPS, and labor units=\u201c0.4\u201d, and (2) line item=seven (7), operation=REMOVE\/REPLACE, line item description=\u201cL FRT COMBINATION LAMP ASSEMBLY\u201d, and labor units=\u201cINC.\u201d Conventional auditing systems known in the art can not properly audit this line item combination for inappropriate labor operations (such as aiming headlamps). In the multi-point auditing process of the auditing system , the translators (e.g., the part translator ) would have associated a part identifier to the description in line seven to mark it as a headlamp being replaced. The auditing system  would have kept track of such a detail from line seven (e.g., via storage in database ) and scanned the remaining lines of the estimate to find that line six includes a labor operation that would also be translated for a headlamp. The auditing system would store that information and use rules to deduce that estimating software (e.g., Mitchell Ultra-Mate Estimating Software) adds enough labor for replacing a headlamp (line seven) to include the aiming operation. The multi-point auditing would therefore alert the appraiser and the insurer that line six should be deleted, as the operation was included in the cost of line seven.","Advantageously, repair estimates can be received, processed, reviewed\/audited, and required changes (if they exist) can be communicated back to the appraisal source and the insurer without human intervention. Multi-point auditing can be performed on all claims regardless of what format they are received (electronic or imaged). Additionally, the process for translating outputs of the conversion process can be applied to all types of forms. For example, medical claims can be audited, where billions of claims are dealt with annually, and all of them are rubber stamped and paid or audited with less than trustworthy tools that require human review of the audit results after the fact. Advantageously, if all claims data can be converted to digital form, the ability to enable procurement, real-time automated settlement, and many other features exists.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0110"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 5A-5Y","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","400","104","402","128","404","128","406","128","408","128","410","128","412","128","414"]},"Below is an example of a translation process (e.g., carried out by the make model translator ) with reference to the steps of method  of . In a preferred embodiment, the sequence of the steps is preserved for the make model translation. However, in other examples the steps can be executed in any order and in any combination without detracting from the make model translation. For example, translation steps can be added and removed as additional patterns are identified within insurance company names.","With respect to step , four primary pieces of information can be used: the claim block make field, the claim block model field, the estimate block make field, and the estimate block model field. The make model translator  can prepare the characters of the word strings in each of the four fields for the translation process. The preparation can include, for example, separating all dissimilar types of characters for processing in the claim block make and model fields and the estimate block make and model fields. In some examples, all alphanumeric words and the special character \u201c&\u201d may be split into two or more words by separating the alpha and numeric and special characters from each other by inserting a space between them. In some examples, if both the claim block model field and the estimate block model field have numerics, and if the smaller numeric is a truncated version of the larger numeric (e.g., divided by 10 or 100) then the make model translator  can set both numerics equal to the larger numeric (e.g., if one model field has 3500 and the other model field has 35 or 350, then the make model translator  sets both model fields to equal 3500).

Now, the temporary translation table  as populated can have three different levels of row matches: 4-way, 3-way, and 2-way, each of which have the potential of different confidence weighting.","For example, the subset takes precedence if the subset is a perfect 2 for 2 match or when it is a 100% match. If the subset is not a 100% match, then the subset is considered 0%, and only matches in the superset are considered. Due to the ranges for these match sets, the match sets can overlap and cause ties. The following exemplary breakdown shows the extremes and averages of the matched sets:","a best match is a 4-way match (e.g., a match across all four fields of the temporary translation table , which can be represented by the number one (1)) with a weighting range of 100% to 75%, AVERAGE (87.50%);","a second best match is either a 4-way match with a weighting range of 75% to 50%, AVERAGE (62.50%), or a 3-way match with an weighting range of 100% to 75%, AVERAGE (87.50%);","a third best match is either a 4-way match with a weighting range of 50% to 25%, AVERAGE (37.50%), a 3-way match with a weighting range of 75% to 50%, AVERAGE (62.50%), or a 2-way match with an weighting range of 100% to 75%, AVERAGE (87.50%);","a fourth best match is either a 4-way match with a weighting range of 25% to 0%, AVERAGE (12.50%), a 3-way match with a weighting range of 50% to 25%, AVERAGE (37.50%), or a 2-way match with an weighting range of 75% to 50%, AVERAGE (62.50%);","a fifth best match is either a 3-way match with an weighting range of 25% to 0%, AVERAGE (12.50%), or a 2-way match with an weighting range of 50% to 25%, AVERAGE (37.50%);","a sixth best match is a 2-way match with a weighting range of 25% to 0%, AVERAGE (12.50%);","and lastly is a no match.","An exemplary way to create 4-way, 3-way and 2-way average weights and goodness values for the match set is to use equations 1 through 4:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0160","num":"0159"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","Total"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":["10","25"]},{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["X","i"]}},"mi":"n"}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Y","mrow":{"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"-"},"mi":"way"},"mo":"\u2062","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":["1","25"]},{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"X","mn":"1"},{"mi":"X","mn":"2"},{"mi":"X","mn":"3"},{"mi":"X","mn":"4"}],"mo":["+","+","+"]},"mn":"4"}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Y","mrow":{"mn":"3","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"-"},"mi":"way"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":["1","25"]},{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"X","mn":"1"},{"mi":"X","mn":"2"},{"mi":"X","mn":"3"}],"mo":["+","+"]},"mn":"3"}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"3"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"Y","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"-"},"mi":"way"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":["1","25"]},{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"X","mn":"1"},{"mi":"X","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"\u00d7"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"4"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}]},"In some embodiments, because the four pieces of information the make model translator  is using are not deemed equal in value.

The make model translator  pulls all row matches from the temporary translation table , which includes 4-way, 3-way, 2-way, and 1-way matches. Since there may be matches from the same row, all manufacturer, make, superset, and subset information will be the same and therefore only needs to be entered once into the match determination table . As the 4 or 3 or 2 pieces of information are copied\/written into the match determination table , the make model translator  transfers the hit percentage into the appropriate column of the match determination Table .","Below is an exemplary list of rules the make model translator  can use to govern the determination of a match. This listing is not intended to be limiting. If there is only one row with a subset match (e.g., the make model translator  determines a particular row of the match determination table  has a subset match and there is only one row with a subset match), the make model translator  deletes all other rows, indicates the remaining row contains the translation, and move to the completion steps. If, however, there is more than one row, the make model translator  deletes duplicates.","If the make model translator  determines there are multiple subset matches, the make model translator  calculates the goodness value using Equation 3 for all rows, and selects the highest goodness valve as the translation, and move to the completion steps. If this not the case continue in sequence. In the case of a tie, the make model translator  calculates the goodness value of the estimate block matches only and select the highest goodness value; or we can select an estimate block subset hit over a claim block subset hit. If there is still a tie between multiple rows, the make model translator  checks to see if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100% (e.g., Y=( 1\/25)*((100%+100%+100%)\/3)=4 or Y=( 1\/25)*((100%+100%+100%)\/3)=4). If so, the make model translator  multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field. For example, if Y has (a) a make equal to Chevrolet, which has one word for a perfect translation, and (b) a model equal to s and 10, each with two words for a perfect translation, for a claim make and model match and only a estimate model match, then Y=( 1\/25)*(([100%]*1+[100%]*2+[100%]*2)\/3)}=6.64. As another example, if Y has (a) a make equal to Chevrolet, which has one word for a perfect translation, and (b) a model equal to blazer and s10, where each has three words for a perfect translation, for a claim make and model match and only an estimate model match, then Y=( 1\/25)*(([100%]*1+[100%]*3+[100%]*3)\/3)}=9.33. The make model translator  selects the highest adjusted goodness score and proceeds to the completion steps. Otherwise, if there is a tie, then the conflicting information does not provide a translation, and the make model translator  moves to the completion steps without a translation.","If one row has a 4-way match, and there are no subset matches, the make model translator  identifies the row as the sole 4-way row match, deletes all other rows, and move to the final steps with the row as the \u201cproposed translation.\u201d If there is more than one row, the make model translator delete duplicates. If there are multiple rows that have two or more 4-way matches, and the proposed translations are not identical, then the make model translator  deletes all other rows and performs a tie break. An exemplary tie brake is illustrated below. The make model translator  calculates the goodness value with Equation 2 for all rows, and selects the highest goodness value as the translation, and move to the completion steps. Otherwise, if two or more 4-way hits exist with the same goodness value, then as a tiebreak the make model translator  calculates the goodness value (e.g., add match percentages and divide by 2) for the estimate make and model component only. If the make model translator  determines that one estimate block make model component that has a higher goodness value, the make model translator  select that as the match. Otherwise, if there is still a tie between multiple rows, the make model translator  checks if the individual components of the \u201cGoodness Value\u201d for each row are all at 100%. (e.g., Y=( 1\/25)*((100%+100%+100%+100%)\/4) or Y=( 1\/25)*((100%+100%+100%+100%)\/4)). If they are, the make model translator  multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field. For example, assume Y has (a) a make equal to Chevrolet, which has one word for a perfect translation, and (b) a model equal to s10, which has two words for a perfect translation. Therefore, for a claim make and model match and a estimate make and model match, Y=( 1\/25)*(([100%]*1+[100%]*2+[100%]*1+[100%]*2)\/4)=6.00. For example, assume Y has (a) a make equal to Chevrolet, which has one word for a perfect translation, and (b) a model equal to Blazer s10, which has three words for a perfect match. Therefore, for a claim make and model match and an estimate make and model match, Y=( 1\/25)*(([100%]*1+[100%]*3+[100%]*1+[100%]*3)\/4)=8.00.

If they are all at 100%, the make model translator  multiplies each component of each row by the number of words for a perfect translation in each component word field as described above.

Otherwise, if there is a tie then the conflicting information does not provide a translation and the make model translator  moves to the completion steps.","If there are multiple rows with 2-way matches and the proposed translation is not identical, the make model translator  performs a tie break. For example, if there are \u201cA to C\u201d matches, the make model translator  deletes the \u201cA to C\u201d matches. If, after the deletion there is only one 2-way match left, the make model translator  identifies the one 2-way match as the translation and moves to the completion steps. If there are \u201cA to B\u201d or \u201cA to D\u201d or \u201cC to D\u201d or \u201cB to C\u201d or \u201cB to D\u201d matches and the proposed translations are not identical, the make model translator  performs a tie break. For example, the make model translator  calculates the goodness value using Equation 4 for all rows, and selects the highest goodness value as the translation, moving to the completion steps. If the matches have the same goodness value, then the make model translator  can pick the row based on a predetermined priority (e.g., the following list arranged with the highest priority first and continuing on to the lowest priority: a CD match, a CB match, an AD match, an AB match, and, lastly, a BD match). If there is a tie, then the conflicting information does not provide a translation, and the make model translator  moves to the completion steps. Otherwise, if there is still a tie between multiple rows, the make model translator  checks if the individual components of the goodness value for each row are all at 100% as described above.","Lastly are the completion steps. If there are no matches (hits) there is not a translation available with the information provided.

If more than one translation exists that have the same number of column hits, then if there is still conflicting information that cannot be reconciled there is not a translation. Otherwise, if a clear match winner has been chosen, then the make model translator  use that row translation as the make and model information.","In some embodiments, all the operations described above for the make model translator  are carried out linearly and in the order described.

Recurring patterns can be deduced from insurance company names (e.g., by reviewing 10,000 insurance company names). In some examples, the number of words used in the body of insurance company names is about 10 times larger than used in parts translation (e.g., via parts translator ). This can make aliasing of an insurance company name dictionary (e.g., a template including all insurance company names for aliasing) difficult because of stepping on other aliases. Abbreviations are often used in both the informal and formal names, so the abbreviations cannot be blindly expanded (e.g., as a preprocessing step). Insurance companies are licensed by state by product, so, in some examples, insurance company names will appear fifty (50) times for one product if licensed all fifty (50) states. Therefore, differentiating between the multiple insurance company names requires identification of the state the type of policy was issued in. Since the type of product is often included in the insurance company name, the type of product may not need to be dealt with separately.","In some examples, the majority of the insurance company names are made unique by just one word, or at most two words. In some examples, (e.g., a small number of cases) the insurance company names are made unique by the order of a sequence of common insurance words. In many of the insurance company name word strings, the first one to three words, not including grammatical articles, are differentiating words that can be used to distinguish between insurance company names. In some insurance company name word strings, where the differentiation comes toward the end of the word string, the differentiating words are generally made up of locations (e.g., town, city, county, state, region, country). In insurance name word strings the order of the word sequence can be important, and should be maintained as the word string is processed (e.g., by the insurance company name translator ). An analysis of the matching of the translated insurance company name word strings with other name word strings has shown that for some insurance company names, common word matches should carry less weight than uncommon word matches. To increase accuracy, the insurance company name translator  can be configured to determine that a proper name for an insurance company exists in a translation table or dictionary if all words in the name are represented in the dictionary table (or data structure being used to represent the insurance company names). The insurance company name translator  can include rules that incorporate one or more of these recurring patterns.","Below is an example of a translation process (e.g., carried out by the insurance company name translator ) with reference to the steps of method  of . In a preferred embodiment, the sequence of the steps is preserved for the insurance company name translation. However, in other examples the steps can be executed in any order and in any combination without detracting from the insurance company name translation. For example, translation steps can be added and removed as additional patterns are identified within insurance company names.","With respect to step , the insurance company name translator  receives data indicative of an insurance company name with one or more words. In some examples, the insurance company name field word string is up to twelve words long.","In some embodiments, the insurance company name translator  generates a dictionary table (e.g., table A of ) and a table to numerically list insurance company names to facilitate the insurance company name translation. This creation process includes, for example, listing information for each company (e.g., a company code, primary company name, company group code, FEIN\u2014federal employer identification number, company business activity status, state of domicile, and words used in the subordinate word string). The insurance company name translator  analyzes the company information to make cross-references to data in the dictionary table, accumulate counts of true occurrences of occurrence categories, calculate word counts for the insurance company names, and other comparisons of words in the insurance company names. The insurance company name translator  calculates, for example, the lowest category of word usage, the approximate usage number total in the first third of the word string, the approximate usage number total in the second third of the word string, and the approximate usage number total in the third third of the word string, and whether the lowest usage word occurs in the first third, second third, or third third of the word string. The insurance company name translator  creates, in some embodiments, a table that explains the number of times words are used within the list of company names by word string position and\/or a table that shows the position in the word string of words representing geographical locations.

If the word is replaced or matched in column  of table , the insurance company name translator  marks that word and location as a state or territory of the United States. Additionally, if the first location word's position number is greater than \u2154*(the total number of words in the string), the insurance company name translator  notes the word position as \u201c3\u201d (e.g., in tables one through five of steps A-E of , or in column , the \u201cthird of the word string the location words are located in\u201d column of table  of ). In some embodiments, the word position is noted during the development of the group table as described above.

If, for example, the word \u201cnever\u201d is listed in the \u201cWhen Is An Adjective\u201d column, then the tested \u201cword\u201d is not used as a adjective. If, for example, the word \u201calways\u201d and\/or \u201call words\u201d is listed in the \u201cWhen Is An Adjective\u201d column, then the tested word is usually used as a adjective for all words it appears with. The same can be true for the words in the \u201cWhen Is An Orientation\u201d column.","Tables similar to table  can be generated, for example, based on the perspective of item names and descriptions. In some examples, table  is based on 1.5 million random item names and descriptions. For example, word placement trends can be utilized to generate a table like table . For example, if the word is primarily a noun then it will have a set of words that \u201cprecede\u201d the noun (e.g., superior to the noun in the relationship), whereas if it is primarily an adjective it will have a group of words that normally follow the word within a word string (e.g., inferior to the adjective in the relationship). Other word trends can include, for example, if the word is primarily a noun then the word will be the first word in the preceding word group. (e.g., the reason for this is that there may be word groups under the noun category at times when the word is not primarily a noun).","If each word in the word string is tested using, for example, table , the auditing system  may find words in the word string where the word being tested is either a noun or an adjective, thereby indicating whether it precedes or follows the word being tested. For example, assume there is a word sting with \u201cA, B, C, D\u201d, where none of the words are orientation words. The auditing system  can generate a string of relationships such as: A>C, B>C>D, C>D, B>D. In order to satisfy all the relationships in this case, the word string sequence must be A, B, C, D, where D is treated as the item name. A correct order of the words in the word string sequence can be determined by the order that correctly satisfies all the relationships in table . There can be as many relationships as there are words in the word string. Words tested and found to be orientation words can simply be held as orientation words that precede the word string.","Table  provides a generic build number and noun\/adjective\/orientation categorization. The \u201cGeneric Build Number\u201d column and the \u201cGeneric Classification\u201d column provide the generic categorization. The \u201cGeneric Classification\u201d column can be used to determine whether the word being tested is a Noun, Adjective, Orientation word. The \u201cGeneric Build Number\u201d column, for adjectives, indicates the word should be treated as Descriptors. For nouns, the \u201cGeneric Build Number\u201d column provides a generic build number. Generic build numbers can represent, for example, 8=Major Assembly, 7=Assembly, 6=Sub Assembly, 5=Sub Assembly Component, 4=Simple Component, 3=Single Pressed\/Rolled\/Cast\/Fiber Support Structure, 2=Plastic\/Rubber Trim\u2014Molding-Protector, and 1=Hardware\/Consumables.","For orientation words, the \u201cGeneric Build Number\u201d column can indicate the word is an orientation word. Orientation words can be collected and placed at the front of the word string. Word strings with multiple nouns and descriptors can be sequenced to abide by the following statement: after orientation words the highest build noun followed by the descriptor words followed last be the lowest build noun which is the item name. Parts can be described by what the part is attached to, what the part is a part of, and\/or what the part is located near. For example, the lowest build number can be the item name.","The \u201cMajor Assembly,\u201d \u201cAssembly A,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly B,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly Component,\u201d \u201cSimple Component,\u201d \u201cSupport Structure,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cHardware\/Consumables\u201d columns can indicate information for a customized Build Number. A noun it can be part of item names that reside at different levels in the build table. For example, the word \u201creceiver\u201d can be a simple connector on a tow bar or it can be a receiver in a complex navigation system, and therefore two different levels of number are supplied. These numbers can be determined by matching the words in the various columns between \u201cMajor Assembly,\u201d \u201cAssembly A,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly B,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly Component,\u201d \u201cSimple Component,\u201d \u201cSupport Structure,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cHardware\/Consumables\u201d with other words besides the word being tested in the word string. For example, if for the test the auditing system  is using \u201cword receiver\u201d and other words in the word string are either \u201cnavigation,\u201d \u201ckeyless entry,\u201d or \u201cradio,\u201d then receiver in this case is a sub assembly with the build number . If the other words in the word string had been \u201cframe,\u2019 \u201chitch,\u201d or \u201cbumper,\u201d then receiver in this case is a sub assembly component with the build number . The build numbers collected for the word string from the \u201cMajor Assembly,\u201d \u201cAssembly A,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly B,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly Component,\u201d \u201cSimple Component,\u201d \u201cSupport Structure,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cHardware\/Consumables\u201d columns are treated just as the numbers collected from the \u201cGeneric Build Number\u201d column. In some examples, however there is a slightly higher degree of accuracy with regard to the build level of each word in the \u201cMajor Assembly,\u201d \u201cAssembly A,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly B,\u201d \u201cSub-Assembly Component,\u201d \u201cSimple Component,\u201d \u201cSupport Structure,\u201d \u201cProtector,\u201d and \u201cHardware\/Consumables\u201d columns.","For example, assume a word string includes \u201cA B C D.\u201d Each word in the word string is tested. For example, word \u201cA\u201d is tested by locating word \u201cA\u201d in the \u201cDictionary\u201d column to identify the build row that pertains to information about this word. If the corresponding entry in the \u201cWhen Is An Orientation\u201d has an \u201cAlways,\u201d the test word A is an orientation word, and it is positioned first in the word string.

The system determines whether all the words are accounted for by being related to one another. If all words are accounted for, then the auditing system  sequences the words to satisfy all relationships and places any orientation words in the front of the resulting word string. The translation can move to the identification step with the matching table (See, e.g., ). If all words are not accounted for, then the auditing system  sequence the words to satisfy all relationships that exist and places any orientation words in the front of the resulting word string. The one or more words without a relationship (i.e., non-orientation words) are placed at the end of the word string and processed as shown in .","In , the auditing system selects () a non-orientation word from the word string.

The auditing system  can arrange () the word string, for example, with any orientation words first, any nouns with a number arranged highest to lowest (where the lowest noun is the item name), and any adjectives placed directly before the item name. The auditing system  determines () whether the relationships established in the first test (e.g., ) are maintained with exception of the word(s) without relationships and the orientation words. If the relationships established in the first test are maintained with exception of the word(s) without relationships and the orientation words, the auditing system  matches () with the matching table (see, e.g., ).

The auditing system  creates () a temporary table for analysis of the information which consists of all the match rows found in table . These rows contain, for example, orientation, orientation alias, descriptor, descriptor alias, match indicator, item name and item name alias information. The match indicator is a number of term matches for the particular row. The match percentage is calculated for each category of word. The percentage can be calculated, for example, by using the denominator as the count of orientation, descriptor and item name words in the table  description for the matching row, and the numerator as the count of any matches that occur in any of the categories (e.g., orientation, descriptor, descriptor alias, item name, item name alias).","The Match Count column in  includes the minimum count for a match for the corresponding row.

If the auditing system determines () there is one match which full fills all the requirements of the minimum match level, the match has no constraint words, and there are no other candidates for the match, the auditing system  can associate the generic item identifier as the item translation. For example, if a part name string is \u201cRight Front Impact Absorber\u201d, the min count is three (3) and the actual count is one (1) for orientation, one (1) for orientation alias, one (1) for descriptor, and one (1) for part name. There are no constraint words, so the total count of four (4) indicates the part name string is a candidate item translation.","If the auditing system determines () there are multiple matches with the same fulfillment requirements, the matching rules can handle the situation appropriately.  is a diagram of an exemplary table  that lists generic item identifiers which can require associating multiple generic item identifiers with a particular word string. The first column, column \u201cIndex\u201d (\u201cI\u201d) contains a unique identifier for each row. The second through ninth columns, labeled \u201cCol. A\u201d, \u201cCol. B\u201d, \u201cCol.

For example, if a part name string is \u201cAxle Shaft\u201d, the part name string has four candidates: Front right axle shaft, Front left axle shaft, Rear right axle shaft, and Rear left axle shaft. These four candidates are reported. If, for example, there is a match with the generic item identifier of the entry and table , the customer can be provided with dual translations, or any number of translations (e.g., five translations).

If there were no comas continue in sequence.","(8) If the word string consists of two or more words, one of which is the word \u201cassembly,\u201d \u201cset,\u201d \u201cextension,\u201d \u201cunit,\u201d or a fastener (e.g., one of the exemplary terms listed in the list BOLT, CLIP, EXTENSION, GROMMET, LUG, NUT, RIVET, SCREW, STUD, UNIT, ASSEMBLY, and SET): (8a) in the case of \u201cfastener,\u201d \u201cextension,\u201d or \u201cunit,\u201d place the descriptor(s) in a descriptor field in the matching table and place \u201cfastener,\u201d \u201cextension,\u201d or \u201cunit,\u201d in the item name field in the matching table. All words following the word \u201cfastener,\u201d \u201cextension,\u201d or \u201cunit,\u201d are deleted. (8b) In the case of \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201cset\u201d all words following the word \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201cset\u201d are deleted. The word preceding \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201cset\u201d should be placed in the item name field and all other words placed in the descriptor fields. Delete the word \u201cassembly or set\u201d. If one word remains, treat it as the item name, and place it in item name field of the matching table. If \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201cset\u201d is the first word in the word string, delete \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201cset\u201d and continue in sequence. If this is not the case continue in sequence. If this is not the case continue in sequence.","(9) Test for pattern recognition of standard part description patterns using, for example, the list of terms AIR, AXLE, BED, BEDSIDE, BODY, BRAKE, BUMPER, CABIN, CLUTCH, AIRCONDITIONER, CONSOLE, COWL, DOOR, EMISSION, ENGINE, EXHAUST, FENDER, FUEL, GRILLE, HEADLAMP, HEATER, HOOD, QUARTERPANEL, RADIATOR, ROOF, STEERING, SUSPENSION, TRANSMISSION, TRUNK, WASHER, WHEEL, WINDOW, WINDSHIELD, and WIPER.","(9a) If the \u201cprimary item name\u201d is the first word in the string then the last word in the string is in the string's \u201citem name\u201d and should be placed in the \u201citem name\u201d field in the matching table. The words between the \u201cprimary item name\u201d (first in the string) and the \u201citem name\u201d (last in the string) should be placed in the second, third & fourth descriptor fields in the same sequence they are in the string. Move to matching steps. If this is not the case continue in sequence.","(9b) If the \u201cprimary item name\u201d is the last word in the string, then the first word in the string is the string's \u201citem name.\u201d Place the first word of the string in the \u201citem name\u201d field in the matching table. The rest of the words can be placed in sequence in the descriptor fields after the \u201cprimary item name\u201d is placed in the first descriptor field. Move to matching steps. If this is not the case continue in sequence.","(9c) If the \u201cprimary item name\u201d is in the middle of the string the word to the right of it is the string's \u201citem name\u201d and should be placed in the \u201citem name\u201d field of the matching table. To the left all words can be placed in sequence in the descriptor fields after the \u201cprimary item name\u201d is placed in first descriptor field. All other words should be ignored. Move to matching steps.","(9d) If information is lacking then estimate the correct answer based on statistical norms. The remaining string does not have a primary item name or it has two non-consecutive \u201cprimary item names\u201d or it is made up of only \u201cprimary item names.\u201d Therefore, place the last word in the string in the \u201citem name\u201d field and the other words in the descriptor fields in the sequence they appear in the string. Move to matching steps.","(9e) If one word remains or one word and orientation words only, check table  for that word and move to lack of information step that does not provide a translation or continue in sequence accordingly.","Proceed as Described in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0344","num":"0343"},"figref":"FIG. 16A","b":["1600","1602","1602","1604","1606","1602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0345","num":"0344"},"figref":["FIGS. 16B-16F","FIG. 16B"],"b":["1620","1622","1622","1624","1624","1626"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0346","num":"0345"},"figref":["FIG. 16C","FIG. 16B","FIG. 16D","FIG. 16D","FIG. 16E","FIG. 16B"],"b":["1630","1626","1640","1640","1624","1622"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0347","num":"0346"},"figref":["FIGS. 16E and 16F","FIG. 16C"],"b":["1630","1650","1652","1654","1660","1624"]},"The above-described techniques can be implemented in digital and\/or analog electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The implementation can be as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage device, for execution by, or to control the operation of, a data processing apparatus, e.g., a programmable processor, a computer, and\/or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in any form of computer or programming language, including source code, compiled code, interpreted code and\/or machine code, and the computer program can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a subroutine, element, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one or more sites.","Method steps can be performed by one or more processors executing a computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating on input data and\/or generating output data. Method steps can also be performed by, and an apparatus can be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., a FPGA (field programmable gate array), a FPAA (field-programmable analog array), a CPLD (complex programmable logic device), a PSoC (Programmable System-on-Chip), ASIP (application-specific instruction-set processor), or an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit). Subroutines can refer to portions of the computer program and\/or the processor\/special circuitry that implement one or more functions.","Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital or analog computer. Generally, a processor receives instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and\/or data. Generally, a computer also includes, or is operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or optical disks. Data transmission and instructions can also occur over a communications network. Information carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of volatile and non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., DRAM, SRAM, EPROM, EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and optical disks, e.g., CD, DVD, HD-DVD, and Blu-ray disks. The processor and the memory can be supplemented by or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.","To provide for interaction with a user, the above described techniques can be implemented on a computer in communication with a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube), plasma, or LCD (liquid crystal display) monitor, for displaying information to the user and a keyboard and a pointing device, e.g., a mouse, a trackball, a touchpad, or a motion sensor, by which the user can provide input to the computer (e.g., interact with a user interface element). Other kinds of devices can be used to provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.","The above described techniques can be implemented in a distributed computing system that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, and\/or a middleware component, e.g., an application server, and\/or a front-end component, e.g., a client computer having a graphical user interface and\/or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an example implementation, or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components.","The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and a server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","One skilled in the art will realize the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof.
