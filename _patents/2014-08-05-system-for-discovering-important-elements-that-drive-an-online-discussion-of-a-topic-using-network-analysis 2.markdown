The government has certain rights in the invention.","This is a Non-Provisional Application of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/862,444, filed on Aug. 5, 2013, entitled, \u201cMethod for Discovering Important Elements that Drive an Online Discussion of a Topic Using Network Analysis.\u201d","This is also a Non-Provisional Application of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/862,467, filed on Aug. 5, 2013, entitled, \u201cMethod for Gauging Public Interest in a Topic Using Network Analysis of Online Discussions.\u201d","(1) Field of Invention","The present invention relates to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic and, more particularly, to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic using network analysis.","(2) Description of Related Art","The large scale of microblogging activity has given rise to free-form discussions in which participants may join and leave at any time. Measuring the public interest in a topic through its online discussions in microblogs can be difficult due to the sheer scale of microblog data (e.g., 100 million new posts per day to Twitter\u2122), as well as the variety of language used in the discussion. Furthermore, the frequency with which entities appear in a discussion may not correlate with their importance. For example, consider a spammer who repeatedly posts the same message about a topic to a discussion. The elements of that message will have a high frequency; however, their relative importance (i.e., whether other discussion participants build on those messages), may be very low due their status as spam. Furthermore, within a single discussion many subtopics may emerge, with varying degrees of frequency. Detecting and ranking the important elements of these sub-discussions can be difficult using a frequency-based analysis since a less frequent element (e.g., a news story) might be discussed by a small core group, whereas another news story may just be mentioned more times by unrelated individuals.","Several works have leveraged the structure of microblog discussions to discover important features individually, such as hyperlinks (see the List of Incorporated Cited Literature References, Literature Reference No. 6), hashtags (see Literature Reference No. 4), events (see Literature Reference No. 3), or Tweets\u2122 themselves (see Literature Reference No. 2). For example, Romero, Meeder, and Kleinberg (see Literature Reference No. 4) analyzed the growth and persistence of hashtags in different topic categories, demonstrating that the emergence of a popular hashtag is highly topic dependent. Their method could be used to measure important hashtags. However, it does not take into account users, uniform resource locators (URLs), Tweets\u2122, or locations.","In a separate work, De Choudhury, Counts, and Czerwinski (see Literature Reference No. 2) considered a problem related to what is most important for a search result given a search query for a term. Using microtext, social network, and discussion attributes that were selected based on a user survey, they found that Tweets\u2122 which exemplified diversity in these attributes were among the best to return according to a user assessment. Their work could be considered an alternate approach to identifying the most important Tweets\u2122 in a discussion. However, their method does not take multiple entities into account.","Ruiz et al. (see Literature Reference No. 5) proposed a similar method for constructing networks from Twitter\u2122 messages about a publically traded company and demonstrated how the properties of this network could be used to predict stock price changes. Their network representation does not consider the location of the users, which is essential to identifying geographically-local discussions. Furthermore, their method did not consider normalizing the diameter of the graph and, therefore, was not effective in using the diameter for the purposes of their paper.","The representation of discussions as interconnected networks of entities has not been considered in the prior art. Existing processes for discovering important elements have largely relied on frequency-based analysis or on identifying important users and analyzing their content. Thus, a continuing need exists for a method that relies upon the interconnectedness of all of a discussion's entities as a way of discovering which elements are important to a discussion.","The present invention relates to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic and, more particularly, to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic using network analysis. The system comprises one or more processors and a memory having instructions such that when the instructions are executed, the one or more processors perform multiple operations. A message is received as input from an online discussion related to a topic. The message is analyzed for information related to the message. A graph comprising a plurality of nodes is generated, wherein each of the plurality of nodes represents an entity. The graph is updated over time as additional messages from the online discussion are received, such that additional nodes are generated and linked with at least one of the plurality of nodes by paths having path lengths. A closeness value is determined for each node based on the path lengths. The entities are ranked based on the closeness values, thereby providing a ranking of the entities by level of importance in the online discussion. The ranking of the entities is output to a user.","In another aspect, the closeness value for each node is determined according to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"cl","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"v"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"V"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["u","V"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["d","G"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["u","v"],"mo":","}}}}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":"G"},"In another aspect, the closeness value represents a relative centrality of an entity to all other entities.","In another aspect, the information related to the message is selected from a group consisting of user information, location information, hyperlink information, and annotation information.","In another aspect, the location information is obtained from at least one of geo-coordinate information related to the message or location information in a user profile from the online discussion.","In another aspect, the present invention comprises a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a new consumer product. The system comprises one or more processors and a memory having instructions such that when the instructions are executed, the one or more processors perform multiple operations. A message is received as input from an online discussion related to a topic. The message is analyzed for information related to the message. A graph comprising a plurality of nodes is generated, wherein each of the plurality of nodes represents an entity. The graph is updated over time as additional messages from the online discussion are received, such that additional nodes are generated and linked with at least one of the plurality of nodes by paths having path lengths. A closeness value is determined for each node based on the path lengths. The entities are ranked based on the closeness values, thereby providing a ranking of the entities by level of importance in the online discussion. The ranking of the entities is output to a user, wherein the user monitors an online discussion among consumers related to a new consumer product and uses the ranking of the entities to identify a set of discussion elements that drive the online discussion of the new consumer product.","In another aspect, the present invention also comprises a method for causing a processor to perform the operations described herein.","Finally, in yet another aspect, the present invention also comprises a computer program product comprising computer-readable instructions stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium that are executable by a computer having a processor for causing the processor to perform the operations described herein.","The present invention relates to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic and, more particularly, to a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic using network analysis.

Subsequently, a description of various principal aspects of the present invention is provided. Finally, specific details of the present invention are provided to give an understanding of the specific aspects.","(1) List of Incorporated Cited Literature References","The following references are cited throughout this application. For clarity and convenience, the references are listed herein as a central resource for the reader. The following references are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully included herein. The references are cited in the application by referring to the corresponding literature reference number, as follows:\n\n","(2) Principal Aspects","The present invention has three \u201cprincipal\u201d aspects. The first is a system for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic. The system is typically in the form of a computer system, computer component, or computer network operating software or in the form of a \u201chard-coded\u201d instruction set. This system may take a variety of forms with a variety of hardware devices and may include computer networks, handheld computing devices, cellular networks, satellite networks, and other communication devices. As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, this system may be incorporated into a wide variety of devices that provide different functionalities. The second principal aspect is a method for discovering important elements that drive an online discussion of a topic. The computer program product generally represents computer-readable instruction means (instructions) stored on a non-transitory computer-readable medium such as an optical storage device, e.g., a compact disc (CD) or digital versatile disc (DVD), or a magnetic storage device such as a floppy disk or magnetic tape. Other, non-limiting examples of computer-readable media include hard disks, read-only memory (ROM), and flash-type memories.","The term \u201cinstructions\u201d as used with respect to this invention generally indicates a set of operations to be performed on a computer, and may represent pieces of a whole program or individual, separable, software modules. Non-limiting examples of \u201cinstructions\u201d include computer program code (source or object code) and \u201chard-coded\u201d electronics (i.e., computer operations coded into a computer chip). The \u201cinstructions\u201d may be stored on any non-transitory computer-readable medium such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a flash drive, and in the memory of a computer.","(3) Specific Details","The large scale of microblogging activity has given rise to free-form discussions in which participants may join and leave at any time. Furthermore, for a given topic, many factors, such as news stories or region-specific interest, may drive new users to participate. For example, Romero, Meeder, and Kleinberg (see Literature Reference No. 4) noted that topical categories often have very different patterns in how information is shared in their discussions. However, it is often unknown what drives the discussion of a specific topic. That is, are specific people responsible for ensuring the discussion continues? Does geographic locality or specific related content, such as media generated from the continuous news cycle, drive discussion?","Described is a system and method for uncovering these conversation-driving entities based on a network analysis of the discussion. The system uses a novel graph methodology to represent the overarching discussion of a topic in microblogs as a graph with interconnected users, topics, locations, hashtags, and hyperlinks. The process then analyzes each entity in the graph in terms of its network properties to rank them by importance. A unique aspect of the system is using a network measure of closeness, which enables identifying not only the most important elements, but also the entities of secondary and tertiary importance from the other entities that do not drive the discussion. Furthermore, the methodology described herein is language-independent and enables real-time monitoring of changes to the discussion.","As shown in , a network  is constructed in which individual Tweets\u2122  link to four other node types: users , hyperlinks (URL ), hashtags , and locations . The users  node provides information related to who created and\/or mentioned the Tweet\u2122 . The URL  node provides information related to where the Tweet\u2122  is cited. The hashtags  node provides information related to how the Tweet\u2122  is annotated. A hashtag is a word or phrase preceded by a hash or pound sign (#) and used to identify messages on a specific topic. The locations  node provides information related to the location of the Tweet\u2122 . As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the node types and number that are used in construction of the network illustrated in  need not be limited to those described above. Furthermore, references to Tweets\u2122 and Twitter\u2122 are used as a non-limiting example of textual messages between users of a social network. Thus, references to Tweets\u2122 and Twitte\u2122 are used only for illustrative purposes, and the present invention is not intended to be limited thereto.","As new Tweets\u2122 are added to the network , nodes are generated based on the Tweet\u2122's content and are linked with existing nodes in the discussion. As the online discussion grows, the network  grows more connected to elements that are shared in common between many Tweets\u2122 . For example, a viral news story would generate a graph with many Tweets\u2122 102 pointing to the same hyperlink (URL ), and possibly to a Tweet\u2122  that was shared multiple times (i.e., retweet ), whereas a discussion from a single city would have many Tweets\u2122  linked to the same location . Importantly, this network  representation of an online discussion enables modeling of shared relations between the features.","For associating Tweets\u2122 with locations, a two-step process is used. First, approximately 1% of all Tweets\u2122 come with geo-coordinates, which allows one to accurately recover the location at which a Tweet\u2122 originated. For instance, the Google\u2122 Maps Reverse Geocoding service (developed by Google\u2122, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, Calif. 94043) can be used to convert geo-coordinates into a canonical city-level location name. Second, when geo-coordinates are not available, a method which looks into a user's profile for a location and uses that as the location of the Tweeted message can be followed (see Literature Reference No. 1). Location names from user profiles were further normalized to the same set of city labels. Furthermore, using the Tweets\u2122 with geo-coordinates as ground truth, the standard errors for profile-based location names were calculated, and those names with a median error above 25 kilometers were removed, ensuring a higher precision at the expense of recall. Ultimately, in experimental studies, approximately 32% of all messages were linked with a location.","To identify and rank the key elements of a discussion, the closeness value for each node is calculated. As a non-limiting example, the closeness of a node v is calculated according to the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"cl","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"v"}},"mo":"=","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603","\uf604"],"mi":"V"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["u","V"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["d","G"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["u","v"],"mo":","}}}}}}},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"sub":"G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","200","204","206","208"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B"]},"Specifically, using closeness provides two advantages. First, the distribution of closeness values allows for better separation of entities of secondary and tertiary importance (). In contrast, all entities but the few most dominant have low PageRank scores (), which makes them difficult to properly separate from other unimportant entities (not shown) that have similarly low Pagerank values. Second, the closeness values are much less sensitive to fluctuations in discussion frequencies (i.e., are more stable over time), which enables better temporal comparison of the relative importance of an item over time.","The invention described herein can be applied to any system that needs to identify features (i.e., discussion elements) that capture collective behavior for prediction. Additionally, the present invention has applications for programs that require finding what entities are most important in online discussions. For instance, a company could monitor the discussion around a new product line to estimate what drives the discussion of the product.","An example of a computer system  in accordance with one aspect is shown in . The computer system  is configured to perform calculations, processes, operations, and\/or functions associated with a program or algorithm. In one aspect, certain processes and steps discussed herein are realized as a series of instructions (e.g., software program) that reside within computer readable memory units and are executed by one or more processors of the computer system . When executed, the instructions cause the computer system  to perform specific actions and exhibit specific behavior, such as described herein.","The computer system  may include an address\/data bus  that is configured to communicate information.

The communication interfaces implemented by the one or more interfaces may include wireline (e.g., serial cables, modems, network adaptors, etc.) and\/or wireless (e.g., wireless modems, wireless network adaptors, etc.) communication technology.","In one aspect, the computer system  may include an input device  coupled with the address\/data bus , wherein the input device  is configured to communicate information and command selections to the processor . In accordance with one aspect, the input device  is an alphanumeric input device, such as a keyboard, that may include alphanumeric and\/or function keys.

In one aspect, the computer system  may include a cursor control device  coupled with the address\/data bus , wherein the cursor control device  is configured to communicate user input information and\/or command selections to the processor . In one aspect, the cursor control device  is implemented using a device such as a mouse, a track-ball, a track-pad, an optical tracking device, or a touch screen. The foregoing notwithstanding, in one aspect, the cursor control device  is directed and\/or activated via input from the input device , such as in response to the use of special keys and key sequence commands associated with the input device . In an alternative aspect, the cursor control device  is configured to be directed or guided by voice commands.","In one aspect, the computer system  further may include one or more optional computer usable data storage devices, such as a storage device , coupled with the address\/data bus .
