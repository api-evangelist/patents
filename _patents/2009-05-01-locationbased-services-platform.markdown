title: Location-based services platform
abstract: A platform for providing location-based services is disclosed. A location data collection client running on a mobile device periodically obtains data allowing determination of the geographic location of the mobile device (e.g., GPS, cell tower, or WiFi data) and transmits that data and mobile device-specific information to a location-based services (LBS) platform server. The LBS platform server determines geographic location of the mobile device from the received data. For example, the LBS platform server accesses databases associating latitude and longitude coordinates with cell tower data or WiFi data and updates mobile device location to maintain current location information for the mobile device, which can be used as a proxy for the location of a mobile device user. The LBS platform server further includes a set of APIs allowing third-party services providers to access to the location data.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Location-Based Services Platform Architecture","SUMMARY"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/050,180, filed May 2, 2008, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates generally to location-based services, and more particularly to a platform providing location data to third-party service providers.","Location-based services (LBS) make use of the geographical location of a mobile device, such as a mobile phone, to provide the mobile device with data relevant to the mobile device's geographical location. Providing LBS allows a third-party service provider or wireless service operator to deliver customized content to mobile devices. Data supplied via LBS may identify an entity, such as a person, business or other object that is near the geographic location of the mobile device, providing a mobile device user with data about the surrounding area. Additionally, LBS could allow movement of a mobile device over time to be tracked or transmission of information, such as notifications, alerts or coupons, to the mobile device when it is geographically near a specified location. The tracking of a device is generally used as a proxy to track a person or asset.","The location data determining mobile device geographic location may be obtained using various methods and maintained in different formats. Because of this, different wireless operators and third-party service providers differently calculate and maintain mobile device geographic location data. Additionally, privacy considerations regarding mobile device geographic location data may be affected by contracts, regulations or policies specific to different wireless carriers. Accordingly, mobile device geographic location data is generally separately calculated and maintained by different wireless carriers, requiring third-party service providers offering LBS applications to develop separate applications specific to different wireless carriers. This need to separately develop and maintain wireless carrier-specific applications hinders the development and adoption of LBS applications offered by third-party providers. Further because wireless operators generally do not provide location to Providers, Providers generally need to build location based applications in the form of software downloadable to the mobile device or through proprietary hardware. Providers must generally choose between using Location Data provided by wireless operators or Location Data extracted from the mobile device.","Embodiments of the invention relate to a platform for providing location-based services. A location data collection client running on a mobile device periodically obtains data allowing determination of the geographic location of the mobile device (e.g., GPS, cell tower, or WiFi data) and transmits that data and mobile device-specific information to a location-based services (LBS) platform server. The LBS platform server determines geographic location of the mobile device from the received data. For example the LBS platform server accesses databases relating geographic locations to cell tower data or WiFi data (e.g., by the MAC addresses of access points) and identifies latitude and longitude coordinates associated with the cell tower data or WiFi data. In an embodiment, the LBS platform server may also receive data allowing determination of the geographic location of the mobile device from additional sources, such as a hardware device or a wireless operator. The LBS platform server updates mobile device location to maintain current location information for the mobile device, which can be used as a proxy for the location of a mobile device user. The LBS platform server further includes a set of APIs allowing third-party service providers to access to the location data. Various applications are enabled by this platform, including pull models where third-party services poll the location data and push models where the server sends the location data according to predefined algorithms.","For example, an API stored on the LBS platform server allows a third-party service provider to retrieve a mobile device location from the LBS platform server in response to a data request or to determine other mobile devices or locations within a certain radius of the retrieved mobile device location. Another API stored on the LBS platform server allows the LBS platform server to push mobile device location to a third-party service provider when mobile device movement meets parameters specified by the third-party service provider or when the mobile device location is within a specified radius of another mobile device or specified location. In an embodiment, a third-party service provider may provide customized location logic to specify when mobile device location is transmitted from the LBS platform server to the third-party service provider. Additionally, the stored APIs may also include presentation or formatting layer, to simplify distribution of content or other data from the third-party content provider.","The Figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.","Embodiments of the invention may be implemented using various architectures, such as the example architecture illustrated in . In this embodiment, location-based services (LBS) platform comprises one or more mobile devices , a network , a location-based platform (LBS) server  and a third-party service provider . The LBS platform may also include a location database . While  depicts a single third-party service provider , in other embodiments multiple third-party service provides  are included in the LBS platform.","The one or more mobile devices  include onboard processing capabilities and data communication capabilities, such as Bluetooth, WiFi, RF, infrared and ultrasonic sound, as well as input\/output functionalities. For example, a mobile device  comprises a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, a smart phone, a navigation device or a laptop computer. However, a mobile device  may be any device capable of processing data and communicating data that can be moved between geographic locations, such as a watch or a car. The mobile device  also receives input from a user and presents output to the user. A mobile device  is described in more detail below in conjunction with . As further described in conjunction with , the one or more mobile devices  include a location data collection client  which extracts data from the mobile device. The extracted data may comprise global positioning system (GPS) data describing the latitude and longitude of the mobile device , cell-tower data identifying one or more cell towers that are geographically nearest to the mobile device  or data identifying one or more wireless access points geographically nearest to the mobile device . In one configuration the location data collection  extracts data from a location API executing on the mobile device  obtaining GPS data and\/or additional location data from the mobile device . In an embodiment, the location data collection client  also extracts data specific to the mobile device , such as a device type, a timestamp when data was extracted or an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number or other product key, such as IMEA number.","The network , which may comprise any combination of local area and\/or wide area networks using wireless communication systems, communicates data between the one or more mobile devices , the LBS platform server  and\/or the third-party service provider . In an embodiment, the network  uses a combination of wireless and wired communication systems to communicate data. To communicate data between the one or more mobile devices , the LBS platform server  and\/or the third-party service provider , the network  may employ a secure web service using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and\/or Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer (HTTPS). Alternatively, the network  may use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for data communication.","The LBS platform server  communicates with the one or more mobile devices  and\/or the third-party service provider  via the network . The LBS platform server  receives data from a location data collection client  running on a mobile device  and processes the received data to determine the geographic location of the mobile device  or extract data associated with the mobile device , such as device type or timestamp associated with data extraction. In an embodiment, the LBS platform server  communicates with a location database  which determines mobile device  geographic location from a location data collection client .","For example, the location data collection client  extracts data identifying one or more cell towers geographically closest to the mobile device . The data identifying the one or more cell towers is received by the LBS platform server , which communicates the data identifying the one or more cell towers to the location database  including latitude and longitude coordinates associated with various cell towers. The latitude and longitude coordinates of the one or more cell towers identified by the location data collection client  are transmitted from the location database  to the LBS platform server  to identify the current position of the mobile device . In an embodiment, the LBS platform server  or the location database  may use a reverse geo-coder to convert the latitude and longitude coordinates of the identified one or more cell towers as a street address, a city, a zip code or a country.","As another example, the location data collection client  extracts data identifying one or more wireless access point geographically closest to the mobile device . The data identifying the cell towers is received by the LBS platform server , which communicates the data identifying the one or more wireless access points to the location database  including latitude and longitude coordinates associated with various wireless access points. The latitude and longitude coordinates of the one or more wireless access points identified by the location data collection client  are transmitted from the location database  to the LBS platform server  to identify the current position of the mobile device . In an embodiment, the LBS platform server  or the location database  may use a reverse geo-coder to convert the latitude and longitude coordinates of the identified one or more wireless access points as a street address, a city, a zip code or a country.","Although shown in  as separate from the LBS platform server , in other embodiments, the location data base  is included in the LBS platform server  to allow local determination of mobile device  geographic location. For example, the LBS platform server  includes one or more databases associating latitude and longitude coordinates with various wireless access points or associating latitude and longitude coordinates with various cell towers.","As further described below in conjunction with , the LBS platform server  include one or more application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow integration of applications with the LBS platform server . The one or more APIs allow a third-party service provider  to access geographic locations of one or more mobile devices  from the LBS platform server , enabling the third-party service provider  to provide a mobile device  with content customized according to the geographic position of the mobile device . Privacy settings stored by the LBS platform server  may be used to regulate data about a mobile device  provided to the third-party service provider  by an API.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["110","110","210","220","230","240","250","260","270","110","110","110"]},"The processor , data store , and the power supply , such as a battery or any other suitable power source enable the mobile device  to perform computing functionalities. The processor  is coupled to the input device  and the output device  enabling applications running on the smart pen  to use these devices. In one embodiment, the data store  comprises a small amount of random access memory (RAM) and a larger amount of flash or other persistent memory, allowing applications, such as the location data collection client , to be stored and executed by the mobile device . This allows the location data collection client  to extract data from the mobile device  describing geographic location of the mobile device. The mobile device also executes an operating system or other software supporting one or more input modalities, for receiving input from the input device  and\/or one or more output modalities presenting data via the output device , such as audio playback or display of visual data.","The output device  may comprise any suitable display system for providing visual feedback, such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display. The output device  may also include a speaker or other audio playback device to provide auditory feedback. For example, the output device  may communicate audio feedback (e.g., prompts, commands, and system status) according to an application running on mobile device  using the speaker and also display word phrases, static or dynamic images, or prompts as directed by the application using the display. The input device  comprises any suitable device for receiving input from a user, such as a keyboard, touch-sensitive display or gesture capture system.","The communication module  comprises a wireless communication circuit allowing wireless communication with the network  (e.g., via Bluetooth, WiFi, RF, infrared, or ultrasonic). For example, the communication module  identifies and communicates with one or more wireless access points using WiFi or identifies and communicates with one or more cell towers using RF. In an embodiment, the communication module  also includes a jack for receiving a data cable (e.g., Mini-USB or Micro-USB). The GPS module  determines geographic location of the mobile device  by timing signals received from GPS satellites to calculate distance from the GPS module  and each GPS satellites.","The location data collection client  extracts data from the GPS module  identifying the geographic location of the GPS module  to identify the location of the mobile device . Additionally, the location data collection client  extracts data from the communication module  identifying one or more cell towers and\/or wireless access points geographically near the mobile device . Data extracted by the location data collection client  is transmitted via the communication module  to a LBS platform server  at predefined intervals. For example, at five-minute intervals, the location data collection client  transmits data to the LBS platform server  using the communication module . In an embodiment, the frequency at which the location data collection client  transmits data to the LBS platform server is increased or decreased based on different parameters, such as amount of movement by the mobile device , network usage, a specified maximum delay interval or use of mobile device  hardware. For example, if the power supply  operates at less than half of full capacity, the frequency of data transmission by the location data collection client  is decreased. , further described below, illustrates an example method for modifying the frequency of data transmission by the location data collection client  responsive to power supply  life.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["130","130","305","310","320","330","340","350","360","130","130","130"]},"The device identifier store  is a persistent storage device including one or more device identifiers. As used herein, a \u201cdevice identifier\u201d refers to a combination of a client identifier associated with a location data collection client  running on a mobile device  and a mobile device identifier, such as a serial number, IDMA number or other identifier associated with the mobile device. A device identifier is associated with a mobile device  running the location data collection client  to uniquely identify the mobile device  by including a client identifier associated with the location data collection client  and a mobile device identifier associated with the mobile device . For example, the client identifier is received by the mobile device  when the location data collection client  is installed, or when the location data collection client  is initially operated. This client identifier is combined with a mobile device identifier retrieved from the mobile device  by the location data collection client, and the client identifier and mobile device identifier are combined to generate the device identifier. In one embodiment, the device identifier store  restricts access to the device identifiers received from one or more mobile devices  running the location data collection client  to prevent entities other than the LBS platform server  from accessing the device identifiers. For example, third-party service providers  are prevented from accessing the device identifier store  to maintain the privacy of the identified mobile devices .","Similarly, the provider identifier store  is a persistent storage device including one or more provider identifiers that uniquely identify third-party service providers . When a third-party service provider  desires to provide an application or other content at least partially dependent on the geographic location of a mobile device , the provider identifier store  generates and stores a provider identifier uniquely identifying the third-party service provider . The generated provider identifier is also transmitted to the third-party service provider  and used to later request data from the LBS platform server . Maintaining separate provider identifiers and device identifiers allows the LBS platform server  to preserve the privacy of different mobile devices  while allowing a third-party service provider  to receive at least a subset of data associated with mobile devices .","Additionally, the third-party service provider  may also locally store and maintain a user identifier associated with different users of mobile devices  that receive content from the third-party service provider . While the device identifier stored by the LBS server  in the device identifier store  uniquely identifies a mobile device , the third-party service provider  locally maintains user identifiers describing different users who receive content from the third-party service provider . Because the third-party service provider  identifies individual users receiving content while the LBS platform server  identifies individual mobile devices  whose location is tracked, the third-party service provider  cannot use the device to obtain location data from the LBS server .","To communicate device location data to a third-party service provider , the LBS server includes a device-provider association table  mapping mobile device identifiers to provider identifiers. In an embodiment, the device-provider association table  also uses data from the third-party service provider , such as user identifier or other user data, to identify a mobile device  associated with a user of the third-party service provider . For example, the device-provider association table  associates a device identifier with a combination of a provider identifier and a user identifier from the third-party service provider . This enables the device-provider association table  to map a mobile device  to a particular user of the third-party service provider . In an embodiment, the device-provider association table  comprises a lookup table associating a device identifier with a provider identifier or associating a device identifier with a combination of provider identifier and user-specific data, such as a login, key, email address or other data used by the third-party service provider  to uniquely identify users. Additionally, the device-provider association table  may include permissions associated with different device identifiers limiting the data associated with a mobile device  that may be communicated to a third-party service provider .","To simplify exchange of mobile device  location data with a third-party service provider , the application programming interface (API) store  includes predefined APIs for providing subsets of data to the third-party service provider . In one embodiment, the third-party service server  includes a push API and a pull API. If the push API is used, the LBS platform server  transmits updated location information to a third-party service provider  when new geographic location data is received from a location data collection client  running on a mobile device . This allows the LBS platform server  to push updated location data to the third-party service provider  as a mobile device  changes location. In an embodiment, the location data communicated to the third-party service provider  is regulated by device-specific settings, such as permissions associated with a device identifier included in the device-provider association table .","For example, a permission associated with a device identifier specifies whether the location of the corresponding mobile device  is communicated to the third-party service provider  as latitude and longitude coordinates, street names, city name, county name or country name. Permissions associated with a device identifier also allow a user of the mobile device  to identify third-party service providers  are able to receive location information associated with the mobile device , allowing the user to regulate access to the location information. Additionally, a permission allows a user of the mobile device  to identify the granularity of the location information communicated to a third-party service provider . For example, a permission allows a third-party service provider  to receive latitude and longitude coordinates associated with the mobile device , while another permission allows a different third-party service provider  to merely receive data indicating the city where the mobile device  is located. An additional permission may allow a user to regulate the length of time that location data is communicated to a third-party service provider .","By pushing updated location data to a third-party service provider , an API allows the third-party service provider  to automatically provide content or applications when a mobile device  is near a specified location or other mobile device . In an embodiment, the push API may receive parameters from a third-party service provider  to transmit geographic location to the third-party service provider  when the parameters are satisfied, reducing the amount of communication between the LBS platform server  and the third-party service provider . For example, the push API communicates an update or notification message to the third-party service provider  when the mobile device  is within a predefined radius of an entity, such as another mobile device  or a specific location. As another example, the push API communicates a notification message to a third-party service provider  when the location of a mobile device  exceeds a threshold or when the location of the mobile device  changes at more than a predefined rate.","The pull API transmits the geographic location of a mobile device  responsive to the LBS platform server  receiving a request from a third-party service provider . The third-party service server  allows the third-party service provider  to determine the location of a mobile device  and provide content to the mobile device  customized to the geographic location of the mobile device . For example, the pull API allows a third-party service provider  to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates of a mobile device  the method used to calculated the latitude and longitude of the mobile device  (e.g., GPS data, cell tower identification, wireless access point identification, etc.), a timestamp specifying when the latitude and longitude coordinates were calculated and\/or geocoded data, such as a street address, associated with the latitude and longitude coordinates from the LBS platform server. As another example, the pull API allows a third-party service provider  to retrieve data from the LBS platform server  describing locations the mobile device  had previously accessed within a specified time interval, allowing the third-party service provider  to generate a history of mobile device  locations. As another example, the pull API allows the third-party service provider  to determine the current location of a mobile device  and identify locations or other mobile devices  within a specified radius of the current location of the mobile device .","In addition to the third-party service server , the LBS platform server includes an API generator  which allows a third-party service provider  to generate customized rules or parameters for receiving location data associated with a mobile device . While the Third-party service server  includes predefined APIs for performing predefined functions and returning predefined data, the API generator  allows a third-party service provider  to customize when location data is communicated from the LBS platform server  to the third-party service provider . Additionally, the API generator  allows a third-party service provider  to customize the format in which data is communicated to the third-party service provider . For example, the API generator  specifies that a street address describing the location of the third-party service provider  is transmitted to the third-party service provider .","The internal location database  comprises a persistent storage device, or combination of a persistent storage device and a non-persistent storage device, storing data received from location data collection clients  running on mobile devices  and stores data describing geographic location of the mobile devices . In one embodiment, the internal location database  stores latitude and longitude coordinates extracted from a GPS module  of a mobile device . Data in the internal location database  describing geographic location of a mobile device  is associated with a device identifier from the device identifier store  to create a pairing of device identifier and geographic location of the mobile device  associated with the device identifier.","However, because the location data collection client  extracts different types of data from a mobile device  for determining geographic position, data from the location data collection client  may be converted into latitude and longitude coordinates of the mobile device . For example, the location data collection client  extracts data identifying a wireless access point or cell tower geographically near the mobile device . The location calculator  converts received data into latitude and longitude coordinates using a variety of methods. For example, the location calculator  includes and retrieves the latitude and longitude coordinates of the cell tower or wireless access point received from the mobile device . In one embodiment, the location calculator  locally stores latitude and longitude coordinates associated with cell towers or wireless access points. Alternatively, the location calculator  transmits data to an external location database  which determines latitude and longitude coordinates and transmits the latitude and longitude coordinates to the location calculator .","Providing Location Based Services",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["140","130"]},"When the location data collection client  is installed on a mobile device  or when the location data collection client  is used for the first time on a mobile device , a client identifier is generated  by server and received  by the location data collection client  running on the mobile device . The client identifier uniquely identifies the location data collection client  running on the mobile device . The location collection client  then extracts a mobile device identifier from the mobile device , such as an electronic serial number or international mobile equipment identity number. The location collection client  then combines the mobile device identifier and the client identifier to generate a device identifier which is transmitted  from the mobile device  to the LBS platform server , where it is stored  in the device identifier store . Storing  the device identifier allows the LBS platform server  to subsequently identify the mobile device  running the location data collection client .","When a third-party service provider  requests access to the LBS platform server , a publisher identifier uniquely identifying the third-party service provider  is generated by the LBS platform server , stored in the publisher identifier store  and transmitted  to the third-party service provider . The third-party service provider  stores  the publisher identifier for later access to the LBS platform server . This allows the LBS platform server  to locally store device identifiers and publisher identifiers which uniquely identify mobile devices  and third-party service providers , respectively, communicating with the LBS platform server .","After transmitting  the device identifier, the location data collection client  extracts  data from the mobile device . For example, the location data collection client extracts  latitude and longitude coordinates from a GPS module  of the mobile device , extracts  data identifying a cell tower geographically near the mobile device  or extracts  data identifying a wireless access point geographically near the mobile device . However, these are merely examples of data extracted  by the location data collection client , and any data suitable for determining a location associated with the mobile device  may be extracted . Additionally, the location data collection client  may also extract  data associated with the mobile device , such as the device type, a timestamp identifying the time at which data was extracted or other data.","The extracted data is transmitted  to the LBS platform server  which uses the extracted data to determine  the location of the mobile device  and associated the determined location with the stored device identifier. For example, the LBS platform server  uses a location calculator  to determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of a cell tower or wireless access point identified by the extracted data. In one embodiment, the extracted data is transmitted  to the LBS platform server at a predetermined frequency, such as every five minutes. Alternatively, the location data collection client  modifies the frequency at which the extracted data is transmitted  based on characteristics of the mobile device , such as network usage or power supply  life. An example of modification of the transmission frequency is further described below in conjunction with .","The LBS platform server  then stores the determined location of the mobile device  in the internal location database , which associates the determined location with the device identifier. This allows the LBS platform server  to locally maintain record of the location associated with a device identifier. The mobile device location data stored in the internal location database  and associated with a device identifier may be accessed by the third-party application provider  for generation of content customized to the location of the mobile device .","For example, when a mobile device  requests  a service, such as an application or other content, from the third-party service provider , the third-party service provider  obtains location information associated with the mobile device  from the LBS platform server . The third-party service may be requested  by a mobile device user subscribing to the third-party service provider  or installing an application from the third-party service provider . In one embodiment, when the third-party service is requested, a mobile device user provides a user identifier, such as a username or email address, allowing the third-party service provider  to uniquely identify the mobile device user.","The third-party service provider  transmits  the publisher identifier of the third-party service provider  and the user identifier to the LBS platform server , which determines  the device identifier associated with the transmitted publisher identifier and user identifier. Using the device-provider association table  to correlate a device identifier with a provider identifier and user identifier pair allows the third-party service provider  to obtain location data from the LBS platform server  without accessing the mobile device . This increases the privacy of the mobile device .","After determining  the device identifier associated with the provider identifier and user identifier from the device-provider association table , location data associated with the determined device identifier is retrieved  from the internal location database . The location data associated with the determined device identifier is transmitted  from the LBS platform server  to the third-party service provider . In an embodiment, the Third-party service server  and\/or the API generator  specifies the format in which the location data is transmitted  to the third-party service provider . For example, the API generator  specifies when location data is transmitted from the LBS platform server  to a third-party service provider .","After receiving the location data, the third-party service provider  uses the location data to provide the requested service. For example, the third-party service provider  uses the location data to generate content, such as notifications, updates or coupons, associated with the device location. The third-party service is then transmitted  from the third-party service provider  to the mobile device . Various formats, such as text messages, email messages, web page updates or any other suitable format, may be used to transmit  the location data to the third-party service provider . Hence, the LBS platform server  and location data collection client  determine the geographic location of a mobile device , and the LBS platform server  allows a third-party service provider  to access the geographic location of the mobile device  without directly accessing the mobile device . This enables the third-party service provider  to incorporate geographic location specific features into its services while preserving the privacy of mobile device users by using the LBS platform server , rather than the mobile device , to disseminate location information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["130","110"]},"The LBS platform server  stores  a device identifier received from a mobile device  running the location data collection client  in the device identifier store . The device identifier comprises a combination of a client identifier generated by the LBS platform server  when the location data collection client  is installed or first run on the mobile device  and a mobile device identifier, such as an ESN or IMEI number, extracted from the mobile device  by the location data collection client . The device identifier uniquely identifies the mobile device  running the location data collection client . To allow a third-party provider  to access stored location data, the LBS platform server generates  and stores a provider identifier, which uniquely identifies a third-party provider , in the provider identifier store . The provider identifier is also transmitted from the LBS platform server  to the third-party service provider , so that subsequent communications between LBS platform server and third-party service provider include the provider identifier.","As the third-party service provider  allocates content, applications or other services on a per-user basis rather than a per-device basis, the third-party service provider  maintains user data, such as user identifiers, such as login name, email addresses or any other identifier that uniquely identifies a user. The user data and provider identifier is received  by the LBS platform server  to identify users of the third-party service provider . However, the LBS platform server  stores location information for different mobile devices  rather than for individual users. Accordingly, the device-provider association table  maps  a stored device identifier to the received user data and provider data. This allows the device-provider association table  to identify a mobile device , using the device identifier, corresponding to a user of the third-party service .","When the LBS platform server  receives  a request from the third-party service provider , including the provider identifier and user data, for a location of a third-party service provider user, the LBS platform server determines  the device identifier associated with the provider identifier and user data included in the request using the device-provider association table . Location data associated with the determined device identifier is then retrieved  from the internal location database  and communicated to the third-party service provider  according to an API included in the Third-party service server  or the API generator .","Updating Mobile Device Location",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":"110"},"After initial installation and upon activation, a location data collection client  extracts data from the mobile device , such as latitude and longitude coordinates from a GPS module , a location API on the mobile device  or identifiers associated with wireless access points or cell towers accessed by a communication module . At least a portion of the extracted data may be used to identify or calculation the geographic location of the mobile device . The extracted data is transmitted  from the mobile device  to a location based services (LBS) platform server  at a defined frequency, such as every five minutes. To conserve mobile device resources, such as allocated bandwidth or power supply life, the transmission frequency may be modified based on characteristics of the mobile device .","While the location data collection client  is running, the extracted data is used to determine  whether the mobile device  is stationary. The mobile device  is determined  to be stationary if the location of the mobile device has not changed during the prior three transmission periods. For example, if the mobile device  remains in the same location for twenty minutes and the transmission frequency is five minutes, the mobile device is considered to be stationary.","Responsive to determining  the mobile device  is stationary, the data transmission frequency is decreased . For example, the transmission frequency is decreased  so the extracted data is transmitted one hour later. The transmission frequency may be further decreased  if the mobile device  remains stationary. For example, if the mobile device  is still stationary after an hour, the extracted data is transmitted again after two hours and if the mobile device  again remains stationary, the transmission frequency is further decreased  so the extracted data is transmitted at four hour intervals. However, when the extracted data changes, indicating that the mobile device  has changed position, the transmission frequency is increased to its original defined value.","Responsive to determining  the mobile device  is not stationary, the location data collection client  continues to transmit  data according to the defined transmission frequency. The power of the mobile device  is also determined , and the data transmission frequency is modified  according to the determined power, allowing the data transmission frequency to be automatically decreased to conserve power. For example, if the mobile device power is determined  to be less than or equal to half of its full capacity, the data transmission frequency is decreased (e.g., data is transmitted at 10 minute intervals rather than 5 minute intervals). This allows the location data collection client  to modify data transmission to allow for accurate determination of current mobile device  location while efficiently using mobile device resources.","The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purpose of illustration; it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
