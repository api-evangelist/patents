{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention relates generally to the field of computer systems. More particularly, a system and methods are provided for producing a document formatted according to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), or another portable format, from an electronically stored original document, while preserving the visual presentation properties of the original document. Thus, the document that is produced retains visual presentation properties instilled by the document-authoring application used to create the original document.","As a result of the expanding mobile workforce, the proliferation of the Internet, the popularity of the World Wide Web, corporate and home based local area networks (LANs), and wide area networks (WANs), server and network based collaboration is increasingly being used to support collaboration within work groups as well as non-work-related groups.","Server and web-based collaboration can provide an individual a convenient and cost-effective means of sharing a document simultaneously with a group of people who may not be available for an in-person meeting. Often, attendees of a \u201cvirtual\u201d collaboration meeting utilize wired and wireless network-capable browser devices, such as thin-client terminals, to display a shared document from a server.","Thin-client browser devices can be advantageous in a collaboration system. They tend to provide lower technology costs, more reliable computing devices, easier to use interfaces, and lower maintenance requirements than a more complex client device such as a personal computer or a workstation.","Online document storage systems and many server based collaboration systems allow an individual to upload documents to a server or a secure DBMS (Database Management System) such as Oracle\u00ae Server by Oracle Corporation, where others can access them. Frequently, individuals create these documents to be shared using document-authoring applications such as Microsoft\u00ae Corporation's PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Project, Visio, etc.","Many document-authoring applications can generate documents with complex design, layout and visual presentation schemes. Individuals often expend a great deal of time and energy polishing the appearance of a document by adjusting the text arrangement, the background colors, the graphics and other visual presentation attributes of the document.","Unfortunately, some collaboration systems discard or alter visual presentation properties of an original document when preparing the document for collaboration. In particular, the original document may need to be presented on multiple types of devices having a range of presentation interfaces or display capabilities. The shared document may end up much less attractive and\/or understandable in comparison to the original document as viewed in the document-authoring application that created the original document.","Also, some collaboration systems rely on client-side document conversion or document presentation methods to allow a shared document to be viewed by the attendees of a collaboration meeting. This approach to collaboration necessitates a meeting attendee's use of a client-side personal computer or workstation rather than a thin-client device. Often, the necessary client-side software is only available for a specific computing platform or computer operating system, and, as a further inconvenience, each meeting attendee must install the software on the computer or workstation in order to view a shared document.","As a result, potential attendees of a collaboration meeting may not be able to participate if they do not have access to a personal computer or the required client-side software.","Thus, there is a need in the art for an automated method of producing a document formatted according to Hypertext Markup Language (or other transportable format), from an original document created with a document-authoring application that preserves visual presentation properties of the original document, without requiring specialized client-side tools.","In one embodiment of the invention, a system and methods are provided for producing a document formatted according to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) from an original electronically stored document. The produced document preserves visual presentation properties of the original document, as characterized by the document-authoring application used to create the original document. Generation of the HTML document, on a server, may be initiated by a document converter in response to a conversion request from a client or other server.","In one embodiment of the invention, a conversion engine, executing in a document converter, produces an HTML formatted document from an original document. The conversion engine calls upon a subset of the functionality comprising the document-authoring application that created the original document to generate one or more document fragments from the original document. The generated document fragments preserve the visual presentation properties of the original document, as defined by the document-authoring application used to create the original document.","The conversion engine, while maintaining visual presentation properties of the original document, assembles the generated document fragments into a browser-neutral document formatted according to Hypertext Markup Language. The document converter, as a reply to a user initiated conversion request, may generate a document conversion response.","In an embodiment of the invention, the document converter is implemented as a web service.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications of the invention and their requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","The program environment in which a present embodiment of the invention is executed illustratively incorporates a general-purpose computer or a special purpose device such as a hand-held computer. Details of such devices (e.g., processor, memory, data storage, display) may be omitted for the sake of clarity.","It should also be understood that the techniques of the present invention may be implemented using a variety of technologies. For example, the methods described herein may be implemented in software executing on a computer system, or implemented in hardware utilizing either a combination of microprocessors or other specially designed application specific integrated circuits, programmable logic devices, or various combinations thereof. In particular, the methods described herein may be implemented by a series of computer-executable instructions residing on a suitable computer-readable medium. Suitable computer-readable media may include volatile (e.g., RAM) and\/or non-volatile (e.g., ROM, disk) memory, carrier waves and transmission media (e.g., copper wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic media). Exemplary carrier waves may take the form of electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals conveying digital data streams along a local network, a publicly accessible network such as the Internet or some other communication link.","In embodiments of the invention described herein, systems and methods are provided for producing a document formatted according to Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), or some other transportable format, from an electronically stored original document, while preserving visual presentation properties of the original document, as characterized by the document-authoring application used to create the original document.","In an embodiment of the invention, the presentation format of a document may encompass external characteristics or visual presentation properties of the document including, but not limited to, content, design, foreground and background colors, images, margins, textual fonts and overall visual appearance. A presentation format of a document may be unique to a document-authoring application. A user may create and\/or modify a presentation format of a document by adding or changing content or images in a document, by setting textual font types, margins, etc., or by modifying a layout or organizational scheme of a document.","The storage format of a document represents a form in which a presentation format may be captured as an electronic image, including the originality and creativity of the document. A storage format may be determined by a pre-defined set of rules or specifications for a presentation format or a property of a presentation format.","A particular presentation format may be compatible with multiple storage formats. A document-authoring application, such as a word processor or spreadsheet, will often manipulate a storage format of a document by maintaining an electronic representation image of a document within a shared memory in a computer system as a document is created or modified.
