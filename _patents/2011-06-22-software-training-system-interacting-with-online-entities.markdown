{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  ","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/384,563, entitled \u201cSoftware E-Learning System Interacting With Social Network Applications Via An API,\u201d filed Sep. 20, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Some embodiments described herein relate generally to proctored e-learning systems, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for verifying that certain tasks, for which instructions have been provided via an e-learning training system, have been successfully completed.","Many known computer-based training courses are relatively static in nature, presenting the student with a set of slides or instructions directed towards the subject matter, such as, for example, the use of an online entity. Some known computer-based training courses, present instructions to maximize use of a selected social network, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc. Such courses do not, however, interact directly with the social network to track the student's progress towards goals, nor do they validate interactions performed by the student concurrently and within the social network itself. Thus, a need exists for improved online networking training systems that teach improved use of social networks, by integrating the training system with the social network itself through an Application Programming Interface (API) and\/or other available interface technology.","In some embodiments, a non-transitory processor-readable medium stores code representing instructions configured to cause a processor to send a first signal configured to cause a client device to display an instruction directing a user to perform an indicated task associated with a profile of the user, the profile associated with an online entity. The code is configured to cause the processor to produce a query formatted according to a predefined programming interface (e.g., an API) associated with the online entity, the query based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task. The code is configured to cause the processor to send a second signal including the query to at least one of the client device or a server device associated with the online entity. The code is configured to cause the processor to receive a third signal including a datum associated with the indicated task, the third signal formatted according to the predefined programming interface. The code is configured to cause the processor to update a status of the indicated task based at least in part on the datum, and send a fourth signal configured to cause the client device to produce an indication associated with the status of the indicated task.","In some embodiments, a training server associated with an online training course can be in communication with a client device and\/or a server of a third-party online entity (e.g., a social network). The training server can be configured to provide\/send website\/webpage content to the client device for display thereby. For example, the training server can send webpage content (e.g., Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) content, text, graphics, video and\/or other media content) for display by the client device (e.g., via a web browser application executing thereat).","In some embodiments, the training server can be any valid combination of hardware and\/or software (e.g., a web server and\/or application server) configured to: (1) track progress of one or more user accounts within one or more online training courses related to a third-party online entity; (2) provide web content including instruction regarding one or more training tasks related to the third-party online entity; (3) communicate with a client device and\/or server of the third-party online entity to determine, based on a common data exchange format, whether a user of the training course has successfully completed one or more indicated training tasks included in the training course and associated with a user profile\/user account associated with that third-party online entity; and\/or (4) produce a ranking of a user profile\/user account based on the information received from the third-party online entity. The third-party online entity can be any online entity, website, service, etc. configured to provide services, functionality and\/or connectivity to a user thereof. For example, the third-party online entity can be a social network service, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Orkut, etc. In other embodiments, the third-party online entity can be any suitable online entity, such as for example, SalesForce.com.","The client device can be any computing device (e.g., a personal desktop or laptop computer, mobile computing device, etc.) configured to connect to\/communicate with the training server and a server (or other device) of the third-party online entity. In some embodiments, the client device can execute and display a web browser application for interaction with by the user. The web browser application can be configured to exchange information (e.g., data packets, signals, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests\/responses, etc.) with the training server and\/or the one or more devices associated with the third-party online entity. The web browser application (\u201cweb browser\u201d) can be configured to display webpage content received from both the training server and the server of the third-party online entity, such that a user thereof may use the browser to (1) receive training task instruction included in the webpage content from the training server and (2) complete one or more training tasks via the webpage content from the third-party online entity.","In some embodiments, the web browser executing at the client device can receive and display webpage content received from the training server. The webpage content can include, for example, text, graphics and\/or other information associated with a training course based on the third-party online entity. For example, the webpage content can include information associated with a training course configured to instruct users thereof how to complete one or more training tasks associated with the third-party online entity. More specifically, the webpage content can include screenshots, slides, videos, images, text, interactive content and\/or other content designed to illustrate how the user can interact with a webpage\/web content of the third-party online entity to complete the one or more training tasks.","In some embodiments, the web browser can also display webpage content received from a server of the third-party online entity. The web browser can optionally display this webpage content in a same content pane, page, window, or tab as the webpage content received from the training server. For example, the web browser can display the webpage content received from the training server (described above) in a first frame\/portion of the web browser content pane, and display the webpage content received from the third-party online entity in a second frame\/portion of the web browser content pane. In this manner, the web browser can simultaneously display both training task information and a portion of a webpage of the third-party online entity at\/through\/via which the training task can be performed by the user. In some embodiments, the client device\/web browser can request and receive the webpage content associated with the third-party entity in response to\/based at least in part on one or more instructions (e.g., HTML tags) received from the training server (e.g., embedded within the webpage content associated with the training course).","Having displayed webpage content associated with both the training course (or specific task) and the third-party online entity, the web browser executing at the client device can receive one or more user inputs\/input signals directed at the portion of the web browser displaying the webpage content from the third-party online entity. Based at least in part on these received input signals, the web browser can send one or more signals (e.g., HTTP packets) to a server associated with the third-party online entity. In this manner, the client device\/web browser can execute\/perform\/provide functionality allowing the user to execute commands designed to complete a training task included in the training course. For example, the web browser can receive one or more user mouse-clicks, text inputs, etc., and can, for example, accordingly update social network profile information (e.g., profile photo, status message, contact list requests\/information, etc.) associated with a user account of the user associated with the third-party online entity.","The web browser executing at the client device can next receive, within the portion of the web browser displaying the training course information, one or more user inputs indicating completion of a specified training task associated with the training course. Based at least in part on this input, the client device\/web browser can accordingly send one or more signals, formatted according to an Application Programming Interface (API) of the third-party online entity, to a device of the third-party online entity. The one or more signals can include, for example, a query configured to determine whether the training task has in fact been successfully completed as indicated by the user. For example, the query can be configured to determine whether the user has successfully added a desired number of social network contacts, successfully uploaded a profile photo, etc.","In some embodiments, the one or more signals can include multiple different queries configured to result in the receipt of different data from the third-party online entity. The different queries can be collectively formulated and\/or formatted according to the API of the third-party online entity such that the aggregation of the different data resulting from the different queries can be used to determine the degree to which (or the effectiveness with which) the training task has been completed. For example, the different queries can be collectively configured to determine whether the user has successfully added a target number of social network contacts having a particular characteristic (e.g., being associated with a particular industry, having achieved a particular level of advancement, having a particular type of educational degree or the like). In this manner, the training server and\/or the system can produce a ranking of the degree to which the user is completing the training task and\/or the degree to which the user is applying the objectives set forth in the training task.","Although the client device\/web browser can send one or more signals, formatted according to the API of the third-party online entity, based at least in part on input received from the user, in other embodiments, the client device, web browser and\/or training server can send the one or more signals at a predetermined time. Similarly stated, in some embodiments, the \u201cpolling\u201d of the third-party online entity can be time-based rather than input-based.","In some embodiments, the time-based polling can include a series of signals each sent at a predetermined time interval after the previous query and\/or at a predetermined time interval after the delivery of the training task. This \u201cperiodic polling\u201d can be used, for example, to verify that the training task has been successfully completed after the training task and\/or training course has been delivered. For example, in some embodiments, the user may not complete a training task contemporaneously with the delivery of the instructions to the client device. In such situations, the training server and\/or the client device can periodically poll the third-party online entity to continually monitor whether the user has completed the training task. This arrangement allows the training server and\/or the client device to detect updates to the user's account associated with the third-party online entity that are made at a later time after the delivery of the training course and\/or that are made by the user through an interface other than the training interfaces described herein.","The web browser executing at the client device can subsequently receive a response to any of the above-described, API-based signals and\/or queries from a device associated with the third-party online entity. In some embodiments, the response can indicate whether the user has in fact completed the training task and\/or can include information sufficient to enable the web browser to determine whether the user has completed the training task.","Based at least in part on the received response, the web browser can display one or more messages and\/or media configured to indicate whether the training task was successfully completed. More particularly, in some embodiments, the web browser can display a notification stating whether the user has successfully completed the training task and a user interface through which user input associated the training task or a subsequent training task (e.g., the next task in the training course) can be received. Similarly stated, if the training task was successfully completed, the web browser can optionally receive a user input indicating a selection of a subsequent training task from the training course. If the training task was not successfully completed, the web browser can optionally receive subsequent user input within the portion of the content pane associated with the third-party online entity, the subsequent user input configured to complete the training task.","In some embodiments, a non-transitory processor-readable medium stores code representing instructions configured to cause a processor to send a first signal configured to cause a client device to display an instruction directing a user to perform an indicated task associated with a profile of the user, the profile associated with an online entity. The indicated task can include, for example, The code is configured to cause the processor to produce a query formatted according to a predefined programming interface (e.g., an API) associated with the online entity, the query based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task. The code is configured to cause the processor to send a second signal including the query to at least one of the client device or a server device associated with the online entity. The code is configured to cause the processor to receive a third signal including a datum associated with the indicated task, the third signal formatted according to the predefined programming interface. The code is configured to cause the processor to update a status of the indicated task based at least in part on the datum, and send a fourth signal configured to cause the client device to produce an indication associated with the status of the indicated task.","In some embodiments, a method includes sending a first signal to a client device enabling the client device to display an instruction. The instruction can direct a user to update a portion of the user's profile associated with an online entity. For example, the instruction can direct the user to add a certain number of new contacts having certain characteristics by a target date. A second signal including a query based at least in part on an identification of the user is sent to a server device associated with the online entity. The second signal and\/or the query can be formatted according to and\/or based upon an (API) associated with the online entity. A third signal including a datum associated with the profile of the user is received from the server device. The method further includes producing a ranking of the profile of the user based at least in part on the datum.","In some embodiments, a computer system for delivering a training program includes a memory and a plurality of modules configured to deliver the training program to a client device via a network operatively coupled to the computer system. At least a portion of at least one of the plurality of modules is stored in at least a portion of the memory. The plurality of modules includes a training module and a validation module. The training module is configured to send a first signal configured to cause the client device to display an instruction from the plurality of instructions. The instruction directs a user to perform an indicated task associated with a user profile associated with an online entity. The validation module is configured to produce a query formatted according to a predefined programming interface associated with the online entity. The query is based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task.

The access information can include, for example, an identification of the user's account with the third-party online entity and\/or an indication of the user's permission for the training server  to access the website server  to retrieve information from the user's account with the third-party online entity.","In some embodiments, the client device  can send a signal (not shown in ) to the website server  prompting the website server  to send a signal causing the client device  to render and\/or display an access webpage and\/or content associated with the third-party online entity. More specifically, the webpage and\/or content associated with the third-party online entity can prompt the user to authorize the training server  to access information associated with the user's account and\/or profile with the third-party online entity via the website server .  is a screen shot showing a sample access interface  displayed at the client device . In this example, the access interface  prompts the user to select a link , which causes a signal to be sent from the client device  to the website server . When the link  is selected, the website server  sends a signal causing the client device  to render and\/or display an access webpage associated with the third-party online entity. In some embodiments, the client device  can produce an indication verifying that the user has granted permission for the training server  to access the website server  to retrieve information from the user's account with the third-party online entity.  is a screen shot showing a sample verification notification  displayed at the client device .","Referring to , the client device  can send a signal  to the training server  via the public network . The signal  can include, for example, a request (e.g., an HTTP request) for webpage information associated with a training course, registration and\/or identification information associated with the user, or the like. In some embodiments, the signal  can be sent in response to a user input received at the client device  that indicates a request to commence activity within a training course associated with a third-party online entity. Similarly stated, in some embodiments, the signal  can be sent in response to input received via a user interface and\/or notification displayed at the client device  requesting that the user begin and\/or continue the training course.","For example, in some embodiments, after sending the registration information and\/or access information, as described above, the training server  can send a signal (not shown in ) causing the client device  to render and\/or display a training course webpage and\/or user interface configured to receive user input related to the training course and\/or task to be displayed at the client device .  is a screen shot showing a sample training course webpage  that includes a listing of training tasks and\/or courses  associated with the third-party online entity that are available from the training server . For example, the listing of training tasks  can include items such as adding an e-mail address (or other contact information) to the user's account\/profile associated with the third-party online entity, adding a profile photo to the user's account\/profile associated with the third-party online entity, updating the user's employment or education information in the user's account\/profile associated with the third-party online entity or the like. The training course webpage  includes an input element  (e.g., an on-screen \u201claunch\u201d button) through which the client device  can receive user input associated with a particular training task . This arrangement allows the signal  to be sent in response to the user input received via the input element .","Although the user input related to selection of a task is shown as being received via the training course webpage , in other embodiments, the user response can be received via a user interface displayed after the user has completed a first training task or course. Thus, in some embodiments, the signal  can include a request for information associated with a \u201cnext\u201d training task included in the training course, i.e., the next training task in the training course that the user of the client device  has yet to complete.","The training course webpage  also includes course status indicator , a training progress indicator  and an overall training status indicator . The course status indicator  indicates whether the user has started or completed a training task in the listing of training tasks. As discussed in more detail below, the training progress indicator  and the overall training status indicator  can indicate a percentage or portion of the training course or overall training that has been completed by the user.","The signal  can include any suitable information associated with a training task or course. For example, the signal  can optionally include information sufficient to identify the user of the client device , such as a username and\/or other credential associated with a user account of that user registered or recorded at the training server  and\/or the training database . Upon receipt of the signal , the training server  can determine which webpage information to send\/return to the client device  for rendering thereat\/thereby (e.g., via a web browser executing thereon). To do so, the training server  can perform a query (or multiple queries) based at least in part on a received user credential associated with the user of the client device . For example, the training server  can send one or more queries (not shown in ) to the training database  and receive corresponding information therefrom.","Having determined the appropriate webpage information, code and\/or content associated with the user of the client device  and the \u201cnext\u201d training task associated therewith, the training server  can send a signal  to the client device  (via the public network ). The signal  can be, for example, an HTTP response. Upon receipt of the signal , the client device  can render the received training course webpage information\/content received from the training server . More specifically, the client device  can render a portion of a webpage including training instructions associated with the next training task in the current training course.","In some embodiments, the signal  can include instructions (e.g., HTML and\/or other code) that directs the client device  (e.g., a web browser executing thereon) to request additional website\/webpage content directly from the website server  associated with the third-party online entity. In this manner, the signal  can include instructions configured to cause the client device  to render both training task information associated with the training course (sent directly from the training server ) and third-party online entity information associated with a profile of the user. Said differently, the instructions can include (1) information associated with a first user account of that user (the first account being associated with the training course), and (2) instructions configured to cause the client device  to request and receive information associated with a second user account of that same user (the second account being associated with the third-party online entity). In such embodiments, upon receipt of the signal , in addition to rendering training course webpage information\/content received from the training server , the client device  can also send a query (described below) to the website server  to request information associated with a profile (e.g., a social network profile) of the user.

For example, in some embodiments, the client device  can receive such an input signal via the input element  shown in . Referring again to , based at least in part on the received user input signal, the client device  can send a signal  to the training server. The signal  can include, for example, an indication that the training task has been completed by the user.","In response to the signal , the training server  can verify that the training task was, in fact, successfully completed by the user. Similarly stated, the training server  can monitor the effectiveness with which the training task as been completed. In this manner, the system has the capability to both deliver the instructions and proctor the user's participation in the training task to ensure that the objectives associated with the training task are met. In particular, the training server  can send a signal  to the website server  via the public network . In some embodiments, the signal  can include a query formatted according to a predefined programming interface associated with the online entity (e.g., the query can be an API-based query). The signal  and\/or query contained therein can be produced by the training server  based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task. Moreover, the signal  and\/or query contained therein can be configured to verify that information stored by the third-party online entity and associated with the profile of the user indicates that the training task has been successfully completed. For example, the signal  can include a query configured to verify that the user has successfully uploaded a profile photo, has added a new contact or target number of new\/total contacts, has completed a job description, education history, personal biography, etc.","In some embodiments, the signal  (or a corresponding series of signals) can include multiple API-based queries produced by the training server  to provide an indication of the status of the training task, the effectiveness with which the user has completed the training task or the like. Each of the API-based queries can include a request for different information associated with the user's profile on the third-party online entity. For example, in certain situations, the training server can formulate a series of API-based queries, the response to which can be cooperatively used by the training server  to determine not only whether the user has completed the training task, but also the degree to which (or the efficiency with which) the user has completed the training task. In this manner, the training server  can tailor the API-based queries and\/or the signal  to \u201cgrade\u201d the user's performance in completing the training task and\/or to produce a measurement of the degree to which the user is applying the objectives set forth in the training task.","The training server  can next receive a signal , including the requested information, in response to the signal  or series of signals (e.g., the API-based query or series of API-based queries). The signal , which is received from the website server , can include information or data associated with the user profile sufficient to enable the training server  to determine whether the training task was successfully completed, the degree to which the training task was completed, a ranking of the user's profile, or the like.

For example, in some embodiments, the training server can cause a client device to present a training course directing the user to complete a series of different tasks, the completion of which will result in a fully updated user profile. The training tasks can include, for example, instructions to add contact information to the user profile, add a photo to the user profile, updating the user's employment or education information in the user profile or the like. The training server can then produce a series of queries and receive data associated with each training task presented to a user. In some embodiments, the training server can produce a ranking (or grade) of the user's profile based on the number of tasks successfully completed.","The training server can produce a ranking (or grade) of the user's profile based on any suitable metric. For example, in some embodiments, the training server can receive a datum associated with a training task presented to a user. The training task can include, for example, instructions directing the user to add a target number of contacts to their user profile, and the datum returned by the online entity can include a current number of contacts included within the user's profile. In this example, the training server can produce a ranking (or grade) the user's profile based on a comparison between the current number of contacts and the target number of contacts.","In other embodiments, the training server can evaluate the user's profile to determine whether the user has successfully added a target number of social network contacts having a particular characteristic. Such characteristics can include, for example, whether the contact is associated with a particular industry, has achieved a particular level of advancement, has a particular type of educational degree or the like. In some embodiments, the training server can produce multiple different queries configured to result in the receipt of different data from the third-party online entity, which can be manipulated and\/or aggregated to grade and\/or rank the user's profile. In this manner, the training server and\/or the system can produce a ranking of the degree to which the user is completing the training task and\/or the degree to which the user is applying the objectives set forth in the training task.","In some embodiments, a training server can send one or more API-based queries and receive the corresponding data from an online entity, as described above, for a group of different users. The group of users can be, for example, the employees within a particular group. The training server can determine the effectiveness with which each user has completed the training tasks presented, as described above, and can \u201cgrade\u201d or \u201crank\u201d a user's interaction with the online entity relative to the other users from the group. In this manner, the training server can aggregate the results from the API-based queries to determine the effectiveness with which a group of users has completed the training task and\/or the degree to which the group of users is applying the objectives set forth in the training task.","In some embodiments the system can identify a supervisor or \u201cadmin user\u201d and provide to a client device associated with the supervisor one or more signals causing the client device to display the status, ranking and\/or profile grades for each user from a group of users.  are screen shots showing sample reports that can be displayed at the client device (e.g., client device ).","In some embodiments, a training server can aggregate the contacts associated with each user from a group of users into a signal social network that can be accessed by a supervisor, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/421,827, entitled \u201cSystems and Methods for Integrating Personal Social Networks Within An Organization,\u201d filed Dec. 10, 2010, which is herein by reference in its entirety.","Although the signal  (or a corresponding series of signals) is described above as being produced and\/or sent in response to user input received from the client device , in other embodiments, the signal  (or API-based query) can be produced and\/or sent at a predetermined time. Similarly stated, in some embodiments, the \u201cpolling\u201d of the third-party online entity can be time-based rather than input-based. In this manner, the training server (e.g., the training server ) can produce a status and\/or grade of the user's profile as a function of time.","For example, in some embodiments, the time-based polling can include a series of signals each sent at a predetermined time interval after the previous query and\/or at a predetermined time interval after the delivery of the training task. For example, in some embodiments, the training server  can send a series of signals  to the website server  each at a predetermined time interval after the previous signal in the series. For example, in some embodiments, the training server  can send a signal  including a query to the website server  every twenty-four hours after the delivery of the training task. In this manner, the training server  can continually monitor whether the user has completed the training task (or the degree to which the training task has been completed).","Such \u201cperiodic polling\u201d can be completed independently from the client device . For example, in some embodiments the training server  can periodically poll the website server  even when the training program is not being displayed (i.e., is not being executed on) the client device . In this manner, the training server can monitor the user's activity associated with the third-party online entity that is completed outside of the training system (e.g., in a manner not associated with the training webpage  and\/or the online entity profile page ), and can provide \u201ccredit\u201d to the user for such activity (e.g., by updating the user's ranking, as described herein).","In some embodiments, the periodic polling can continue until the training task has been successfully completed. Upon successful completion of the training task, the training server  can issue a notification to the client device  to notify the user that the task is considered as having been completed and\/or that the user's ranking has been updated. In other embodiments, the period polling can continue for a predetermined period of time (e.g., until the expiration of a training license, etc.).  is a flow diagram that illustrates a method of providing online instruction regarding an online training task associated with a third-party entity and verifying successful completion of the same via one or more API calls, according to an embodiment.","A training server can receive a request from a client device to commence or continue a training course associated with an indicated user account, .

A user of the training course can be associated with a user account pertaining to or associated with the training course (i.e., stored in one or more memories\/databases in communication with the training server). The user of the training course can also be associated with a social network account associated with the third-party entity. The request can be received from the client device via a network, such as a private network and\/or a public network (e.g., the Internet). In some embodiments, the request can be included in an HTTP request sent from a web browser of the client device.","The training server can send, to the client device, instructional content (e.g., web content containing instructional text and\/or media) related to a next training task for completion by the user of the user account, . In some embodiments, the instructional content can include one or more instructions configured to indicate to the user how to accomplish a specified task within the third-party social network (e.g., upload a profile photo, add a specified number of contacts, etc.) In some embodiments, the instructional content can be configured to be displayed in a portion of a web browser (of, e.g., a web browser module\/application executing at the client device), such as a content pane associated with the training course (e.g., the content pane  described in connection with  above).","The training server can optionally send, to the client device, additional instructions (e.g., HTML) configured to cause the client device to request, from the third-party entity, website\/webpage content related to the next training task, . For example, the training server can send, to the client device, one or more Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) included within HTML code received by the client device. Upon receipt of the HTML code, the web browser module\/application can accordingly request webpage content from the third-party social network based at least in part on the included\/embedded URLs. Based at least in part on one or more responses (e.g., HTTP responses) received from the third-party social network, the web browser application\/module can display, within a portion of the content pane associated with the third-party social network, a portion of one or more social network webpages. In this manner, the web browser can provide a means by which the user can interact with the third-party social network and provide user input configured to complete the training task described above.","The training server can optionally receive, from the client device, an indication that the training task has been completed, . For example, the training server can receive a signal from the web browser executing at the client device that includes an indication of one or more user inputs. The user inputs can indicate, for example, that the user has pressed a button, selected an option from a drop-down list, etc., indicating that the next training task has been completed by the user (e.g., based on one or more inputs\/actions taken within the portion of the web browser content pane associated with the third-party social network).","Based at least in part on the received indication described in step  above, the training server can next query the third-party entity\/social network website to verify that the next training task has been completed, . More specifically, the training server can send a request to a device (e.g., a server or database) associated with the third-party entity including a query associated with the next training task and the user account. The request can be formatted according to an API associated with the third-party entity, the API being defined to enable provision of data associated with the third-party entity (e.g., social network information, such as profile information associated with a user account). In some embodiments, the request can be sent directly to the device associated with the third-party entity (via, e.g., a public network such as the Internet and\/or a private network). In some embodiments, the request can be sent indirectly from the training server through\/via the client device, with the client device receiving an instruction to send\/forward the request to the device associated with the third-party entity. If the training server receives an affirmative (\u201cyes\u201d) response from the device associated with the third-party entity, the training server can proceed to step  described below. Alternatively, if the training server receives a negative (\u201cno\u201d) response, the training server can proceed to step , also described below.","If the training server receives a response\/indication that the next training task has in fact been successfully completed by the user, the training server can send, to the client device, an indication of the same, . For example, the training server can send a signal to the web browser executing at the client device such that the web browser displays a text, graphical, video, or other indication that the next training task has been completed. In some embodiments, the signal can be configured to cause the web browser to display (e.g., in the portion of the content pane associated with the training course) an updated training course progress indicator for the user account, indicating (e.g., indicating graphically, indicating via text, etc.) a portion, percentage and\/or amount of the training course that has been completed by the user of the user account. In some embodiments, the displayed information can include congratulatory text based on the user's completion of the next training task. In some embodiments, the signal can be configured to cause the web browser to display a UI component configured to allow the user to indicate a desire to view\/complete a subsequent training task associated with the training course and\/or a different training course. Although not shown in , in some embodiments, the web browser executing at the client device can receive an indication regarding the completion\/incompletion of the next training task directly from the device associated with the third-party entity, and can accordingly display text, graphics, etc., based thereon within portion of the content pane associated with the training course. The signal sent to the client device can be any suitable signal and\/or form of communication. As described above, in some embodiments, the web browser on the client device can display an indication associated with the signal. In other embodiments, the signal can be an e-mail, SMS or the like that notifies the user of the status of the training task. In some embodiments, the client device need not display the signal and\/or any content associated with the signal upon receipt of the signal.","If the training server receives a response\/indication that the next training task has not been successfully completed by the user, the training server can send, to the client device, an indication of the same, . More specifically, the training server can send a signal to the web browser executing at the client device including text, graphics, video and\/or other media indicating that the user has not successfully completed the next training task. Based at least in part on this received signal, the web browser can display, within the portion of the content pane associated with the training course, the received media and\/or indication. In some embodiments, the web browser can also display one or more UI components configured to allow the user to indicate a subsequent time that the next training task has been completed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0112"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["700","700","710"]},"A query formatted according to a predefined programming interface associated with the online entity is produced, . The query is based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task. In some embodiments, the query can be an API-based query or an \u201cAPI call,\u201d as described herein. In some embodiments, a series of queries can be produced.","A second signal including the query is sent to the client device or a server device associated with the online entity, . In response to the query, a third signal including a datum associated with the indicated task is received, . The third signal is formatted according to the predefined programming interface. In some embodiments, the third signal can be an API-based signal, as described herein.","A status of the indicated task is updated based at least in part on the datum, .

The second signal can be, for example, an API-based query of the types shown and described herein. In some embodiments, for example, a series of API-based queries can be produced and\/or sent to the server device.","A third signal including a datum associated with the profile of the user is received from the server device, . Based at least in part on the datum, a ranking of the profile of the user is produced, . In some embodiments, the ranking can be based upon a comparison between certain data within the user profile and a target provided in the instructions. In other embodiments, the ranking can be based on a comparison of the user profile to the profile of other users within a group.","Some embodiments described herein relate to a computer storage product with a computer-readable medium (also can be referred to as a processor-readable medium) having instructions or computer code thereon for performing various computer-implemented operations. The media and computer code (also can be referred to as code) may be those designed and constructed for the specific purpose or purposes. Examples of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media such as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as Compact Disc\/Digital Video Discs (CD\/DVDs), Compact Disc-Read Only Memories (CD-ROMs), and holographic devices; magneto-optical storage media such as optical disks; carrier wave signal processing modules; and hardware devices that are specially configured to store and execute program code, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), and read-only memory (ROM) and RAM devices.","Examples of computer code include, but are not limited to, micro-code or micro-instructions, machine instructions, such as produced by a compiler, code used to produce a web service, and files containing higher-level instructions that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example, embodiments may be implemented using Java, C++, or other programming languages (e.g., object-oriented programming languages) and development tools. Additional examples of computer code include, but are not limited to, control signals, encrypted code, and compressed code.","While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, not limitation, and various changes in form and details may be made. Where methods described above indicate certain events occurring in certain order, the ordering of certain events may be modified. Additionally, certain of the events may be performed concurrently in a parallel process when possible, as well as performed sequentially as described above. Any portion of the apparatus and\/or methods described herein may be combined in any combination, except mutually exclusive combinations. The embodiments described herein can include various combinations and\/or sub-combinations of the functions, components and\/or features of the different embodiments described. For example, a mobile device validation system can include multiple access servers configured to authenticate one or more mobile device users and\/or to validate one or more client mobile devices.","Although the online entities are described herein as being third-party online entities (i.e., an online entity that is separate from, distinct from and\/or not controlled by the training server), in other embodiments, an online entity can be associated with the training server. Similarly stated, in other embodiments an online entity can be controlled by and\/or managed by a party associated with the training server, or vice-versa. In yet some additional embodiments, the online entity can share common hardware with the training server. The training server, whether or not owned by the entity that is the subject of the training, can be integrated with the entity's systems or can communicate with the entity's systems by use, for example, of an API as described above. In embodiments in which the training server is integrated directly into the entity's systems, an API is not required. The various instructions and interactions between the client device and training server\/program, however, are functionally similar to that described above.","Although certain methods are described above as validating the completion of certain instructions associated with an online entity based on data received in response to an API-based query, in other embodiments, a status of a task can be updated in response to data received from a source other than the online entity. For example, in some embodiments, a status of a task can be updated base on a response received from the client device and\/or the user.","Although shown in  as being sent by the training server  in response to the signal , in other embodiments, the client device  can alternatively send the signal  in response to the received user input indicating completion of the next training task. For example, a web browser executing at the client device  can send, using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), the signal  to the website server  or another server associated with the third-party online entity (not shown in ). In such embodiments, the client device  can receive the signal  directly from the website server  and accordingly render an appropriate indication as described above, without receiving the subsequent signal  from the training server .","Although the training server  is shown in  as sending the signal  to the website server  via the public network , in other embodiments, the training server  can send the signal  directly to the website database .","Although the training server  is shown and described above as producing and sending a query (i.e., the signal ) based at least in part on an identification of the user and the indicated task, in other embodiments, the training server  can produce and send a query based at least upon additional data associated with the user. Such data can originate from any suitable data source, such as for example, the on-line entity that is the subject of the training task, another third-party entity (e.g., the user's employer, the entity that is subscribing to the training program on behalf of the user or the like) and\/or public databases. For example, in some embodiments, the training server  can produce a query based at least in part on the user's level of experience, position and\/or department within an organization. In this manner, the training server  can tailor the API-based queries and\/or the signal  to \u201cgrade\u201d the user's performance based at least in part on specific information associated with the user. More particularly, a user having limited experience and who is working in an entry-level department may have different targets and\/or thresholds for a \u201csuccessful\u201d completion of a training task than would a user having vast experience and who is working in an advanced department.","Moreover, in some embodiments, such additional data associated with the user can be used to select the next training task to be presented to the user. Thus, the training program for each user can be tailored specifically for that user, based on the additional data. For example, a training program may include different tasks related to different aspects of a third-party online entity based on the data associated with user. For example, certain users may have different privacy needs (e.g., based on their position within an organization, previous positions or the like), and may therefore require additional training tasks associate with privacy settings than would other users. In some embodiments, the training program can be customized automatically for each user based a rule set and the additional data.","Although the notifications and indications, such as, for example, the notifications shown in , are shown and described as being visual notifications produced by the client device (e.g., the client device ), in other embodiments, any of the notifications described herein can be rendered via any suitable type of output. Such types of outputs can include, for example, audible output (beeps, alarms, recorded voice outputs or the like) or haptic outputs.","Although the training webpages (e.g., the training webpage  and the training webpage ) are shown and described above as including a training page portion within which a training task is presented, in other embodiments, a training task can be presented by a client device in any suitable format. For example, in some embodiments, a training server can send one or more signals causing a client device to display a training toolbar through which one or more training tasks can be presented. For example,  is a screen shot showing a sample training toolbar  that includes a series of user input elements  associated with the training program. In use, when the user provides input via a one of the elements (i.e., the user selects an element), the training server can send one or more signals to produce a training page portion . The training page portion , which provides instructions as described above, can be rendered along with an online entity profile portion , thereby allowing the user to interactively complete the training task, as described above.","Although the system is described as interfacing with a particular third party site, in some embodiments, the training page can interface with multiple third party sites. For example, the training page may provide links to multiple different sites such that the user can navigate between different accounts, profiles, etc. in a single training session. In such embodiments, the user can navigate back and forth between profiles to perform various tasks (e.g., synchronizing contacts). As the training window persists, the underlying page (e.g., social network page portion) changes. Such workflow between various sites\/systems can prevent the need for multiple separate training interfaces."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 9 and 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 12 and 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIGS. 16-18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 22"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
