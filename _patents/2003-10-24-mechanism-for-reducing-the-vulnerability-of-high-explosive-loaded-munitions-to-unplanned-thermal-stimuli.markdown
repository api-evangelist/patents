title: Mechanism for reducing the vulnerability of high explosive loaded munitions to unplanned thermal stimuli
abstract: A new mechanism substantially reduces the vulnerability of explosive load munitions to thermal stimuli, such as fire or heat during transport and storage, thus enhancing personnel safety and the survivability of adjacent munitions. The mechanism includes a threaded fuze adapter made of plastic and having a melting temperature that is lower than the auto-ignition temperature of the explosive. The adapter secures a fuze or metal closing plug to an explosive loaded projectile and is designed to permit venting of combustion gases through the nose of the projectile upon auto-ignition of the explosive, thereby preventing detonation of the explosive and fragmentation of the projectile body. A plastic or metal ring is utilized to support the body of an explosive loaded projectile within a fiberboard packing tube, thus allowing the fuze to readily separate from the projectile body upon the melting of the plastic threaded fuze adapter and subsequent combustion of the explosive during an unplanned thermal stimulus event. An intumescent coating is deposited on the metal ammunition container that is used to package explosive loaded cartridges, to reduce the rate of thermal stimuli to the munitions, thereby ensuring that the plastic fuze adapter of the present invention reaches its melting temperature prior to the explosive attaining its auto-ignition temperature.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PREVIOUS APPLICATIONS","U.S. GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 10\/122,109 filed on Apr. 11, 2002 now abandoned by Roger Wong, et al. for Mechanism For Reducing The Vulnerability Of High Explosive Loaded Munitions To Unplanned Thermal Stimuli, which application itself claims benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of provisional application 60\/282,884 filed Apr. 10, 2001, the entire file wrapper contents of which applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth at length.","The invention described herein may be made, used, or licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.","The present invention relates in general to the field of Insensitive Munitions (IM) used by the U.S. Armed Forces, and it particularly relates to a new mechanism for reducing the vulnerability of explosive loaded munitions to unplanned thermal stimuli.","High explosive munitions are an essential part of the arsenals of armed forces. Logistic operations of the armed forces frequently involve the transportation of high explosive munitions from manufacturing plants to ammunition storage depots, Ammunition Supply Points (ASP) and magazines, throughout the world. For military sites located within a national boundary, ground transportation is preferred and commonly conducted by rail or trucking freight. For military sites located overseas, the transportation of munitions includes ships and airplanes.","Explosive loaded munitions are transported and stored in manners intended to minimize risks of accidental detonation. However, accidents such as an overturned tractor trailer, a train derailment, or a cargo plane crash can occur during transport of the munitions. In some instances, the ensuing fire and heat resulting from the accident could provide sufficient thermal stimuli to cause the munitions to detonate. In such an event, a chain explosion could result from sometimes a single munition explosion. To minimize such a risk of accidental explosions, the United States Department of Defense requires that all munitions and weapons withstand unplanned stimuli such as heat from fire, shock from blast, and impact from fragments and bullets. This requirement is termed Insensitive Munitions (IM).","To meet the Insensitive Munition requirement, munitions must pass Fast Cook-Off (FCO) and Slow Cook-Off (SCO) test requirements, as established by MIL-STD-2105B, \u201cMilitary Standard for Hazard Assessment Tests for Non-Nuclear Munitions\u201d. In a typical Fast Cook-Off test, the munition is engulfed in the flames of a jet fuel (or gasolene) fire exhibiting a minimum average temperature of 1,600\u00b0 F., to assess its response to rapid heating. In the Slow Cook-Off test, the munition is heated in a closed chamber at a linear rate of 6\u00b0 F. (or 50\u00b0 F.) per hour until a reaction occurs, to assess its response to gradual heating. The FCO and SCO tests are considered to be passed if the munition exhibits a Type V response where the test items only burn or scatter parts less 50 feet away from the burn pan or test oven.","It is a feature of the present invention to provide a new mechanism for high explosive munitions that substantially reduces the vulnerability of explosive load munitions to thermal stimuli such as fire or heat during transportation and storage, thus enhancing personnel safety and the survivability of adjacent munitions. Further, the munitions design of the present invention is capable of meeting the Insensitive Munitions requirements according to the MIL-STD-2105B specifications.","To this end, the new munitions design of the present invention incorporates a number of novel design features, including the following:\n\n","The foregoing and other features and advantages of the present invention are realized by a mechanism that incorporates the following design features such as a threaded plastic fuze adapter, an improved packaging tube with a support ring for the projectile body, and an intumescent coating deposition on a metal container holding the improved packaging tubes.","Similar numerals in the drawings refer to similar elements. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures might not be in exact proportion, and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","12","10","10","16","12","14","28","22","26","24"]},"The fuze  is generally a threaded body , with a tapered midsection  and nose . The fuze  of the explosive loaded cartridge  is secured to the threaded opening  of the projectile body  via the plastic fuze adapter . An exemplary fuze  used in conjunction with the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the Multi-option M734A1 fuze.","The aft section of the fuze body  is typically comprised of a threaded metal base , with a Safing and Arming (S&A) device (not shown), an explosive lead charge (not shown) and an explosive booster  within its interior volume. The S&A device, lead charge and booster  are designed to initiate and detonate the main charge explosive  in the projectile body . The S&A device generally holds a stab or electrically initiated detonator, which is \u201cout-of-line\u201d with the lead charge and booster  until the explosive loaded cartridge  has been fired from the weapon and the fuze  has armed. Following a firing of the explosive loaded cartridge , the armed fuze  detonates the main charge explosive , after it electronically senses or impacts the target. The ensuing explosion causes the projectile body  to break up into lethal fragments. The lead charge and booster  are typically made of a pressed explosive, such as Composition A5 (also known as COMP A5) and PBXN 5. PBXN-5 explosive is used for the booster  in the exemplary Multi-option M734A1 fuze because it reacts less violently than COMP A5 explosive when subjected to thermal stimuli. The threaded metal base  is engaged to the interior surface  (, B) of the plastic fuze adapter  of the present invention, which, in turn, is engaged to the threaded opening  of the projectile body , by means of its exterior threaded surface  (, B). When the fuze  is engaged to the projectile body , the booster  is situated immediately adjacent to the main charge explosive  inside the projectile body .","A plurality of slots  are typically formed on the exterior surface of the fuze body , at the base of the tapered midsection . The slots  are designed to accept a wrench or fork-shaped tool for assembling the fuze  to the projectile body . A metal, U-shaped clip  () is commonly inserted into the slots , to support an explosive loaded cartridge  within a fiberboard packaging tube  (). The metal packing clip  () is not utilized when the explosive loaded cartridge  is packaged in an improved fiberboard packaging tube  () of the present invention, which will be a subject for a further description in subsequent details.","The tapered midsection  and nose  of the fuze body  generally house the mechanical and\/or electronic components that initiate the detonator in the S&A device after the fuze  electronically senses or impacts the target. An electronic, radio frequency (RF) transceiver\/firing circuit board and a turbine alternator are housed under the truncated, conical shaped, metallic windshield and plastic nose assembly of the exemplary Multi-option M734A1 fuze.","Referring now to , the threaded fuze adapter  of the present invention is generally made of a cylindrical ring  having a threaded interior surface  as well as a threaded exterior surface . The fuze adapter  attaches the fuze  to the projectile body  by means of its interior and exterior threaded surfaces , . As used in conjunction with the exemplary 60 mm M720E1 cartridge, the threaded fuze adapter  has a nominal inside thread diameter (I.D.) of 1\u00bd inches, nominal outside thread diameter (O.D.) of 1 11\/16 inches and a length (L) of approximately 0.64 inch.","The threaded fuze adapter  is made of a material, e.g. an ionomer plastic, having a melting temperature sufficiently below the auto-ignition temperature of the main charge explosive  in the projectile body . A typical melting point of the fuze adapter material would be about 200\u00b0 F. For the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge, a FORMIONFl-120 plastic is utilized. During an unplanned thermal stimulus such as an exposure to external heat or fire source, the threaded fuze adapter  is melted upon reaching its melting temperature prior to the main charge explosive  reaching its auto-ignition temperature. Upon melting of the threaded fuze adapter , the fuze  is no longer physically secured to the projectile body , thereby enabling the fuze  to freely separate from the projectile body . As the thermal stimulus continues to heat the explosive loaded cartridge , the main charge explosive  begins to burn upon reaching its auto-ignition temperature. The burning explosive  produces combustion gas, which generates pressure within the internal volume of the projectile body . As the gas pressure begins to build, the fuze  is expelled from the projectile body , thereby enabling the combustion gas to pass through and out the threaded opening . Venting of the combustion gas and relief of the internal pressure prevents the burning reaction of the main charge explosive  from developing into an uncontrolled detonation and fragmenting the projectile body . Thus, the threaded fuze adapter  enhances personnel safety and the survivability of adjacent munitions in a fire, by preventing accidental explosion and fragmentation of an explosive loaded cartridge .","The projectile body  is generally made of a forged, high fragmenting, steel alloy shell. The thickness of the projectile body  is roughly 3\/16 inch to \u00bc inch. The ogival shape of the projectile body  is designed to reduce the aerodynamic drag on the explosive loaded cartridge  during flight. Approximately mid position of the projectile body , an obturating ring  is circumferentially fitted within an external groove. During launch, the obturating ring  expands to seal the high pressure, propellant combustion gas behind the projectile body  as it travels up the mortar barrel. The sealing action allows the explosive loaded cartridge  to be propelled the maximum distance downrange. The projectile body  has a threaded opening , which accepts the fuze  via the threaded fuze adapter  and allows the main charge explosive  to be loaded therein. The projectile body  connects to the tail fin  via a threaded boss  located at the aft end.","With more specific reference to , the main charge explosive  is typically a melt-castable explosive such as Composition B (also known as COMP B) and PAX-21. PAX-21 explosive is used in the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge because of its reduced shock sensitivity and predictable behavior in unconfined burns. COMP B explosive and PAX-21 explosive have auto-ignition temperatures of about 380\u00b0 F. and 314\u00b0 F., respectively. As used herein, auto-ignition temperature means a temperature at which the explosive  starts to combust upon subject to thermal stimuli.","The tail section  of the explosive loaded cartridge  is comprised of a tail fin , a propelling charge  and an ignition cartridge . The tail fin  generally consists of a plurality of fin blades attached to a cylindrical boom which assembles to the projectile body . The fin blades are circumferentially attached to the boom at equal angular spacing and are generally trapezoidal shaped with rounded corners. The tail fin  provides the necessary stability control to maintain a proper flight path of the explosive loaded cartridge  to the target. An exemplary tail fin  used in conjunction with the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the six bladed, aluminum alloy M27 fin. The propelling charge  is fitted onto the boom of the tail fin , between the fin blades and projectile body . The ignition cartridge  is housed within the boom of the tail fin , opposite the end that assembles to projectile body . A plurality of vent holes  extending through the boom of the tail fin  enables the ignition cartridge  to ignite the propelling charge .","The propelling charge  is generally comprised of horseshoe shaped, containers filled with a propellant charge . Typically, the containers are made of a combustible, felted fiber material and the propellant charge  is a single or double based propellant. An exemplary propelling charge  used in conjunction with the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the four-increment, M235 propelling charge.","The ignition cartridge  is designed to function and ignite the propelling charge  when the explosive loaded cartridge is fired from the weapon. It typically has a percussion primer , black powder pellet and a propellant charge therein. An exemplary ignition cartridge  used in conjunction with the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the M702 ignition cartridge. The explosive loaded cartridge  is fired from the weapon by loading it, tail section  first, into the muzzle of the mortar barrel. Upon release, it slides down the barrel and impacts a firing pin at the bottom. The firing pin strikes and initiates the percussion primer  of the ignition cartridge . The percussion primer  initiates the black powder pellet, which in turn ignites the propellant charge contained within the ignition cartridge . The hot combustion gas and flame from the ignition cartridge flashes through the vent holes  in the fin boom and ignites the propelling charge . The combustion gas pressure generated by the ignition cartridge  and propelling charge  propels the explosive loaded cartridge  up the barrel and out to the target. In order for the threaded fuze adapter  to function as described earlier upon an occurrence of a thermal stimulus, an improved packaging method for the explosive loaded cartridge  is provided by the present invention. To understand the need for a new packaging method of the present invention, it might be beneficial to describe a conventional munition packaging method according to a prior art.","With reference to , a conventional packaging method for the explosive loaded cartridge  includes a fiberboard tube  and a U shaped, metal support clip . The fiberboard tube  is generally made of a cylindrical casing with a stationary end cap  and a removable end cap . The explosive loaded cartridge  is encased within the fiber tube  and is positively restrained by the metal support clip  attached to the fuze  via the wrench slots . A small gap exists between the fuze  of the explosive loaded cartridge  and the stationary end cap . In the event of an unplanned thermal stimulus, the metal support ring  and stationary end cap  would restrain the fuze  in place and prevent the release of the fuze  upon a melting of the threaded fuze adapter . The pressure generated by the combustion gas upon the ignition of the main charge explosive  would build up and might not be sufficiently relieved from the broken joint resulting from the threaded fuze adapter , thus causing a potential detonation of the explosive loaded cartridge  with an ensuing fragmentation of the projectile body .","With reference to , it illustrates an improved packaging enclosure  according to the present invention; the explosive loaded cartridge  is encased within a fiberboard tube . An exemplary fiberboard tube  for use with the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the PA  fiber tube. The fiberboard tube  is generally made of a cylindrical casing with a stationary end cap  and a removable end cap . The tail fin  of the explosive loaded cartridge  is positioned against the removable end cap , thus enabling the explosive loaded cartridge  to be loaded or removed in a rearward manner.","The fiberboard tube  has an overall length sufficiently greater than the length of the explosive loaded cartridge  such that a sufficient space  exists between the tip of the nose  of the fuze  and the stationary end cap . A support ring  provides a positive restraint of the explosive loaded cartridge .","With further reference to , B, C, the support ring  is attached to the fiberboard tube  and engaged with the explosive loaded cartridge  in the ogive region of the projectile body . The support ring  is generally formed of a plastic cylindrical shell  with a circular flange  that is peripherally located along the mid section of the cylindrical shell  of the support ring .","When used for supporting the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge, the cylindrical shell  typically has a nominal inside diameter (I.D.) of approximately 2.15 inch, and a length of approximately 0.875 inch. The outer surface of the cylindrical shell  is generally 2.40 inches in diameter. The inner surface of the cylindrical shell  is comprised of a straight surface  and two tapered surfaces .","The straight inner surface  spans approximately one third the length of the cylindrical shell , while the tapered inner surfaces  occupies the remaining length of the cylindrical shell . The tapered inner surface  has a taper that is generally conforms to the curvature of the projectile body  at the point of contact there between to provide a positive restraint of the explosive loaded cartridge  within the fiberboard tube . When used for supporting the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge, the tapered inner surface  has a taper angle (T) of approximately 70.","The circular flange  is generally formed on the outer surface of the cylindrical shell  at the mid length. When used for supporting the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge, the flange  has a thickness of about 0.125 inch and an outer diameter of 2.69 inches. The flange  is designed to secure the support ring  to the fiberboard tube .","In a manner of the storage of the explosive loaded cartridge  in the fiberboard tube  as illustrated in , in the event of an unplanned thermal stimulus, upon the melting of the threaded fuze adapter , the space  enables the fuze  to freely and completely separate from the projectile body , thereby enabling the threaded fuze adapter  to achieve its fullest function as intended.","With reference to , a plurality of fiberboard tubes  each containing an explosive loaded cartridge  are packaged inside a metal ammunition container . An exemplary metal ammunition container  for storing the exemplary 60 mm M720A1 cartridge is the PA  metal container, which holds eight of the explosive loaded cartridges  packaged inside fiber tubes .","A further novelty of the present invention is an intumescent coating  deposited onto the exterior or interior surface of the metal ammunition container . The intumescent coating  is typically used in the construction industry to protect structural members such as steel beams in fires.","In the event of an unplanned thermal stimulus such as an external heat or fire source, the intumescent coating  on the metal ammunition container  insulates the fiberboard tubes  and the explosive loaded cartridges  packaged therein from the fire, and further abates the rate of heating of the explosive loaded cartridges . The gradual heating inside the metal ammunition container  ensures that the threaded fuze adapter  reaches its melting temperature prior to the main charge explosive  reaching its auto-ignition temperature, thus preventing an accidental detonation of the explosive loaded cartridge .","It should be understood that the geometry, compositions, and dimensions of the elements described herein can be modified within the scope of the invention and are not intended to be the exclusive; rather, they can be modified within the scope of the invention. Other modifications can be made when implementing the invention for a particular environment."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The features of the present invention and the manner of attaining them, will become apparent, and the invention itself will be understood by reference to the following description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIGS. 6A","FIG. 6A","FIG. 5","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6B"],"b":["6","6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 7A and 7B","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
