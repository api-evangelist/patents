title: Method and apparatus for authenticating a digital certificate status and authorization credentials
abstract: A relying party obtains a certificate of a certificate subject and acquires a status information object for the certificate. The relying party validates the certificate using information in the status information object and compares authorization attributes present in the status information object with policy attributes associated with the requested service. A policy attribute is a set of constraints used by the relying party to determine if the authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject are sufficient to allow the certificate subject to access the requested service. If the authorization attributes present in the status information object match the policy attributes associated with the requested service, the relying party may grant the certificate subject access to the requested service.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to authenticating digital certificates and more particularly to providing a cost effective manner for authenticating both an identity certificate and an authorization attribute presented by a certificate subject.","Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provides a protocol for implementing authentication using public key cryptography. PKI allows for asymmetric cryptography, wherein different keys are used for encryption and decryption. In particular, a pair of keys, one public and one private is generated for each user for encryption and decryption. To ensure the trustworthiness of public\/private keys, certificate authorities (CA) issue digital key certificates. The digital key certificates are digitally signed by the CA to guarantee that an individual providing a digital certificate (also simply referred to herein as certificate) is, in fact, who the individual claims to be. Each digital key certificate includes, among other information, a name of a certificate subject, a serial number, an expiration date, the certificate subject's public key, and the digital signature of the issuing CA. The certificate subject is an entity for which the content of the certificate applies. It is understood that by issuing the certificate, the issuer of the certificate is asserting through the certificate that the content of the certificate applies to the certificate subject. Thereafter, when the certificate subject presents the certificate to relying parties, the relying parties can authenticate the identity of the certificate subject. When the relying party needs to identify a certificate subject, it will perform an activity commonly referred to an authentication. When the relying uses digital certificates to authenticate the certificate subject, the authentication process typically involves two main steps, validating the certificate subject's certificate, and verifying the certificate subject has access to a private key associated with the certificate subject's certificate. This second step is commonly done by validating the certificate subject's signature on various data originated in part by the relying party and subsequently signed by the certificate subject with the private key associated with the certificate subject's certificate.","Digital certificates may need to be revoked prior to expiry. For example, if the certificate subject ceases to be trusted, perhaps because the attributes included in the certificate have changed, or if the certificate subject's private key is stolen or otherwise compromised, signatures made by the certificate subject's private key can no longer be trusted and so the certificate must be revoked. The revoked certificate is published in a certificate status information database, such as a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). When a relying party uses the certificate to authenticate a certificate subject, the relying party may determine the revocation status of the certificate by directly accessing the certificate status information database, such as the CRL or by using an online certificate status protocol (OCSP) or a Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP).","Determining the revocation status of a certificate is commonly referred to as determining the status of the certificate, therefore the terms revocation status, status and certificate status are used synonymously herein. Certificate validation commonly refers to a process where the statuses of multiple certificates in a chain are determined. The result of certificate validation is presented in a certificate validation information object that includes an indication of whether to accept or reject the certificate being validated. The process of certificate validation is equivalent to determining the certificate status when there is only one certificate in a chain. The phrase of \u201cdetermining certificate status\u201d includes functions for determining the certificate validation information object. The phrase \u201ccertificate status\u201d includes the status of individual certificates, the status of multiple certificates in a chain, or the certificate validation information object.","The certificate subject may request services offered by the relying party. When the certificate subject requests a service from the relying party, the relying party verifies that authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject match the authorization attributes associated with the requested service. Authorization attributes can be encoded in many forms. For example, authorization attributes may take the form of a predefined Object ID (OID), where multiple parties in a domain have been configured to know that each OID value corresponds to an authorized service or set of services. The OID may take the form of a string of numbers such as 1.2.3.4. When OIDs are represented as a string of numbers it may be known that if, for example, 1.2.3 is authorized for a given certificate subject then 1.2.3.X is also authorized for that certificate subject. Authorization attributes may also take the form of, for example, an index into a table of authorized services, a function name, a role name or identifier, a user name, an X500 Distinguished Name component, a DNS Fully Qualified Domain Name or a component thereof, an IP address or protocol port identifier.","If the certificate subject's authorization attributes match those associated with the requested service, the relying party grants the certificate subject access to the requested service. A match between certificate subject's authorization attributes and the authorization attributes associated with the requested service does not imply that they are identically equal. The relying party could implement at least one predefined rule that determines what is considered as a match and what is not considered as a match. For example, the rule may indicate that a certificate subject's attribute within a predefined range is considered a match with authorization attributes associated with a requested service; a certificate subject's attribute below or above a certain threshold is considered a match with authorization attributes associated with a requested service; a parameter with a particular bit-set is considered a match with the authorization attributes associated with a requested service; and\/or the presence or absence of a certain limiting parameter is considered a match with the authorization attributes associated with a requested service.","In some cases the certificate subject's authorization attributes may be included in the digital certificate such that the digital certificate includes an identity attribute that identifies the certificate subject and authorization attributes that identify the certificate subject's privileges. In successfully authenticating the digital certificate, the relying party may therefore be assured of both the identity and authorization attributes of the certificate subject. However, identity and authorization attributes are typically incompatible because the identity attribute is intended to last for a longer time period than authorization attributes, which inherently need to change whenever the privileges of the certificate subject change. By including the authorization attributes into the identity certificate, the certificate subject is required to acquire a new identity certificate whenever the authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject change. Acquiring the identity certificate more often than needed can raise the cost of operating the PKI.","Alternatively, the authorization attribute may be separated from the identity certificate; i.e., the authorization attribute is included in an attribute certificate. One advantage of this approach is that the identity certificate does not need to be updated every time the authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject changes. However, an entirely new system of certificate management is required to manage the attribute certificate.","As an alternative, some organizations use PKI for identity authentication and use a backend server for validating the authorization attributes. Typically, the backend server includes a list of roles with which the certificate subject is associated. These roles are transmitted to the relying party authenticating the certificate subject for the relying party to use in determining which, if any, of the offered services the certificate subject is authorized to access. All of the alternatives presented above require that when the relying party is authenticating the identity and authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject, the relying party must be connected to both the PKI and the attribute certificate management infrastructure. The attribute certificate management infrastructure may include an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server, or a Domain Controller.","To eliminate the need for connectivity with the PKI when the relying party is authenticating the certificate subject's identity, one approach allows for each certificate subject to periodically acquire its status from the CRL or to obtain an OCSP status for its certificate from an OCSP server. Thereafter, when presenting its digital certificate to the relying party for authentication, the certificate subject provides a cached copy of its CRL status or the OCSP status to the relying party. If the relying party determines through validation policies the status information is sufficiently current, the relying party may accept the certificate as valid. This approach ensures that the certificate identity status is highly available but it does not provide an avenue for the relying party to validate authorization credentials presented by the certificate subject without connectivity to the attribute certificate management infrastructure.","Accordingly, a method is needed to easily and affordably authenticate both the identity and the authorization attributes of the certificate subject, without requiring connectivity to back-end infrastructure during authentication.","Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of embodiments of the present invention.","The apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.","Some embodiments are directed to methods and apparatuses for determining an authorization status for a requested service. A relying party obtains a certificate of a certificate subject and acquires a status information object for the certificate. The relying party validates the certificate using information in the status information object and compares authorization attributes present in the status information object with policy attributes associated with the requested service. A policy attribute is a set of constraints used by the relying party to determine if the authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject are sufficient to allow the certificate subject to access the requested service. If the authorization attributes present in the status information object match the policy attributes associated with the requested service, the relying party may grant the certificate subject access to the requested service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","108","102","108","102"]},"Although only one CA  is shown in  for ease of illustration, more than one CA may be included in a PKI. CA  may be a commercial CA which issues certificates that may be trusted by web browsers used by the general public or CA  may be associated with a domain, an organization, or government entity, for example. When more than one CA is included in the PKI, trust relationships may exist between the CAs.","In public key cryptography, a private key associated with the public key is known only to certificate subject . The corresponding public key is made publicly available (as part of the digital certificate) and is stored in a publicly accessible repository . Certificate subject  may thereafter use the private key to decrypt data that another party has encrypted with the certificate subject's public key obtained from repository . In addition to encrypting messages (which ensures privacy), certificate subject  can use the private key to digitally sign information before it is transmitted to another party. Another party may then verify certificate subject  digital signature using certificate subject  certificate.","Certificate subject  may be authorized to access certain services offered by a relying party. The attributes associated with authorized credentials\/privileges may be included in the digital certificate assigned to certificate subject . When the relying party receives a digital certificate with information associated with certificate subject , the relying party authenticates both the identity of certificate subject  and the authorization attributes presented in the digital certificate.","The functions of CA , the relying party, and certificate subject  are implemented by processors included in, for example, personal computers, servers, or smart phones that are configured to process data. Therefore, the operations discussed herein as being performed by CA , the relying party, and certificate subject  are implemented on the associated processors of CA , the relying party, and certificate subject .","Digital certificates may be revoked, and a revoked certificate may be published in a certificate status information database . Certificate status information database  may be, for example, a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), a database access by an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server, or a server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) source. The scope of the discussion herein is applicable to any source of certificate status information. An OCSP server or validating server referred to herein is typically a general purpose server configured to provide certificate status information, including CRL, OCSP responses, or SCVP responses. An OCSP request referred to herein may be any generic request for certificate status information and an OCSP response referred to herein may be any generic response containing certificate status information. At regular intervals, CA  updates certificate status information database  and issues an updated certificate status information database which includes a list of revoked certificates. A recent certificate status information database for CA  must be checked as part of the digital certificate validation process.","To facilitate authentication of the certificate subject's identity and authorization attributes without requiring that the relying party be connected to backend infrastructure, in an embodiment, certificate subject  is configured to periodically obtain its certificate status and associated authorization attributes. In particular, certificate subject  sends a status request to, for example, an OCSP server . OCSP server  queries certificate status information database  to determine if the digital certificate has been revoked. OCSP server  also queries authorization attributes with an authorization database . Authorization database  may be, for example, an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server that handles user requests for access to computer resources. The AAA server may also provide authentication, authorization, and accounting services for enterprise users.","Although the discussion herein is directed to querying two sources for the status information and the authorization credentials, OCSP server  may be configured to query one or more sources to obtain the certificate status and the associated authorization attributes. In addition, although the discussion is mostly directed to the certificate subject requesting the status of its digital certificate and authorization attributes, any entity including the relying party can make the request. Furthermore, it should also be noted that, a status request to OCSP server  may include a request for multiple certificates that may be associated with one or more subjects and\/or one or more authorization attributes associated with one or more requested services.","In response to the status request, OCSP server  returns a response with a status information object. The status information object may be, for example, a data structure which includes information associated with the status of one or more certificates (certificate status information data) and one or more authorization attributes, each of which may be associated with one or more certificate subjects. Furthermore, the status information object may include a currency indicator such as time of day, sequence number, expiration dates, or next update time. The integrity of the status information object may be cryptographically protected using a digital signature or a Message Authentication Code (MAC). The privacy of the status information object may also be cryptographically protected via known encryption mechanisms. In addition, the authorization attributes and the certificate status information data may each be cryptographically protected independently or as a combined object.","In one embodiment, OSCP Server  may choose to authenticate the status request (remove: the Certificate Subject ), before generating a Authorization Response Extension , as shown in  below, or transmitting the OCSP response. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP), as specified for example in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 5055, also provides certificate status information similar to how OCSP works. However SCVP can inherently provide certificate status information for many certificates needed to build a chain of certificates from a certificate subject's certificate to a relying party's trusted certification authority (remove: self signed certificate), and check the certificate status of all the certificates in the chain. Such functionality is often referred to as Certificate Validation. OCSP is therefore functionally equivalent to SVCP where the certificate chain contains only one certificate. SCVP requests referred to herein are treated identically to OCSP requests, and SCVP responses are treated identically to OCSP responses. Therefore the term OCSP used herein should be taken to include SCVP. Therefore the terms OCSP response, OCSP request, and OCSP server are taken to include SCVP response, SCVP request, and SCVP server respectively. Similarly the terms OCSP Server is used synonymously with Certificate Status Server and Certificate Validating Server.","The relying party can use the above certificate validation methods to determine if it should provide a requested service to a certificate subject. The relying party would do this by acquiring certificate subject's digital certificate, and certificate status information associated with the subject's certificate containing certificate status information and authorization attributes. The relying party would then authenticate the certificate status information by validating the signature on the certificate status information with the certificate of the validating server. The relying party would then use the certificate status to validate the digital certificate of the certificate subject. The relying party would then determine the identity of the certificate subject by sending the certificate subject some data to sign. After receiving the signed data, the relying party would then verify the signature on the signed data. Finally, by comparing the authorization attributes with the local authorization policy the relying party can determine whether on or not to provide the requested service based on the result of the comparison.","In one embodiment, when access to one or more requested services is being authorized for multiple certificate subjects, the status information object may include a data object for each certificate subject being authorized. This data object may include both certificate status information data and authorization attributes.","The status information object can be used to validate at least one certificate. One method of doing this is to verify the cryptographically protected integrity of the status information object, extract the appropriate certificate status information data for the at least one certificate, and determine, based on the value of the status information, the validity of the at least one certificate. For example, the certificate status information object may include a flag indicating whether or not the at least one certificate is valid.","In one embodiment, the status request may contain an identification of the specific service being requested. Such identification may take the form of at least one of the following; a Universal Resource Locator (URL), a service name defined in a predetermined naming convention, a distinguished name and Domain Name System (DNS) fully qualified domain name, an IP address, a protocol port number (such as a TCP or UDP port), a process ID, an Application Programming Interface (API) name, a function name, or an index into a redefined table of services.","When the status request sent to OCSP server  identifies specific services, the status of the certificate for certificate subject  and the authorization attributes associated with the services requested by certificate subject  may be included in the certificate status information object sent in response to the status request. If the status request sent to OCSP server  does not identify specific services, the status of the certificate for certificate subject  and the authorization attributes associated with services that certificate subject  is authorized to access may be included in the certificate status information object sent in response to the status request. Thus, a response to a status request for multiple certificate status information objects may include the requested certificate status of each certificate subject and the corresponding authorization attributes associated with any or all of the certificate subjects, wherein the authorization attributes may be associated with either requested services or authorized services.","In an embodiment, a requesting entity, for example certificate subject , initiates the authentication process by periodically sending an authorization request extension to OCSP server . The authorization request extension includes an indication of a service being requested and the authorization attributes required for that requested service. The authorization request extension may be integrated into a modified OCSP request message, for example in a modified version of a standardized IETF OCSP request message. Alternatively, the authorization request extension may be appended to the standardized IETF OCSP request message. The OCSP request message with the authorization request extension may also include one or more attributes, associated with certificate subject , that are to be validated. In one embodiment, the authorization request extension may identify a list of authorization attributes that are to be included in a response message sent from OCSP server . For example, the authorization request extension may include a specific service type for each authorization attribute needed. The authorization request extension may also include an explicit list of authorization attribute types. An authorization attribute type is an identifier that OCSP server  can use to determine which authorization attributes are needed by the requesting entity. In one embodiment, an authorization attribute type is an identifier that indicates a class of services or one of many service that are available at a given relying party or group of relying parties. For example, an authorization attribute type might specify \u201cVoice Service\u201d or \u201cData Services\u201d, or more specifically, \u201cdatabase lookup services\u201d. Similarly, an authorization attribute type may specify \u201call services available at a service provider (X)\u201d or \u201call voice service available at the service provider (X)\u201d. The actual encoding of the authorization attribute type may take the form of, for example, a name, an OID, an index into a service types table, an IP address or a protocol port id, among other options.","If the authorization request extension includes a service type, the response message from the OCSP server  may include authorization attributes associated with the service type. OCSP server  may determine which authorization attributes are associated with an authorization type in many ways. For example, the authorization attribute type may be an OID with fewer digits than the actual corresponding attribute OIDs. For example, OID 1.2.3 may be used to encode an attribute type while the authorization attributes of this attribute type may be encoded as 1.2.3.x or 1.2.3.x.y. Attribute types may be grouped in other ways including predefined tables of attribute type identifiers and the corresponding attribute identifiers, or predefined naming rules. For example, \u201call group calling\u201d might be an attribute of a service type, \u201cvoice services\u201d. The authorization attribute may also be a simple indication, such as an \u201cauthorized\u201d or \u201cnot authorized\u201d indication.","If the request extension includes an explicit list of attribute types, then the response message from OCSP server  may include authorization attributes associated with the listed attribute types. If neither a service type nor an attribute type is included in the authorization request extension, the response message from OCSP server  may include all or part of the authorized attributes associated with certificate subject . The OCSP server  may use filtering criteria in determining which authorization attributes are applicable for the certificate subject . The filtering criteria may be, for example, the identity or attributes associated with the requesting entity, time of day, location, any field included in the certificate subject's certificate including a certificate policy, a distinguished name, an assurance level, or an identifier for the issuing CA.","Upon receiving the OCSP request with the authorization request extension, OCSP server  determines the certificate subject's status by querying the appropriate certificate status information database . If the status of subject's certificate is determined to be valid, OCSP server  also queries database  (for example AAA server) to obtain the authorization attributes associated with the certificate subject  and the services indicated in the status request. OCSP server  may communicate with the AAA server via, for example, a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or Structured Query Language (SQL) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).","Upon obtaining the certificate status and authorization attributes for certificate subject , OCSP server  includes the authorization attributes in an authorization response extension contained within, for example, a standard OCSP response. The OCSP response also includes the status of the digital certificate. OCSP server  sends the OCSP response with the authorization response extension to certificate subject . In an embodiment, the OCSP response is digitally signed by OCSP server  to guarantee its integrity and to guarantee that it originated from an authorized OCSP server. The digitally signed response therefore includes the status of the certificate subject  digital certificate and authorization attributes associated with certificate subject . In an embodiment, the OCSP response may include the status information object. The status information object may be a modified OCSP response that is configured to include one or more of the certificate status, authorization attributes and the OCSP server signature.","Certificate subject  caches the modified OCSP response or status information object. Thereafter, when certificate subject  sends information to the relying party, certificate subject  also sends the cached status response or status information object with the digital certificate. The relying party can therefore use the received status response or status information object to verify the status of the certificate subject  digital certificate and to obtain the authorization attributes associated with certificate subject . In particular, the relying party validates certificate subject 's digital certificate using information in the status information object and compares authorization attributes present in the status information object with policy attributes associated with a requested service. A policy attribute is a set of constraints used by the relying party to determine if the authorization attributes associated with certificate subject  are sufficient to allow certificate subject  to access the requested service. If the authorization attributes present in the status information object match the policy attributes associated with the requested service, the relying party grants certificate subject  access to the requested service.","By including certificate subject  certificate status and authorization attributes along with the certificate subject's digital certificate, in some embodiments, the relying party can verify the identity and authorization attributes of certificate subject  without needing connectivity to a back-end server. Authorization attributes can thus be changed frequently and easily without requiring that a new identity certificate be issued to certificate subject .","In one embodiment, certificate subject  acts as an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) supplicant and OCSP server  acts like an EAP authenticator. In communications using EAP, the EAP supplicant may request connection to a wireless network through an access point (a station that transmits and receives data). The EAP authenticator then requests identification (ID) data from the EAP supplicant and transmits that data to an authentication server. The authentication server asks the EAP authenticator for proof of the validity of the ID. After the EAP authenticator obtains that verification from the EAP supplicant and sends it back to the authentication server, the EAP supplicant may be connected to the network as requested. Therefore, OCSP server  acts as the EAP authenticator and forwards EAP messages between authorization server  and certificate subject . When the OCSP server receives an EAP Success message from authorization server , OCSP server  retrieves the authorization attributes from the EAP Success message and inserts the authorization attributes into the OCSP response sent to certificate subject .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","200","204","204","204","108","204","200"],"i":["a","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300","302","302","302","108","204","204","304","302","304","304"],"i":["a","n","a","n ","a","n"]},"The periodicity of polling for the authorization attributes and status of certificate by the certificate subject can be optimized. If, for example, the certificate subject determines the nature of a current interface, i.e. whether it is on wired or a wireless interface, the certificate subject can reduce the polling frequency based on the current interface. For example, the certificate subject may reduce the polling frequency if the current interface is a wireless interface. An embodiment may involve the use of two modes of operation, a normal mode and an emergency mode. The normal mode may be set as a default mode of operation and the emergency mode may be invoked when there is, for example, a natural disaster or a national emergency. In the emergency mode, the certificate subject may poll for authorization attributes and the status of certificate more frequently. Furthermore, the certificate subject may also be able to poll for authorization attributes and the certificate status in an on-demand mode, that is, the certificate subject may also be able to poll for information as needed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["410","420","430","440","204","204","450","460","300"],"i":["a","n"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","520","530","540","550"]},"In the foregoing specification, specific embodiments have been described.
