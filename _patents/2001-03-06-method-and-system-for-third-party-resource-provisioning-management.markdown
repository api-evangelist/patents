Field of the Invention","The present invention relates, generally, to resource provisioning management (RPM) systems, and, in preferred embodiments, to third party providers of resource provisioning management services.","2. Description of Related Art","A common use of communication networks is to provide users access to network resources such as software, electronic data, or files in storage systems or databases connected to the network. As the number of users on a given network increases, there is often a need to control user access rights to resources on the network. However, as the number and type of resources available over the network increase, the difficulty in managing access rights to such resources tends to increase. Further difficulties arise where resources are in remote locations, accessible to users over a distributed network, such as the Internet.","Network environments often involve a variety of network users, where the users may be grouped or categorized by a relation or role that the user serves in the environment. For example, in an engineering or technical development company environment, users of the company's computer network may include company officers, directors, managers, engineers, technical support staff, office support staff, accounting department staff, information technology (IT) department staff, contractors, consultants, temporary employees or other relation-based or role-based groups or categories of network users. Other companies, organizations or network environments may have other relation or role-based groups of users. Each user may have a need to access certain network resources in connection with the user's relation or role. In addition, it may be desirable to restrict users with certain relations or roles from access to certain resources, for example, for security, privacy or other reasons.","Depending on the network environment, other types of resources may also be allocated to (or restricted from) users, based on the user's relation or role in the environment. For example, in the engineering or development company environment described above, users may be allocated such resources as telephones, telephone accounts, computers, Internet accounts, e-mail accounts, office equipment and supplies, laboratory or engineering equipment and supplies, or other resources, based on the user's role or relation with the company.","In many conventional businesses or organizations, specific personnel perform the function of provisioning users according to their roles. For example, an office administrator may place an order with the organization's information technology (IT) department to have a computer, telephone, voice mail, e-mail, and certain applications and databases available on the day a new user joins the organization. Individuals from the IT department would then manually set up these resources. Other office personnel may bring desks, chairs, and cabinets from storage and set up the user's office. Over the course of time, the user's relationship or roles within the organization may change, for example, as the user is transferred, promoted, demoted or terminated from the organization. As a user's relationship or role with the organization changes, the user's needs or rights to access resources may change.","The burden on the office administrator and office personnel to manually administer user access to resources in the above example is typically dependent on the size of the organization (the number of users) and the rate at which users join or leave the organization or otherwise change roles. To improve efficiency and reduce the burden on the office administrator and office personnel, some organizations have used software applications which automate or partially automate some of the tasks relating to provisioning certain, limited types of resources to users.","Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one form of automatic provisioning that has become commercially available. RBAC provides permissions (access rights) to a user to access certain accounts (files, web pages, etc.) available over the network, based on a person's role in the organization. For example, a file or folder may be viewed only by its creator, or may be accessible to a larger group of users through an organization's network, depending on the permission rights established for that file or folder. In conventional RBAC systems, these permissions are based on a person's role within the organization.","However, modern organizations may be structured along several intersecting lines. For example, organizations may be structured according to title (presidents, vice-presidents, directors, managers, supervisors, etc.), technology (electronics, mechanical, software, etc.), project (product A, B, C, etc.), location (Irvine, N.Y., etc.) and the like. A single user may appear in several or all of these organizational structures, and thus may be in a somewhat unique overall role as compared to other users in the organization. Because this may require that many users be provisioned uniquely, many unique roles would have to be defined in the system to automate such provisioning. Furthermore, conventional RBAC only provisions \u201csoft\u201d resources such as accounts, applications, databases, files, Web pages, and the like, as opposed to \u201chard\u201d resources such as telephones, computers, desks, and the like.","The software applications which automate or partially automate some of the tasks relating to provisioning certain, limited types of resources to users are operable on a communication network for provisioning users with resources according to established criteria. Systems employing such software applications will be generally referred to herein as RPM systems.","Although the third party service providers or managed services (collectively known as managed resources) may have user management consoles which enable a human to make changes to the managed resource, the consoles or interfaces may be incompatible with the RPM system. Because of this, software agents may be deployed as translators between the RPM system and the managed resources. The agent, in essence, replaces human intervention with automated steps that perform essentially the same function. The agent is capable of receiving a message or request from the RPM system, and translating the request to code that can interface with the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of the managed resource. After the managed resource performs the particular function of the request, the managed resource may pass values to the agent, which may then communicate the values back to the RPM system.","Unfortunately, the implementation of an RPM system may require resources that are cost-prohibitive for some companies or organizations. Implementation of an RPM system typically requires system servers, terminals, system software, agents and other items associated with a communications network. Expenditures for such items can be tremendous, costing anywhere from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. These costs may be overwhelming for companies or organizations of modest means, thereby putting acquisition and implementation of an RPM system out of reach.","Also, the implementation of an RPM system typically requires a commitment to personnel for the operation of the system. The cost required to hire and train such personnel and the costs for associated overhead may discourage some companies or organizations from implementing an RPM system altogether. Thus, without a viable alternative for RPM services, these companies and organizations cannot benefit from an RPM system.","Companies and other organizations who lack the resources for or who are otherwise discouraged from acquiring and implementing an RPM system could benefit greatly from third parties who function as providers of RPM services. Up until now, however, a system and method for providing third party RPM services has not existed. Generally, an RPM system and method has heretofore been implemented within an organization utilizing resources in an enterprise or application service provider environment.","Tremendous benefit could also be obtained by companies and other organizations utilizing third party RPM service providers if the resources being provisioned could be shared among such companies or organizations. Such sharing among affiliated companies could provide cost savings and administrative efficiency. Again, however, up until now, a mechanism for sharing resources among affiliate companies or organizations utilizing third party RPM service providers has not existed.","A need also exists for a public infrastructure generally in the RPM sector. There does not currently exist any third party RPM service provider delivering provisioning services such as identity, entitlement, policies and roles for the general public to utilize when the need for resource provisioning arises.","Therefore, embodiments of the present invention relate to systems and methods for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations using a single logical server, where each organization may have internal resources.","Such a method may comprise the steps of establishing a set of attributes, organizational information, and user roles for each organization; defining a plurality of resource provisioning policies for each organization based on selected attributes, organizational information, and user roles; receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from each organization for a particular user, resource, or database; determining which resource provisioning policies are applicable to the user based on the received user role information, organizational information, and attribute information; and provisioning the user from a remote, centralized location with resources based on the applicable resource provisioning policies.","The method may also include provisioning over a network and provisioning users with external resources.","A method for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations using a single logical server, each organization having internal resources may also comprise the steps of establishing a set of attributes, organizational information, and user roles for each organization; defining a plurality of resource provisioning policies for each organization based on selected attributes, organizational information, and user roles; receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from each organization for a particular user, resource, or database; determining which resource provisioning policies are applicable to users based on the received user role information, organizational information, and attribute information; grouping each organization together into a resource exchange; and cross-provisioning users from a remote, centralized location with resources from organizations within the resource exchange based on the applicable resource provisioning policies.","The method may also include the step of providing a translational map for organizations within the resource exchange. Further, the method may include the step of providing high level authentication of organizations within the resource exchange. The method may further include the step of providing identity synchronization of organizations within the resource exchange. The method may further include the step of providing an audit trail for organizations within the resource exchange, and may further include the step of providing anonymity for organizations within the resource exchange.","A method for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations using a server in a public provision infrastructure may also comprise the steps of establishing a set of attributes, organizational information, and user roles for each organization having resources; defining a plurality of resource provisioning policies for each organization having resources based on selected attributes, organizational information, and user roles; receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from each organization for a particular user, resource, or database; receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from members of a general public desiring use of a resource within the public provisioning infrastructure; generating a resource provisioning ticket for the members of the general public; determining which resource provisioning policies are applicable to users based on the received user role information, organizational information, and attribute information; and forwarding the provisioning ticket to a vendor of a particular resource.","A system for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations may comprise a third party resource provisioning management service provider; a server for provisioning resources, wherein the server is operated by a third party resource provisioning management service provider; internal resources belonging to each organization; and a network providing a link between the server and the internal resources; wherein the third party resource provisioning management service provider provisions the internal resources of each organization over the network at the request of the organization.","The system may further comprise external resources, wherein the external resources are provisioned for each organization.","A system for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations may also comprise a third party resource provisioning management service provider; a server for provisioning resources, wherein the server is operated by a third party resource provisioning management service provider; a resource exchange made up of the plurality of organizations, each organization having internal resources; and a network providing a link between the server and the internal resources, wherein the third party resource provisioning management service provider cross-provisions the internal resources of each organization within the resource exchange over the network at the request of each organization.","The system may further comprise a translational map for organizations within the resource exchange, means for each high level authentication of organizations within the resource exchange, means for identity synchronization of organizations within the resource exchange, and means for providing an audit trail for organizations within the resource exchange.","A system for provisioning resources of a plurality of organizations may also comprise means for establishing a set of attributes, organizational information, and user roles for each organization having resources; means for defining a plurality of resource provisioning policies for each organization having resources based on selected attributes, organizational information, and user roles; means for receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from each organization for a particular user, resource, or database; means for receiving attribute information, organizational information, and user role information from members of a general public desiring use of a resource within the public provisioning infrastructure; means for generating a resource provisioning ticket for the members of the general public; means for determining which resource provisioning policies are applicable to users based on the received user role information, organizational information, and attribute information; and means for forwarding the provisioning ticket to a vendor of a particular resource.","These and other objects, features, and advantages of embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, when read with the drawings and appended claims.","In the following description of preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention.","As described above, embodiments of the present invention relate to a system operable on a communication network for provisioning users with resources based on policies, roles and attributes. Embodiments of the present invention will be generally referred to herein as a resource provisioning management (RPM) system, or simply \u201cthe system.\u201d","The system may be implemented with software applications and modules deployed on various processor or computer systems connected for communication over one or more network or non-network links. As described in more detail below, the processors in which the modules and applications are deployed may differ from system embodiment to system embodiment. In addition, the types of users, administrators and other entities that interact with the system may differ from system embodiment to system embodiment. Preferred embodiments of the system are designed to provide a high level of flexibility to accommodate the needs of a variety of potential applications of use.","Two representative examples of system environments in which embodiments of the present invention operate are shown in , respectively.  shows a generalized representation of an Application Service Provider (ASP) environment embodiment, while  shows a generalized representation of an Enterprise environment embodiment of the system. In each of , a platform computer system  is coupled for communication with a plurality of user computers, administrator computers and other entities over a network , depending upon the needs of the system. Further entities, including external systems, databases and directories, third party service providers, managed services and system administrators may be coupled for communication to the platform system  through the same network or through other networks or dedicated communication links, depending upon the needs of the system. While a number of such entities are shown and described with respect to embodiments disclosed herein, it will be understood that further system environment embodiments of the invention need not include all of the entities described herein.","The network environment may also include one or more network servers, routers and other network structure and devices (not shown). A network environment may comprise a local area network (LAN), for example, within an office or building. In other embodiments, the network environment may comprise a wide area network (WAN) including, but not limited to, the Internet.","The platform system  may be implemented, for example, with one or more processors or computers which include or operate with associated memory and software modules and applications to carry out various functions described herein. The platform system  carries out various functions associated with provisioning users with resources based on policies, roles, organizational information, and attributes, as described below. Further functions may be carried out on processors or computers associated with the users, administrators, and service providers, for example, implemented by software running on those computers, as described below. Embodiments of the present invention can therefore run on a cluster of computers or on a single computer. These computers may or may not have multiple processors.","Users, and users acting in administrator roles, may operate computers which may include suitable processors, memory devices and user interface devices, such as, but not limited to, display devices, keyboards, mouse devices, or the like, to allow users to obtain and communicate information over the network or other communication link. Suitable software may be stored at, or be accessible to, the user and administrator Web browsers or computers, to provide user and administrator interface functions and to allow communication of electronic information and content, such as data, files, programs and other software over the network, in accordance with well known network communication technology. In addition, software for implementing functions associated with the user and administrator according to embodiments of the present invention may also be stored at, or be accessible to, the user and administrator Web browsers, respectively.","The system  provides a platform for defining policies and provisioning services to a user interacting with the system, or a user interacting with the network on which the system is operating. The system may designate and track the types of services as well as the types of access to these services for a large number of users. In the generalized examples of , the platform system  may receive requests for services from user computers. The platform system  may also receive information from administrator computers relating to, for example, authorizations of users' requests or changes in users, policies or roles. The platform system  may also provide information to the administrator Web browsers or computers, including, for example, reports on operation and service usage. The platform system  may provide requests, instructions, or other information to service providers or managed services computers related to providing services to the users, based on user requests, policies, roles, organizational information, and attributes. The platform system  may control access to services, such as data, files, programs or other electronic information from database or storage systems to the users, based on user requests, policies, roles, organizational information, and attributes.","As described above, a system according to the  embodiment is deployed in an ASP environment. An ASP may be described as an organization that deploys, hosts and manages access to applications such as software and other resources to multiple parties from a centrally managed facility. The applications are typically delivered over networks, including, but not limited to the Internet, on a subscription basis.","In the ASP environment, one or more users within the ASP may be designated as RPM system administrators  with access rights greater than other users at the same company. RPM system administrators, like other users at the same company, are capable of performing operations in accordance with policies put in place by the ASP customer, which may be based on role and organizational information for each user. However, these RPM system administrators are additionally provided with certain system configuration responsibilities, including selecting the processors on which certain modules or applications of the system are deployed, as described below. In addition, an RPM system administrator may be able to manage, for example, organizations, users, services, roles, workflow rules, policies and the system itself. An RPM provisioning system administrator may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system, and may also be authorized to manage different portions of the system's data by being granted permission to access such data. The responsibilities of any given RPM system administrator may range from organization management only, to entire system management, depending upon the permission or access rights provided to the given RPM system administrator.","The system in  may also interface, for example, with one or more Customer End-Users , Customer Administrators , and Customer Supervisors . In the illustrated example, the interfaces for the Customer End-User , Customer Administrator , and Customer Supervisor  are Web enabled for connection over the Internet .","A Customer End-User  is a user having access to resources in accordance with policies put in place by the customer A Customer End-User  may be an employee of an ASP's customer who is provided access to certain ASP resources. A Customer End-User  would typically be authorized only to perform self-administration of its own personal and account information stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Directory server (not shown in ) by communicating requests for provisioned services\/resources over the network using a Web browser.","A Customer Administrator , as shown in , is also a user having access to resources in accordance with policies put in place by the customer. A Customer Administrator  may be an employee of an ASP's customer who is responsible for administering portions of a customer's organization, such as managing organizational and user information and, is therefore provided with permissions or access rights to appropriate system data to perform such functions. For example, a Customer Administrator may define and manage use of user roles and policies and, thus, may be provided with permission or access rights to the LDAP Directory Server. Thus, a Customer Administrator may define or change users, roles, policies, organization hierarchy or the like. A Customer Administrator may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system, and therefore may be provided with permission or access rights to the RPM system server containing a report engine  (see FIG. ). A Customer Administrator  typically would be authorized to manage different portions of the system's data by being granted permission to access such data. The responsibilities of a Customer Administrator  may range from organization management only, to entire system management, depending upon the permission rights granted to the Customer Administrator.","A Customer Supervisor , as shown in , is also a user having access to resources in accordance with policies put in place by the customer. A Customer Supervisor  may be an employee of an ASP's customer who is responsible for managing or supervising groups of users in the customer organization. A Customer Supervisor  may delegate responsibilities to another Customer Supervisor. In preferred embodiments, the delegation of responsibility may be authorized for a pre-defined period of time. A Customer Supervisor  may make changes to a roster of current users and approve requests made by users, where such requests require approval. A Customer Supervisor  may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system. It should be understood that, in preferred embodiments, reports are not stored. Rather, they are generated as needed, and if a user wants to store a report, it would have to be saved to the user's Web browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00064","num":"00064"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["22","22","10","58","10"]},"As illustrated in , the system may also interface with one or more Customer Datastores . In preferred embodiments, this interface is Internet capable. A Customer Datastore  may be a relational database or directory that stores ASP customer information. Note that customer-relevant data such as the customer's organization, roles, account information, and user information is stored in the directories within the Customer Datastores , while in-progress workflow information, audit logs, historical audit trail information (e.g., requests that have been approved), system state information (e.g. workflow state, requests that have not yet been approved), and information about remote services is stored in the databases within the Customer Datastores .","The system  may also interface, for example, with a Managed Service , as shown in FIG. . In preferred embodiments, this interface is Internet capable. A Managed Service  may be an application, device or datastore that the system  proactively manages. A Managed Service may comprise a network device that has an account maintenance system, such as an RPM system, an operating system, an application (e.g., a human resources (HR) system, enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, etc.), public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates, databases, financial services, and the like. The Managed Service's system may function independently. Thus, the datastore for the system  and that of a Managed Service may be synchronized periodically or at defined or irregular intervals, for example, to update the datastore.","The system may also interface, for example, with a Third Party Service Provider , as shown in FIG. . In preferred embodiments, this interface is Internet capable. A Third Party Service Provider  may be an external organization that provides services that may be provisioned through the system . A Third Party Service Provider  may be, for example, a credit card service that provides credit cards or credit accounts that are provisioned through the system . As another example, a Third Party Service Provider  may be a telephone service company that provides telephone line accounts that are provisioned through the system . It should be understood that these are merely representative examples. Many other types of services may be provided by a Third Party Service Provider in accordance with further system embodiments.","The system  may also interface, for example, with a Partner System , as shown in FIG. . In preferred embodiments, this interface is Internet capable. A Partner System  may be similar or identical to the system , but used by a business partner or customer and integrated into the system . Thus, the Partner System  represents a system-to-system interface which, in preferred embodiments, may be used to provide the seamless integration of multiple systems.","As described above, a system according to the embodiment of  is deployed in an Enterprise environment. An enterprise may be any organization that desires or requires management and administration of its resources, including, but not limited to, companies, firms, educational organizations, governmental organizations, or other groups or associations. In the  embodiment, the system  supports the same capabilities described above with respect to , but with some differences for different kinds of users.","For example, the system  may interface with a System Administrator  in a manner similar to the RPM system administrator interface described with respect to FIG. . The System Administrator  may be an employee of the Enterprise, and may have responsibility for configuring the system. A System Administrator  may be able to manage organizations, users, services, roles, workflow rules, policies, and the system itself. A System Administrator  may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system. A System Administrator  may be authorized to manage different portions of the system's data by being granted permission to access such data. The responsibilities of a System Administrator  may range from organization management only, to entire system management.","Instead of Customer End-Users, Customer Administrators and Customer Supervisors described with respect to , the environment in  includes Employees (or Partners) , Employee Administrators , and Supervisors . Each may interface with the system , and are preferably web enabled for interfacing with system  over the Internet. An Employee may be an employee of the enterprise. An Employee  is a user having access to resources in accordance with policies put in place by the enterprise. Typically, an Employee may only be authorized to perform self-administration of the Employee's own personal information.","An Employee Administrator , as shown in , may be an employee of the Enterprise who is responsible for Enterprise employee administration. An Employee Administrator  is a user having access to resources in accordance with policies put in place by the Enterprise, who is responsible for managing the Enterprise's organizational and user information. This may involve defining, changing and managing user roles and policies. An Employee Administrator  may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system. An Employee Administrator  may be authorized to manage different portions of the system's data by being granted permission to access such data. The responsibilities of an Employee Administrator  may range from organization management only, to entire system management.","An Enterprise Supervisor  may be an employee of the Enterprise who is responsible for managing groups of users within the Enterprise. Typically, an Enterprise Supervisor  may make changes to users and approve requests made by users. An Enterprise Supervisor  may also generate reports to audit the current and historical status of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00074","num":"00074"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["58","58","10"]},"As illustrated in , the system may interface with a Human Resources Datastore . A Human Resources Datastore  may be a database or directory that stores Enterprise employee and partner information.","The system  may also interface with a Partner System , Third Party Service Providers  and Managed Services , in a manner similar to that described above with respect to the Partner Systems , Third Party Service Providers  and Managed Services  in FIG. .","The system  in  may be used to manage the provisioning of a variety of services or resources to users. A service may be any type of resource that may be accessed one or more times by users of the system. For example, a cellular telephone account or an account with a credit card company may be services. Using these services as examples, the system may, for example, designate that certain users have access to a cellular telephone account and a credit card account, and may track the usage by the user of these accounts. The system may also set various rules and policies regarding the use of these accounts by the user, depending on the status of the user.","Using the system, an organization may provision, or allocate, services to a user within the organization based on defined policies, organizational information, attributes, and the role of the user in the organization. The policies, or rules, may be pre-defined for the organization based on the needs of the organization and incorporated into the system. The policies may be flexible enough to account for the various roles within the organization and the services each role requires. For example, assume an organization hires a new employee in the capacity of System Administrator. Using the system, several actions may be automatically initiated. For example, if a pre-set policy for the organization provides that each employee receives regular telephone service, a regular telephone, and an e-mail account, then upon the hiring of a new System Administrator, the system will automatically notify the appropriate parties to set up a regular telephone account and an e-mail account for the System Administrator and deliver a regular telephone to the System Administrator's office. Assume also that a pre-set policy for the organization is that each System Administrator has access to all system databases. The system will then automatically grant the System Administrator access to all system databases.","For purposes of illustration only, assume that the same organization hires a new employee in the capacity of Outside Salesperson. As before, because of the policies that have been pre-defined for the organization, including, but not limited to, the policy that each employee receives regular telephone service, a regular telephone, and an e-mail account, the system automatically notifies the appropriate parties to set up a regular telephone account and an e-mail account for the Outside Salesperson and deliver a regular telephone to the Outside Salesperson's office. However, if the organization has a pre-defined policy that Outside Salespersons do not have access to all system databases, as do System Administrators, then access to these databases may be automatically denied by the system to the Outside Salesperson. If, however, the organization has a pre-defined policy that all Outside Salespersons receive cellular telephones, then the system may automatically set up a cellular telephone account for and order delivery of a cellular telephone to the Outside Salesperson.","Preferred embodiments of the system described herein perform these actions automatically based on the role of the person within the organization and policies that are pre-defined for the organization. The policies may be based on the needs of the organization and the requirements of each particular role within the organization, such that resources may be provisioned to each user to meet the needs and the requirements of the user's particular role in the organization.","A logical architecture view of applications and modules of a system  according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . As shown in , an example system embodiment may be characterized as a group of software modules with interfaces that allow the modules to collaborate with each other in order to implement the features of the system. In preferred embodiments, each module may be a self-contained unit of software that may be replaced within the system without compromising the integrity of the system, as long as the interface of the replaced module is maintained. While the interface to the module may remain consistent, the internal architecture of each module may vary, depending upon the application of use.","The modules may be grouped into an applications subsystem  and a platform subsystem . The applications subsystem  is directed toward applications that help a user or an administrator perform specific functions and, thus, may be implemented in software running on computers operated by users or administrators. The platform subsystem is directed toward services and utilities for enabling applications to interact with directories and databases containing the state of a network and the services on that network that are being managed. The platform subsystem may be implemented in software running on the platform computer system.","The applications subsystem  may include, for example, administration applications , application framework  and user applications . Administration applications  are applications used by an administrator, via the network, for various administration purposes. These applications may include one or more System Configuration applications , which provide an interface to allow an administrator to configure certain properties of the system. For example, the administrator interface may allow administrators to make system configuration settings, including, but not limited to, directory communication settings, logging properties, e-mail service settings, and garbage collection settings. The System Configuration applications  may include an interface to a Form Generation application , invoked to provide custom forms for data managed by the system. An example of such a form is illustrated in FIG. .","The Form Generation application  may also allow an administrator to create custom forms to be displayed in user and administrator applications. The Form Generation application may comprise a graphical user interface builder that associates system data attributes with graphical controls, which may include, but is not limited to, a \u201cWhat You See Is What You Get\u201d (WYSIWYG) graphical user interface builder.","The administration applications  may also include one or more Service Configuration applications , which provide an interface to allow administrators to configure certain properties of a service managed by the system. Examples of properties of a managed service include, but are not limited to, network location (IP address and port number), encryption for use and management, administrator login (ID and password), and management protocols.","In one preferred embodiment, a service may be bundled as a set with other services that are related through administrator-defined dependencies defined through the administrator interface. The Service Configuration applications  may include an interface to the Form Generation application  to provide custom forms for the account information to be used in the User Management web user application, which is the Web-based user interface that allows a user to add, modify, and delete other users.","The application framework  comprises a framework that integrates administrator and user applications. The application framework may include one or more System Browser applications , accessible by the system administrator, that preferably provide a graphical display of the entire managed contents of the system in a format that is easy to use.","The user applications  are applications used by an end-user, over the network, for various purposes. The user applications  may include one or more Organization Management applications  that preferably provide a graphical display of an organization's hierarchy of data in a format that is easy to use. From this interface, organizational units, locations, business partner organizations, users, system roles and organizational roles in the form of a tree view can be constructed and altered.","Depending upon the access level of the user, different areas of the hierarchy can be viewed or modified by the user. In embodiments in which the system manages multiple organizations, a user in a given organization will be restricted from accessing other organizations' data. However, a system administrator (not to be confused with an employee administrator or a customer administrator, described below) may be provided with access rights to all organizations' data.","The user applications  may include one or more Request Management applications  that provide an interface for the user to review and manage change requests pending within the system. A change request is a request to change one or more attributes of a user, or a request to change one or more attributes of a service belonging to that user. The interface may allow, for example, users acting in a supervisory role to approve or disapprove change requests.","The user applications  may also include one or more Form Viewer applications  that dynamically display forms as they are designed by the Form Generation administration application . The access level of the user determines which form, if any, the Form Viewer application will display in different situations. One or more Report Viewer applications  may be included for allowing a user to instruct a Report Engine in the platform subsystem  to execute predefined reports, and for displaying the results to the user. The access level of the user determines which reports the Report Viewer will provide. In addition, the user applications include applications for allowing a user to submit a request for provisioned services.","The user applications  may also include a Policy Management application  that provides an interface for defining policies that control the provisioning of services to users. In addition, constraints on individual attributes of services may be defined. The policies determine an association between the users and the services or resources, and constraints on those services provisioned to the users, based on attributes and user roles. The policies may define one or a series of approvals that are required before provisioning a given service or any service to a user. For example, such approvals may be required from one or more other users acting in a supervisory role. Policies may require one or more approvals if an attribute constraint is violated. The approvals may be defined using a Workflow Management application , which provides an interface for defining the approval process needed for a request in the system.","As described above, the platform subsystem  includes service and utility modules that enable various applications of the system to interact with directories and databases that hold information relating to the state of the system and services available over the network. The platform subsystem  may include, for example, application services , data services  and remote services . In preferred embodiments, the platform modules are designed to be as independent as possible of any domain-specific information. This enables the platform to be easily applied to a different domain and support a new set of applications without (or with minimal) re-architecture.","The application services  includes modules that may be used by several other system applications (client applications) to perform a service. These service modules may provide a separate and independent set of capabilities to their client applications. The applications services modules  may include an Authorization module  for providing a set of authentication implementations that may be used by client applications. Such implementations may include, but are not limited to, simple password authentication techniques or X.509 certificate authentication.","The application services  may also include an Authorization module  that provides an interface for authorized users to define authorization rules, and enforces those rules as client applications attempt operations on the system, such as requesting services or data. These rules may apply to accessing data within the system, as well as to operations that can be applied to the system data, such as add, modify, or delete operations.","A Business-To-Business (B2B) Gateway module  may be included to provide an interface to an external access management system such as the RPM system described herein, or a comparable third-party system.","The B2B Gateway module  may provide an external system the ability to add, modify, delete and query user information. In preferred embodiments, these functions may be performed through an open protocol such as, but not limited to, secure hypertext transport protocol (HTTPS) to enable secure communications through the Internet. In preferred embodiments, requests made by external systems to carry out such functions may be stored in an RPM database or other storage facility  for auditing purposes.","The applications services  may also include a Logging module  that provides a utility for logging information, such as alarms and historical events, into persistent storage (e.g. the RPM database ) associated with the platform system.","The applications services  may also include a Policy Engine  for executing policies that associate users with services. The Policy Engine  functions to determine whether or not provisioning requests conform to defined policies and to provide correct recovery procedures in the event that a policy is violated. If an approval is needed for a provisioning request, the Policy Engine  interfaces with a Workflow Engine  to notify and obtain authorization instructions from the appropriate authorization entity, which may be, for example, one or more users having pre-defined supervisory roles.","The Workflow Engine  functions to execute and track transactions within the system. Such transactions may include provisioning and de-provisioning of services, user status changes, and the approval process associated with a provisioning request in the system. In preferred embodiments, users with appropriate access levels may, through a client application, query the Workflow Engine for status information relating to a transaction (such as a provisioning request) being executed by the system.","The applications services modules also include a Report Engine  for executing predefined reports and formatting requested information. Note that requests for reports will only come directly from users of the system or the system administrator. They will not come from other systems.","The data services modules  includes modules that assist other modules in interacting with directories and databases that hold the network's state and the system's configuration. The data services modules  may include an Information Model  that provides a logical view of the data in persistent storage in a manner that is independent of the type of data source that holds the data. The model abstracts the details of the stored data into more usable constructs, such as Users, Groups and Services, by adding an object-oriented layer on top of the LDAP-based data model. The model may also provide an extendable interface to allow for customized attributes that correspond to these constructs.","The data services modules  may also include a Meta-Data module  that provides an interface from which a client may discover the design of the directory schema. Meta-Data is data that defines the content of the actual data. This may be used by a client to manage the data in persistent storage with a dynamic approach.","The remote services modules  provide interaction with external systems for provisioning and de-provisioning services. Synchronization of service information and user information, which is the process of making sure that the information stored on the remote service and the information stored in the RPM system match and is up to date, may also be performed by the remote services modules .","The remote services modules  may include a Message Transformation module  that provides utilities for defining and executing conversions of messages such as add, modify, delete, and search from one format to another. This module handles message formats, rather than delivery protocols. The actual protocols used are determined at run-time, and may include, but are not limited to, Remote Access Management Protocol (RAMP), Encrypted Socket Protocol (ESP), and Directory Access Markup Language over HTTPS (DAML\/HTTPS). The message transformation module  transforms between the data format used in the LDAP directory and the format used on the external system. Both formats are key value pairs, but the names of the keys must be mapped as part of the conversion process.","The remote services modules  may also include a Provisioning module  for providing an abstraction layer for provisioning products and services through external systems. The abstraction layer hides the protocol being used from the provisioning system. The specific protocols used to perform the provisioning, such as those described above, are preferably isolated from the client of the module. In preferred embodiments, new provisioning protocols may be added to the module without disrupting the module interface.","The remote services modules  also include a Synchronization module  that retrieves service information from external systems to keep the service information stored by the system up to date. In addition, the Synchronization module  may retrieve organizational information, such as organizational unit and user information. The module is preferably pre-set or configured to define the data needed, how to retrieve it, where to store it and how often to perform retrievals. The module may also define rules for resolving conflicts between information retrieved from an external system and currently stored data.","An example component view embodiment of the system is shown in , wherein logical applications and modules of  are organized into system components. A component is a self-contained and independent software entity that can be deployed onto computer and networking hardware separately from other components within the system. In the  embodiment, applications and modules are arranged to form an Application Server component , a B2B Server component , a Service Server component , a Synchronization Server component , a Web Server component  and a Workflow Server component . Each of these components is arranged in one of two domains, a trusted domain  and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) domain , relative to an untrusted domain .","A DMZ is a computer network (or a single computer) that is protected from a company's internal network (the trusted domain), but is accessible from the internet. The DMZ domain  contains systems that are accessible from the internet, and can access the internal network (trusted domain). The DMZ domain  will not typically contain any sensitive data or critical systems. The DMZ domain  is created so that even if a hacker breaks into the DMZ, the hacker would still have to break into the internal network from the DMZ. Although every effort is made to protect the DMZ from hackers, a security breach in the DMZ should not result in the theft or corruption of data, or in the loss of a critical system. The trusted domain, which is the internal network, is considered much more sensitive. Any intrusion into the trusted domain is considered a serious breach of security.","The Application Server component  is composed of modules for supporting users interacting with the system, for example, through the Web Server component . The Application Server component  is coupled to the Web Server component  and the Workflow Server through secure connections, such as secure remote method invocation (RMI) connections. The Application Server component  includes the authentication, authorization, report engine and logging modules of the application services  and data services modules  shown in FIG. . In preferred embodiments, the Application Server component also executes logic for the presentation of the Application Services modules, so that the Web Server component may remain as simple as possible. This also provides a security boundary for the Application modules.","In preferred embodiments, each request to the Application Server (requests from users for provisioned services) is authenticated and authorized before it is executed. At this level, only proper system credentials may be sufficient for authentication, to determine whether a valid Web Server is making the request. However, by requiring authorization of the requesting user before any request is executed, the Web Server component may remain in an untrusted domain.","The B2B Server component  is composed of modules for providing an interface to external systems such as another provisioning system of the type described herein, or other third-party provisioning systems that may communicate requests to the platform system.","In the illustrated embodiment, the B2B Server component  includes the B2B Gateway module  and an Authentication module (see reference character  in ) for authenticating B2B requests. The interface may be provided using a secure network protocol, such as HTTPS, for encrypting data transfer and for authentication of requesters. In preferred embodiments, all requesters must be authenticated and authorized before requests can be fulfilled. The B2B Server component  is also coupled to the Workflow Server , preferably through a secure connection, such as a secure RMI connection.","The Service Server component  is composed of modules for providing an interface to managed resources  and , and services that issue unsolicited notices or asynchronous provisioning confirmations to the system. The Service Server component  may be connected to managed services resources  and , through, for example, a DAML\/HTTPS connection. In addition, the Service Server component  may be connected to databases, such as a customer database , and third party service provider systems  and , through suitable connections, which may comprise HTTPS connections or vendor-specific connections.","The Service Server component  includes a Notification Gateway module which provides receiving logic that interacts with the Synchronization and Provisioning modules of the Synchronization Server  and the Workflow Server  components, respectively, through secure connections such as secure RMI connections. The separation of the Notification Gateway module from the Synchronization and Provisioning modules provides a security boundary between untrusted and trusted domains. The protocols used may be specific to the managed entity. In preferred embodiments, all requesters must be authenticated and authorized before passing on information to any modules in the trusted domain.","The Synchronization Server component  includes modules for periodically synchronizing service information between the service providers ,  and a local data repository. The Synchronization Server component  is configured to adapt to the service provider's interfaces to extract desired information. The Synchronization Server component  includes the synchronization and message transformation modules of the remote services , the authentication, authorization, and logging modules of the applications services , and the data services modules  shown in FIG. .","The Web Server component  includes modules for providing users with a graphical interface. The Web Server component includes an Applications Presentation module, which creates Web pages for the end user, as well as the authentication module of the applications services module group . The Web Server component is connected to client systems , , for example, over an HTML\/HTTPS connection. Preferably, all clients are authenticated when making requests to the system. For example, the Web Server may be configured to require password authentication, X.509 certificate authentication, or both, when using HTTPS.","The Workflow Server component  includes modules for provisioning and de-provisioning services within the system. The Workflow Server component includes the policy engine, workflow engine, logging, email, authentication and authorization modules of the applications services module group , as well as the data services modules  and the provisioning and message transforming modules of the remote services module group .","The components - of the  embodiment may be deployed in hardware (processor or computer systems) in a variety of manners. The components may be deployed on as few processors as possible, for example, to minimize system complexity and operational cost. Alternatively, some or all of the components may be separated and distributed to separate processors to maximize computing resources. Many of the modules and applications within components can also be distributed to further maximize computing capabilities. Furthermore, some or all of the components may be configured in clusters to take advantage of load balancing algorithms and fail-over capabilities.","The responsibility of configuring the system deployment may be provided to a system administrator. Thus, applications, modules or components containing groups of applications or modules as described above may be provided to a system administrator, for example, in software form (such as on a computer readable storage medium), in hardware or firmware form (such as on circuit boards or cards to be installed in a computer system) or a combination thereof. The system administrator may then develop a deployment strategy that meets the organization's performance and security needs and deploy the appropriate modules on appropriate hardware devices to fit the desired strategy. The system administrator may be free to deploy all of the components of the system on one processor or distribute clusters of each component in almost any combination, if desired.","An example of simple deployment option is shown in , where the six components - of  are clustered onto one processor  comprising the Platform system. Thus, processor  represents a server running the provisioning system according to embodiments of the present invention described herein. The Platform Processor  is coupled to external systems and clients over the network , through a Web Server Load Balancer . One or more Data Server processors  may be coupled to the platform processor  for deploying the RPM Directory and RPM Database. The Data Server processors  include a server running a relational database server and an LDAP directory server. The  embodiment demonstrates a simple deployment with a clustered deployment of servers that deploy all the components of the system. The load balancing algorithms dictate which components are running on specific processors. This deployment embodiment, however, may present security risks because the components are not deployed on separate hardware in separate trusted domains, as described above.","Another example of a deployment option is shown in FIG. . The  deployment, while more complex than the deployment shown in , alleviates some of the security concerns associated with the  deployment. All components ,  and  shown in the DMZ domain in  that interface to external clients and systems via the Internet may be clustered on one or more dedicated Web Server processors  in  to create a boundary between untrusted and trusted domains, where the web client is in an untrusted domain and the rest of the system components are in a trusted domain. The Synchronization Server component  is deployed in a separate cluster, so that communication with the service providers can be configured independently of other clusters.","In this manner, the interfaces to external clients and systems are isolated to one or more servers containing only those components of the system necessary for external interface. Other components of the system, including, but not limited to, those components that must remain secure, may reside on servers that do not interface to external clients and servers. Thus, external users of the system whose trustworthiness has not been verified are isolated from secure portions of the system, and the integrity of secure portions of the system residing on other servers within the system may be protected.","Now that the general system and various perspective views of the system have been described, including some examples of environments in which the system may operate, it may be understood that features of the system may be organized into functional areas. Some functional areas that may be incorporated into the system are given below and are merely examples of the types of functional areas the system may employ.","For example, all requirements for defining approval signatures and enforcing them may be grouped into an Approval Management functional area. As another example, an Authentication and Authorization functional area may group all requirements for user authentication to the system and the management of a user's access to functions and data within the system.","As further examples of functional areas of the system, a Business Partner functional area may group all requirements for managing business partner relationships. A Business-to-Business functional area may group all requirements for business-to-business interactions. This may include all external interfaces to partner and service subscriber systems.","An External Data Input functional area may group all requirements for incorporating current customer information into the system, such as existing users and resources. An Organization Management functional area may group all requirements for adding, modifying, and deleting organizations. A Policy Based Provisioning functional area may group all requirements for defining the provisioning of services based on attributes or a users' membership in a role, group, organizational unit, or organization.","A Report Generation functional area may group all requirements for reporting capabilities provided by the system. A Service Management functional area may group all requirements for defining services that the system may provision.","A System Administration functional area may group all requirements for configuring the system. This may include requirements for installing the system and altering its configuration parameters. A User Interface Customization functional area may group all requirements for providing a user the ability to customize a user interface. A User Management functional area may group all requirements for adding, modifying, and deleting users.","Other functional areas may be developed based on the needs of the system user.","Examples of certain operations of the system are shown in the sequence diagrams of .  is a sequence diagram of interactions for implementing a user's authentication to the system.

Other, more non-traditional \u201csoft\u201d resources may include messages to third parties, digital certificates for enabling the user to access encrypted resources, the capability to order products over the Internet, the ability to order a corporate credit card, access to financial services providers, and the like. In addition, RPM may provision users with \u201chard\u201d resources such as telephones, computers, cellular telephones, pagers, personal digital assistants, desks, chairs, file cabinets, and other physical components. RPM may also provide resource bundles, which are pre-packaged groupings of resources that are typically provisioned together. For example, a resource bundle may include a cellular telephone, telephone service, a pager account, voice mail, and Internet access. Another example of a bundled account may be Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) access and an Internet Service Provider (ISP) account.","Note that RPM systems according to embodiments of the present invention may also have the capability of making provisioning adjustments if a user's roles and attributes change, including de-provisioning, and especially de-provisioning all of the allocated resources once a user has left the company.","In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the RPM system provisions users with resources based on policies, which are defined based on roles and attributes. A role describes a person's responsibility within the organization, and may include roles such as a manager, secretary, system administrator, committee member, and the like. Each role has only two values. For example, a user is either a manager (a \u201cyes\u201d value), or he is not (a \u201cno\u201d value). An attribute is a characteristic or quality of a user or resource, such as \u201camount of time spent traveling,\u201d or \u201ccost.\u201d In contrast to a role, each attribute may have multiple values. For example, the attribute \u201camount of time spent traveling\u201d may have the values \u201cless than 30%,\u201d \u201cbetween 30% and 60%,\u201d and \u201cgreater than 60%.\u201d","Policies are written based on these roles and attributes. Because attributes can be used in addition to roles to define a policy, the task of defining the relationship between users and resources is made more efficient. Attributes can take on multiple values, and thus a single policy definition can be written in Boolean form using IF-THEN-ELSE IF statements (or the equivalent) to account for different attribute values, instead of multiple role definitions using IF-THEN statements. It should be noted that although IF-THEN-ELSE statements are presented herein for purposes of explanation only, in embodiments of the present invention any programming language and syntax capable of implementing the equivalent Boolean statements may be employed. A simple example is illustrative. Suppose that a role-based system has defined three roles as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e2941","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"224pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Role No.","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","IF the user is in marketing AND the user is a manager AND the user travels"]},{"entry":[{},"less than 30% of the time, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with a pager;"]},{"entry":["2","IF the user is in marketing AND the user is a manager AND the user travels"]},{"entry":[{},"between 30% and 60% of the time, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with a cellular telephone;"]},{"entry":["3","IF the user is in marketing, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with access to the sales figures database;"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Now suppose that a new employee, user A, is a marketing manager that travels less than 30% of the time. Suppose also that a new employee, user B, is a marketing manager that travels between 30% and 60% of the time.

The role-based system would also determine that roles 2 and 3 apply to user B, and that user B should be provisioned with a cellular telephone and access to the sales figures database.","Now suppose that a policy-based system according to embodiments of the present invention has defined two policies as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e3093","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"224pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Policy",{}]},{"entry":["No.","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","IF the user is in marketing AND the user is a manager, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"IF the user travels less than 30% of the time, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with a pager;"]},{"entry":[{},"ELSE IF the user travels between 30% and 60% of the time,"]},{"entry":[{},"THEN provision the user with a cellular telephone;"]},{"entry":["2","IF the user is in marketing, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with access to the sales figures database;"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The policy-based system of would determine that roles 1 and 2 apply to user A, and that user A should be provisioned with a pager and access to the sales figures database. The policy-based system would also determine that roles 1 and 2 apply to user B, and that user B should be provisioned with a cellular telephone and access to the sales figures database.","It should be understood from the above example that embodiments of the present invention allow a single policy to be defined than covers multiple attribute values, minimizing the number of policies that need to be defined as compared to the number of roles that would have to be defined in a role-based system. In the simple example provided above, policy 1 of the policy-based system replaces roles 1 and 2 of the role-based system. With fewer policies to evaluate, less memory may be consumed. In addition, in preferred embodiments the determination of resources can be performed more quickly. In the simple example provided above, when user A is being evaluated, both IF-THEN statements in roles 1 and 2 must be evaluated before the role-based system can determine that role 1 applies to user A, but role 2 does not. In contrast, once the \u201cIF the user travels less than 30% of the time\u201d statement in policy 1 is found to be true, the ELSE IF statement in policy 1 can be bypassed.","The roles and attributes associated with a user, as described above, may be assigned by human resources personnel or other organizational employees prior to the user's start date. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the provisioning of a user may be initiated by calling up a provisioning user interface (screen) on a Web browser connected to an organizational network. This screen would enable human resources personnel to input known roles and attributes. The RPM system would then search its stored policies and, based on the user's roles and attributes, determine a set of resources to be provisioned. Alternatively, human resources personnel may simply type employee information into a human resources (HR) system database, where the RPM system would automatically pull information from this database through a direct feed and begin the provisioning process. In addition, a start date or other date and time information may be entered, and the RPM system can initiate provisioning tasks when triggered by this date and time information.","The actual provisioning of resources may involve electronic communications and human interaction. For example, an e-mail might be sent to various office personnel to deliver a desk and chair to a certain office by a certain date. Another e-mail might be sent to IT personnel to deliver a computer and telephone to the office by a later date, and then enable a computer account, provide access to various applications and databases, e-mail, and voice mail by yet another date. Outside procurement services companies may also be contacted for some or all of the provisioning tasks. In addition, the provisioning of accounts maintained by an external system such as an ASP may be facilitated by communications between the RPM system and \u201cagent\u201d software that resides in a server within the external system. The \u201cagent\u201d acts as a portal through which accounts from the external system may be managed and accessed.","Once a user is provisioned with a set of resources, a list of these existing resources is maintained by the RPM system. Thereafter, if a user's roles or attributes should change, the policies are re-evaluated and a new list of resources to be provisioned are determined. This new list of resources is compared to the list of existing resources, and users are provisioned or de-provisioned according to the differences in the lists. In preferred embodiments, if a particular existing resource is also in the new list of resources, the RPM system will make no change regarding this resource, rather than de-provisioning then provisioning the resource.","Upon termination or suspension or a user, or if a user should take a leave of absence, embodiments of the present invention may also suspend the provisioning of resources, rather than de-provisioning them. For example, if a terminated user has threatened to take legal action against the company, the user's e-mail account may be suspended but not deleted, so that the user cannot access the e-mail account, but the e-mails may nevertheless be reviewed by the company in anticipation of litigation.","In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a reconciliation process is performed when the RPM system is first invoked. In reconciliation, the RPM system compares a list of currently provisioned resources with a list of resources that should have been provisioned based on the current state of each user's roles and attributes. Discrepancies between the two lists are resolved by provisioning or de-provisioning.","Although the previous example described an attribute of a user (\u201camount of time spent traveling\u201d), in embodiments of the present invention the RPM system may also maintain attributes of resources. Resource attributes play a role where the provisioning process allows for a selection of resources. For example, once a user begins working at an organization, the user may be able to call up the provisioning user interface screen to request optional resources. After entering additional information, the user may be able to select optional resources, provided that the user has certain attribute values.","Continuing the present example for purposes of illustration only, suppose that user A (a marketing manager that travels less than 30% of the time, and is not automatically entitled to a cellular telephone) can nevertheless request a cellular telephone if certain other roles and attributes are satisfied. User A may call up the provisioning screen and inter a value of \u201cEurope\u201d for the attribute \u201cclient location.\u201d The provisioning screen may then present user A with a selection of cellular telephones to choose from. If user A selects a cellular telephone less than $200, a \u201ccellular telephone cost\u201d attribute having a value \u201cless than $200\u201d will be associated with user A, and the system may automatically provision user A with that telephone by sending an e-mail order to a cellular telephone provider, for example.","However, if the selected telephone is more than $200, such as a so-called \u201cworld phone,\u201d a \u201ccellular telephone cost\u201d attribute having a value \u201cmore than $200\u201d will be associated with user A, and approval may be required. For example, an e-mail may be sent to a vice-president, providing the vice-president with access to the provisioning screen and requesting that the vice-president input the approval or disapproval of the telephone. Once this information is provided, the RPM will either order the telephone or send a denial message to the user. An example policy definition covering this example is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e3282","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Policy No.","Definition"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","IF the user is in marketing AND the user is a manager, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"IF the user travels less than 30% of the time, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"provision the user with a pager;"]},{"entry":[{},"IF the user's client's location is in Europe, THEN"]},{"entry":[{},"IF the cellular telephone is less than $200"]},{"entry":[{},"Provision the user with the cellular telephone;"]},{"entry":[{},"ELSE"]},{"entry":[{},"approval from a vice-president is needed to provision the user"]},{"entry":[{},"with"]},{"entry":[{},"the cellular telephone;"]},{"entry":[{},"ELSE IF the user travels between 30% and 60% of the time,"]},{"entry":[{},"THEN provision the user with a cellular telephone;"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Other examples of resource attributes include, but are not limited to, color, features, and manufacturer.","As described above, embodiments of the present invention may require input from another person before provisioning can continue. In another example provided for purposes of illustration only, when a new employee is entered into the system, human resources personnel may enter known roles and attributes, such as the new employee's department, at which time the policy may halt the inputting of information into the provisioning screen and instead send an e-mail to the department manager, providing the department manager with access to the provisioning screen and requesting that the department manager input a cubicle or office location. Once this information is provided, human resources personnel are notified, and provisioning of that office with a desk, chair, etc. can resume. More generally, at any point in the provisioning sequence, the policy may require that another person provide some of the new employee's roles, attributes, job descriptions, etc. before provisioning can resume.","It should be understood that although the above examples describe e-mail as a means for seeking information or approval from another person, or ordering resources, other methods of communication such as providing hyperlinks to Web pages and automated ordering of resources over the Internet using online resource provider order sheets may also be employed.","As described above, in embodiments of the present invention the provisioning process may be a sequence of steps, some of which require human intervention such as providing information or authorization. An example of this sequence will now be provided. Referring to , a user wishing to be provisioned with one or more resources may access a provisioning user interface screen  from a networked computer. In embodiments of the present invention, the provisioning screen  may include explanatory text and boxes or fields into which information may be entered. The user may type information into the fields, or may select from a pulldown menu of fixed choices. For example, fields  and  for a user to enter his first and last name may be provided, and a pulldown menu  of available resources may be provided. In alternative embodiments, the provisioning screen  may also include fields for optional information, fields for required information that the requesting user does not know (and therefore must be provided by another person), fields for required information (such as approvals) that must be provided by another person, and the like. In preferred embodiments, however, the provisioning screen visible to the requesting user will only contain those fields for information that the user is capable of providing.","Continuing the example of  for purposes of illustration only, suppose that the user requests an e-mail account. In embodiments of the present invention, the RPM processes the provisioning request by sending the provisioning screen to the manager, sending an e-mail to the manager to access a particular hyperlink to view the provisioning screen, or the like. As indicated by reference character , the department manager may see a different provisioning screen  from the requesting user. For example, the provisioning screen  may include additional fields  and  which allows the manager to approve or disapprove the request, and, if approval is given, which department has given the approval.","Continuing the example of  for purposes of illustration only, if approval is given, the provisioning screen may then be made known to the IT department, who may see a different provisioning screen  from the department manager. For example, the provisioning screen  may include an additional field  which allows IT personnel to designate a particular mail server, which may be dependent on the department information, and which may be beyond the department manager's knowledge.","As the preceding example illustrates, in preferred embodiments of the present invention, software for controlling the optional provisioning process may establish which information is to be provided by an individual, and which individuals have approval or disapproval authority, etc. The provisioning process may also determine who can modify information, and which information cannot be modified. The provisioning process may also define what information must be added before the provisioning request can be sent to the next person. In alternative embodiments, the provisioning request may be sent back to the requesting user for additional information or the modification of existing information (i.e. the modification of a resource request). In preferred embodiments, the authorizing authority may change depending on what is entered into the request fields. Thus, there is no one process path through which this request form will flow. The process path may actually branch into different directions, depending on what information is entered into the fields of the request form. A generic name for this flow is called workflow process.","An embodiment of the invention as described up to this point may be shown very generally in  first organization  provisions resources (not shown) using a first server  by interfacing with such resources through the first organization's agents . Independently, a second organization  provisions resources (also not shown) using a second server  by interfacing with such resources through the second organization's agents . Note that in this configuration, two logical servers, and possibly even more physical servers, are being utilized by two independent vendors for the same purpose. Although this configuration is typical and may be necessary, it may also be redundant in a variety of circumstances.","An alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . Here, a first organization  also provisions resources; however, rather than provisioning resources using a server under its, the first organization  may have its resources provisioned by a third party RPM service provider operating a third party server . The first organization  may interface with the third party server  through a network , such as, for example, the Internet. Likewise, the third party RPM service provider may interface with the first organization's agents  through the network  to provision resources for the first organization . Likewise, the second organization  may have its resources provisioned by the third party RPM service provider using the third party server  through the network . The third party RPM service provider may interface with the second organization's agents  through the network  to provision resources for the second organization . Thus, in this embodiment, both organizations ,  utilize a single logical server  operated and controlled by the third party RPM service provider.","According to this embodiment of the invention, both organizations may take advantage of the efficiency of a single logical third party server  operated by a third party over a network , thereby removing the costs associated with purchasing and operating a server for resource provisioning activities. Also, the third party RPM service provider may function as a data center and provide resource provisioning as a managed service to the organizations , , whereby the organizations ,  may become customers of the third party RPM service provider. The managed service may be provided on a subscription basis, whereby any organization desirous of such services may pay a set periodic fee for all of its resource provisioning needs.","For example, assume it is the policy of a first company to provide its salespersons with an email account and access to its customer database. Assume also that this first company has chosen to outsource its resource provisioning requirements to a trusted third party RPM service provider. Assume also that it is the policy of a second company to provide all its employees with an account on its networking operating system, and that the second company has also chosen to outsource its resource provisioning requirements to a trusted third party RPM service provider. Both companies would provide the trusted third party RPM service provider with relevant employee information and the nature of the access rights to be granted to the salespersons of the first company and the employees of the second company. Such information could be provided by both companies to the trusted third party RPM service provider over a network such as, for example, the Internet.","The trusted third party RPM service provider may maintain such information on its server or servers. This would allow the trusted third party RPM service provider to immediately provision a new salesperson or new employee with the required resources. All that would be required to effect such provisioning would be that each company provide the trusted third party RPM service provider with relevant changes to salesperson or employee information. Based on such changes, the trusted third party RPM service provider could create, change or remove accounts or otherwise modify provisioning on required resources. Alternatively, each company could provide the trusted third party RPM service provider with the exact nature of the provisioning change required.","A flowchart detailing a method for implementing the embodiment of  is shown in  request for provisioning services is received by a third party RPM service provider at step . Such a request may be made by one or more companies needing such services. The request may be made via electronic means or by personal contact between the appropriate persons at the company and at the third party RPM service provider.","At step , the third party RPM service provider receives user information from the company making the request. This information may include, but is not limited to, user name, user number, a list of resources to which the user will have access, the nature of the access rights, and the like. This information may be sent electronically from the customer to the third party RPM service provider using a network, such as, for example, the Internet. The third party RPM service provider will also receive notification that the user is authorized to access the appropriate resources from the customer at step . This information may also be sent electronically from the customer to the third party RPM service provider using a network, such as, for example, the Internet.","At step , the third party RPM service provider provisions the relevant resource or resources for the user via agents. It should be noted that many systems may be provisioned at this step to effect the required provisioning. Such provisioning may also take place over a network. Once the resource or resources have been provisioned for the user, the user is notified accordingly at step  and is then at liberty to utilize the resource or resources in accordance with the provisioning policy established by her employer. This process may be repeated as many times as necessary for each company making a request to the third party RPM service provider for provisioning of its resources.","A flowchart detailing an alternative method for implementing the embodiment of  is shown in  change in user information is received by a third party RPM service provider at step . The changes may be received via electronic means over a network, such as, for example, the Internet, or by personal contact between the appropriate persons at the company and at the third party RPM service provider and may include, without limitation, changes in user name, user role, user organization, user title, user location, and the like. Also, such changes may be received automatically. For example, a mechanism may be implemented whereby any changes made to a company's human resources database are automatically sent to or retrieved by the third party RPM service provider.","At step , the third party RPM service provider determines which changes in resource access rights are needed based on the user information changes received. This may be done independently of the company sending changes in user information. At step , the third party RPM service provider obtains any approvals necessary for provisioning changes prior to effecting such provisioning.","At step , once the necessary approvals have been received, if any, the third party RPM service provider provisions, which may include, without limitation, deprovisioning, the relevant resource or resources for the user via agents. It should be noted that many systems may be provisioned at this step to effect the required provisioning. Also, resources may be provisioned in parallel. Such provisioning may also take place over a network. Once the resource or resources have been provisioned for the user, the user is notified accordingly at step  and is then at liberty to utilize the resource or resources in accordance with the provisioning policy established by her employer.","In the embodiment of the invention shown in , the resources being provisioned may all be contained within a customer's \u201cinformation technology\u201d space. That is, the resources being provisioned may not necessarily exist at the customer's site, but may be within the realm and under the control of the customer. For example, these types of resources may include, but are not limited to, email, operating systems and databases. Such resources may exist worldwide, but, nonetheless, may still be within the control of the customer.","An enhancement to the embodiment of  is shown in FIG. . In this embodiment, resources  external to the first organization  and the second organization  may be accessed and utilized by both organizations ,  through a network  and provisioned for both organizations ,  by a third party RPM service provider using a third party server . The third party RPM service provider and the organizations ,  may interface with these resources  via agents.","For example, continuing with the example used in reference to , assume the first company and the second company provide all of their management level employees with a charge card account, such as, for example, an AMERICAN EXPRESS card. Assume also that both companies have also chosen to outsource its provisioning requirements for this resource to a trusted third party RPM service provider. Both companies would provide the trusted third party RPM service provider with relevant employee information, such as, for example, the names of employees who have management positions within their respective companies, the employee numbers of such employees, the charging authority granted to each individual employee, and the like. Such information may be provided by both companies to the trusted third party RPM service provider over a network such as, for example, the Internet.","The trusted third party RPM service provider would then establish the appropriate relationship with the charge card company such that the trusted third party RPM service provider would have the requisite authority to establish accounts on behalf of the companies and provision employees of both companies with charge cards for such accounts through agents. Once the relationships between the companies and the trusted third party RPM service provider, the companies and the charge card company, and the trusted third party RPM service provider and the charge card company have been established, the provisioning of employees at any of the companies with a charge card account may be immediate. All that is necessary is that a company notify the trusted third party RPM service provider of its provisioning requirement and supply the trusted third party RPM service provider with the necessary employee information. The trusted third party RPM service provider can then establish the account with the charge card company and instruct the charge card company to forward one or more charge cards to the employee of the company for whom the account is being established.","Another alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . In this embodiment, any number of companies ,  may use a third party RPM service provider for provisioning resources through agents , . These companies ,  may utilize their own resources and have these resources provisioned through a network , such as, for example, the Internet, by the third party RPM service provider using a third party server . However, these companies ,  may also be considered vendors of their respective resources and may choose to affiliate themselves with one another and share resources. This is easily facilitated due to the third party RPM service provider being a common and trusted link to each vendor. Thus, the resources owned and operated by each affiliate organization may be \u201ccross-provisioned\u201d among the affiliated organizations by the third party RPM service provider. This embodiment of the invention may also be described as a \u201cresource exchange.\u201d","Also, according to this embodiment of the invention, the infrastructure may be considered semi-private because, although it is not completely private as the enterprise and ASP embodiments described previously are, it is also not completely open to the public. The infrastructure, and, consequently, the resources available within the infrastructure, may be open only to those vendors of resources who have chosen to affiliate themselves with other vendors utilizing a third party RPM service provider for purposes of having such resources provisioned by such a service provider.","As an example of the embodiment of the invention shown in , suppose that a first vendor belonging to a resource exchange, i.e., belonging to a provisioning infrastructure, has the capability to provide email systems for other organizations. Suppose also that a second vendor in the same resource exchange provides database access to various consumer lists. Suppose also that the first vendor determines it has a need for various consumer lists and decides it would like to obtain the database information controlled by the second vendor. Finally, suppose that the second vendor determines it would like to implement an email system for its employees. Then, upon notification by each company to the third party RPM service provider, the third party RPM service provider may cross-provision the first vendor with the database resource belonging to the second vendor. Likewise, the third party RPM service provider may cross-provision the second vendor with the email system provided by the first vendor. In this type of cross-provisioning embodiment and others, because the third party RPM service provider is a trusted authority, it may mask the identity of the an employee or employees, which may be original or true identities, by provisioning a \u201cpseudo-account\u201d for the second vendor.","Because both vendors are members of the resource exchange, most, if not all, of the information required by the third party RPM service provider for cross-provisioning of the resources for each vendor will already be available to the third party RPM service provider. In addition, both vendors will typically have entered into an agreement regarding the cross-provisioning of resources, such agreement generally being a condition precedent to becoming a member of the resource exchange, the details governing such cross-provisioning will already have been put in place. Thus, the provisioning of the desired resources may be immediate once the request for provisioning is made.","As another example of the embodiment of the invention shown in , suppose that an organization in a resource exchange contracts with a charge card company providing that every vice-president in the organization be given access to one of the charge card company's charge accounts. Assuming that the charge card company is also a member of the resource exchange, as soon as the contract is effective, each vice-president in the organization may immediately and automatically be provisioned by the third party RPM service provider, through the resource exchange, with a charge card company charge accounts. There need be no additional flow of individual information to effectuate the provisioning. All information required for the provisioning of the organization's vice-presidents with charge accounts will already be available on the system, since both the organization and the charge card company will have already been members of the exchange. However, if desired, additional approval processes may be executed prior to any such provisioning.","Also, the provisioning may be done in the aggregate. Because the organization will have already identified to the third party RPM service provider its policies for the roles and attributes of persons within its organization, such as those policies applicable to vice-presidents, and because the charge card company will have already identified to the third party RPM service provider its policies for anyone who needs to be provisioned with one of its charge accounts, the third party RPM service provider can coordinate the requirements of both organizations and expeditiously provision the vice-presidents with charge accounts.","For example, the organization might have a policy that says vice-presidents get an annual spending limit of $100,000. The charge account might be set, then, to limit annual purchases for vice-presidents to $100,000. Also, the organization might have a policy that says any single purchase by a vice-president cannot be greater than $10,000 without approval from the president. Thus, the charge account might be set, then, with a single purchase limit for vice-presidents of $10,000. So, once a role and its attributes have been established in the system, it can immediately be adapted to the provisioning of a resource without further effort by the organization.","In this embodiment, a user can also be de-provisioned very quickly. For example, assume a vice-president in the organization is terminated or leaves the organization. Although her paychecks may stop immediately, her charge account could typically remain open until the end of the month. This could be very dangerous for the organization in that the vice-president may still have purchasing power on the charge account even though she is no longer affiliated with the organization. In this embodiment, if the organization tells the third party RPM service provider that the vice-president is no longer with the organization, the third party RPM service provider can immediately de-provision the vice-president from her charge card account, thereby protecting the organization from unauthorized usage.","A flowchart detailing a method for implementing the embodiment of  is shown in  request for provisioning services is received by a third party RPM service provider at step . Such a request may be made by one or more companies needing such services. The request may be made via electronic means or by personal contact between the appropriate persons at the company and at the third party RPM service provider. However, in this embodiment the provision request is made for a resource not owned or operated by the company making the request. For example, a company might make a request for email provisioning, but, in actuality, the company might not have an email resource. Accordingly, the company would be looking to an affiliate within the resource exchange to provide email services, and would be looking to the third party RPM service provider to provision such services.","At step , the third party RPM service provider provisions appropriate resources within the resource exchange for the company making the provisioning request. Once provisioning is complete, the user is notified accordingly at step  and is then at liberty to use the resource according to the provisioning policy of the company and in accordance with an agreement between the company requesting the provisioning of the resource and the company providing the resource for provisioning. Typically, such an agreement would be a condition precedent to becoming a member of the exchange.","A flowchart detailing an alternative method for implementing the embodiment of  is shown in  change in user information is received by a third party RPM service provider at step . Such changes may be received by one or more companies having such changes. The changes may be received via electronic means or by personal contact between the appropriate persons at the company and at the third party RPM service provider. Also, such changes may be received automatically. For example, a mechanism may be implemented whereby any changes made to a company's human resources database are automatically sent to or retrieved by the third party RPM service provider.","Also, in this embodiment the changes may be for users who are provisioned for a resource or resources not owned or operated by the company by whom the user is employed. For example, a company might have a change for a user with respect to email, but, in actuality, the company might not have an email resource. Accordingly, the company would be looking to an affiliate within the resource exchange to provide its email services.","At step , the third party RPM service provider determines which changes in resource access rights are needed based on the user information changes received. This may be done independently of the company sending changes in user information. At step , the third party RPM service provider obtains any approvals necessary for provisioning changes prior to effecting such provisioning.","At step , the third party RPM service provider provisions, which may include, without limitation, deprovisioning, appropriate resources within the resource exchange for the company providing changes in user information. Provisioning of multiple resources may be done in parallel. Once provisioning is complete, the user is notified accordingly at step  and is then at liberty to use the resource or resources according to the provisioning policy of the company and in accordance with an agreement between the company requesting the provisioning of the resource and the company providing the resource for provisioning. Typically, such an agreement would be a condition precedent to becoming a member of the exchange.","Billing for cross-provisioning services among affiliates may take a variety of forms. For example, a transaction fee may be applied by a vendor each time a resource is provisioned. Such fee may be payable to the customer requesting provisioning to the vendor of the resource, with a percentage of such fee payable to the third party RPM service provider. Alternatively, a subscription may be paid by a customer requesting provisioning to the vendor of a resource such that all provisioning fees are included in the subscription rate. This type of billing arrangement may be attractive to a customer with heavy provisioning needs if such needs can be anticipated.","Various techniques to facilitate the cross-provisioning of resources among affiliates may be included, without limitation, in the embodiment shown in FIG. . For example, to facilitate cross-provisioning of resources in a resource exchange, a \u201cfootprint\u201d of the roles and attributes within each affiliate organization in the exchange may be made generic. That is, each role within one affiliate organization may translate to a corresponding role in another affiliate organization. This may be made possible by a translational map that translates roles from one affiliate into another. For example, a sales engineer in one affiliate may be referred to as a technical sales consultant in another affiliate. Even though these two positions may be identified differently in their respective organizations, the duties required by the positions may be the same in the context of the exchange. Thus, the third party RPM service provider may maintain a translational map that coordinates the access rights and entitlements of these two positions between affiliate resources. So, a sales engineer in a first affiliate may have the same entitlement to resources as a technical sales consultant in a second affiliate and vice versa. The third party RPM service provider may provide a mapping to standard affiliate organizational footprints or standard policies.","Another technique used to facilitate the cross-provisioning of resources among affiliates in the embodiment shown in  relates to high level authentication of affiliates. Success of an affiliate resource exchange may require that each affiliate be authenticated with respect to various business and financial aspects of such affiliates, including, without limitation, background checks, credit worthiness checks, cash flow checks, and other aspects of an affiliate's business and financial viability. Such high level authentication may be performed by the third party RPM service provider and used in addition to an authentication of identity provided by various techniques including, but not limited to, passwords and multifactor approaches such as PKI and biometrics.","Yet another technique used to facilitate the cross-provisioning of resources among affiliates in the embodiment shown in  relates to identity synchronization. In order for cross-provisioning of resources to function smoothly in a resource exchange, updated information regarding resource users and affiliates within the exchange must be readily available. For example, should an affiliate leave the exchange, this must be reflected as soon as possible within the list of resource exchange affiliates so that other affiliates may plan and take action accordingly, especially if the departure of an individual means exposure to loss for a critical resource of another affiliate. Conversely, should an organization providing a valuable resource or resources become a member of the exchange, such information should also be made available to other affiliates of the exchange so that they may readily take advantage of the additional resource or resources available. Such a resource or resources may be registered in the exchange and provisioned accordingly by the third party RPM service provider.","A third party RPM service provider may provide such identity synchronization within the resource exchange. Such synchronization is made possible from a practical standpoint due to the fact that the third party RPM service provider may function as a data center for all affiliate members of the resource exchange. Thus, all information required to update resource exchange information is available on one logical server and updates can, therefore, be made quickly and efficiently.","Yet another technique used to facilitate the cross-provisioning of resources among affiliates in the embodiment shown in  relates to audit trails. It may be advantageous for security, accountability and other reasons for each affiliate of the resource exchange to have a record of each cross-provisioning transaction completed for its own resources by the third party RPM service provider. Moreover, it may also be advantageous for each affiliate of the exchange to have a record of each cross-provisioning transaction completed for its users of another affiliate's resources. A third party RPM service provider may provide an audit trail, i.e., a record of each provisioning transaction, for affiliates of the resource exchange. Such an audit trail may be implemented by a third party RPM service provider since, as before, a third party RPM service provider may function as a data center for all affiliate members of the resource exchange. Thus, all information regarding provisioning transactions may be easily recorded and provided to affiliate members at their request.","Yet another technique used to facilitate the cross-provisioning of resources among affiliates in the embodiment shown in  relates to anonymity of individuals and organizations interacting with resources. In the event resource usage within a resource exchange is subject to interaction, such as, for example, bidding, identities of the affiliates involved in such interaction may be made anonymous during the interaction process. That is, during such interaction, affiliate identities may be masked out so that the interaction process is not skewed by the identity of the affiliates.","There may be three levels of anonymity implemented in a resource exchange. First, there may be no anonymity at all. Using bidding as an example, it may be unimportant to the affiliates that their identities remain anonymous during a bidding process. Consequently, their identities may be made known to the other affiliates bidding on a resource. Second, the identities of affiliates bidding on a resource may be masked out, but a user doing the actual bidding may be assigned some type of unique identifier to be used for all bidding sessions. Third, the identities of affiliates bidding on a resource may be masked out and a generic identifier used for only one bidding session may be assigned to a user doing the actual bidding; at subsequent bidding sessions, a different generic identifier may be assigned to the same user doing the actual bidding. Such anonymity may be facilitated by a third party RPM service provider since a third party RPM service provider functions as a centralized provider of provisioning services for all affiliate members of the resource exchange. Thus, identities of the affiliates may be masked at the discretion of the affiliates by the third party RPM service provider, such identities remaining anonymous if an affiliate so chooses.","Another alternative embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. . In this embodiment, any individual organization of the general public  may use a third party RPM service provider for provisioning resources, as opposed to vendors providing resources that are provisioned for affiliate use in a resource exchange. Here, the third party RPM service provider provides the infrastructure to allow any individual organization of the general public requiring provisioning services to obtain such services, thus providing a public provisioning infrastructure. This configuration supports customers without resources to utilize the resources of a resource exchange or other external resources that are part of a public provisioning infrastructure.","To effect the embodiment of the invention shown in , the third party RPM service provider may provide any individual organization of the general public , which includes, without limitation, users, organizations and affiliates, with a \u201cticket\u201d subsequent to the verification of the user's identity. The \u201cticket\u201d may associate the user with entitlement, policies, attributes, roles and rules in connection with the provisioned resources. An organization may have, for example, an \u201corganizational footprint\u201d that defines which of the positions in an organization are entitled to various resources and also defines the level of access to and utilization of those resources to which the particular position is entitled. For example, if a person in an organization is a salesperson, the ticket may give the salesperson access to every resource to which the salesperson is entitled based on the rules defined in the organizational footprint. So, for example, if someone obtains a ticket, that person gets footprint access into the resources of the infrastructure, or the resource exchange, made available to it by virtue of the footprint, ticket and the authenticity of the user's identification.","Tickets may be authenticated and verified by a trusted third party RPM service provider. Attributes for tickets may vary widely. A ticket may be transferable, it may exist for a specific length of time, or it may have various access rights associated with it. A ticket may exist for one person, several persons, or an entire organization. For example, suppose a law firm has a need to use a resource such as an information database. Assume that the law firm enters into an agreement with the information database resource provider and also enters into an agreement with a trusted third party RPM service provider to provision its employees with access to the database. Then, the trusted third party RPM service provider will generate a ticket for such access. Each lawyer in the firm would then get a ticket for access to the database in accordance with firm policy. Alternatively, the entire firm may receive one ticket for access to the database. The ticket may be good for a set period of time and may provide each attorney with certain access rights with respect to the database. At the end of the set period of time, the law firm may analyze usage and cost associated with the database and modify the access rights on the ticket.","Continuing with this example, assume a new attorney joins the law firm. Because the law firm has already entered into an agreement with the third party service provider to provision its attorneys with the database, and because the law firm has already entered into an agreement with the database resource provider to utilize the database, all the law firm need do to provision the new attorney with database access is to provide information to the third party RPM service provider indicating that a new attorney has joined the firm and provide the third party RPM service provider with relevant information regarding the new attorney. Because resource providers are provided with tickets, the third party RPM service provider will then generate a ticket and send it to the database resource provider. In turn, the database resource provider will set up an account for the new attorney. The new attorney may then access the database, subject only to authentication of her identity by PKI or another identity authentication method.","A flowchart detailing a method for implementing the embodiment of  is shown in  request for provisioning services may be received by a third party RPM service provider at step . Such a request may be made by an individual organization in the general public needing such services. The request may be made via electronic means or by personal contact between the appropriate persons at the organization and at the third party RPM service provider. At step , the third party RPM service provider allocates appropriate space on its server to accommodate the data processing needs of the organization making the service request.","At step , the third party RPM service provider receives user information from the organization making the request. This information may include, but is not limited to, user name, user number, a list of resources for which the user desires access, the nature of the access rights, and the like. This information may be sent electronically from the organization to the third party RPM service provider using a network, such as, for example, the Internet. The third party RPM service provider will then provision the user with the requested resources at step . Once the user has been provisioned with the resources, the user is at liberty to use such resources pursuant to agreements entered into between the third party RPM service provider and the individual organization and the resource provider and the individual organization.","The embodiment of  may be likened to a hub and spoke configuration, wherein the third party RPM service provider is the hub and groupings of affiliations or individual organizations in the general public exist at the end of each spoke. In this embodiment, all levels of access may be permitted within the confines of the public provisioning infrastructure. For example, assume that a non-computing resource such as a charge card account exists within a resource exchange of affiliated companies. If an individual organization in the general public who is not a member of the resource exchange desires to be provisioned with such charge accounts, it may enter the infrastructure by requesting that a trusted third party RPM service provider generate a ticket for it that provides it with access to the charge accounts in the exchange.","A graphical diagram showing various levels of embodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. . At the central location provisioning level , various organizations  may obtain resource provisioning from a third party RPM resource provider. At an affiliate level , various resource vendors  may be part of a resource exchange, sharing resources with other affiliates  within the exchange. At a public provisioning infrastructure level , an individual organization  may obtain access to resources within the infrastructure, subject to receipt of a provisioning ticket and appropriate identity authentication.","The embodiments shown in  may be used in connection with a public key infrastructure (PKI), i.e., an infrastructure providing identification authentication and certificates. Using PKI, the identity, privacy and nonrepudiation of users of embodiments of the present invention, which includes, without limitation, companies, organizations, vendors, and affiliates, as well as members of the general public, may be assured. Once an identity is assured by PKI, provisioning of a resource for a user may occur. A provisioning infrastructure may be coupled with a PKI such that identity is authenticated and resources are provided based on the identity and the relationship between the identity and the provisioning policy of an organization making a resource available to a user. PKIs are well known in the art and will not be described in detail here.
