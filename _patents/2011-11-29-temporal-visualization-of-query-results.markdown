title: Temporal visualization of query results
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for constructing a temporal visualization of query results. That is, query results associated with temporal information, such as timestamps, may be used to create a temporal distribution (e.g., query results comprising images and image capture dates, web pages and web page creation dates, etc.). The temporal distribution may comprise a distribution of the query results over time (e.g., query results may be sorted and/or grouped based upon dates specified by the timestamps). A temporal visualization of the query results may be constructed using the temporal distribution. For example, query results may be assigned to date slots within the temporal visualization. The temporal visualization may illustrate a substantial number of query results (e.g., thousands) that may otherwise not be visually presentable at once. Zoom commands and/or hover commands may be processed to provide finer and/or coarser granularity of the query results.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Searching tools, such as a search engine, may provide a user with query results in response to a query submitted by the user. The query results may comprise a subset of available data, which may be tailored to the interests of the user as expressed by the query. Searching tools may be available for various types of data, such as a web search engine (e.g., for web pages, web images, web videos, etc.), a database search tool (e.g., for database entries), a file system search tool (e.g., for files stored by a file system), and\/or a variety of other search tools for various data. Current searching tools generally provide query results as a list of data. In one example, a web search engine may provide a list of search result web pages organized by relevancy. In another example, an image searching tool may provide a visual list of search result images organized by relevancy. Unfortunately, searching tools may not present query results in a manner that may facilitate further exploration of query results beyond a first portion of the returned results. For example, merely 10 search results may be presented per search result page such that a user may have to navigate to a second search result page to see search results 11-20, a third search result page to see search results 21-30, etc.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques for creating a temporal visualization of query results are disclosed herein. For example, query results associated with a query may be received. The query results may, for example, be provided by a searching tool (e.g., a web search engine may provide web page search results, an image search engine may provide image search results, a social network may provide social network updates, an ecommerce website may provide product information, a database search engine may provide database entries, etc.). It may be appreciated that the query results may comprise various types of data associated with temporal information, such as timestamps (e.g., a crawl and\/or creation date associated with a web page, a publication date associated with a social network update, a creation date associated with a video, a first access date associated with an image, etc.).","A temporal distribution of the query results may be created based upon timestamps associated with respective query results. For example, the query results may be organized and\/or sorted according to dates specified by the timestamps (e.g., the query results may be organized based upon publication dates). A temporal visualization of the query results may be constructed using the temporal distribution. In one example, the temporal visualization may illustrate query results as a graph (e.g., an X axis may comprise a date range comprising date slots to which query results may be assigned (e.g., plotted as points within the graph), and a Y axis may comprise markings representing numbers of query results per date slot). In this way, a distribution of query results (e.g., thousands of query results) may be illustrated within the temporal visualization according to dates (e.g., as opposed to conventional query result pages that may display, for example, 10 query results per page sorted according to relevancy).","Visual indicators may be associated with date slots and\/or query results assigned to date slots. For example, a visual indicator (e.g., a color indicator) may be associated with one or more query results assigned to a date slot within the temporal visualization based upon a total number of query results assigned to the date slot. For example, a date slot Feb. 7, 2010 may comprise a substantial number of query results associated with a query \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d (e.g., a number of query results above a threshold, such as 300 query results). The query results assigned to date slot Feb. 7, 2010 may be colored red to visually indicate to a user that date slot Feb. 7, 2010 may comprise interesting\/relevant query results (e.g., given the abundance of results at this time, at least some results in this set of query results are likely to be particularly relevant to the query). In this way, the user may quickly identify date slots likely to comprise interesting\/relevant query results.","Because such a large amount of query results may be illustrated within the temporal visualization, query results may be assigned relevancy rankings so that subsets of query results may be presented to the user. For example, a user may hover over a particular date slot within the temporal visualization using a cursor. A subset of query results assigned to the date slot may be identified based upon the subset of query results being assigned desired relevancy rankings (e.g., a number N of query results assigned comparatively high relevancy rankings may be identified as the subset of query results for the date slot; query results comprising relevancy rankings above a threshold ranking may be identified as the subset of query results for the date slot; etc.). In this way, the subset of query results, which may be highly interesting and\/or relevant to the user, may be presented to the user.","A storyline may be constructed from the temporal visualization to aid a user in viewing the query results. For example, one or more date slots within the temporal visualization may be identified based upon the one or more date slots comprising concentrations of query results (e.g., a date slot assigned a number of query results above a threshold number). The storyline may be constructed from at least one query result from respective date slots (e.g., a query result from a date slot may be used based upon the query result being assigned a desired relevancy ranking). In this way, the storyline may comprise one or more search results highly representative of the query, which may \u201ctell a story\u201d of the query results over time (e.g., the storyline may illustrate query results that may be representative of the query from various dates).","Various commands may be received through the temporal visualization. For example, a zoom command comprising a selected time span of the temporal visualization may be received (e.g., zoom-in command and\/or a zoom-out command). A second temporal visualization comprising query results associated with the selected time span may be created and\/or presented. In this way, a user may interact with the temporal visualizations to explore the query results at various levels of granularity.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing subject matter.","Today, users create, organize, share, search, and\/or interact with a plethora of data, such as images, videos, files, social network information, etc. In one example, a user may upload images to a photo sharing website. The photo sharing website may comprise an image search engine that may allow other users to search for and\/or interact with such images. In another example, an ecommerce website may comprise a database search engine that may provide consumers with product information retrieved from a products database. Generally, query results are presented to a user based upon relevance of query results to a query (e.g., a first results page may comprise the top 10 relevant query results, a second results page may comprise the next top 10 relevant query results, etc.). Such query results may be presented on a small scale. For example, even though a query may return thousands of query results, merely 10 or so query results may be presented per results page.","Accordingly, among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques for creating a temporal visualization of query results are provided herein. The temporal visualization may illustrate query results within a temporal domain. That is, the temporal visualization may comprise a temporal distribution of the query results (e.g. query results may be organized, grouped, sorted, and\/or illustrated based upon temporal information, such as timestamps). It may be appreciated that a wide variety of query results may be utilized in constructing a temporal visualization. For example, query results associated with temporal information, such as timestamps, may be utilized in constructing the temporal visualization (e.g., timestamps corresponding to publication dates, crawl dates, first access dates, modification dates, creation dates, and\/or a variety of other dates).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","104","102","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["110","112","114","114","112"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["120","122","124","124","122"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1D","b":["130","132","134","132","134"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1E","b":["140","142","144","144","142","144"]},"One embodiment of constructing a temporal visualization of query results is illustrated by an exemplary method  in . At , the method starts. At , query results associated with a query may be received. For example, query results may comprise images, text, videos, web pages, social network updates, social network communication, database entries, ecommerce website data, and\/or a plethora of other types of data associated with temporal information, such as timestamps (e.g., publication dates, crawl dates, first access dates, modification dates, creation dates, etc.). At , a temporal distribution of query results may be created based upon timestamps associated with respective query results. It may be appreciated that one example of a temporal distribution is illustrated in  as temporal distribution . In one example, the temporal distribution may comprise query results organized and\/or sorted based upon dates specified by the timestamps. In another example, the temporal distribution may comprise groupings of query results associated with date slots (e.g., query results with associated timestamps of Jan. 6, 2010 may be grouped into a date slot Jan. 6, 2010, query results with associated timestamps of Jan. 7, 2010 may be grouped into a date slot Jan. 7, 2010, etc.). It may be appreciated that the query results may be organized in various manners to create the temporal distribution.","At , a temporal visualization of the query results may be constructed using the temporal distribution. It may be appreciated that one example of a temporal visualization is illustrated in  as temporal visualization . It may be appreciated that the temporal visualization may be constructed in real-time during a search query session (e.g., in response to a user submitting the query to a searching tool). In one example of constructing the temporal visualization, a date range may be assigned to the temporal visualization based upon the temporal distribution (e.g., an x axis of the temporal visualization may be assigned a date range of date slots associated with dates specified within the temporal distribution). Query results may be assigned to corresponding date slots within the date range based upon respective timestamps of the query results (e.g., query results comprising a Jan. 7, 2010 timestamp may be assigned to a date slot Jan. 7, 2010 within the date range, query results comprising a Feb. 12, 2011 timestamp may be assigned to a date slot Feb. 12, 2011 within the date range, etc.). In one example, the query results may be illustrated within the temporal visualization as a graph. For example, representations of query results may be plotting along the date range (e.g., the x axis) of the temporal visualization at corresponding date slots. A y axis of the temporal visualization may comprise markings representing numbers of query results per date slot (e.g., thus forming a graph of query results per date slot). In this way, the temporal visualization may comprise a graph that represents query results as points on the graph, for example. It may be appreciated that the temporal visualization may comprise a variety of different types of graphs and\/or may comprise visualizations other than graphs (e.g., graphical illustrates of query results organized and\/or listed by dates, textual descriptions of query results organized and\/or listed by dates, etc.). Moreover, a date slot and\/or the like as used herein may comprise more than a day, such as multiple days, a week, month, etc. or less than a day, such as few hours, minutes, etc. That is, (unless clearly indicated to the contrary) a date slot and\/or the like as used herein may comprise any amount of time and is not to be limited to a day, for example.","To aid a user in identifying and\/or visualizing query results within the temporal visualization, visual indicators may be provided. In one example, a visual indicator may be associated with a date slot and\/or one or more query results assigned to the date slot within the temporal visualization. The visual indicator may, for example, be based upon a total number of query results assigned to the date slot (e.g., query results assigned to a first date slot comprising a comparatively low number of query results may be colored green, query results assigned to a second date slot comprising a comparatively high number of query results may be colored red, etc.). In another example, a concentration of query results assigned to a date slot within the temporal visualization may be identified based upon the date slot being assigned a number of query results above a threshold number. A visual indicator may be associated with the query results and\/or the date slot. In this way, a user may be able to visually identify interesting and\/or relevant query results (e.g., a date slot corresponding to a day the super bowl occurred may comprise a comparatively high number of query results for a query \u201csuper bowl\u201d, and thus query results assigned to the date slot may be colored red). It may be appreciated that a variety of other visual indicators may be used (e.g., bolding of font, increasing sizes of query results, pop-up indictors, text indicators, etc.).","Because a substantial number of query results may be used to construct the temporal visualization, relevancy rankings may be assigned to query results so that subsets of query results that may be interesting and\/or relevant to a user may be identified and\/or presented. For example, a subset of query results assigned to a date slot within the temporal visualization may be identified based upon the subset of query results being assigned desired relevancy rankings (e.g., relevancy rankings above a threshold rank, a top N number of ranked query results for the date slot, etc.). In this way, the subset of query results may be presented within the temporal visualization (e.g., upon a user hovering over a date slot, a subset of query results comprising highly relevant query results assigned to the date slot may be presented).","A storyline may be may be constructed from the temporal vitalization to aid a user in viewing the query results. That is, because the temporal visualization may be constructed from a substantial number of query results (e.g., the temporal visualization may comprise a graph that represents thousands of query results as points on the graph), a storyline may be constructed to provide the user with a short synopsis of query results over time. The storyline may comprise one or more query results from various date slots that may be representative of the query (e.g., a query for \u201csuper bowl images\u201d may result in a storyline comprising super bowl images, with high relevancy rankings, from date slots corresponding to dates of the super bowl over the past 30 years). In one example of creating a storyline, one or more date slots within the temporal visualization may be identified based upon the one or more date slots comprising concentrations of query results (e.g., a date slot assigned a number of query results above a threshold number). The storyline may be constructed from at least one query result from respective date slots (e.g., a query result from a date slot may be used based upon the query result being assigned a desired relevancy ranking). In this way, the storyline may comprise one or more query results highly representative of the query over time (e.g., query results from various dates that may be interesting and\/or relevant to the user).","The temporal visualization may be presented to a user through an interactive interface, such as a graphical user interface, a web page, etc., which may allow the user to interact with the temporal visualization. In one example, a zoom command, such as a zoom-in command and\/or a zoom-out command, comprising a selected time span of the temporal visualization may be received. A second temporal visualization comprising query results associated with the selected time span may be constructed. A zoomed-in temporal visualization may illustrate the query results at a finer granularity (e.g., thumbnail images may represent query results within the second temporal visualization, as opposed to merely points on a graph). A zoomed-out temporal visualization may illustrate the query results at a coarse granularity, which may provide the user with a \u201cbigger picture\u201d view of query results over a longer time range. In another example, a hover command comprising a referenced time span of the temporal visualization may be received (e.g., a user may hover over a query result and\/or a date slot with a cursor, the user may select one or more query results and\/or date slots with the cursor, etc.). A subset of query results assigned to the referenced time span may be presented based upon the subset of query results being assigned desired relevancy ranking. In one example, if a user hovers over a date slot, then a number N of top ranking query results assigned to the date slot may be used to create the subset of query results. In another example, if a user selects one or more query results, then the one or more query results may be used to create the subset of query results (e.g., desired relevancy rankings may represent any relevancy ranking because the user selection is specifying the exact query results to be used). In this way, the user may visually explore the query results within the temporal visualization.

For example, a date range of date slots  may be assigned to the temporal visualization  as an x axis of a graph, and markings representing results per date slot  may be assigned to the temporal visualization  as a y axis of the graph. In this way, query results  may be assigned to date slots within the temporal visualization  (e.g., query results  may be plotted as thumbnails, text, symbols, and\/or points, etc. within the graph).","The visualization component  may be configured to associate a visual indicator with one or more query results assigned to a date slot within the temporal visualization  based upon a total number of query results, for example, assigned to the date slot. For example, date slot  may comprise a comparatively high concentration of query results. The visualization component  may detect the high concentration, and may assign a visual indicator to date slot  (e.g., query results assigned to date slot  may be colored red). In this way, a user may visually identify potentially interesting and\/or relevant query results.","The visualization component  may be configured to construct a storyline. For example, the visualization component  may identify one or more date slots within the temporal visualization  comprising concentrations of query results based upon the one or more date slots being assigned numbers of query results above a threshold number (e.g., date slot  may be assigned a number of query results above a threshold number, such as 250 query results). The visualization component  may construct the storyline comprising at least one query result from respective date slots assigned numbers of query results above a threshold number (e.g., a query result from a date slot may comprise a desired relevancy ranking for the date slot, such as a highest ranked query result).","The interaction component  may be configured to process various commands associated with the temporal visualization  (e.g., to provide a user with an interactive experience with the temporal visualization ). In one example, the interaction component  may receive a zoom command comprising a selected time span of the temporal visualization  (e.g., a zoom-in command and\/or a zoom-out command). The interaction component  may construct a second temporal visualization comprising query results associated with the selected time span. In another example, the interaction component  may receive a hover command comprising a referenced time span of the temporal visualization .

Query results may be assigned to various date slots within the date range  (e.g., as points, symbols, images, and\/or text along the x axis). For example, query results associated with a date Jan. 8, 2011 within the temporal distribution may be assigned to a Jan. 8, 2011 date slot (e.g., the query results may be illustrated as points on a graph, thumbnails, text, etc.).

Date slot  may comprise a comparatively medium concentration of query results, and thus the date slot  may be assigned a slash fill pattern to indicate that the query results within date slot  may be of some interest and\/or relevance. Date slot  may comprise a comparatively low concentration of query results, and thus the date slot  may be assigned a stripe fill pattern to indicate that the query results within date slot  may be of low interest and\/or relevance.
