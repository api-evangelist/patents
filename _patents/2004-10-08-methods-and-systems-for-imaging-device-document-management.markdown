{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS","Device Function API'","Security"],"p":["Imaging devices such as printers, copiers, scanners and fax machines can have a wide array of functions and capabilities to fit specific uses or combinations of uses. Imaging devices often take the form of a multi-function peripheral device (MFP) that combines the functions of two or more of the traditionally separated imaging devices. An MFP may combine any number of imaging devices, but typically comprises the functions of a printer, scanner, copier and fax machine.","Some imaging devices may contain computing resources for data storage and processing such as processors, hard disk drives, memory and other devices. As imaging devices add more features and functions, they become more costly and complex.","More complex imaging devices and MFPs may comprise network connectivity to provide communication with other computing devices, such as personal computers, other imaging devices, network servers and other apparatus. This connectivity allows the imaging device to utilize off-board resources that are available on a connected network.","Imaging devices typically have a user input panel with an array of buttons, knobs and other user input devices. Some devices also have a display panel, which can be for display only or can be a touch panel display that enables user input directly on the display.","Devices with touch panel displays or displays with buttons arranged in cooperation with the display can display menu data that may be selected by user input. This menu data is typically driven by an on-board server module within the imaging device.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems, methods and devices for interacting with a remote computing device from an imaging device. These embodiments comprise remote computing devices configured to communicate with imaging devices, imaging devices configured to communicate with remote computing devices and systems comprising various combinations of remote computing devices in communication with imaging devices.","The foregoing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Embodiments of the present invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. The figures listed above are expressly incorporated as part of this detailed description.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the methods and systems of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention but it is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention.","Elements of embodiments of the present invention may be embodied in hardware, firmware and\/or software. While exemplary embodiments revealed herein may only describe one of these forms, it is to be understood that one skilled in the art would be able to effectuate these elements in any of these forms while resting within the scope of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise interfaces and architecture that integrate imaging devices with remote computing device applications and environments to provide solutions that may not be possible solely with an imaging device alone. Some embodiments comprise an infrastructure and set of interfaces that allow applications on a network to programmatically control imaging device functions and interact with a user through an imaging device input panel. Software functions that are not practical within the imaging device can be performed on the server but are accessible from the imaging device.","For the purposes of this specification and claims, an imaging device (IDev) may be described as a device that performs an imaging function. Imaging functions comprise scanning, printing, copying, image transmission (sending and receiving), image conversion and other functions. Exemplary imaging devices comprise printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners, computing devices that transmit, convert or process images and other devices. An IDev may also perform multiple imaging functions. For example, and not by way of limitation, a multi-function peripheral device (MFP), which typically has the capability to perform a plurality of functions comprising a printer, scanner, copier and\/or a facsimile machine or image transmitter\/receiver, is a type of imaging device. Other MFP imaging devices may comprise other combinations of functions and still qualify as an IDev.","For the purposes of this specification and claims, a remote computing device (RCD) is a device capable of processing data and communicating with other devices through a communications link. An RCD is a remote device because it requires a communications link, such as a network connection, a telephone line, a serial cable or some other wired or wireless link to communicate with other devices such as an imaging device. Some exemplary RCDs are network servers, networked computers and other processing and storage devices that have communications links.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . These embodiments comprise an imaging device (IDev)  that may be a multi-function peripheral device (MFP) or a single function device. The imaging device  further comprises a user interface (UI) panel , which may comprise input buttons  and a display device  or may comprise a touch panel system with or without buttons . User input and display may also be performed through a separate UI device , which may be connected to the imaging device  by a communication link , such as a USB connection, a network cable, a wireless connection or some other communications link. UI device  may comprise an input device, such as a keyboard or buttons as well as a display device, which may also be a touch screen panel. UI device  may also comprise an interface for transfer of instructions that are input to the device  from a remote input device. This form of UI device  may comprise memory sticks, USB memory cards and other storage devices that may be configured to store input for transfer to an imaging device.","These embodiments further comprise a remote computing device (RCD)  that is linked to the imaging device  via a communications link , such as a network connection. This network connection may be a typical wired connection or a wireless link.","Embodiments of the present invention may provide menu data from the RCD  to the imaging device UI panel  or remote panel  via the network connection . Once this menu data is fed to the imaging device , an UI panel ,  on the imaging device  may be used to interact with applications that run on the remote computing device . User input received from UI panels ,  may be returned directly to the remote computing device .","A Web Service is a software application identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined, described and discovered by Extensible Markup Language (XML) artifacts and supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via Internet-based protocols.","An application on the remote computing device  may use one or more Web Services to control various features in the imaging device , such as enabling, disabling or setting device values or controlling device functions.","Embodiments of the present invention allow network applications running on remote computing devices to interact with the user of the imaging device through the imaging device I\/O panel. These embodiments allow imaging device user interface (UI) control (i.e., touch panel, button\/display) by applications. Some embodiments may also integrate custom display screens or menus with the native imaging device UI. Embodiments may hand off control of imaging device functions between standard operation modes performed on the imaging device in response to user input to an imaging device UI and open systems modes that utilize network resources, such as applications on RCDs, through user input at the imaging device UI.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise network-based applications that have full control over the imaging device UI to display text and graphics in any format. In these embodiments, the application can programmatically display buttons, textboxes, graphics, etc. in any layout desired.","In some embodiments, the UI layout is easy to program using a standard language, such as a markup language. These languages comprise Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Wireless Markup Language (WML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) and other languages.","In some embodiments of the present invention a remote computing device application or server application is able to request a keyboard UI to be displayed on the imaging device display , . In some embodiments, this functionality is available on the imaging device and does not need to be recreated by remote computing device applications. In some embodiments, the remote computing device may define the keyboard prompt and default values. These embodiments may comprise a remote computing device that is able to rename imaging device UI buttons, such as the OK and Cancel buttons as well as define additional buttons.","In some embodiments, menu templates may be served to the imaging device UI by the imaging device itself  or from a remote computing device .","External Authorization Application","Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise a remote computing device application that is registered as the External Authorization server. The External Authorization application may control access to the imaging device and may have top-level control of the UI. UI control may be given to this application in the same manner that control is given to an internal auditor.","In these embodiments, when an imaging device system boots, it checks to see if an External Authorization application is registered. If so, the imaging device is placed in disabled mode and the application is contacted to take control of the UI. If the External Authorization server is not available, an error message may be displayed and the device may remain disabled. The imaging device may periodically try to contact the External Authorization server until it is available. Table 1 below describes what entity has control of the UI, in an exemplary embodiment, when the device is in a disabled state.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"UI Control in Disabled State"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Button Press","UI Control","Indicator Lights"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Device boots","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Document Filing","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Image Send","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Copy","External Application","None"]},{"entry":["Job Status","Device - standard Job Status","Job Status"]},{"entry":[{},"screens"]},{"entry":["Custom Settings","Device - standard Custom Settings","N\/A"]},{"entry":[{},"screens"]},{"entry":["OS Mode","Not available when device is"]},{"entry":[{},"disabled"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"In embodiments of the present invention, access to the custom UI panels of imaging devices may vary from application to application. Some solutions, such as Document Management integration, may wish to leverage the native Image Send screens, but display some custom UI's to gather additional information about a scan job. Other solutions, like custom printing applications, may be accessed from a separate mode than the native functions.","In order to accommodate the diversified needs of these solutions applications, embodiments may support multiple integration points for UI control. These integration points are based on a user action (\u201ctrigger\u201d) for which applications may register. In some embodiments, applications may be registered with target devices so that the device knows that when \u201ctrigger A\u201d occurs on the front panel to contact \u201cremote computing device B\u201d for instructions. In exemplary embodiments, applications may be integrated with an imaging device at any of several \u201ctrigger\u201d points.","Remote computing devices may be registered to a specific function and contacted when that function's hardware key is pressed (e.g. Image Send) on the imaging device UI. Any UI information provided by the remote computing device may be displayed instead of the standard function screens native to the imaging device. This trigger may be used for applications that wish to replace the existing functions with completely custom UI's, such as an alternative scan solution or a specialized display, such as a \u201cSection 508\u201d compatible screen or other specialized-need interface that may have large buttons or other accommodations.","In some embodiments, each function on the imaging device may have a menu on the touch screen that remote computing devices, such as servers, can register. This enables solutions applications to provide custom content and still use some of the standard functionality provided by the imaging device. When a button assigned to a custom application is selected, a menu will be displayed with the solutions registered to that function. Users may select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.","In some embodiments, a stand-alone RCD mode that provides remote computing device application access can be accessed from the job queue portion of the UI that is displayed on every screen. This trigger point may be used for applications that do not fit within one of the standard device functions, such as custom printing solutions on an imaging device. When the RCD menu is selected, a menu will be displayed with the solutions applications registered to the generic RCD mode. Users will select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.","Hardware Key Interaction","In some embodiments of the present invention, when an imaging device is enabled, additional hardware keys may be used to manage the device.

Some embodiments also comprise an auto clear setting that can be configured for a given period of time, such as 10 to 240 seconds (or disabled). In these embodiments, when there is no activity for the time configured in auto clear, the device may automatically return to disabled mode and attempt to contact a remote computing device to retake control of the UI.","Error & Jam Notifications","Depending on a particular solution, a remote computing device application may have full or only partial control of the imaging device UI and a particular imaging job. In some embodiments, partial control may include cases where a remote computing device is monitoring clicks, but native modes are responsible for the UI interaction and controlling the job. Partial control may also include cases where the remote computing device application is integrated with a native mode (UI trigger=function custom menu). In these embodiments, the imaging device may handle all error and jam notifications with only a notification sent to the relevant remote computing device application.","For some embodiments, in cases where the remote computing device application has full control over the UI and the job, error and jam notifications may be handled differently depending on the type of error. For recoverable errors, a notification may be sent to the remote computing device application and the application may be responsible for displaying messages and resolving the error. For non-recoverable errors, the imaging device and RCD mode may interact to gracefully handle the error condition (e.g. provide user with instructions for clearing jam).","Control Handoffs","In some embodiments, at different points throughout an imaging job, several applications may need control over an imaging device including, but not limited to, an External Authorization application, a standard RCD application, an imaging device native mode and other applications. The following section describes, for an exemplary embodiment, the various steps in an exemplary job, the entities that may have control during each step, and what type of control may be allowed.","S1: User provides credentials to access the device at the device UI. This step may be controlled by a remote computing device, such as an External Authorization application or by Internal Accounting (native mode) in the imaging device itself. At the end of this step, the device is enabled. The External Authorization application may also specify default parameters or disable specific job parameters (e.g. default file format is PDF, but user may change; color mode is set to B\/W and user may not change).","S2: User sets parameters for the job using one of the native imaging device modes or a standard RCD application. At the end of this step the user makes an input to initiate the job. When the input is made, an optional notification may be sent to the standard RCD application, which can then change job parameters if desired. An e-mail application is one example of an application that may request notification when the user input is made. A user may use native Image Send screens or other input to select scan options and choose e-mail recipients. A user may then select a custom application button and choose the scan-to-e-mail option from the menu. The e-mail application may then display custom screens for the user to set permissions for the file. Once a user places the original document(s) on the scanner and initiates the process, the e-mail application may capture the destination parameters set by the user and change the target destination to the e-mail application FTP server. The e-mail application may then receive the file, apply the appropriate permissions, and send to the e-mail recipients selected by the user. A remote computing device application may also want to retake control of the UI at this point, if, as in some embodiments, the application generates thumbnails of the scanned images and displays them to the user for verification.","S3: Once the job is initiated, the imaging device is responsible for scanning or RIPing the job and spooling it to the HDD. If the imaging device is configured to authorize jobs with an external authorization application, it may send a click report to the application and wait for instructions. The external authorization application may enable the job for sending\/printing, cancel the job, or change job parameters (and then enable). As an example, a rules-based printing application may wish to change job parameters after it receives a click report. Some rules-based printing applications support rules-based printing and scanning that can limit what each user is allowed to do based on the time of day, the destination, or many other parameters. For example, only users in the marketing group may be able to scan high-quality color images. If a user from another group selects color and 600 dpi, a rules-based application may change the parameters to color and 200 dpi. At the end of this step the job should either be authorized or canceled.","S4: In some embodiments, this may be an optional step, where the standard RCD application in step 2 may have specified the destination as a HDD for temporary storage. This step may also be used, in some embodiments, by a Java application running on the imaging device. For example, a government office may have a custom encryption application running on the device that takes the scanned document, encrypts it, and then requests the imaging device to send it to the target destination selected by the user in step 2. In some embodiments, it may be beneficial to send a notification to the external authorization application after this step\u2014because the imaging device does not know how long the file will be on the HDD or what the application is going to do with it\u2014and after the send\/print step.","S5: In the final step, the file is actually output. In typical embodiments, the file is either sent over the network or printed locally. At the end of this step, a notification that the job was successfully completed should be sent to the external authorization application and optionally, to the standard RCD application.","Device Control and Management API's","The API's may be used to allow a remote computing device application to control access to an imaging device for vend applications and to manage the device from a remote location.","Device Control and Vend API","In some embodiments of the present invention, a Device Control and Vend API allows applications to enable and disable access to the device and track click counts. The Device Control and Vend API may provide an RCD with the following controls:","E\/DDF\u2014this may allow an RCD to enable or disable access to the device as a whole or by function to enforce individual user privileges.

In embodiments of the present invention that provide some security measures, the following exemplary items are security concerns that may be addressed by the remote computing device interface.","Access to remote computing device interfaces may be limited to valid applications. Embodiments provide extensive access and control of the imaging device, which poses a significant security risk. The interface of these embodiments may be protected from access by attackers, while maintaining ease of setup and use for valid solutions.","Confidential data (user credentials and job data) may be protected during network transfer. User credentials and job data may be secured during network transfer to ensure that it cannot be stolen, an intruder cannot monitor device activity, and a man-in-the-middle attack cannot change messages. Imaging devices may support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and other connections to ensure data is safe while being communicated between the imaging device and remote computing device applications.","Administrators may have the ability to lock-down imaging device access. For users with strict security policies, administrators may have the ability to disable access by remote computing devices or limit access to specific applications. Administrators may have an option to register the limited applications that they wish to access the imaging device interfaces.","Remote computing device applications may ensure the imaging device is not being \u201cspoofed.\u201d The remote computing device may be able to authenticate an imaging device that it is contract with it to ensure an intruder cannot imitate the imaging device to collect network configuration and password information, monitor file\/folder structures of a document management system, or spoof security settings and DSK status of the imaging device.","A remote computing device may ensure that the server is not being \u201cspoofed.\u201d The imaging device must be able to authenticate all remote computing devices that it is in contact with to ensure that an intruder is not spoofing the remote computing device's IP address. By pretending to be the remote computing device, an intruder could steal user credentials, redirect scanned documents, change device settings or firmware, or bring down the access control system (either to provide access to unauthorized users or initiate a denial of service attack for valid users).","Access control\/vend applications may not be compromised when a remote computing device is unavailable. When the remote computing device is unavailable, it may not be acceptable to provide open access to the device. If the remote computing device is unavailable at startup or becomes unavailable at anytime (e.g. someone disconnects network cable), the imaging device may immediately be disabled and an error message displayed.","An administrator may be able to adjust a security level based on company and application requirements. Security requirements can have a large impact on the time it takes to develop a remote computing device application and the resources required to implement the solution. Users using some embodiments may range from a small business with one imaging device, no IT staff, and a simple scan or print application to a large government office using access control and audit trails to track all device activity. The security measures used to protect imaging device interfaces may be adjustable by the administrator to match the target environment.","The imaging device and remote computing device applications may be able to hand-off user credentials. Users may be prompted to login at multiple points throughout a job. For example, an access control application or accounting application may control total device access, the imaging device may have user authentication enabled for Image Send, and a document management application may require user login before showing a folder list. In many environments, all of these applications will use a common user database. In some embodiments, it is, therefore, desirable for the applications to pass user credentials to each other, so that each one does not have to repeat the authentication process.","Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to .
