{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61\/101,141 filed 29 Sep. 2008, the specification of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","One or more embodiments of the invention are related to the field of computer systems. More particularly, but not by way of limitation, one or more embodiments of the invention enable a system and method for management of common decentralized applications data and logic.","2. Description of the Related Art","There is currently no known system or method for computer-assisted management of common decentralized applications data and logic, for example enterprise-network files of interest which contain enterprise-wide business data, but which are housed in individual files spread across an organization.","Specifically, enterprise-wide business data and processes are currently built and maintained in two popular tools, spreadsheets, most commonly MICROSOFT\u00ae EXCEL\u00ae), and desktop\/departmental databases, most commonly MICROSOFT\u00ae ACCESS\u00ae. Files of these types litter business organization personal computers and yet should be coordinated to provide data integrity and centralized knowledge. This dispersed information topology limits the usefulness of the data.","Enterprise Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and other IT-department managers often are held responsible for knowing how many files exist of certain file types (for example, MP3s and proprietary-software executables). This is a difficult job at best as the files could be in thousands of directories spread across thousands of personal computers in a large organization.","In addition, both spreadsheets, such as MICROSOFT\u00ae EXCEL\u00ae and desktop\/departmental databases such as MICROSOFT\u00ae ACCESS\u00ae offer daunting challenges to most enterprises' CIOs or IT departments, as they are usually:","Difficult to inventory and understand\u2014Most spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental databases are designed, built, and maintained by business (i.e., non-Information Technology) departments, with no IT involvement or guidance. Thus, most CIOs or IT managers cannot answer with any confidence any question about the number or purpose of the spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental databases\u2014even though these usually comprise a substantive percentage of overall enterprise \u201cinformation.\u201d","Very difficult to migrate into enterprise applications\u2014After business departments develop and use spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental databases, business department management occasionally finds inherent spreadsheet and desktop\/departmental database limitations (primarily to do with single-user limits or lack of integration with other enterprise databases) to be a problem, and ask their CIO or IT manager to \u201cupgrade\u201d it to support multiple users and, where appropriate, integrate it with other enterprise applications and data. This is often a troublesome request for a CIO or IT manager to receive, as most CIO's resources are stretched thin and the effort of migrating either a spreadsheet or desktop\/departmental database to fit it into enterprise database and architectural standards (such application-development technology stacks such as .NET\/SQL Server or J2EE\/Oracle) often significantly exceeds the cost of designing and building the original spreadsheet or desktop\/departmental database.","For at least the limitations described above there is a need for a system and method for management of common decentralized applications data and logic.","One or more embodiments of the invention enable a new system and method for management of common decentralized applications data and logic. Specifically, embodiments of the invention enable a computer-assisted management of enterprise-network files of interest, and trouble-free migration of enterprise-wide business data and processes currently built and maintained in two popular tools, spreadsheets (most commonly MICROSOFT\u00ae EXCEL\u00ae) and desktop\/departmental databases (most commonly MICROSOFT\u00ae ACCESS\u00ae).","Embodiments of the invention solve the problems outlined in the description of the related art by a system and method that includes:","A file-system repository that lists each file of interest and in addition describes in detail design and intent information for each spreadsheet and desktop\/departmental database.","Utilities that keep the file-system repository complete and up to date.","A Simplified Enterprise Application Repository (SEAR), (also referred to herein as the Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model) configured to store descriptions of simple \u201centerprise\u201d applications.","A Repository Application that manage both the file-system repository and the SEAR.","Utilities that read enterprise database meta-data (such as table definitions) and store them into the SEAR.","Utilities that analyze spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental databases, or files of any other type, for example as associated with given file-type extensions, in the file repository and restate them as simple \u201centerprise\u201d applications in the SEAR. Other file types include MP3's, or files of any other extension.","Utilities that generate well-documented and well-programmed enterprise relational databases and applications from simple \u201centerprise\u201d applications descriptions in the SEAR.","A system and method for management of common decentralized applications data and logic will now be described. In the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to an artisan of ordinary skill that the present invention may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. In other instances, specific features, quantities, or measurements well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention. Readers should note that although examples of the invention are set forth herein, the claims, and the full scope of any equivalents, are what define the metes and bounds of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"Enterprise Network () that contains computers, e.g., mainframes (), servers (), desktops (), laptops (), and other file-containing computers (), with various files of interest including spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental databases, wherein the computers record basic file information such as date-time last modified, size, et cetera in the file-system repository ().","\u201cCrawler\u201d () utility periodically searches network directories and files for new, changed, or deleted\/erased files of interest including, but not limited to, spreadsheets and desktop\/departmental database files.

In each case, clicking the link automatically invokes the Repository Application () for a purpose-specific on-line transaction to do the action requested.","An Enterprise Database Upload () utility periodically searches the Enterprise Development Database () structure (part of the Centrally Managed Enterprise Architecture ()) for created, modified, or dropped tables and other relational-database objects, and stores changes into a Simplified Enterprise Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model () database, which also is part of the Comprehensive Repository () relational database.","A Spreadsheet Synthesis () utility reads the Spreadsheet Meta-Model () database, determines (helped by Repository-Application () \u201cannotations\u201d as necessary) each spreadsheet's equivalent applications semantic (or meaning), and saves or updates that meaning (as an enhanced spreadsheet \u201capplications\u201d definition) in the Simplified Enterprise Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model () database. Where appropriate, the enhanced spreadsheet \u201capplication\u201d definition reflects if it maintains its own data or, also, already existing enterprise data (i.e., that which has been analyzed and stored by the Enterprise Database Upload () utility).","A Database Synthesis () utility reads the Database Meta-Model () database, determines (helped by Repository-Application () \u201cannotations\u201d as necessary) each desktop\/departmental database's equivalent applications semantic (or meaning), and saves or updates that meaning (as an enhanced desktop\/departmental database \u201capplications\u201d definition) in the Simplified Enterprise Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model () database. Where appropriate, the enhanced desktop\/departmental database \u201capplication\u201d definition reflects if it maintains its own data or, also, already existing enterprise data (i.e., that which has been analyzed and stored by the Enterprise Database Upload () utility).","An Enterprise Applications Generator () utility reads the Simplified Enterprise Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model () database (including \u201cannotations\u201d where applicable) and generates RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) DDL (Data-Definition Language, used to create, alter, and drop tables, et cetera) and DML (Data-Manipulation Language, used to insert, modify, and erase applications data), in the enterprise's preferred RDBMS environment (such as Oracle or SQL Server) to extend the Enterprise Database (). The Enterprise Applications Generator () utility also generates well-documented applications logic (\u201ccode\u201d), compiles that code, and deploys appropriate applications modules into the enterprise's Applications Logic Files () and Development Applications Tools () (both part of the Centrally Managed Enterprise Architecture ()) in the enterprise's preferred applications technology (such as .NET and J2EE).","The Repository Application () also is used by the CIO, file owners, line-of-business managers, and other authorized staff to read, analyze, report on, and add value to (\u201cannotate\u201d) information in the Simplified Enterprise Simplified Enterprise Application Meta-Model () database, and on demand to run the Spreadsheet Synthesis () utility, the Database Synthesis () utility, the Enterprise Database Upload () utility, and the Enterprise Applications Generator () utility.
