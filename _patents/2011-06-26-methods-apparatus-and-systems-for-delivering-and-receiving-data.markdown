{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims the benefit and priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/083,395 filed Apr. 8, 2011, which is a continuation-in-part to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/950,877 filed Nov. 19, 2010","The inventions relate to methods, apparatus and systems for delivering and receiving data.","There are a number of television broadcast standards used around the world which are not compatible with one another. For example, Europe uses \u201cDigital Video Broadcasting\u201d (DVB) standards, while North America uses \u201cAdvanced Television Systems Committee\u201d (ATSC). Furthermore, Japan uses \u201cintegrated Services Digital Broadcasting\u201d (ISDB) while China uses its homegrown \u201cDigital Multimedia Broadcast Terrestrial\/Handheld\u201d (DMB-TH) standard. In addition there are cable, satellite, handheld and terrestrial TV standards.","Television is facing competition from the internet one at least two fronts. For example users can buy or rent TV series and films on a number of websites and watch them without advertisements. Users may also download the content from sites like Hulu.com using streaming technology to receive the content with advertisements. Other subscription based businesses are being developed to allow users to access the content, for example, in exchange for a monthly payment. A second front of competition with the internet is that of time. For example, many people spend time using applications like social networks, search engines, instant messaging, e-mails, voice-over IP, games, etc. As the users spend more time on the internet they spend less time watching television.","Different standards have been developed for digital television. For example, the MPEG-2 standard defined by the Motion Picture Expert Group (MPEG) is a standard that allows television to convert their analog systems into more efficient digital television systems. There are other MPEG industry standards. For example MPEG4 offers a more efficient video compression. A Standard Definition (SD) television requires approximately 3.8 Mbps in MPEG-2 and 1.8 Mbps in MPEG-4. A High Definition (HD) television requires approximately 19 Mbps in MPEG-2 and around 7 Mbps in MPEG-4.","The MPEG-2 standard specifies formatting for the various component parts of a multimedia program. Such a program might include, for example, MPEG-2 compressed video, compressed audio, control data and\/or user data. The standard also defines how these component parts are combined into a single bit stream. The process of combining the components into a single stream is known as multiplexing. The multiplexed stream may be transmitted over any of a variety of links, such as Radio Frequency Links (UHF\/VHF), Digital Broadcast Satellite Links, Cable TV Networks, Standard Terrestrial Communication Links, Microwave Line of Sight (LoS) Links (wireless), Digital Subscriber Links (ADSL family), Packet\/Cell Links (ATM, IP, IPv6, Ethernet.)","To compress a stream carrying multimedia entertainment content, discrete samples in a stream are transformed into a bit-stream of tokens, which uses less bandwidth than the corresponding initial stream, since essentially only data that has changed from image to image is captured in the compressed stream, instead of capturing all the information from each image. The signal is broken into convenient sized data blocks (frames, or packets), and header information is added to each data block. The header typically identifies the start of the packets and may include time-stamps. The multimedia encoding\/decoding format tells the decoder (receiver) how to inverse-represent the compacted stream back into data resembling the original stream of un-transformed data, so that the data may be heard and viewed in its normal form.","MPEG systems are composed of various types of streams, such as, for example, Elementary Streams (ES), Packet Elementary Streams (PES), Program Streams (PS) and Transport Streams (TS). Elementary Streams (ES) contain the raw information components stream of a program stream, for example the compressed information of an audio stream of a program or the compressed information of a video stream of a program. Elementary streams in MPEG are first packetized in variable-length packets called PES packets which primarily have a length of 64 kbytes and begin with a PES header of 6 bytes minimum length. A Packet Elementary Stream (PES) is a raw information component stream that has been converted to packet form, such as, for example, a sequence of packets. This packetization process involves dividing a group of bits in an elementary stream and adding packet header information to the data. The packet header includes a Packet Identification code (PID) that uniquely identifies the packetized elementary stream from all other packetized elementary streams that may be transmitted. This Packetized Elementary Stream (PES) with its relatively long packets structures is not optimal for broadcasting transmission.","The MPEG-2 standard defines two forms of multiplexing (combining of ES into a single stream): MPEG Program Streams (PS) and MPEG Transport Streams (TS).","A MPEG Program Stream contains a group of tightly coupled PES packets referenced to a common time base like, for example, a television program. Such streams are suited for transmission in a relatively error-free environment and enable easy software processing of the received data.","In MPEG Transport Streams, each PES packet is broken into fixed-sized transport packets, providing the basis of a general-purpose technique for combining one or more streams, possibly with independent time bases. This is suited for transmission in which there may be potential packet loss or corruption by noise, and\/or where there is a need to send more than one program at a time. In MPEG-2, the objective has been to assemble up to 20 independent TV or radio programs to form one common multiplexed MPEG-2 data signal.","The MPEG Transport Stream consists of a sequence of fixed sized transport packets of 188 bytes. Each packet comprises 184 bytes of payload and a 4 byte header. One of the items in this 4 byte header is the 13 bit Packet Identifier (PID).","MPEG-2 Transport stream (TS) is a standard format for transmission and storage of audio, video, and data, and is used in broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC. Transport Stream is specified in MPEG-2 Part 1, Systems (formally known as ISO\/IEC standard 13818-1 or ITU-T Rec. H.222.0).","The first header byte of a TS packet is the \u201csync byte,\u201d whose value is 0x47, followed by three one-bit flags and a 13-bit Packet Identifier (PID). This is followed by a 4-bit continuity counter. Additional optional transport fields, as signaled in the optional adaptation field, may follow. The rest of the packet typically consists of payload. Packets are 188 bytes in length, but the communication medium may add some error correction bytes to the packet. ISDB-T and DVB-T\/C\/S uses 204 bytes and ATSC 8-VSB, 208 bytes as the size of emission packets (transport stream packet+FEC data). ATSC transmission adds 20 bytes of Reed-Solomon forward error correction to create a packet that is 208 bytes long. The 188-byte packet size was originally chosen for compatibility with ATM systems.","A Transport Stream specifies a container format encapsulating packetized Elementary Streams, with error correction and stream synchronization features for maintaining transmission integrity when the signal is degraded. Transport Stream transmissions may carry multiple Program Streams.","An Elementary Stream in a Transport Stream is identified by a 13-bit packet identifier called PID. A demultiplexer extracts Elementary Streams from the Transport Stream in part by looking for packets identified by the same PID. Packets in the same Elementary Stream have the same PID, so that the decoder can select the Elementary Streams it wants and reject the remainder. Currently, the elementary video, audio and data streams for the same channel use a different PID.","A Transport Stream may include Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information and Program Specific Information (PSI), which describe the Elementary Streams which need to be combined to build programs.","Broadcast systems, like for example DVB, do not only transmit pure content, but also descriptions about the content in the form of metadata. This metadata contains different kind of content-information and may be use to navigate through the content, for example to select different television channels. For example, in MPEG-2 the metadata may be transmitted using the Program Specific Information (PSI) packets.","As discussed above, Program Specific Information is the MPEG-2 data that identifies what parts of the transport stream belong to a particular program. This information is carried in a number of PSI tables:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The Program Association Table (PAT) is the entry point for the Program Specific Information (PSI) tables. It lists all programs available in the transport stream. It is carried in packets with PID=0. For each assigned program number, the PAT lists the PID for packets containing that program's PMT.","The PAT includes data that the decoder uses to determine which programs (also referred to as channels) exist in the respective transport stream. Each of the listed programs is defined by a 16-bit value called program number. Each of the programs listed in PAT has an associated value of PID for its Program Map Table (PMT). The PAT points to a number of PMTs (one per program), which, in turn points to the video, audio, and data content of a respective program carried by the stream.","Program Map Tables (PMTs) contain information about programs. The Program Map Table (PMT) lists all the PIDs for packets containing elements of a particular program (for example, audio, video, and auxiliary data). For each program, there is one PMT. Once the PIDs for the video, audio and data content of the respective program carried by the stream are known, the decoder is able to decode the packets that have these PIDs.","While the MPEG-2 standard permits more than one PMT section to be transmitted with a single PID, most MPEG-2 television systems such as ATSC and SCTE require each PMT to be transmitted with a separate PID that is not used for any other packets. The PMTs provide information on each program present in the transport stream, including the program number, and list the elementary streams that comprise the described MPEG-2 program. There are also locations for optional descriptors that describe the entire MPEG-2 program, as well as an optional descriptor for each elementary stream. Each elementary stream is labelled with a stream type value.","The MPEG transport decoder generally performs the following functions:\n\n","The MPEG-2 specification does not specify the format of the CAT and NIT.","A CAT is used for a scrambled stream. The CAT is carried in packets with PID=1. The CAT contains PIDs for Entitlement Management Messages (EMMs), which contain authorization level information for conditional access systems.","To cope with any extensions, the MPEG Group has created the possibility to incorporate so-called \u201cprivate sections and private tables\u201d in the transport stream. The group has defined mechanisms which specify what a section of a table has to look like, what its structure has to be and by what rules it is to be linked into the transport stream. Taking advantage of the \u201cprivate section\u201d and \u201cprivate tables\u201d features, the European DVB Group has introduced numerous additional tables intended to simplify the operation of DVB receivers. Called \u201cService Information\u201d (SI) they are defined in ETSI Standard ETS300468. Some of these tables are the \u201cNetwork Information Table\u201d, the \u201cTime&Date Table\u201d (TDT), and the \u201cTime Offset Table\u201d (TOT).","The Network Information Table (NIT) is an optional table that describes all physical parameters of a DVB transmission channel. It contains, for example, the received frequency and the type of transmission (e.g. satellite, cable, terrestrial) and also the technical data of transmission like error protection, type of modulation, etc. This table may be used to optimize the channel scan as much as possible.  shows an example of a Program Association Table (PAT) containing the PID for a Network Information Table (NIT).","In Europe, many broadcasters are also transmitting an \u201cElectronic Program Guide\u201d (EPG) which has its own table in DVB, the so-called \u201cEvent Information Table\u201d (EIT). It contains the planned starting and stopping times for the broadcasts of, e.g. one day or one week. The structure which is possible here is very flexible and also allows additional information to be transmitted.","The \u201cTime&Date Table\u201d (TDT) is used to transmit the current clock time and the current date. In the TDT, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e. the current clock time for the Zero-Degree meridian without any daylight saving time shift is transmitted. The respective applicable time offset can then be broadcast in a \u201cTime Offset Table\u201d (TOT) for the various time zones. It depends on the software of the TV receiver how the information contained in the TDT and TOT is evaluated. Complete support for this broadcast time information may require the DVB receiver to be informed of its current location in a country having a number of time zones.","According to one implementation a method is provided that comprises transmitting from a social network site to a television broadcasting site a stream of data comprising broadcast content, the broadcast content designated by the social network site to be broadcast by the television broadcasting site to a plurality of end-user media devices, the end-users being members of the social network site; receiving in the social network site from an end-user media device that is receiving or designated to receive the broadcast content broadcast data related to the broadcast content and identifying data of the member end-user; accessing in the social network site member information of the end-user; and selecting in the social network site by use of the broadcast data and the member information targeted advertising content for the purpose of facilitating a transmission of the targeted advertising content to the end-user media device for it to be played in conjunction with the broadcast content.","Methods, apparatus and systems are provided that enable a user of a computing device to alter, augment or replace broadcast transmitted content destined for or received in the computing device with on-line content from the internet. In some implementations an application program, purchasable or otherwise downloadable from the internet (e.g., from an application store), facilitates in the computing device the manipulation of broadcast transmitted content that changes the manner in which the content from a broadcast transmission source (e.g., television or cable transmission sources) is presented by the computing device absent the intervention of the application program. For example, in one implementation an application program downloaded from the internet to the computing device alters the presentation of broadcast transmitted content by substituting broadcast advertising with non-advertising content from the internet. Many other examples of manipulating or enabling broadcast transmitted content in a computing device by the use of one or more application programs received in the computing device on-line the internet are disclosed and contemplated herein.","For example, in one implementation a method is implemented in a user computing device having a pre-existing capability to receive first content in the form of at least one first data signal from a first external source and to process the at least one first data signal to produce an intended first video presentation and an intended first audio presentation of all or part of the first content in a video display device and in an audio device, respectively, the video display device and audio device integrated with or otherwise connected with the user computing device, the method comprising: receiving on-line from a first site different than the first external source an application program in the user computing device, the application program comprising executable instructions that when executed in the computing device are capable of intervening in the pre-existing first data signal process at a time coincident or after the first content is received in the user computing device, receiving in the user computing device the first content from the first external source; and altering the pre-existing first data signal process in the user computing device by use of the application program to produce a second video presentation and\/or a second audio presentation different than one or both of the respective first video presentation and first audio presentation.","According to one implementation a method is provided comprising: receiving in a social network site from a computing device of a member of the social network site identifying data of the member; receiving in the social network site from the computing device broadcast data related to broadcast content being played in the computing device; accessing in the social network site member information; and selecting in the social network site by use of the broadcast data and member information targeted advertising content for the purpose of facilitating a transmission of the targeted advertising content to the computing device for it to be played in conjunction with the broadcast content.

The graphical system must clip objects while they are being drawn when a collision occurs. This constant checking and clipping ensures that different applications can cooperate with one another in sharing a display, but also consumes a significant proportion of computing power.","A computing device typically draws on its display by writing a bitmapped representation of the graphics into the video memory . Without any hardware overlays, only one chunk of video memory exists, which all applications share, and the location of a given application's video memory moves whenever the user changes the position of the application's window. With shared video memory, an application must constantly check that it is only writing to memory that belongs to that application.","An application or a video signal using a hardware overlay gets a separate section of video memory that belongs only to that application or signal. Because nothing else uses it, the computing device never needs to waste resources in checking whether a given piece of the video memory belongs to it, nor does it need to monitor whether the user moves the window and changes the location of the video memory. To get the image from the separate video memory to display in tandem with the remaining shared elements on the display, the graphical system associates a certain attribute (for example, a particular color) as a \u201cmask\u201d for that overlay, which the graphics card understands to mean that it is to draw from the separate overlay buffer onto the screen. This technique has become known as \u201cchroma key\u201d.","In some implementations, the video interface  may comprise a video hardware overlay module  to combine in the display device  different video and\/or graphic data. One example is a combination comprising the video output of the video decoder  and the graphics or video generated with the assistance of user-downloaded application program . The video hardware overlay module may be configured by the GPU  or by the processing unit , for example using the graphics device driver  and\/or the API . Other implementations may combine the different video and\/or graphic data, such as, for example, the video output  of the video decoder  and the graphics or video generated with the assistance of a user-downloaded application program , without using a hardware overlay module.","In some implementations the video decoder  transmits video data to the video hardware overlay module  using a direct communication like the communication  shown in . In other implementations the video hardware overlay module  may access the video data output of a video decoder for example using RAM , the graphic processing unit (GPU)  or the processing unit .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"100"},"In some implementations the video signal of a TV channel selected on the computing device  is presented in the area  of display device  while the audio signal from the selected TV channel is played through the audio processing interface  which can, for example, be equipped with internal speakers or connected to external speakers  as shown in .

These programs may be developed by third party developers using special programming tools specific to an application store and\/or a specific device and\/or a specific operating system. A third party developer may be a software developer company different from the company that develops and sells the computing device and the company that operates the application store. Usually the third party developer must register in an application store to offer its software product. An example of an application store is the Apple App Store where a user of Apple products, such as the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, may purchase and download application programs specific to such devices. Some applications of the Apple App Store may include software modules with specific functionalities.

The metadata may be, for example, an identifier of the selected TV channel. In this manner APP  can know which TV channel has been selected or is being played in the computing device .","Metadata may contain information about the selected TV channel in the computing device and on other TV channels accessible from the computing device .","In some implementations metadata is obtained from the data signal . For example, in the case of DVB TV systems used in Europe, such as DVB-T, DVB-S or DVB-H, metadata can be obtained from different table data, such as for example Service Information (SI), Program Specific Information (PSI) and Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data, as explained above.

The implementations disclosed and contemplated herein related to EPGs and metadata are not intended to be limited to any particular type of EPG or metadata.","In the United States of America the Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) standard has been developed for digital terrestrial and cable television. Like the SI and PSI tables in DVB, the ATSC standard utilizes Program and System Information Protocol (PSIP) tables. Japan has defined its own tables in its Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) standard. These tables are called ARIB (Association of Radio Industries and Business). China has its own digital terrestrial television standard known as Digital Multimedia Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DNB-T) that utilizes metadata tables. In some implementations APP  has the ability to access metadata of multiple television systems that use different tables with different formats.","In some implementations metadata may have the same structure as the metadata of the aforementioned television standards, such as DVB-SI, DVB-PSI, DVB-EPG, ATSC-PSIP, and ISDBT-ARIB. Other metadata defined by other standards can be equally used in other implementations.","In some implementations, metadata is stored in a storage device  of the computing device  in a common format readable by the APP  program regardless of the television standard used by the computing device to receive the metadata. In such implementations the APP  program may read metadata associated with multiple television standards. As an example, in some implementations the metadata of the different television standards is stored using the XML standard.","In some implementations, the computing device  receives television information on-line through the network interface , for example through an internet connection with a data site S such as that depicted in . In some implementations the information accessed and transmitted to computing device  from site S is data that identifies the television programs that may be received by the computing device via different television systems such as digital terrestrial television (e.g. DVB-T, ATSC, ISDB-t), Internet television (e.g. via IP unicast, multicast or broadcast packets), mobile digital television (e.g. DVB-H), etc. This advantageously enables the computing device  to receive from a single source data associated with different television systems.","In some implementations data received by the computing device  from site S may include, for example, information that uniquely identifies each TV channel and the content that each channel is transmitting or is going to transmit. This information can be read by a program running on the computing device, for example to detect which is the television program selected and\/or the content which is being played on the computing device. In some implementations the data may also contain information on programs to be transmitted by one or more television channels in the next minutes, hours, days or weeks.","In some implementations data may be stored on a computer other than the computing device , such as a server connected to the internet, and APP  can access data via the Internet.

In some implementations, the software module  shows subtitles in the APP overlay  area using the graphics device driver  and\/or API .","In some implementations data  includes content that partially replaces contents of a selected TV channel. For example, a user of computing device  may select that all or portions of the audio of a selected TV channel be presented in a given language which results in audio data being transmitted from site  to the computing device. In this manner, the audio data may be reproduced in the computing device instead of the audio transmitted by the selected TV channel. This makes it possible, for example, to watch a film in a language other than the language in which the film is being broadcast on television.","In some implementations APP  is used to select an audio language to be played during the broadcast of a TV channel in the computing device and causes language identifying data to be transmitted to site . In some implementations APP  receives or facilitates the reception of the audio data in the chosen language and facilitates the playing of this audio through the speakers in synchronization with the TV channel video signal.","In some implementations a software module  associated with APP  performs some or all of the functions associated with causing audio data to be played in the computing device .

For example, APP  receives information from the site  indicating that between the times T and T it must reproduce the multimedia content stored in the database  of site . In some implementations, in response the application program APP  communicates with the video interface  and the audio processing interface  and selects which video signal to process through the video interface  and which audio signal to process through the audio interface  at a given moment.","In some implementations the content contains some advertisements, for example advertisements that subsidize the broadcasting of content on the television channel. Between the times T and T the TV channel can transmit advertisements that the computing device  receives but replaces them with the advertisement content . In this way, computing devices, such as televisions, which receive the selected television channel and do not have the APP , can display a common advertising content while the computing device  can receive and display different advertisement content ","In some implementations, the broadcast content transmitted to the computing device  does not include advertising content, but instead includes place holders that facilitate or otherwise enable the integration of advertising content or other content from a source other than the TV channel broadcast source. In some implementations the source other than the TV channel broadcast source is the internet.","It is important to note that the content integrated with or otherwise incorporated with the main content of the broadcast channel need not be advertising. For example, in some implementations the application program APP  received from an APP store enables a user to select the type of content to be integrated with or otherwise incorporated in the broadcast during for example the time interval T-T. For example, based upon the manner in which the APP  was received, the user may be presented with different content options. For example, if APP  was purchased for a fee from an APP store the user may be provided with a variety of options which may include edited scenes, trailers, actor or director profiles, actor or director interviews or commentary, short film\/TV segments, news segments, general entertainment segments, entertainment segments or news segments associated with the broadcast, etc. In some implementations APP  may cause or facilitate web browsing, e-mail access, temporarily changing the selected channel to another channel, or other functions during the time interval T-T. The \u201canother channel\u201d may be pre-selected by a user of the computing device or automatically selected by the computing device. For example, if a user is watching a sports channel, movie channel, documentary channel or reality TV channel, then the \u201canother channel\u201d may be another sports, movie, documentary, or reality TV channel, respectively. In some implementations, the computing device automatically resumes representing (e.g., displaying the main content of the broadcast in the form of video and\/or audio) in the computing device  when the time interval expires, while in other implementations the computing device may produce an alert when the time interval expires and provide a user of the computing device an option to resume the broadcast or to continue with an existing or other activity.","In some implementations the other functions facilitated by APP  during the time interval T-T may include the initiations or resumption of a video game, a gaming operation, or other activity. For example, if the selected TV channel content is a soccer match, during the time interval T-T, a soccer video game is made available for use by a user or users of the computing device. The video game may be for example one that has been previously stored on the computing device or one made accessible on-line via the internet. The video game may be a single user game or one that permits multi-viewer participation. In some implementations the video game is made available free of charge for a selected period of time (e.g., the duration of the selected TV channel program, the duration the selected TV channel is being played in the computing device, a pre-determined time period, etc.) or for a selected number of play sessions.","It is important to note that the terms \u201cintegrated with\u201d and \u201cincorporated in\u201d are not to be construed in a limiting manner. The terms are meant to include any means used to facilitate the playing of a broadcast content with other content. The other content may be content previous stored in a memory of the computing device . The content previously stored may be content from a broadcast previously played in the computing device, content from a source other than the broadcast source, etc. For example, when a broadcast includes a sporting event the computing device may store in memory certain previously played highlights and during the time interval T-T the computing device replays all or some of the stored highlights. The same is applicable to movies and other forms of content where certain scenes of the selected broadcast channel (e.g., favourite scenes) are stored in the computing device. In some implementations the highlights\/scenes are predetermined by the broadcast source, while in other implementations the highlights\/scenes are selected by a user of the computing device during the playing of the selected broadcast in the computing device. For example, during the playing of the selected TV channel some of the content may be temporarily stored in a buffer or other memory device and upon a user selecting a user-interface function (e.g., by use of key of a remote control device, selection of a display icon, etc.) all or a portion of the content stored in the buffer is selected to be replayed during time interval T-T. In some implementations the broadcast content includes markers or other information that identifies or delineates scenes or content segments. This facilitates the storing of complete scenes or content segments in the buffer or other memory device. Thus, upon a user making a selection of a content segment to be replayed, the computing device stores the highlights\/scenes by use of the identifiers or delineations.","In some implementations or all of the implementations disclosed herein, the application program APP , and or a software module associated with APP , provides or facilitates the implementation capabilities. For example, an application program APP  that related to a golfing channel may be purchased on-line from the computing device from an APP store. Upon the application program APP  being downloaded and\/or activated in the computing device, one or more functions may be automatically activated or otherwise selected by a user of the computing device to alter a predetermined reproduction of the broadcast content of the golfing channel. For example, a capability of initiating a video golfing game during broadcast segments that would otherwise involve the playing of advertisements may be enabled. In this example, as well with others, the selected TV channel broadcast signal may include data that is used to access a video game on-line that represents the same course, playing field, participants, etc. as those involved in the selected TV channel broadcast.","In some implementations the computing device  does not allow the user to change the channel or skip the advertising content . For example, the APP  may contain executable instructions that when executed in processing unit  block channel changing in the signal interface  using for example a configuration register of the signal interface . The processing unit  can use a configuration register in the interface signal that indicates whether the channel can be changed or not.","In some implementations processing unit  transmits to the signal interface  the time duration of content and the time T when content begins. In response, the signal interface  of the computing device  restricts or prevents the changing of the channel between times T and T.","In some implementations executable instructions implemented in the processing unit  of the computing device  detect if the user tries to change the channel during playback of the advertising content and causes a display a message, for example indicating that the television content being received is funded by the advertising and that he or she must wait until the advertising has finished to change the channel.","In some implementations a display message is caused to be produced in a user interface of the computing device that allows the user to choose between changing the channel and not being able to continue watching the contents of the selected TV channel for a certain time or playing the advertising content and continue to watch the contents of the television channel. The certain time may be, for example, the duration of the television program, a chapter of a serial or other content.","In some implementations the executable instructions that control whether the computing device  can change TV channels, display messages and\/or user interfaces are included in the APP  and\/or software module .","In some implementations site  transmits content to the computing device before time T and the computing device can locally store file content to play it from the time T.","In some implementations computing device  receives the content transmitted by the site  using a streaming protocol, such as using RTSP and RTP protocols","In some implementations the computing device , its operating system and\/or APP  may use different buffers for storing data , for example audio, video and\/or subtitle data, and facilitate the synchronization of the audio, video and subtitles of a given content, such as a film or a television channel.","The streaming protocol RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), is described in RFC 2326 specifications published online by IETF (Schulzrine H. et al., Internet Engineering Task Force, Network Working Group, Request for Comments 2326, April 1998; currently available on the Internet http:\/\/www.ietf.org\/rfc\/rfc2326.txt) RTSP protocol operation is closely related to two other protocols of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force): SDP and RTP protocols.

These databases were originally created by cars driving on the streets with a GPS which recorded the MAC Address of the WiFi routers they detected. This technique was used by the companies Skyhook and Google. A more recent approach to create such a database is used by some mobile services of mobile phones, for example, the iPhone, which in certain privacy settings, records the WIFI routers detected, associating GPS type coordinates to them and sends that information to Apple. Even some desktop computers, such as the Apple iMAC, record WIFI routers detected and periodically send that information to Apple.","In some implementations site  has access to a WiFi routers database used to determine the approximate position of the computing device .

However, other social network implementations are also possible, using a different number of elements and distributing the various functions between different elements in different ways.","In some implementations, the computing devices , and may use a browser-type program or an application to communicate with the social site , for example by means of application , which allows users to register and interact with one another. The application  may, for example, display different types of data for each user, including profile information, or relationships between a user and others. For example, the relationships that the user of computing device has with users of computing devices and ","In some implementations, the application  is associated with a website which is usable from a browser, such as the browser . In one implementation, application  may use other communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, XML, web services, etc.) to communicate with the computing device, for example to communicate with the application APP .","In one implementation, the server performs the functions of registering, authenticating and authorizing the computing devices and\/or users who use computing devices to allow them to connect and communicate with the social site  to transmit and receive data to the social site  and to other computing devices.","In some implementations the computing devices may transmit to the social site  data that comprises information that identifies the computing devices , and or identifies the user in the database . For example, the computing device user may have registered at a web page of the web server of site , transmitting registration data which are stored in the database . Upon registration, the user can choose identifier data, such as for example the e-mail address or other identifier data, and a password that allows the user, for example, to access his or her data and modify them.","Once a user has registered on the social site  he or she may transmit data, such as personal information, to the social site  in the form of text messages, pictures, photos, videos, audio, URL or URI type web links, geographic data, geographic coordinates such as GPS, location data, information on events and other social data that the social site  receives and stores associated with the user in the database .","In some implementations, the server executes a software program editor of social relations which it receives from the computing devices , and , data indicating a type of relationship between users of computing devices and the software program which stores in storage means  data regarding the type of relationship between the users. The editor of social relations software can also generate and send communications to the computing devices to confirm the type of social relations.","For example, users of computing devices and can register on the site  using the application  and select the names userand user. Once registered, the usercan request to establish a relationship with the userusing the software program editor of social relations of the server . The server may send a communication or message to the userso that this user confirms the relationship with the user. If the userresponds with a message or communication indicating that he or she accepts the type of social relationship created by user, the server stores the social relationship in a database or storage means .","The type of relationship established between userand usercan be, for example, being friends, belonging to the same club, team, gymnasium or school, having a subject, class or profession in common, having planned to attend or having attended to an event such as a sporting or religious event, a conference or trade show, having common hobbies or tastes, such as on a type of music or film, etc.","Each type of social network can establish different types of relationships between different social network users.","In some social networks, like Twitter, a user can publish in the network short messages, such as for example up to 140 characters, and users who wish to receive these messages \u201csubscribe\u201d to the user who publishes the messages to receive them. At the same time the user who publishes the messages may also be registered to receive messages from other users. When a user has subscribed to receive messages, a \u201cfollower\u201d type of social relationship is stored in the social network.","New types of social relationships between users can be defined in the program that runs on the server assigning to each new type of relationship a unique identifier (for example an integer or alphanumeric code) and a description of the type of social relationship while storing that information in a database of site .","In some implementations the server executes a software program that lets one see relationships between users and their associated data, such as photographs, videos and personal profile data of users who are linked between them. The server also allows other functions for users to interconnect, such as users sending messages, emails or establishing voice communications, such as voice over IP (VoIP) or video communications such as videoconferences.","In some implementations the server runs a program or software programs that allows the social site  to communicate with a software application running on a computing device.","The database or storage means  can use any storage device or storage means to store the information for each user and their relationships and communications with other users. Moreover, the data may be stored in one or more remote locations.","In some social networks, social network members can join or create relationships based on groups. These groups may include people with the same interests, such as a football team, a band, a personal hobby, a brand of clothing, etc. Each user can create his own group with those who share the same interests.","Some implementations enable the creation of various types of groups with different privacy settings and accepting new members in the group.","Some implementations have an open public group of users who have a common interest or who want to show their affinity with the aim of the group. The open public group interactions are typically public and visible in search engines pages, the content can be viewed without being a member of the page. Non-members typically cannot add content.","A \u201cpage\u201d does not follow the typical format of the group because there are no members. Joining a \u201cpage\u201d is typically accomplished by simply clicking on an icon on the page itself. After joining a page a member is generally free to add content.","Other implementations enable the creation of groups that have administrators and members.","The following are examples of groups:","Open group: Any user can join this group and invite others to do so, in this way, any user can view the information and content of the group and add their own content. Joining is automatic, so no-one needs to accept or confirm the request to join the group.","Closed or Private Group: For a new member to join the group, the group administrators must approve an application for membership. The group appears in the search engine results but the contents cannot be viewed. Any user can view the description of the group, but only members may view the contents and add new content.","Secret Group: The group does not appear as the result of a search or on the profiles of the group members. Only people who receive an invitation from a group member may join. Only members can view group information and content and add new content to the group.","In some implementations, the administrator or administrators can change the settings of the groups so that the restrictions respect to the possibility of publishing content can vary.","The form for the creation of a group typically includes information fields such as group name, description and some relevant searchable data. In some situations, when the social site group includes an administrator, the administrator can delete or report inappropriate content.","According to other implementations the social network site has functionalities similar to that of Twitter and enables the creation of a user to publish content, for example, in the form of short messages. In turn, a user can be a \u201cfollower\u201d of another user, thus creating a link between the two of them allowing him\/her to receive content that this user posts and view other users' comments to that content","A user may directly become a \u201cfollower\u201d of another user, without the need for the user followed to have to decide whether or not to accept that relationship. However there may be settings that can protect publications, so that only accepted users allowed to follow these publications may see them.","User messages can be searched based on keywords or \u201ctopics\u201d, such as, for example. messages that talk about a theme or content on a single common interest, similar to what a group would be.","The example of  shows three computing devices , and that communicate with the social site  through network  using communications ,  and , respectively.

Moreover, the broadcast transmission is not limited to wireless transmissions. In addition, it is also important to note that the term \u201cTV site\u201d is meant to include any media source capable of broadcasting, rebroadcasting, or otherwise relaying a data signal intended to be received, at least in part, by multiple computing devices. For example, according to some implementations the \u201cTV site\u201d is an entity that provides entertainment programming to a computing device by the use of multicast technology via a data network, such as the internet.","In some implementations the data signal  may be transmitted to the devices , and using wireless technologies like WIFI, WIMAX, UMTS, 3gpp, 3gpp2, LTE, or other wireless technologies.","The TV site  is connected to the network  by communication . In one implementation, the TV site  is connected to the social network site  using a communication , for example an Ethernet network or a VPN (Virtual Private Network).","In one implementation the TV site  comprises a broadcast module  that transmits one or more TV signals to antennas ,  and  using network .

Thus if, for example, users of the computing devices and have established a relationship of friendship, social site  may allow the users to share this information.","In some implementations, the application APP  shows on the display of the computing device information about the television channel currently being played by the computing devices and . The application APP  can, for example, display this information overlaid on the television channel content currently playing.","In one implementation, the social site  can group all the information it receives from various computing devices in a single television channel to show it to the users. For example, the social site can display real-time audience of each television channel, in absolute form (number of computing devices that have logged into the social site and which reproduce each TV channel) or as percentage (percentage of computing devices that have logged into the social site and which reproduce each TV channel calculated on the total number of computing devices that play TV channels and send information to the social site).","In some implementations, the user of the computing device may have stored on social site  social relationships with a large number of other social site  users, such as hundreds or thousands of other users. In some implementations, the application APP  displays information, for example, aggregated information. The aggregated information may be, for example, the total number of users associated with the social network site  who are concurrently watching the program. Other examples may include a display of the identity of users having a social relationship with the user of computing device who are logged-in to the social network site  and watching the same TV channel, demographic information of those watching the same TV channel, etc. In some implementations the social site only consider users that have stored in the social site  a particular social relationship with the user of computing device , such as for example, having a friend relationship.","In some implementations, the computing device can exchange information in real time with the computing devices of other users who are watching the same television channel as the one played on the computing device and also have a social relationship stored in the social site . For example, they can exchange information as text messages displayed on the screens of the computing devices superimposed on the television channel or audio messages played on the loudspeakers of the computing devices, etc.","In some implementations, a user of a computing device who is watching a particular television channel can send a message to social site  with information such as \u201cI like it\u201d indicating that the user of the computing device likes the content being watched on the television channel. Other users of the social site  can access this information and thus the social site  facilitates the making of recommendations of TV channels in real time. Conversely, the message may contain negative information, such as \u201cI don't like it\u201d.","In some implementations, the computing device may receive, through the social site , information transmitted by other users with whom there exists a \u201cfollower\u201d-type social relationship as explained above in the Twitter social network. Thus, for example, in some implementations a first computing device of a first user can transmit data to the social site  related with content that is being transmitted or is about to be transmitted by a particular television channel, and users who have established in the social network  a \u201cfollowers\u201d-type relationship with the first user can receive and view on their computing devices the data transmitted by the first user, such as texts, forums, voice messages such as VoIP (Voice over IP), video messages or other data transmitted by the first user. In some implementations these messages are displayed simultaneously on the screen of the computing device with the content of television channel, for example, superimposed on the screen content.","In some implementations, a user can transmit data to the social site  and other users who have a \u201cfollowers\u201d-type social relationship can receive and view these data in their computing devices regardless of the selected TV channel in the computing device seeing the data. For example, a user can be watching a TV news channel or be changing TV channels while viewing superimposed on the screen of his or her computing device messages from those he or she has a social relationship stored in the social site , such as messages related to stock quotes, weather, etc. that the user can read or watch independently of the selected TV channel or while the user is changing the TV channel.","In one implementation, a user can select and store in the social site  information about other users associated with each TV channel. For example, a user may want to receive or transmit information to or from users userA, userB and userC when he or she is watching a first TV channel TV and receive and\/or transmit information to or from other users userD, userE and userF when he or she is watching another TV channel TV.

These are just two of many advertising preference criteria that may be selected and stored by the social site  for a particular user\/member.","It is important to note that content portion is not limited to advertising, but may comprise any of a variety of other types of content that has been selected by use of the social site , or by use of social site data, to replace content . For example, the content portion may include text and\/or audio and\/or video messages from other social site users, music, cartoons, videos, etc. Moreover, content may or may not reside with the social site . For example, the content may reside with a third party advertising site . In one implementation the social site  stores an index of advertisements that are selectable by use of one or more of the user data discussed above and sends instructions to the third party advertising site  to transmit to the social site  and\/or the computing device the selected targeted advertising . In one implementation the selected targeted advertising is stored in a file associated with the user in the social site  and used in the future selection of advertisements. In another implementation the social site  sends advertising selection data to the third party advertising site  and the third party advertising site  selects the targeted advertising ","In another implementation the application  executing in the computing device may be used to facilitate an exchange of information between the channel  source and the social site  through the computing device . In this manner the channel  source may use the social site data provided to it to select the content of portion  or replace the content portion  with targeted content. The content  and\/or the targeted content may or may note reside with the channel  source. For example, the contents may reside with a third party advertising site, such as site .","In some implementations, the source and\/or content of an original advertising content  is also used in the selection of content . For example, since a contractual business relationship between the original advertising source (e.g., BMW) and the source of channel  likely exists, the content to replace content  is selected from the same advertising source so as not to interfere with the contractual obligations\/relationship of the parties involved. For example, a sporting event sponsored by BMW advertising has an original content  related to a sports utility vehicle with a target audience comprising older or family oriented viewers. However, the social site  data of the user of computing device who is watching channel  indicates that the user is young and single. In such an instance, for example, the social site data in combination with the advertising source information may be used to select a BMW motorcycle advertisement to replace content  that included the BMW sports utility vehicle advertisement. In some implementations, the one or more data signals  associated with broadcast content  comprises data that identifies the advertising sources.","In some implementations, at the beginning T of a broadcast of content , or at one or more instances between T and T, the broadcast source  transmits to the computing device data related to the intended advertising content and\/or data related to the intended advertising source and this data is used in the computing device in the selection of the targeted advertising . In some implementations the channel source  transmits to the computing device all relevant advertising data useable in selecting targeted advertising at the beginning of the broadcast T, or at a time prior to a first advertising content portion.","In some instance, as mentioned below, a broadcast content may comprise a portion  devoid of content but yet intended for advertising content, or other content. In some implementations the channel source  has a contractual obligation to ensure an advertisement from a particular advertising source occupies the broadcast between intervals T and T. In such instances, in some implementations, the channel source  transmits to the computing device data related to the intended advertising source and this data is used in the computing device in the selection of the targeted advertising ","In the discussion above, many of the explanations have been directed to a replacement of content  with content . The implementations disclosed herein are not limited to such a replacement. For example, in some implementations content portion  may be devoid of content.","In some implementations, APP  facilitates the communication and transmission of data between the computing device and the one or more other entities (e.g., social site , channel  source, third party advertising site, etc.) involved in the selection and transmission of content to the computing device . A more detailed explanation of some implementations of APP  is provided below.","In some implementations computing device may receive from an internet site, such as social site , advertising content based on the geographical location of the computing device or any other information associated with the computing device or the user of the computing device stored in the social site .","In some implementations, the data is transmitted from the social site  to the computing device using a streaming technology like, for example, Flash, RSTP, RTP, RTCP, HTML5 or other streaming technologies.","In some implementations, the social site  may start the transmission of the data to the computing device in an instant before T, and the computing device may store the received portion of the data ,in a storage medium, for example a cache memory, and start the reproduction of the content in the instant T.","In some implementations, the channel  source transmits first information to the computing device indicating the instant T and\/or identifying the data ","In some implementations the first information is transmitted in the one or more data signals , for example as metadata of the channel  source. In some implementations, the metadata transmitted by a first antenna is different than the metadata transmitted by a second antenna (not shown in ) and different devices receiving the data signal  may receive different T information and different information identifying the data . For example, an antenna transmitting to the state of New York may transmit different first information than an antenna transmitting to the state of Washington.","In one implementation the APP  may be used in the computing device with a plurality of channel sources. In one implementation, the APP  transmits information to the social site  identifying the channel source currently being selected in the computing device and the social site  uses this information and the information stored in the social site  associated with the user of the computer device to select the advertisement content to be transmitted to each device.","In some implementations, the APP  stores information identifying each of the advertisements received from the social site  and reproduced in the computing device associated with each channel source. The APP  may transmit this information to the social site  and the social site  may store this information received from each device and use it to charge the advertisers and\/or to compensate the channel sources for replacing their advertisements.","In other implementation, the operating system of the computer devices stores information identifying each of the advertisements received from the social site  and reproduced in the computing device associated with each channel source. The APP  or the operating system may transmit this information from the computing devices to the social site  and the social site  may store this information received from each device and use it to charge the advertisers and\/or to compensate the channel sources for replacing their advertisements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0294","num":"0303"},"figref":"FIGS. 16 and 17","b":["100","60","100","60","1660"]},"In the example of , the APP  comprises a software module and a software module . In one implementation, software module is a software module\/component that facilitates communication between the computing device  and the social site . For example, APP  may allow the computing device  user to \u201clog-in\u201d with the social site  so that the computer device has access to user's data stored in the social site  associated to users who are logged in.","In some implementations, the login into social site  can be done automatically from the computing device  without requiring user intervention. Optionally, the user can disable this option or choose in which television channels she or he wants to enable automatic login.","In some implementations, the software module  executes some or all the features discussed in the examples and implementations of .

Upon an APP being developed for use in conjunction with the one or more social sites , the APP may be made available to the user of the computing devices  via a variety of venues. For example, the APP may be provided for a fee or free of charge from the developer site , a social site , or another site, such as an APP store, and then downloaded from any of a number of different sites.","In some implementations, a supervising site  is also involved. The social site , the developer site  and the supervising site  may execute different program applications like for example a main webpage , , , and a database , , .","According to one example a user chooses an application program APP  offered on the social site  and downloads the program APP  into the computing device  using communications .

According to the implementations of , an SMA is provided that coordinates communications and functions among broadcast participants comprising more than one social network site (e.g. social site and social site ). According to some implementations, the SMA comprises executable instructions that when executed in the computing device  provides the ability for the user to select which user social sites are to be used in the targeted content process. In some implementations the SMA permits a selection of all or some of the social sites to which the user belongs, while in other implementations the SMA only permits the selection of a single social site. In situations where multiple social sites are selected, such as, for example, social sites and , user data from both of sites and are used in the selection of targeted content.","In some implementations the SMA permits the user to select a preference between social site and . In some implementations the SMA resolves conflicts between site user data and site user data using the selected preference.","In some instances the targeted advertising content is selected by the social site  based primarily on information contained in the profiles of one or more other members of the social site in which the user of the computing device  has a social relationship. For example, in one implementation the user may have a friend relationship with a member named \u201cJohn\u201d who's birthday falls on March 25. According to some implementations, social site  on at least the days leading to March 25selects at least one or more targeted advertisements for the user of the computing based primarily on information stored with the social site relating to John. The same concept may be used for weddings, valentine's day, father's day, mother's day, etc. In some implementations the social site  selects the targeted advertising based on general member information, while in other implementations the social site  facilitates the creation of a gift preference list by its members and uses information from these lists in the advertising selection process.","In some implementations the social site  provides an advertising listing that is segmented by product categories, lifestyle attributes, event type (e.g. birthday, wedding, etc.), etc. By use of the listing\/database, the social site permits a member, like John, to select from the advertising list\/database one or more advertisements he\/she would like to be sent to other members to be played in conjunction with broadcast content that is being viewed or is to be viewed in the computing device  of the other social site member.","According to some implementations the social site  causes to be transmitted to the user computing device a reminder, such as in the form of text, that may be delivered and reproduced in the computing device at a time coincident, or at a moment near in time to when the targeted advertisement is being reproduced in the computing device.","According to some implementations, the user of the computing device may activate and\/or deactivate such functionalities by use of the application  residing in the computing device or by other means provided by the social site.","According to some implementations the social site  provides to John, and of course other members like John, any ability to activate and\/or deactivate this type of advertising selection as it relates to them personally.","Turning again to , in other implementations the social network site  transmits content to the TV site  for the purpose of being broadcast to multiple end-user media devices, such as computing devices , and . In some implementations the content to be broadcast is delivered to the TV site  via the network  through communications  and , while in other implementations the broadcast content is delivered to the TV site via communication . Although  depicts a single social network site , a single TV site  and a single network , it is to be appreciated that implementations involving two or more social network sites, two or more TV sites and two or more networks are contemplated. For example, content received in the TV site  to be broadcast may originate from multiple social network sites. Another example may involve the social network site transmitting content for broadcast to multiple TV sites.","In the example of , the TV site  is shown as being distinct from the social network site . However, according to some implementations the functions and equipment associated with the TV site  are integrated with those of the social network site  to form a social broadcasting site (herein after referred to as an \u201cSBS\u201d) having functionalities associated with both the social network site  and TV site . An SBS advantageously provides a single platform for hosting and broadcasting social content.","The broadcast content transmitted from the social network site  may reside in one or more data storage devices associated with the social network site. The broadcast content may comprise content uploaded to the social network site by member users of the site, content originating in the social network site and content deposited into the social network site by custodians\/administrators of the site. The content transmitted from the social network site  to the TV site  may have as its source any one or more of the foregoing types of content.","In some implementations content is selected for broadcast by use of information residing in the social network site  associated with one or more members of the social network site. The member information may comprise member profile information and\/or member preference information. Member profile information may include, for example the gender, age or geographic location of the member, Member preference information may include, for example, information related to member hobbies, topics of interest, survey results, or any other information indicative of a member's interest. In one implementation content selected to be broadcast to a specific geographic location is done by providing to members in the geographic location with an ability voice their preference to candidate content. In one implementation a descriptive listing and\/or audio clips and\/or video clips and or video\/audio clips of candidate content is made available to the members along with means to express a member's preference of content to be broadcast.","In other implementations content to be broadcast is selected solely, or in part, by information of member's that are logged in with the social network site and\/or tuned in to a broadcast channel of the TV site. For example, computing devices and may be receiving via a broadcast receiver data signals associated with a sports channel of the TV site while computing device may be receiving via a broadcast receiver data signals associated with a movie channel. By use of, for example, the application program  stored in the computing devices, real-time channel viewing data associated with each of the computing devices , and are transmitted to the social network site . Subsequent to receiving the channel viewing data form computing devices and , the social network site  may access member information of the users of computing devices and and use the member information to select the next or future content of the sports channel broadcast. If, for example, member information of a large portion of the sports channel viewing audience indicates a preference for the game of tennis, the social network site  may select content related to the game of tennis to be the next or future content of the sports channel. In a like manner, the social network site  may access member information of the user of computing device and use the member information to select the next or future content of the movie channel broadcast.","According to some implementations, upon the social network site  selecting content to be broadcast subsequently makes available information about the future broadcast content, along with viewing details (e.g., broadcast channel, date, time, etc.) to one or more of the users of computing devices , and . In some implementations information about the future broadcast content is made available to the one or more computing devices , and by transmitting the information via the TV site so that it is broadcast to the one or more computing devices. In some implementations in lieu of or in conjunction with broadcasting the information, the information about the future broadcast content is multicast or unicast to the one or more computing devices via network .","In one implementation the social network site  transmits, or otherwise provides to the TV site  one or more streams of data comprising broadcast content. In some implementations the one or more streams are transmitted, periodically, continuously, or nearly continuously. In this manner, the TV site  may periodically, continuously, or nearly continuously, be provided with content form the social network site from which it may select content for being incorporated into a program for broadcast. For example, the social network site  may facilitate receiving from members of the site content related to humorous events in the form of audio\/video clips.","In one implementation the social network site  makes available through its website, or another website, an application program specific to downloading from a user computing device content related to humorous events. For example, it may be that the Fox Network broadcasts a program entitled \u201cFunny Moments\u201d. An application program specific to \u201cFunny Moments\u201d may be made available for download from the social network site  and\/or the Fox Network website to the computing devices , and . The application may comprise executable instructions that when executed in a computing device launches an interactive display to assist the user of the computing device to download to a storage medium associated with the social network site  video\/audio clips specifically designated as candidate content for the program \u201cFunny Moments\u201d. In some implementations the application program provides editorial tools useful for formatting the content according to specifications or other requirements imposed by the social network site  and\/or TV site  (e.g., the Fox Network). The editorial tools may comprise, for example, compression tools or other means to diminish or increase the byte size of the audio\/video clip. The tools may also comprise means for adjusting sound quality, video quality, splicing content, omitting content, adding content (e.g., sound effects, voice-over, text, etc.). In this manner, content downloaded to the social network site  may be provided in a format ready or nearly ready for incorporation into the program \u201cFunny Moments\u201d. In some implementations, the application program does not itself provide the editorial functions, but instead launches or makes available for download to the user's computing device one or more of the editorial tools.","As discussed above, in some instances the functions of the TV site are incorporated with the social network site so that the social site itself is the broadcasting entity. In such instances the broadcast may occur via a transmission through network  and antennas ,  and  or via a multicast through network .","In addition to providing content to be broadcast in, for example, the program \u201cFunny Moments\u201d, the social network site may also provide one or more other streams of data to the TV site (e.g. the Fox Network) and\/or other TV sites (e.g. ABC, CBS, NBC, etc.) for being included in other broadcast programs. For example, the Fox Network may broadcast a program entitled \u201cMy Wedding\u201d that is designated to at least partially include video\/audio clips from real-life weddings. According to one implementation the social network site supports the download and prepares wedding video content for broadcast in a manner like that described above.","As discussed above, in some instances broadcast content transmitted to the computing devices , and from the TV site  may be augmented or otherwise supplemented with non-broadcast content that is provided via a unicast communication between the social network site  and the computing devices , and . As previously discussed, the unicast-provided content may be, for example, advertising content. In implementations involving the social network site  directly broadcasting or indirectly broadcasting through a third party or external TV site, advertisements or other types of content may be transmitted from the social network site  to the computing devices via a unicast communication for the purposed of being incorporated, or integrated or otherwise played in conjunction with the broadcast content. The unicast transmitted content may be selected in accordance with one or more of implementations previously disclosed herein. In one implementation the computing devices comprise the requisite hardware, firmware and\/or software for receiving and processing the broadcast data signals  and also the requisite hardware, firmware and\/or software for receiving and processing the unicast data from the social network site.","According to one implementation a method is provided that comprises transmitting from a social network site to a television broadcasting site a stream of data comprising broadcast content, the broadcast content designated by the social network site to be broadcast by the television broadcasting site to a plurality of end-user media devices, the end-users being members of the social network site; receiving in the social network site from an end-user media device that is receiving or designated to receive the broadcast content broadcast data related to the broadcast content and identifying data of the member end-user; accessing in the social network site member information of the end-user; and selecting in the social network site by use of the broadcast data and the member information targeted advertising content for the purpose of facilitating a transmission of the targeted advertising content to the end-user media device for it to be played in conjunction with the broadcast content.","Note that in the foregoing description, references to \u201cone implementation\u201d or \u201can implementation\u201d, \u201cin some implementations\u201d, or like terms mean that the feature or features being referred to is included in at least one implementation of the present invention.
