title: Method, article of manufacture and apparatus for restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages
abstract: A method, article of manufacture, and apparatus for restricting the receipt of automatic delegate reply messages. Specifically, the method configures a control message for an electronic mail (e-mail) message addressed to at least one recipient terminal or computer, and sends the e-mail and control messages to the at least one recipient terminal. Upon processing the control message, the at least one recipient terminal determines whether to reply to the received e-mail message with a delegate reply message. As such, a sender of the e-mail message may restrict the receipt of delegate reply messages by configuring the control message through different features or options.

No. 09\/569,790, filed May 12, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,618,748, entitled \u201cMETHOD, ARTICLE OF MANUFACTURE AND APPARATUS FOR RESTRICTING THE RECEIPT OF DELEGATE REPLY MESSAGES\u201d, which is herein incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to electronic mail systems and, more particularly, the invention relates to a method, article of manufacture and apparatus for restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages.","2. Background of the Related Art","In today's electronic mail (e-mail) environment, many users utilize a delegate reply feature while away on vacation or business. This delegate reply feature may automatically create and send a delegate reply message in response to a sent message. The delegate reply message notifies the sender that the user, i.e., the recipient of the sent message, is unavailable or not present, and generally provides a reason for their absence.","Although the delegate reply message is useful to the recipients of the sent message, the delegate reply message also contributes to extraneous messages or clutter to the sender. When the message is sent to a large audience, this cluttering problem is exacerbated if the recipients in the audience use the automatic delegate reply feature. In this situation, extra effort is required by the sender to clean up the delegate reply messages. As such, the large amount of delegate reply e-mail received would discourage the sender from sending messages to such a large audience.","Therefore, a need exists in the art for a method, article of manufacture and apparatus prevent this cluttering problem by restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages.","The invention provides a method, article of manufacture and apparatus for restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages comprising configuring a control message for an electronic mail (e-mail) message addressed to at least one recipient terminal or computer, and sending the e-mail and control messages to the at least one recipient terminal. Upon processing the control message, the at least one recipient terminal determines whether to reply to the received e-mail message with a delegate reply message.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for deleting delegate reply messages comprising receiving an automatic delegate reply message provided in response to a sent electronic mail message to at least one recipient terminal, and deleting the opened delegate reply message.","The invention also provides an apparatus comprising a memory and a processing unit, where the apparatus is configured for restricting the receipt of delegate reply messages. The memory stores an electronic mail message and a delegate reply restriction routine. The processing unit executes the delegate reply restriction routine retrieved from the memory, configures a control message for an electronic mail message upon command from an input device, and sends the electronic mail and control messages to at least one recipient terminal. Upon processing the control message, the at least one recipient terminal determines whether to reply to the received e-mail message with a delegate reply message. In this manner, the apparatus restricts the receipt of automatic delegate reply messages.","Additionally, a computer readable medium storing a software program is provided, where the software program, when executed by a computer, causes the computer to perform a method. In one embodiment of the computer readable medium, the method comprises configuring a control message for an electronic mail message addressed to at least one recipient terminal, and sending the electronic mail and control messages to the at least one recipient terminal. Upon processing the control message, the at least one recipient terminal determines whether to reply to the received e-mail message with a delegate reply message.","In another embodiment of the computer readable medium, the method comprises receiving an automatic delegate reply message provided in response to a sent electronic mail message to at least one recipient terminal, and deleting the opened delegate reply message.","To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","106","100","102","104","106","106","106","106","104","104","102","102","106","104","102","106","102"],"sub":["1","2","n"]},"In addition to conventional e-mail messages, the system  routes control messages to the user terminals . These control messages may comprise a delegate flag for restricting whether other terminals may send a delegate reply message to a previously sent message. The control messages are handled and routed by the system  in exactly the same manner as conventional e-mail. The routines within each user terminal are designed to provide special processing for the control messages when received.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","106","200","202","200","204","206","208","210","210","208","204","202","206","204","212","218","216","212","210","220","222","214","210","208","200"]},"As will be described in detail below, one embodiment of the invention is implemented as a program product for use with a computer system such as, for example, the system  shown in . The program(s) of the program product defines functions of the preferred embodiment and can be contained on a variety of signal\/bearing media, which include, but are not limited to, (i) information permanently stored on non-writable storage media, (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive); (ii) alterable information stored on writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive or hard-disk drive); or (iii) information conveyed to a computer by a communications medium, such as through a computer or telephone network, including wireless communications. Such signal-bearing media, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, represent embodiments of the present invention.","In one embodiment of the invention, the control message processor  configures a control message associated with an e-mail message addressed to at least one recipient terminal or computer, e.g., one recipient terminal or a plurality of recipient terminals. The e-mail processor  and control message processor  then sends the respective e-mail and control messages to the at least one recipient terminal. The control message may comprise a delegate flag, where the at least one recipient terminal processes the control message for determining whether to reply to the received e-mail message with an automatic delegate reply message. The control message may be sent within the e-mail message or separate from the e-mail message.","The control message is configured to implement different features or options in a software routine, i.e., a delegate reply restriction routine. In one configuration of the control message, the invention disables all recipients of a sent message from responding with a delegate reply message. In another embodiment, the invention disables the recipients listed in a CC: field of the sent message from responding with a delegate reply message. In this case, the sender would only receive automatic delegate reply messages from recipients listed in the TO: field of the sent message. Additionally, the invention may disable all recipients of a sent message from responding with a delegate reply message only if the number of recipients addressed in the sent message is above a threshold number.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 4","FIGS. 3A"],"b":["300","400","3","4"]},"The mail program is embodied in a method  shown in . The method  starts at step  and proceeds to retrieve an event at step . Such events may represent a particular command from a user, e.g., the sender of an e-mail message or the recipient of delegate reply messages. The sender may enter the command as an option or selection to a feature provided in the invention. The method  operates in an event-driven manner, i.e., the method  retrieves events and performs different steps depending on a particular event retrieved.","At step , the method  queries whether the event is to send an e-mail message without receiving any corresponding delegate reply messages. Namely, step  determines whether the sender desires to cancel or disable all delegate reply messages that may be provided in response to a sent e-mail message.","If the event is to send an e-mail message without receiving any delegate reply messages, the method  proceeds to create or obtain a message identifier for the message to be sent at step . In one embodiment of the invention, the message identifier includes sender and timestamp information. This timestamp information may comprise the date and time of the e-mail message to be sent. Other embodiments of the message identifier, e.g., a numerical value or terminal number, are also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.","The method  proceeds to write the message identifier in the e-mail message to be sent at step . At step , the method  sets a delegate flag to an off state. This delegate flag may be part of a control message that is either transmitted with the e-mail message or embedded within the e-mail message. After setting the delegate flag, the method  proceeds to send the e-mail message at step  and retrieve the next event at step .","If the event is to send an e-mail message with the possibility of receiving delegate reply messages, i.e., the cancel delegate feature is not selected, the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  queries whether the event is to send an e-mail message in a normal manner. Namely, step  determines whether the sender is to send an e-mail message. If the event is to send an e-mail message, the method proceeds to step , where a message identifier may be obtained in substantially the same manner as step .","At step , the method  queries whether the event is to receive delegate reply messages from recipients specified in the CC: field of a sent e-mail message. Namely, step  determines whether to limit the receipt of delegate reply messages from recipients specified in the TO: field, i.e., not receive delegate reply messages from recipients specified in the CC: field.","If the event is allows receipt of delegate reply messages from recipients in the CC: field in the e-mail message to be sent, the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  determines whether the sender desires to send an e-mail message without receiving any delegate reply messages if the number of recipients addressed in the e-mail message to send exceeds a threshold number. The exact threshold number is selected by the sender, or predetermined by a programmer or a person having ordinary skill in the art.","If the number of recipients addressed in the e-mail message to be sent exceeds the threshold, the method  proceeds to step , where the method  sets the delegate flag to an off state and writes the message identifier in the message. The method  proceeds to send the e-mail message at step  and retrieve the next event at step . If the number of recipients addressed in the e-mail message to be sent does not exceed the threshold, the method  proceeds to write the message identifier in the e-mail message at step . The method  proceeds to send the e-mail message at step  and retrieve the next event at step .","Returning to step , if the event restricts the receipt of delegate reply messages from recipients in the CC: filed in the e-mail message to be sent, the method  determines whether the e-mail message specifies any recipients in CC: field. If no recipients are specified in the CC: field, the method  proceeds to step . If at least one recipient is specified in the CC: field, the method  proceeds to step , where the method  makes an additional copy of the e-mail message. This copy of the e-mail message is to be sent to the recipients originally listed in the CC: field.","At step , the method  sets the delegate flag to an off state. This delegate flag may be sent within a control message associated with the copy of the e-mail message to be sent to the recipients originally listed in the CC: field. The control message may be sent separate from or within the copy of the e-mail message. At step , the method writes the message identifier in the copy of the e-mail message to be sent. The method  proceeds to send the copy of the e-mail message to the recipients originally specified in the CC: field. The CC: listed users are removed from the original version of the message at step  before proceeding to step . In this manner, only the recipients originally listed in the CC: field are disabled from responding to the copy of the sent e-mail message with a delegate reply message.","Returning to step , if the event is not sending an e-mail message, i.e., the sender receives an e-mail message, then the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  determines whether the timer has expired. This timer periodically expires such that the method  may download incoming mail at periodic intervals. If the timer is not expired, the method  proceeds to step , where the query is whether the event is to open a received e-mail message. This received e-mail message may comprise a normal e-mail message or a delegate reply message.","If the event is to open the received e-mail message, the method  proceeds to step , where a window is opened for the received e-mail message. Step  is embodied in method  as further described in connection with . After this step , the method  retrieves the next event at step . If the event is not to open the received e-mail message, the method  proceeds to perform normal processing at step  and retrieve the next event at step .","Returning to step , if the timer is expired, the method  proceeds to step , where the timer is reset. At step , the method  determines whether to download any e-mail messages that were received prior the expiration of the timer. Namely, step  queries whether any new e-mail messages to download. If there are no e-mail messages to download, the method  proceeds to retrieve a new event at step . If there are e-mail messages to download, the method  proceeds to download the received e-mail messages at step .","The method  proceeds to step  to determine whether the received e-mail message is a delegate reply message. If the received e-mail message is a delegate reply message, the method  proceeds to step , where a query is performed to determine whether to receive only one delegate reply message from a particular recipient of a previously sent e-mail message. Namely, step  determines whether to restrict the receipt of duplicate delegate reply messages from a recipient.","If the received messages are not restricted to one delegate reply message per recipient, the method  proceeds to step . At step , the method  identifies the recipient providing the received delegate reply message in response to a sent e-mail message. This identification is used to determine whether this recipient sends any subsequent delegate reply messages. The method  proceeds to determine whether any other e-mail messages were received before the timer expired at step .","If the received messages are restricted to one delegate reply per user, the method  proceeds to step , where the method  determines whether any delegate reply messages have been previously received from the same recipient responding with the delegate reply message. In one embodiment of the invention, step  determines whether the message identifier of the delegate reply message is the same as that of a prior delegate reply message from the same user. The message identifier may include sender and timestamp information as previously described in step . In turn, the delegate reply message has the same message identifier as the sent e-mail message that the delegate reply message was provided in response to. If the other delegate reply messages have been received from this recipient, the method  deletes the other delegate reply messages and proceeds to determine whether there are any additional e-mail messages to download at step . If other delegate reply messages have not been received from this recipient, the method  proceeds to steps  and  as previously discussed.","Returning to step , if the received e-mail message is not a delegate reply message, the method proceeds to step . In this step , the method  queries whether the delegate reply feature is activated. If the delegate reply feature is activated, the method  proceeds to step . If the delegate reply feature is inactive, the method  proceeds to step , where the method  determines whether the delegate flag associated with the received message is inactive, e.g., in an off position.","If the delegate flag is inactive, e.g., in an off position, for the received e-mail message, the method  proceeds to step . If the delegate flag is active, e.g., in an on position, for the received e-mail message, the method  proceeds to prepare a delegate reply message and include the original message identifier therein at step . In one embodiment, the default position of delegate flag is the on position, i.e., the recipient terminal responds with a delegate reply message unless the delegate flag is in an inactive or off position. At step , the method  sends the delegate reply message in response to the received e-mail message, and proceeds to step .","Referring to , the method  is implemented when a received e-mail message is opened at step . The method  starts at step  and proceeds to step , where the window is opened and the message contents are loaded to the display. The method  proceeds to retrieve the next event at step . At step , the method  queries whether the event is to close the previously opened window.","If the window remains open, the method  proceeds to step , where a query is performed whether there is an event, i.e., a command using an option or feature, to delete all delegate reply messages related to the opened delegate reply message. Namely, step  determines whether to delete all delegate reply messages provided in response to the same e-mail message as the opened delegate reply message. To determine whether other delegate reply messages are related to the opened delegate reply message, the method  may compare message identifiers between the opened delegated reply message and other delegate reply messages, i.e., unread or previously opened delegate reply messages. With this feature, the user would open one of the delegate reply messages, and delete this and any other related delegate reply messages.","If the related delegate reply messages are not to be deleted, the method  proceeds to handle other events at step . After this step , the method  returns to step  for retrieving the next event. If the related delegate reply messages are to be deleted, the method  proceeds to step , where the message identifier is retrieved from the opened delegate reply message. This message identifier is used to determine other related delegate reply messages. At step , the method  queries whether any other delegate reply messages have been received. Step  determines whether any unopened, e.g., unread, or previously opened delegate reply messages have been received.","If there are no other delegate reply messages to process at step , the method proceeds to retrieve the next event at step . If there are other delegate reply messages to process at step , the method  proceeds to step , for determining whether the received delegate reply message and the opened message have the same message identifiers.","If a match exists between the message identifiers of the opened e-mail message and received delegate reply message at step , the method  proceeds to remove the matched delegate reply message at step . In this case, the method  proceeds to step  for determining whether other delegate reply messages have been received. If no match exists between the message identifiers of the opened and received delegate reply message at step , the method  proceeds to step , where the next received delegate reply message is considered. Steps  and  are repeated for each received, e.g., unopened, unread or previously opened, delegate reply message.","Returning to step , if the event is to close the previously opened window, the method  proceeds to step . In step , the method  determines whether the opened message is a delegate reply message. If the message is not a delegate reply message, the method  proceeds to close the window at step  and retrieve the next event at step .","If the message is a delegate reply message, the method  proceeds to step , where the method  queries whether to remove the e-mail message. Namely, the method  may implement a feature for automatically deleting the delegate reply message once the recipient is done viewing this e-mail message. If the remove delegate feature is selected, the method  deletes the delegate reply message at step , closes the window at step  and retrieves the next event at step . If the remove delegate feature is not selected, the method  proceeds to close the window at step  and retrieve the next event at step .","Although various embodiments which incorporate the teachings of the present invention have been shown and described in detail herein, those skilled in the art can readily devise many other varied embodiments that still incorporate these teachings."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The teachings of the present invention can be readily understood by considering the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
