title: Service outage details in an error message
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are disclosed for providing a customized service error message to a user of a service. An error encountered during a user action related to the service may be compared to one or more identified service outages to determine if the error may be attributable to any of the service outages. If the error may be caused by one or more of the identified service outages, the customized service error message can be provided, where the customized service error message comprises information about one or more of the identified service outages that cover the error. The customized service error message may be displayed to the user so that the user knows that the error is server/service side (e.g., as opposed to an issue on the user's local device), a timeframe within which the error is expected to be resolved, etc.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Online services and\/or web-based applications may be accessed by network connected users, such as connected to the Internet. Some services may be used by a large number of users, and may utilize vast amounts of resources, such as hardware and software to provide the services to the users. These services may comprise multiple data centers, respectively comprising many (e.g., thousands of) servers and many (e.g., hundreds of) hardware\/network components. Operations comprised on this scale may often have many small-scale, localized, partial outages, for a variety of reasons. Hardware outages may comprise storage disk failures, server crashes, network switches and\/or other hardware failures, for example. Further, small-scale, localized software failures may occur that can affect a portion of users utilizing one or more of the services, for example.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Unless there is a large scale impact affecting a significant proportion of users of an online service, a majority of online service providers typically display a default\/generic error message to affected users when a service outage occurs, for example. Often, for example, there may be no indication as to specifics related to the service outage. For example, there is usually no indication that the outage is being resolved and\/or a possible resolution time-frame. Lack of communication during these types of outages may cause a reduced user experience.","Accordingly, one or more techniques and\/or systems are disclosed where a customized error message may be provided to a user regarding a service outage, where the customized message provides more details about potential causes, responses, and\/or remedies, for example. Service outages for one or more services can be monitored, and if an error is detected during a user action, details of the error can be compared to any current service outages. If the error is covered by one or more identified service outages, details of the service outage may be provided in a customized error message to the user. Further, the customized error message may be provided to the user merely if the service outage actually affects the user.","In one embodiment for providing a customized service error message to a user of a service, one or more service outages for the service can be identified. An error encountered during a user action may be detected, and it can be determined whether the error is covered by one or more of the identified service outages for the service. If the error is covered by the one or more identified service outages, the customized service error message can be provided to the user, where the customized service error message is based upon information related to the one or more identified service outages that cover the error.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Typical large-scale, online applications, such as a web-based email service, operate on a massive scale, spanning multiple data centers with many (e.g., thousands of) servers and many (e.g., hundreds of) hardware\/network components. Operations at this scale can have many small-scale, localized, partial outages at any time, for example, due to a variety of reasons, such as hard disk failures, server crashes, network switches and\/or other hardware failures, for example. Typically, unless there is a large scale impact affecting a significant portion of the users of the service, most online service providers merely provide a default\/generic error message to the affected users. Often, there is little indication to the users that the error was caused due to a service outage. This lack of a more detailed communication during an outage may provide a less satisfactory user experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","104"]},"In the example embodiment , a third error message provides some generic potential problems, noting that there might be a service outage and\/or a programming error. Again, the message  offers some generic advice for a resolution, by refreshing the page and\/or going back to the previous page. Further, the error message  has a link \u201cmore information\u201d which may be selected by the user to navigate to another location for more information about the error. As an example, the link may take to user to a help page which describes the type of error (e.g., http ), and some possible causes. However, typically, this type of information does not provide the user with enough information to determine the actual cause of the error.","As provided herein, a method may be devised that provides for displaying a more detailed service error message to a user of an online service. As an example, providing a more detailed service error message can addresses some of the communication problems described above. For example, when the user is impacted by an outage that causes an error, details of the outage can be displayed in a context of the error message. Information can be retrieved about the outage, such as its scope, functions impacted, latest status, approximate resolution time, etc. Further, merely those users that are actually impacted by a \u201cpartial\u201d outage may be shown these details, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204"]},"In one embodiment, current, active outages for the online service may be identified (e.g., periodically, continually, or at a specified time), for example, based on a variety of service health monitoring systems and\/or other service operational systems. In this embodiment, for example, the current, active outages can be stored in an outage directory (e.g., in a stack with most recent outages on top), which may be accessed by one or more portions of the service to identify possible outages affecting users of the one or more portions.","At  in the exemplary method , it may be determined whether an error encountered during a user action may be covered by the one or more identified service outages. As an example, a user action may comprise initiating a portion of the online service (e.g., opening an application), interacting with one or more portions of the service (e.g., selecting an UI element on a page), requesting an action for the service (e.g., navigating to a webpage for the service), and\/or requesting data comprised by the service (e.g., retrieving a file). It will be appreciated that the user action is not merely limited to the examples described herein, for example, the user action can comprise any user-related action that may cause the online service to perform a response action.","Further, as an example, if an appropriate service action cannot be performed in response to the user action an error may be encountered. For example, an error may be encountered if a portion of the online service attempted to be opened cannot be initiated, if a requested action cannot be performed, if requested data cannot be retrieved, and\/or an element of the service cannot respond to a user interaction. In one embodiment, an error may be categorized into an error type (e.g., 10060 connection timeout in error  of ), for example, which can be determined based on the user action and\/or the resulting service response (e.g., or lack thereof).","In one embodiment, the one or more identified service outages can be reviewed to determine if any one or more of the one or more identified service outages may be a cause of the error, for example, based on the error type. As an example, a service outage comprising a network connection failure (e.g., switch failure) may be a possible cause of an error resulting from no response from a requested server (e.g., 10060 connection timeout error  of , and a HTTP  gateway timeout error, amongst others). In this example, the network connection failure service outage may be considered to cover the error encountered during the user action. Further, as an example, at least one cause of the error encountered during the user action may be determined to be a result of the one or more identified service outages, and therefore may be covered by the one or more identified service outages.","At  in the exemplary method , if the error is determined to be covered by the one or more identified service outages, the customized service error message can be provided to the user based, at least, upon the one or more identified service outages. As an example, if the error is not determined to be covered by the one or more identified service outages for the service attempted to be used by the user, the error may comprise a local (e.g., local to the client used by the user) error for which service outage information may not be provided.","As another example, if the error is determined to covered by one or more of the one or more identified service outages, details of the service outage(s) covering the error can be retrieved (e.g., from the variety of service health monitoring systems and\/or other service operational systems comprising the service). Further, in this example, the details of the service outage(s) covering the error can be included in the error message to the user, resulting in the customized service error message. In one embodiment, the customized service error message can be displayed to the user in an application User Interface (UI) for the service (e.g., in a browser).","Having provided the customized service error message to the user, the exemplary method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"]},"At , the pulled outage data can be put into a directory  of service outages for the one or more online services being monitored. As an example, the directory may comprise a stack where more recent information in located at a top of the stack (e.g., LIFO). In this example, more recent service outage information may be placed on the top of the stack, such as data retrieved from a most recent pulling of outage data from the monitoring systems. At , the directory  can be monitored by the respective one or more online services, for example, for service outage data that may comprise information referencing a system utilized by the online service.","That is, for example, an online service can monitor the directory  to identify when a new service outage is added that includes hardware and\/or software utilized by the online service. As an example, a service outage report may comprise a summary of one or more systems affected and\/or one or more services (or portions thereof) affected by the by outage. At , an online service may identify service outage data (e.g., an outage summary) in the directory  that could affect the online service. At , the online service can send a request for more details about the identified service outage, for example, in an effort to determine if the online service is affected by the outage, what may be the cause of the outage, and\/or possible resolutions for the outage, for example.","In one embodiment, the request for outage details may be triggered by an error encountered during a user action involving the online service. As an example, a user may be performing the user action by interacting with the online service (e.g., opening a web-application, requesting data, navigating to a portion of the online service, etc.) when an error is detected (e.g., the service cannot respond appropriately to the user action). In this embodiment, the online service may send the request for service outage details when the error is detected, for example, and the request may comprise the detected error and\/or the service outage data identified in the directory .","At  in the example embodiment , the request for service outage details can be received, such as at a service that can provide service outage details. At , it may be determined whether the error is covered by one or more service outages identified for one or more online services for which active outage data has been pulled (e.g., at ). In one embodiment, as described above (e.g., at  of ), an error may be covered by a service outage if the service outage may be a potential cause of the error, and\/or if an error type for the error may be one that may be caused by the service outage.","If the error is determined not to be covered by the one or more service outages (NO at ) a response can be returned to the requesting online service that indicates the error is not covered by identified service outages, at . If the error is determined to be covered by the one or more service outages (YES at ) affinitization data may be identified for the user, at . As an example, affinitization data may comprise a tendency and\/or preference of the user to utilize particular services (or portions thereof) and\/or access data that is resident on particular clusters of service devices. In one embodiment, the affinitization data may comprise a location of service related data utilized by the user and\/or a location of one or more portions of the service utilized by the user. For example, a location of service related data may comprise a particular data center (e.g., or portion of the data center), utilized by the online service, that is located close to the user. Further, for example, a location of one or more portions of the service may comprise a network operations center (NOC) (e.g., or a portion of the NOC) that provides the services typically used by the user, and\/or may be located in a vicinity of the user, for example.","In one embodiment, the affinitization data identified for the user may be used to determine whether the user is affected by a service outage. As an example, the type of affinitization data described above may be cross-referenced with the service outage data to determine whether the user may be affected by one or more of the service outages that cover the error. At , it may be determined whether the user is covered or affected by one or more of the services outages that cover the error. In one embodiment, determining whether the user is affected by one of the one or more identified service outages can comprise determining that the service outage impacts the identified location of the service related data utilized by the user, and\/or the location of the one or more portions of the service utilized by the user.","If it is determined that the user is not covered or affected by at least one of the one or more identified service outages (NO at ), a response can be returned to the online service comprising an indication that the user may not be covered by an identified service outage (e.g., the error may be attributable to something local to the user, such as hardware and\/or software issues on the laptop, desktop, etc. of the user, for example). If it is determined that the user is covered by at least one of the one or more identified service outages (YES at ), details of the one or more service outages covering the user may be identified, at . In one embodiment, information about a service outage may comprise a scope of the service outage (e.g., what hardware, services and\/or data storage may be causing the outage), one or more functions that may be impacted by the service outage (e.g., service, data retrieval, particular actions, etc.), a status of the service outage (e.g., identified, being reviewed, under repair, resolved, etc.), and\/or an approximate resolution time for the service outage (e.g., how long until the outage is fixed). As an example, the information about a service outage can be retrieved from the active outage data pulled for the one or more online services being monitored.","At  in the example embodiment , information about a service outage, which may be included in a customized error message  to the user, can be returned to the online service, for example, in response to the service outage request from the online service. As an illustrative example,  illustrates an example embodiment  of information that may be used for a customized error message, which may be provided to a user. In this example , the information in the error message  comprises possible causes  of the error, identifying that the server hosting the data requested is out, and that a particular storage location (e.g., for the host server) has failed.","Further, current actions  (e.g., a status) that may be under way to resolve the outage can be provided. In this example, the user is notified that the outage has been identified, attempts are being made to resolve it, which includes utilizing a backup location for the requested data. An expected outage resolution  notice can be provided, which may let the user know when the outage may be resolved. Additionally, possible user actions  can be provided, which may give the user error response options. In one embodiment, one of the user response options may comprise requesting a service outage resolution notification. As an example, when the service outage that covers the error for the user is resolved a notice of resolution can be sent to those users that have requested the notification. In this way, for example, the user may be able to move onto other actions instead of having to continue to attempt the user action, during which the error was encountered, in hopes that it was resolved. That is, the users will be notified with the service outage is resolved and the service is once again available, and the users may thus engage in other activities instead of routinely \u201cchecking back\u201d to see if the service is available.","At  in the example embodiment , the online service may display the customized error message  to the user, such as in a UI provided by the online service. Providing this type of detailed information to the user and\/or providing for resolution notification, for example, may provide an enhanced user experience for an online service, by allowing the user to quickly determine a source of an error and\/or a possible (time of) re-availability of the service.","In one aspect, when a service outage occurs that may affect a large number of online services and\/or for which a large number of errors are detected, for example, an outage detection and response service may be overwhelmed with requests for outage details (e.g.,  of ). As an example, a collection of online services may comprise a plurality of services, utilizing a large amount of hardware distributed all over the country, accessed by millions of users. In this example, when an outage affects several of the services (e.g., a portion of a data center crashes), it may also affects thousands or millions of users. In this example, the outage detection and response service may receive a large amount of requests, which may, in-turn, cause the service to crash. In one embodiment, a request threshold may be utilized to mitigate potential overwhelming of an outage detection and response service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","406"]},"At , it may be determined if the outage request threshold has been met (e.g., the RPS has met or exceeded the threshold). If the outage request threshold is met (YES at ), a response request can be returned to the online service, in response to the received request from the service. In one embodiment, the response request can comprise a notification to the online service to mitigate sending any more outage requests for a desired period of time. As an example, the response to the request from the online service for service outage details can comprise a request from the outage detection and response service to stop sending service outage requests for a specified period of time (e.g., long enough to recover from the potential overwhelming number of requests received). In this way, for example, the outage detection and response service may be able to handle incoming requests if a number of requests received are reduced.","If the request threshold is not met (NO at ), a customized message may be returned, which comprises details about the one or more service outages (e.g., as described in ). In response to viewing the customized error message, the user may indicate that they wish to receive a notification of outage resolution. For example, the user may select an option in the error message (e.g.,  of ) that requests a resolution notification. At , if a resolution notice request is not received (NO at ), no action may be taken when the service outage is resolved.","If a resolution notice request is received (YES at ), such as from the user, service outage resolution monitoring can be performed, at . As an example, current, active outage data that is pulled for the one or more online services (e.g.,  of ) can be reviewed to determine if the monitored service outage is still listed in the pulled data (e.g., pulled periodically, at desired intervals). Each time the current, active outage data that is pulled, for example, it may be determined whether the monitored service outage is still active (e.g., unresolved), at . If the monitored service outage is still active (e.g., outage still persists) (NO at ), a subsequent list of current, active outage data can be monitored, at . If the monitored service outage is no longer active (YES at ), a notice of service outage resolution can be returned to the online service, at , which may inform the user that the service outage has been resolved (e.g., and that the service is once again available).","A system may be devised that can provide for detailed service outage information to be presented to a user of an online service, such as when an error is detected while using the online service. Rather than merely providing a generic error that indicates the user's action cannot be performed, details can be provided that comprise an actual reason for the error, if caused by a detected service outage. Further, a status of the service outage causing the error may be provided, along with possible resolution information, and\/or user options for dealing with the error, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","602","602","604","654","652","606","604","656","654"]},"In the exemplary system , a message providing component  is operably coupled with the error determination component .

For example, the outage identification component  can identify one or more service outages  for one or more services . In this example, the error determination component  can compare the error  to the one or more identified service outages  to see if at least one of the one or more identified service outages  may have caused the error  (e.g., cover the error).

The alert mode component  may mitigate the overload by returning a notification response  to a service requesting the service outage data, where the response comprises a request to mitigate sending an outage request for a specified period of time. Further, the alert mode component  may trigger the notification response  when an outage request threshold is met, where the outage request threshold can comprise a number of outage requests received over a defined period of time (e.g., requests per second (RPS).","A user affinitization component  can be configured to identify affinitization data  for the user . The affinitization data  may comprise a location of service related data utilized by the user and\/or a location of one or more portions of the service utilized by the user. Further, the user affinitization component  can be configured to determine whether the user is affected by the one or more service outages based at least upon the affinitization data . Additionally the user affinitization component  can allow the customized service error message  to be provided to the user  (e.g., via the message providing component ) merely if the user is affected by the one or more service outages.","In one embodiment, the message providing component  can be configured to provide the customized error message  to the service  so that the message may be displayed to the user  in a service-based user-interface  (UI).
