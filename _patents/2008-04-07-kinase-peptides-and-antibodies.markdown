No. 11\/435,570 filed 17 May 2006, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/682,115 filed May 18, 2005, the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to kinase peptides and antibodies having immunospecificity for kinase polypeptides and proteins, as well as nucleic acids related to these peptides and antibodies, and methods for using the peptides and antibodies.","Protein kinases are enzymes that covalently modify proteins by attaching phosphate groups (from ATP) to serine, threonine, and\/or tyrosine residues. In so doing, the functional properties of the protein kinase's substrates are modified. Protein kinases transduce signals from the cell membrane into the interior of the cell. Such signals include not only those arising from ligand-receptor interactions but also environmental perturbations when the membrane undergoes mechanical deformation (i.e., cell stretch or shear stress). Ultimately, the activation of signaling pathways that use protein kinases often culminate in the reprogramming of gene expression through the direct regulation of transcription factors or through the regulation of mRNA stability or protein translation. Protein kinases regulate most aspects of normal cellular function.","Many signal transduction pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation originate with transmembrane receptors containing cytoplasmic protein kinase domains. For instance, there are many kinds of cytokine and growth factor receptors that belong to different receptor families. Most of these receptors function as: (1) receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine-kinase-associated receptor (see, for example, Fanti et al. (1993) Annu. Rev. Biochem, 62:453); (2) receptors serine\/threonine kinase (for example, Josso and di Clemente, (1997) Curr Opin Genet Dev., 7:371-7; Dijke et al. (1996), Curr Opin Cell Biol., 8(2):139-45); or (3) G-protein linked receptors (Piper and Zeuzem (2004) Curr Pharm Des., 10(28):3539-45; Presland (2004) Biochem Soc Trans., 32(Pt 5):888-91). Following binding with an extracellular ligand and activation, the receptors trigger different cascade of intracellular protein phosphorylation to transduction signals, thereby altering the cell's pattern of gene expression and leading to biological effects.","The pathophysiological dysfunction of protein kinase signaling pathways underlies the molecular basis of many cancers and of several manifestations of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertrophy and other types of left ventricular remodeling, ischemia\/reperfusion injury, angiogenesis, and atherogenesis. Because of the important roles the protein kinases play, they have emerged as crucial targets for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic indications, including, cancer, inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases (e.g., diabetes), cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders.","The present invention provides kinase peptides, antibodies, and related nucleic acids. The present invention also provides diagnostic and therapeutic compositions and methods using these peptides, antibodies and nucleic acids.","The present invention provides an isolated and\/or recombinant kinase peptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs. 1-23.","In one embodiment, a mixture comprising two or more isolated and\/or recombinant kinase peptides is provided.","The invention further provides an antibody specifically immunoreactive with one or more kinase peptides comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs. 1-23.","In one embodiment, a mixture comprising two or more antibodies is provided.","The present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs. 1-23, or a complementary nucleotide sequence.]","In one embodiment, a mixture comprising two or more nucleic acids is provided.","The kinase peptide, antibody, or nucleic acid of the invention may further comprise a detectable label.

In one embodiment, the secondary antibody reacts with the primary antibody. In another embodiment, the secondary antibody is specifically immunoreactive with one or more kinase peptides comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs. 1-23. The secondary antibody may be labeled with a detectable label.","The present invention provides a composition for detecting one or more kinase polypeptides or proteins in a sample, comprising a nucleic acid which comprises at least a portion of a sequence encoding a peptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs. 1-23, or a complementary nucleotide sequence. The nucleic acid preferably comprises at least about 5 up to about 30 nucleic acid bases encoding a portion of a peptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs. 1-23, or a complementary nucleotide sequence.","The nucleic acid may be labeled with a detectable label.","The present invention provides a method for detecting, diagnosing, staging or monitoring the progression of a kinase-mediated disease in a subject, the method comprising the steps of a) providing a sample from the subject, b) detecting a level of a kinase polypeptide or protein in the sample using an antibody specifically immunoreactive with a kinase peptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs. 1-23; and c) comparing the level(s) of the kinase polypeptide(s) in the sample to a baseline level of the kinase polypeptide(s); where a difference in level(s) of the kinase polypeptide(s) is indicative of the presence, stage or progression of the disease in the subject.","The step of detecting or monitoring is may be accomplished by a method selected from the group consisting of immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.","The present invention provides a method for detecting, diagnosing, staging or monitoring the progression of a kinase-mediated disease in a subject, the method comprising the steps of: a) providing a sample from the subject, b) detecting a level of a kinase nucleic acid in the sample using a nucleic acid which comprises a sequence encoding a peptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOs. 1-23, or a complementary nucleotide sequence; and c) comparing the level of the kinase nucleic acid in the sample to a baseline level of the kinase nucleic acid; where a difference in level of the kinase nucleic acid is indicative of the presence, stage or progression of the disease in the subject.","The kinase nucleic acid may be a DNA or an RNA.","The step of detecting or monitoring is may be accomplished by a method selected from the group consisting of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR(RT-PCR), in situ hybridization, Southern blot, Northern blot, sequence analysis, gene microarray analysis, and detection of a reporter gene.","In one aspect, the method of the invention further comprises determining the efficacy of therapeutic intervention or treatment by a step of (d) modifying therapeutic intervention or treatment of the disease based on the difference in kinase level(s) as indicated in step (c).","In one embodiment, the sample is obtained from a patient to be diagnosed monitored or treated for the disease, and the baseline level is from a control sample from a patient not having the disease.","In another embodiment, the sample is from a patient who is known to have the disease, and the baseline level comprises a level of kinase from a previous disease sample from the same patient, wherein a difference in the level of the kinase indicates that the patient is at a different disease stage, or is indicative of the efficacy of therapeutic intervention or treatment, e.g, the responsiveness of the patient to therapy.","The sample of the invention may comprise, for example, a bodily fluid sample, a tissue sample, or a cell sample. The sample may be immobilized on a substrate.","In one embodiment, the method of the invention is used to determine the prognosis of the disease in a patient.

The peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids may be used in researching kinase-related biological activities, e.g., signal transduction, as well as in disease diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis and therapy.","Protein Kinases","Different kinases phosphorylate different amino acid residues, and they may play different yet overlapping roles. There are over 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome. For example, tyrosine protein kinases in general respond to growth factors or mitogenic signals and phosphorylate proteins that initiate rapid signal transduction. Serine\/threonine protein kinases typically phosphorylate proteins that integrate and amplify intracellular signals, leading in some cases to regulation of certain transcription factors and expression of genes. Many kinases have been implicated as playing a role in diseases, including cancer and other inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases (e.g., diabetes), cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders.

A disease or disorder in which a kinase is implicated is referred to herein as a \u201ckinase-mediated disease.\u201d","Useful kinases of the present invention include both receptor and nonreceptor kinases. The kinases serve as the targets for research, diagnostic or therapeutic application of the present invention. Tables 1-4 list some nonlimiting examples. * in Tables 1-4 refers to the OMIM\u2122.

RTKs recognize peptide growth factor ligands (e.g., hormones). The binding of a ligand leads to autophosphorylation of RTKs and stimulates the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity, which subsequently stimulates a signal transduction cascade. The RTK pathways are involved in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and many other functions by transmitting a hormone signal to Ras, a monomeric G protein that passes the signal on to downstream components. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been shown to be involved in cancer (see, e.g., Rowinsky (2003) The Oncologist, 8:5-17; Bucher, et al., (2004), Swiss Med. Wkly., 134:145-153; Gotlib et al., 2004, Blood, 103: 2879-91), and cardiovascular diseases (e.g., see Force et al. (2004) Circulation, 109:1196-1205), as well as other diseases.","In one embodiment, the RTK is selected from the group consisting of: Ax1 (P30530), ErbB3 (NP001973), PDGF R .\u03b1(NP006197), Dtk (P55144), ErbB4 (Q15303), PDGF R .beta. (NP002600), PDGF R .beta. (P02452), FGF R1 (NP056934), c-Ret (P07949), EphA1 (NP005223), FGF R2 \u03b1(NP002010), ROR1 (Q01973), EphA2 (NP004422), FGF R3 (NM-022965), ROR2 (Q01974), EphA3 (NP872585), FGF R4 (NM022965), SCF R (NP954637), EphA4 (P54764), Flt-3 (NP000750), Tie-1 (P35590), EphA6 (P54758), HGF R (Q04756), Tie-2 (Q02763), EphA7 (NP004431), IGF-1 R(NP000609), TrkA (P04629), EphB1 (NP004432), Insulin R(NP034700), TrkB (Q16620), EphB2 (NP004433), M-CSF R (P07333), TrkC(CAA12029), EphB4 (NP004435), Mer (Q12866), VEGF R1 (NP003367), EphB6 (NP004436), MSP R (Q04912), VEGF R2 (AAR26285), ErbB2 (NP004439), MuSK (NP005583), and VEGF R3 (P35916). The numbers in the parentheses represent NCBI protein accession numbers for the RTKs.","In another embodiment, the protein kinase is a Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activated Ras induces a kinase signal cascade that culminates in activation of MAPK. MAPKs are serine\/threonine kinases that can translocate into the nucleus of the cell, and phosphorylate transcription factors that regulate gene expression. Multiple MAPK pathways are found in eukaryotic cells, and lead to different specific actions depending on the stimulus. MAPKs may, amongst other things, promote expression of cyclins, proteins involved in cell division (cell cycle).","In another embodiment of the invention, the kinase is an MAPK-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase which is also a serine\/threonine kinase. Several MAPKAP kinases are activated by MAPK family members termed extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1\/ERK2) and stress activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2, also called p38). The MAPKAP kinases can be subdivided into two groups; those comprising two kinase domains in a single polypeptide, and those with a single kinase domain. For example, the MAPKAP kinases comprising a single kinase domain are MAPKAP-K2, MAPKAP-K3, MAPKAP-K5 (also called p38-regulated activated kinase or PRAK) and MAPK-integrating kinase (MNK). MAPKAP-K2 and MAPKAP-K3 are activated by SAPK2 in vivo and one of their physiological substrates is heat shock protein (HSP) 27. MAPKAP-K5 is also activated in vivo by SAPK2. MAPKAP-K2 is involved in controlling production of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumomecrosis factor, interleukin 6 and interferon \u03b3, at a post-transcriptional level. The cellular response to DNA damage is mediated by evolutionarily conserved Ser\/Thr kinases, phosphorylation of Cdc25 protein phosphatases, binding to 14-3-3 proteins, and exit from the cell cycle. MAPKAP kinase-2 is directly responsible for Cdc25B\/C phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding in vitro and in response to UV-induced DNA damage within mammalian cells. Downregulation of MAPKAP kinase-2 eliminates DNA damage-induced G2\/M, G1, and intra S phase checkpoints. MAPKs and MAPKAP kinases have been indicated in cancer (e.g., see Platanias (2003) Blood, 101: 4667-4679), inflammatory diseases (e.g., Hommes, et al. (2003) Gut 52:144-151), and diabetes (e.g., Shanley (2004) Invest Opthalmol Vis Sci. 45:1088-94), as well as other diseases.","In one embodiment, the MAPKAP kinase contains a sequence represented by NCBI protein accession number AAD09136, AA960234, AAH24559, or AAH63064.","In another embodiment, the protein kinase is a phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase. PI3 kinases are activated by growth factors, insulin and G-protein coupled receptors and convert phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), a ubiquitous second messager. PIP3 binds to a variety of effector molecules including protein serine\/threonine kinases (protein kinase B, PDK1), Tec family protein tyrosine kinases, and regulators of monomeric G-proteins (such as GRP 1) that control cell growth, proliferation and shape, prevent apoptosis, stimulate directed cell movement and mediate the metabolic actions of insulin. PI3 has been indicated in diabetes (e.g., Shanley (2004) Invest Opthalmol V is Sci. 45:1088-94; Storz (1999) Eur J. Biochem. 266:17-25), and other diseases. In one embodiment, the PI3 kinase is p110\u03b2 or p85\u03b1.","Isolated Kinase Peptides","The present invention provides novel isolated kinase peptides, as well as a mixture containing two or more kinase peptides.","As used herein, the term \u201cpeptide\u201d refers to a natural or synthetic molecule comprising two or more amino acids linked by the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another. A peptide of the present invention is not limited by length, thus the term encompasses \u201cpolypeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein.\u201d A \u201ckinase peptide\u201d of the present invention is a peptide fragment derived from a kinase protein and is preferably between about 2 to about 100 amino acids in length, more preferably between about 5 to about 50 amino acids in length, more preferably between about 10 to about 30 amino acids in length, even more preferably between about 10 to about 20 amino acids in length. The terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d sometimes are used interchangeably. A \u201ckinase polypeptide\u201d or \u201ckinase protein\u201d may refer to an entire kinase protein, or to fragment or variant thereof.","Preferably, the kinase peptide of the present invention contains an epitope for the production of an antibody specifically immunoreactive to the kinase peptide.","In a preferred embodiment, the peptide of the present invention comprises a peptide containing an epitope, either an immunogenic epitope or an antigenic epitope. An \u201cimmunogenic epitope\u201d as used herein, refers to a portion of a peptide that elicits an antibody response in an animal, as determined by any method known in the art, for example, by the methods for generating antibodies described herein. (See, for example, Geysen et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:3998-4002). The term \u201cantigenic epitope\u201d as used herein refers to a portion of a protein to which an antibody can immunospecifically bind to its antigen as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by the immunoassays described herein. Antigenic epitopes need not necessarily be immunogenic. Peptides that function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:5131-5135; and as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211).","As used herein, the term \u201cisolated,\u201d with respect to peptides, nucleic acids, or antibodies, refers to that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring nucleic acid or peptide or antibody present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same nucleic acid or peptide or antibody, which is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such isolated nucleic acid could be part of a vector and such isolated nucleic acid or peptide or antibody could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that the vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. An \u201cisolated\u201d peptide, nucleic acid or antibody, also includes material synthesized, or produced by recombinant DNA technology, as well as preparations such as serum containing an antibody of the invention.","In one embodiment, the kinase peptide of the invention is synthesized by methods known in the art and as described below. In another preferred embodiment, the kinase peptide is produced by expressing a nucleic acid encoding the peptide.","Kinase peptides can be synthesized by different methods well known in the art. For example, including ribosomally-directed fermentation methods, as well as non-ribosomal strategies and chemical synthesis methods. Kinase peptides containing the 20 natural amino acids can be prepared via recombinant expression systems that utilize the ribosomally directed peptide synthesis machinery of a host organism, e.g., . Alternatively, kinase peptides, including those containing unnatural or non-proteninogenic amino acids or modified amino acid side chains can be prepared through a solution-phase chemical synthesis of peptides (e.g., using N-Boc protection and the activated ester route). Protocols for sequence solution-phase chemical synthesis of peptides have been described in Andersson et al., Biopolymers 55:227-250 (2000). One method used for generating peptides is solution-phase chemical synthesis, which employs a N-tert-butoxy (N-Boc) protected amino acid and a C-protected amino acid (Andersson et al., Biopolymers 55: 227-250 (2000)). An alternative solution-phase method for chemically-catalyzed peptide synthesis employs pre-activated esters as the carboxyl component for coupling (Andersson et al., Biopolymers 55: 227-250 (2000)). In addition, enzyme-mediated solid-phase peptide synthesis has also been employed. Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) uses insoluble resin supports, and has simplified and accelerated peptide synthesis and facilitated purification (Merrifield, R. B., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85: 2149-2154 (1963)). Since the growing peptide is anchored on an insoluble resin, unreacted soluble reagents can be removed by simple filtration or washing without manipulative losses. Solid phase peptide synthesis can be performed using automation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various peptides are within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","The kinase peptides according to the present invention can be modified, for example, by the addition of an acetyl or amine group or amino acids at the amino- and\/or carboxy-terminus of the peptide. Amino acid addition modifications may also be performed, for example, to alter the conformation of the epitope bearing peptide such that the epitope will have a conformation more closely related to the structure of the epitope in the native protein. An example of a modified epitope-bearing peptide of the invention is a peptide in which one or more cysteine residues have been added to the peptide to allow for the formation of a disulfide bond between two cysteines, thus resulting in a stable loop structure of the epitope-bearing peptide under non-reducing conditions. Disulfide bonds can form between a cysteine residue added to the peptide and a cysteine residue of the naturally-occurring epitope, or between two cysteines which have both been added to the naturally-occurring epitope-bearing peptide.","In addition, it is possible to modify one or more amino acid residues of the peptide by substitution with cysteines to promote the formation of disulfide bonded loop structures. Cyclic thioether molecules of synthetic peptides can be routinely generated using techniques known in the art, e.g., as described in PCT publication WO 97\/46251, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Other modifications of epitope-bearing peptides contemplated by this invention include biotinylation.","In one embodiment, the kinase peptide of the invention is modified by adding an acetyl group at the amino terminus and\/or an amide group at the carboxyl terminus.","The kinase peptide of the invention may be provided as a chimeric peptide, such as in the form of a fusion peptide. For instance, the kinase peptide can be provided as a recombinant fusion peptide which includes a second peptide portion having an amino acid sequence unrelated (heterologous) to the kinase peptide. For example, the second peptide portion may be glutathione-S-transferase, or a peptide with an enzymatic activity such as alkaline phosphatase, or an epitope tag.","In one embodiment, the kinase peptide of the present invention has a biological activity including the ability to bind to a ligand, phosphorylate a tyrosine, serine or threonine residue of a protein or peptide substrate. For example, the kinase peptide may compete with a kinase protein in binding to the ligand, thus specifically modulates the activities of the kinase protein.","In one embodiment, the kinase peptide contains an amino acid sequence that is identical with or homologous to a sequence represented by anyone of SEQ ID NOs. 1-23. A homologous sequence is at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identical to the peptide represented by anyone of SEQ ID NOs. 1-23.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"RTK\u2003Peptides:",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20031","YVHHRDLAAARNIL"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20032","CIHRRDLAARNNVL"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20033","FVHRDLAAARNNCM"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20034","LVHRDDLLAARNVL"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20035","FIHHRDIAAARNCL"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20036","FVHRDDLATRNCCL"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"MAPKAP\u2003Peptides:",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20037","KKLNRTLSVA"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20038","CEQIKIKKIEDASNP"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u20039","KQAGSSSASQGCNNQG"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200310","CSHNSLTpTP"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200311","CNSSKPTPQLKPIES"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"PI3\u2003Peptides:",{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200312","CTEDRIQHALERR"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200313","CYKPEKSDLLSSPP"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200314","KGLHEFDSLK"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200315","NEPLEFDINI"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200316","LNSLIKLNAV"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200317","EVVSTSETIA"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200318","KQKFDEALRE"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200319","KKGLECSTLY"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200320","AEWYWGDISR"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200321","DVKLLYPVSK"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200322","IQRIMHNYDK"]},{"entry":[{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO.\u200323","EDDEDLPHHD"]}]}}}}},"In a preferred embodiment, the kinase peptide is encoded by a nucleic acid containing any combination of nucleotide degeneracy.","The invention also provides a mixture of two or more kinase peptides, each containing an amino acid sequence that is identical with or homologous to a sequence represented in SEQ ID NOs. 1-23.

The antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal or recombinant, produced by methods known in the art or as described below.","As use herein, the term \u201cspecifically immunoreactive\u201d refers to a measurable and reproducible specific immunoreaction such as binding between a peptide and an antibody, that is determinative of the presence of the peptide in the presence of a heterogeneous population of peptides and other biologics. The term \u201cspecifically immunoreactive\u201d may include specific recognition of structural shapes and surface features. Thus, under designated conditions, an antibody specifically immunoreactive to a particular peptide does not bind in a significant amount to other peptides present in the sample. An antibody specifically immunoreactive to a peptide has an association constant of at least 10.sup.3M.sup.\u22121 or 10.sup.4M.sup.\u22121, sometimes about 10.sup.5M.sup.\u22121 or 10.sup.6M.sup.\u22121, in other instances 10.sup.6M.sup.\u22121 or 10.sup.7M.sup.\u22121, preferably about 10.sup.8M.sup.\u22121 to 10.sup.9M.sup.\u22121, and more preferably, about 10.sup.10M.sup.\u22121 to 10.sup.11M.sup.\u22121 or higher. A variety of immunoassay formats can be used to determine antibodies specifically immunoreactive to a particular peptide. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a peptide. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.","As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to an immunoglobulin specifically immunoreactive to a given antigen (e.g., a kinase peptide of the invention). The term \u201cantibody\u201d as used herein is intended to include whole antibodies of any isotype (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, etc), and fragments thereof. An \u201cantibody\u201d of the invention also includes an antibody preparation, e.g., a serum (antiserum). Antibodies can be fragmented using conventional techniques and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as whole antibodies. Thus, the term includes segments of proteolytically-cleaved or recombinantly-prepared portions of an antibody molecule that selectively reacts with a certain protein or peptide. Non-limiting examples of such proteolytic and\/or recombinant fragments include Fab, F(ab\u2032)2, Fab\u2032, Fv, and single chain antibodies (scFv) containing a V[L] and\/or V[H] domain joined by a peptide linker. The scFv's may be covalently or non-covalently linked to form antibodies having two or more binding sites. Antibodies may be labeled with detectable labels by one of skill in the art. The label can be a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, enzyme, or enzyme co-factor, or any other labels known in the art. In some aspects, the antibody that binds to an entity one wishes to measure (the primary antibody) is not labeled, but is instead detected by binding of a labeled secondary antibody that specifically binds to the primary antibody.","Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab\u2032) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), intracellularly made antibodies (i.e., intrabodies), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. The antibodies of the invention can be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are of human, murine (e.g., mouse and rat), donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken origin.","As used herein, a \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that recognizes only one type of antigen. This type of antibodies is produced by the daughter cells of a single antibody-producing hybridoma. A monoclonal antibody typically displays a single binding affinity for any epitope with which it immunoreacts. A monoclonal antibody may contain an antibody molecule having a plurality of antibody combining sites, each immunospecific for a different epitope, e.g., a bispecific monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. (Kohler and Milstein (1975), Nature, 256:495-497; U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110; Ausubel et al.

(1992, 1993), eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y.).","The antibodies of the present invention can be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific, trispecific, or of greater multispecificity). Multispecific antibodies can be specific for different epitopes of a peptide of the present invention, or can be specific for both a peptide of the present invention, and a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous peptide or solid support material. (See, e.g., WO 93\/17715; WO 92\/08802; WO 91\/00360; WO 92\/05793; Tutt et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147:60-69; U.S. Pat.

For example, the antibodies may be produced against a peptide containing repeated units of a kinase peptide sequence of the invention, or they may be produced against a peptide containing two or more kinase peptide sequences of the invention, or the combination thereof.","Moreover, antibodies can also be prepared from any region of the peptides and kinase peptides of the invention. In addition, if a polypeptide is a receptor protein, e.g., a receptor kinase, antibodies can be developed against an entire receptor or portions of the receptor, for example, an intracellular domain, an extracellular domain, the entire transmembrane domain, specific transmembrane segments, any of the intracellular or extracellular loops, or any portions of these regions. Antibodies can also be developed against specific functional sites, such as the site of ligand binding, or sites that are glycosylated, phosphorylated, myristylated, or amidated, for example.","In the present invention, the kinase peptides for generating antibodies preferably contain a sequence of at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, more preferably at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, and, preferably, between about 5 to about 50 amino acids in length, more preferably between about 10 to about 30 amino acids in length, even more preferably between about 10 to about 20 amino acids in length. The preferred kinase peptides are those derived from the RTK proteins listed in Table 1 above; that is, preferred kinase peptides have an amino acid sequence the same as or homologous to a portion of the sequence of the proteins listed in Table 1.","The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be prepared using well-established methods. In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibodies are prepared using hybridoma technology, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein (1975), Nature, 256:495. In a hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is typically immunized with an immunizing agent (e.g., a kinase peptide of the invention) to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-1031. Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, rabbit, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.","Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol. (1984), 133:3001; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).","The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies. Preferably, the binding specificity (i.e., specific immunoreactivity) of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding specificity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard (1980), Anal. Biochem., 107:220.","After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium or RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.","The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.","The monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also can be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Such a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide can be substituted for the constant domains of an antibody of the invention, or can be substituted for the variable domains of one antigen-combining site of an antibody of the invention to create a chimeric bivalent antibody.","Polyclonal antibodies of the invention can also be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For the production of polyclonal antibodies in vivo, host animals, such as rabbits, rats, mice, sheep, or goats, are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for example, by intraperitoneal and\/or intradermal injection. Injection material is typically an emulsion containing about 100 \u03bcg of peptide or carrier protein. Various adjuvants can also be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species. Adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of antibodies in serum from an immunized animal can be increased by selection of antibodies, e.g., by adsorption of the peptide onto a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.","Antibodies encompassed by the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular embodiment, such phage can be utilized to display antigen binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured onto a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv, or disulfide stabilized antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage polynucleotide III or polynucleotide VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. (1995) J. Immunol. Methods, 182:41-50; Ames et al.

(1988) Science, 240:1038-1040, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","For some uses, including the in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal immunoglobulin and a human immunoglobulin constant region. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, e.g., Morrison (1985), Science, 229:1202; Oi et al. (1986), BioTechniques, 4:214; Gillies et al. (1989), J. Immunol. Methods, 125:191-202; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).","Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species that bind to the desired antigen and have one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the nonhuman species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions are substituted with corresponding residues from the CDR and framework regions of the donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding, and by sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,762 and 5,585,089; and Riechmann et al. (1988) Nature, 332:323, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, including, for example, CDR-grafting (EP 239, 400; PCT publication WO 91\/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; and 5,585,089); veneering or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan (1991), Molecular Immunology, 28(4\/5):489-498; Studnicka et al. (1994) Protein Engineering, 7(6):805-814; Roguska et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:969-973; and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332).","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients, so as to avoid or alleviate immune reaction to foreign protein. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art, including the phage display methods described above, using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO 98\/46645, WO 98\/50433, WO 98\/24893, WO 98\/16654, WO 96\/34096, WO 96\/33735, and WO 91\/10741; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin polynucleotides. For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin polynucleotide complexes can be introduced randomly, or by homologous recombination, into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells, in addition to the human heavy and light chain polynucleotides. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin polynucleotides can be rendered nonfunctional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the J.sub.H region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention.","Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce useful human IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE antibodies. For an overview of the technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995) Intl. Rev. Immunol., 13:65-93.

The term should also be understood to include, as equivalents, analogs of either RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs, and, as applicable to the embodiment being described, single (sense or antisense) and double-stranded polynucleotides. ESTs, chromosomes, cDNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs are representative examples of molecules that may be referred to as nucleic acids. The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d is not limited by length, thus encompasses \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and \u201coligonucleotide.\u201d A \u201cnucleic acid encoding a kinase peptide,\u201d as used herein, is preferably between about 6 to about 300 nucleotides in length, more preferably between about 15 to about 150 nucleotides in length, and more preferably, between about 30 to about 90 nucleotides in length, and more preferably, between about 30 to about 60 nucleotides in length.","In one embodiment, the invention provides a nucleic acid encoding a peptide of the invention, or a complementary sequence thereof.","In another embodiment, the invention provides a mixture containing two or more nucleic acids as described above.","As used herein, the term \u201cstringent conditions\u201d refers to conditions where only nucleic acid sequences which are very similar to each other will hybridize. The precise conditions determining the stringency of a particular hybridization include not only the ionic strength, temperature, and the concentration of destabilizing agents such as formamide, but also on factors such as the length of the nucleic acid sequences, their base composition, the percent of mismatched base pairs between the two sequences, and the frequency of occurrence of subsets of the sequences (e.g., small stretches of repeats) within other non-identical sequences. The conditions generally refer to hybridization at either (1) 1\u00d7SSC (10\u00d7SSC=3 M NaCl, 0.3 M Na-citrate.2HO (88 g\/liter), pH to 7.0 with 1 M HCl), 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), 0.1-2 mg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65\u00b0 C.; (2) 1\u00d7SSC, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 0.1-2 mg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42\u00b0 C.; (3) 1% bovine serum albumen (fraction V), 1 mM Na.EDTA, 0.5 M NaHPO(pH 7.2) (1 M NaHPO=134 g NaHPO7HO, 4 ml 85% H.sub.3POper liter), 7% SDS, 0.1-2 mg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65\u00b0 C.; (4) 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, 0.02 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1\u00d7Denhardt's solution (100\u00d7=10 g Ficoll 400, 10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone, 10 g bovine serum albumin (fraction V), water to 500 ml), 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 0.1-2 mg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42\u00b0 C.; (5) 5\u00d7SSC, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 \u03bcg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65\u00b0 C.; or (6) 5\u00d7SSC, 5\u00d7Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 100 \u03bcg\/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42\u00b0 C., with high stringency washes of either (1) 0.3-0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C.; or (2) 1 mM NaEDTA, 40 mM NaHPO(pH 7.2), 1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. The above conditions are intended to be used for DNA-DNA hybrids of 50 base pairs or longer.

As used herein, a probe\/primer may include natural (i.e., A, G, C, or T) or modified on bases (7-deazaguanosine, inosine, etc.) or on sugar moiety. In addition, the bases in a probe\/primer may be joined by a linkage other than a phosphodiester bond, so long as it does not interfere with hybridization. Thus, for example, probes\/primers may be peptide nucleic acids in which the constituent bases are joined by peptide bonds rather than phosphodiester linkages. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that probes\/primers may bind target sequences lacking complete complementarity with the probe sequence depending upon the stringency of the hybridization conditions. The probes\/primers may be directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable label by methods known in the art. The primer is capable of initiating strand elongation. By assaying for the presence, absence, or the level of the probe binding or primer elongation product, one can detect the presence, absence, or the level of the target nucleic acid. Preferably, the probe\/primer of the present invention is between about 8 to 100 nucleotides in length, more preferably between about 12 to 50 nucleotides, more preferably between about 12 to 35 nucleotides in length.","As used herein, the term \u201cdetectable label\u201d refers to a composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. The detectable label can be selected, e.g., from a group consisting of radioisotopes, fluorescent compounds, enzymes, and enzyme co-factors.","The present invention also provides nucleic acids encoding an antibody of the invention (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof). In a specific embodiment, a nucleic acid of the invention encodes an antibody (including molecules comprising, or alternatively consisting of, antibody fragments or variants thereof), comprising, or alternatively consisting of, a Vdomain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the Vdomains of a heavy chain expressed by an anti-kinase protein antibody-expressing cell line of the invention (e.g., a hybridoma) and a Vdomain having an amino acid sequence of a light chain expressed by an anti-kinase protein antibody-expressing cell line of the invention.

Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding a molecule of the invention, including, for example, site-directed mutapolynucleotidesis and PCR-mediated mutapolynucleotidesis which result in amino acid substitutions. This can be used to prepare desired antibodies, e.g., humanized antibodies as described herein. Also preferably, the variants (including derivatives) encode less than 50 amino acid substitutions, less than 40 amino acid substitutions, less than 30 amino acid substitutions, less than 25 amino acid substitutions, less than 20 amino acid substitutions, less than 15 amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid substitutions, relative to the reference Vdomain, VCDR1, VCDR2, VCDR3, Vdomain, VCDR1, VCDR2, or VCDR3.","A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutapolynucleotidesis. The resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity.","Nucleic acids encoding epitopes can also be recombined with a second nucleic acid as an epitope tag (e.g., the hemagglutinin (\u201cHA\u201d) tag or flag tag) to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example, a system for the ready purification of non-denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines has been described by Janknecht et al., (1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:8972-897). In this system, the second nucleic acid is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the polynucleotide is translationally fused to an amino-terminal tag having six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto an Ni.sup.2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins are selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers.","If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known, a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin can be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or a cDNA library generated from, (or a nucleic acid, preferably poly A+ RNA, isolated from), any tissue or cells expressing the antibody, such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence. Alternatively, cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular nucleic acid sequence to be identified, e.g., a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the desired antibody can be employed. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR can then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.","Applications","The kinase peptides, nucleic acids encoding the kinase peptides, antibodies specifically immunoreactive with the kinase peptides, as well as nucleic acids of the present invention are useful for research and for disease detection, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.","As nonlimiting examples, antibodies of the present invention can be used to purify, detect, and target the protein tyrosine kinase polypeptides of the present invention, including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic, detection, screening, and\/or therapeutic methods. For example, the probes\/primers and antibodies can be used in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of kinase biomarkers in biological samples. (See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd Ed. 1988, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety).","Probes\/primers and antibodies of the invention can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying dysfunctions associated with mis-expression of a kinase protein containing the sequence of the kinase peptide of the invention, such as for detecting in a sample of cells isolated from a patient, a level of a kinase protein, a level of a nucleic acid encoding a kinase protein; e.g. measuring a kinase mRNA level in a cell, or determining whether a genomic kinase gene has been mutated or deleted. These probes\/primers of the invention can also be used as a part of \u201cantisense\u201d therapy which refers to administration or in situ generation of oligonucleotide probes or their derivatives which specifically hybridize (e.g. bind) under cellular conditions, with the cellular mRNA and\/or genomic DNA encoding one or more of the subject kinase proteins so as to inhibit expression of that protein, e.g. by inhibiting transcription and\/or translation. The antibodies of the invention can also be used for therapies as described below.","Diagnosis The kinases of the present invention may serve as biomarkers for (1) diagnosis of diseases (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disease (diabetes), inflammatory disease, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders), (2) prognosis of diseases (e.g., monitoring disease progression or regression from one biological state to another), (3) determination of susceptibility (risk) of a subject to diseases, or (4) evaluation of the efficacy of a treatment for a disease.","As used herein, a \u201cbiomarker\u201d is a molecule, the level of whose nucleic acid or protein product has a quantitatively differential concentration or level with respect to an aspect of a biological state in a subject. The level of the biomarker can be measured on both the nucleic acid level and the polypeptide level. At the nucleic acid level, a nucleic acid gene or a transcript which is transcribed from any part of the subject's chromosomal and extrachromosomal genome including for example the mitochondrial genome may be measured. Preferably an RNA transcript, more preferably an RNA transcript includes a primary transcript, a spliced transcript, an alternatively spliced transcript, or an mRNA of the biomarker is measured. At the polypeptide level, a prepropeptide, a propeptide, a mature peptide or a secreted peptide of the biomarker may be measured. A biomarker can be used either solely or in conjunction with one or more other identified biomarkers, so as to allow correlation to the biological state of interest as defined herein.","Specific biomarkers of the present invention include target kinases described above, e.g., in Tables 1-4. Preferably, the biomarkers are receptor kinases, e.g., RTKs, MAPKAP kinases, and PI3 kinases.","The term \u201cbiological state\u201d is used herein to mean the result of the occurrence of a series of biological processes. As the biological processes change relative to each other, the biological state also undergoes changes. One measurement of a biological state, is the level of activity of biologic variables such as biomarkers, parameters, and\/or processes at a specified time and under specified experimental or environmental conditions. A biological state can include, for example, the state of an individual cell, an organ, a tissue, and\/or a multi-cellular organism. A biological state can be measured in samples taken from a normal subject or a disease subject. Therefore, measuring the biological state at different time intervals may indicate the state of disease progression in a subject. The term \u201cbiological state\u201d thus include a state that is indicative of a disease (e.g., diagnosis) a state that is indicative of the progression or regression of a disease (prognosis), a state that is indicative of the susceptibility (risk) of a subject to a disease; and a state that is indicative of the efficacy of a treatment for a disease.","The term \u201cbiological state\u201d is also used herein to refer to clinical signs and diagnostic criteria associated with a disease state. The biological state of a disease state can be quantified with measurements of biological variables. For example, for the disease state of diabetes, the biological variables can include fasting plasma glucose, casual plasma glucose, or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) value.","In one embodiment the biological state can be mathematically defined by the values of x and p at a given time, as known in the art. Once a biological state of the model is mathematically specified, numerical integration of the above equation using a computer determines, for example, the time evolution of the biological variables x(t) and hence the evolution of the biological state over time.","The term \u201creference pattern of the disease state\u201d is used herein to mean a set of biological variables that are measured in a diseased biological system under specified experimental conditions. For example, the measurements may be performed on blood samples at some specified time following a particular glucose or insulin stimulus.","Alternatively, measurements may be performed on biopsy samples, or cell cultures derived from a diseased human or animal. Examples of diseased biological systems include cellular or animal models of the disease or a patient.","The term \u201cbaseline level,\u201d or a \u201ccontrol level\u201d of biomarker expression or activity refers to the level against which biomarker expression in the test sample can be compared. In some embodiments, the baseline level can be a \u201cnormal level\u201d (i.e., level in a sample from a normal subject). Therefore, it can be determined, based on the control or baseline level of biomarker expression or biological activity, whether a sample to be evaluated for disease cell growth has a measurable increase, decrease, or substantially no change in biomarker expression as compared to the baseline level. The term \u201cnegative control\u201d used in reference to a baseline level of biomarker expression typically refers to a baseline level established in a sample from the subject or from a population of individuals which is believed to be normal (i.e., non-tumorous, not undergoing neoplastic transformation, not exhibiting inappropriate cell growth). In another embodiment, a baseline can be indicative of a positive diagnosis of disease. Such a baseline level, also referred to herein as a \u201cpositive control\u201d baseline, refers to a level of biomarker expression or biological activity established in a sample from the subject, another subject, or a population of individuals, wherein the sample was believed, based on data for that cell sample, to have the disease (i.e., tumorous, exhibiting inappropriate cell growth, cancerous). In yet another embodiment, the baseline level can be established from a previous sample from the subject being tested, so that the disease progression or regression of a subject can be monitored over time and\/or so that the efficacy of a given therapeutic protocol can be evaluated over time.","Preferably, the method for establishing a baseline level of biomarker expression is selected based on the sample type, the tissue or organ from which the sample is obtained, the status of the subject to be evaluated, and, as discussed above, the focus or goal of the assay (e.g., diagnosis, staging, monitoring). Preferably, the method is the same method that will be used to evaluate the sample in the subject. In a most preferred embodiment, the baseline level is established using the same cell type as the cell to be evaluated.","In one embodiment, the baseline level of biomarker expression or biological activity is established in an autologous control sample obtained from the subject. The autologous control sample can be a sample of isolated cells, a tissue sample or a bodily fluid sample, and is preferably a cell sample or tissue sample. According to the present invention, and as used in the art, the term \u201cautologous\u201d means that the sample is obtained from the same subject from which the sample to be evaluated is obtained. The control sample should be of or from the same cell type and preferably, the control sample is obtained from the same organ, tissue or bodily fluid as the sample to be evaluated, such that the control sample serves as the best possible baseline for the sample to be evaluated. In one embodiment, when the goal of the assay is diagnosis of abnormal cell growth, it is desirable to take the control sample from a population of cells, a tissue or a bodily fluid which is believed to represent a \u201cnormal\u201d cell, tissue, or bodily fluid, or at a minimum, a cell or tissue which is least likely to be undergoing or potentially be predisposed to develop tumor cell growth. For example, if the sample to be evaluated is an area of apparently abnormal cell growth, such as a tumorous mass, the control sample is preferably obtained from a section of apparently normal tissue (i.e., an area other than and preferably a reasonable distance from the tumorous mass) in the tissue or organ where the tumorous mass is growing. In one aspect, if a tumor to be evaluated is in the colon, the test sample would be obtained from the suspected tumor mass and the control sample would be obtained from a different section of the colon, which is separate from the area where the mass is located and which does not show signs of uncontrolled cellular proliferation.","A difference in kinase expression level between a test sample and a baseline, either measured at the nucleic acid or the peptide level, is considered positive for the particular purpose of the test if the difference is at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably 80%, 90%, or even more preferably 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more.","As used herein, the terms \u201ccancer,\u201d \u201ctumor,\u201d \u201ccancerous,\u201d and \u201cmalignant\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

In some embodiments the inflammatory disease or condition is a \u201cchronic inflammatory disease or condition.\u201d A chronic inflammatory disease or condition is an inflammatory condition that does not resolve after a period of weeks, months or longer. Chronic inflammatory conditions can follow an acute inflammatory condition, or for some diseases or conditions can occur in the absence of an acute inflammatory disease or condition. An inflammatory disease or condition includes the following: autoimmune system diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus or SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis (and its specific forms such as Wegener's granulomatosis), scleroderma, myositis, serum sickness, transplant rejection, graft versus host disease, sickle cell anemia, gout, complications of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases such as hepatitis virus infection, including hepatitis A, B, C, and D, HIV infection, West Nile virus, Lyme disease, etc. Each of these diseases or conditions can also be described as chronic inflammatory diseases or conditions.","The term \u201cneurological disorder\u201d refers to a group of disorders in which one or more regions of a subject's brain operate at frequencies which are different from the predetermined frequency for that region of the brain or from the predetermined frequencies of the other regions of the subject's brain. Examples of neurological disorders include, but are not limited to, traumatic brain injury, post traumatic stress disorder, post stroke paralysis, post traumatic brain injury paralysis, cerebral palsy, headache, depression, post chemotherapy cognitive, mood and fatigue disorder, fibromyalgia, memory loss, coma, attention deficit disorder, etc.","As used herein, the term \u201cefficacy\u201d refers to either inhibition to some extent, of cell growth causing or contributing to a cell proliferative disorder, or the inhibition, to some extent, of the production of factors (e.g., growth factors) causing or contributing to a cell proliferative disorder. A \u201ctherapeutic efficacy\u201d refers to relief of one or more of the symptoms of a cell proliferative disorder.

(1995) Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). If appropriate, the target kinase can be identified as a cell surface molecule in tissue or in a bodily fluid, such as serum.","For example, methods of detecting nucleic acid of a kinase biomarker include but are not limited to, RNA fingerprinting, Northern blotting, polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction, Qbeta replicase, isothermal amplification method, strand displacement amplification, transcription based amplification systems, nuclease protection (SI nuclease or RNAse protection assays) as well as methods disclosed in WO88\/10315, WO89\/06700, PCT\/US87\/00880, PCT\/US89\/01025.","For example, detecting the expression level of a nucleic acid of a kinase biomarker may include (i) providing a probe\/primer of the invention; (ii) contacting the probe\/primer with a sample; and (iii) detecting, by hybridization of the probe\/primer to nucleic acids in the sample, the presence and absence or the level of a kinase biomarker nucleic acid. The method may also include amplifying the nucleic acid of the kinase biomarker before detecting. For instance, the probe\/primer can be employed in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in a ligation chain reaction (LCR). A difference in the level of expression between a test sample (e.g., from a patient subject) and a control sample (e.g., from a normal subject) is indicative of the biological state of interest. The probe\/primer used may also be a mixture of two or more probes\/primers as described above.","The nucleic acid detection method also includes detecting, in a sample of the subject, the presence or absence of a genetic lesion spanning a region represented by a nucleic acid encoding a kinase peptide of the invention.

In this method, the level of the biomarker is indicative of the presence of cancer cells. The presence of the biomarker at an increased level as compared to a normal baseline control is an indication of the presence of a cancer, a possible predisposition to such cancer or a susceptibility to an anti-cancer therapeutic treatment. The level of the biomarker can be determined by conventional methods such as expression assays to determine the level of expression of the gene (using the probes\/primers, or mixtures thereof provided by the invention), by biochemical assays to determine the level of the gene product, or by immunoassays. In one embodiment of this method, the level of the biomarker can be determined by identifying the biomarker as a cell surface molecule in tissue or by detecting the biomarker in soluble form in a bodily fluid, such as serum, that can be immobilized. The biomarker level can be determined by contacting a patient test sample with an antibody, or a fragment thereof, that binds specifically to the biomarker and determining whether the anti-biomarker antibody or fragment has bound to the biomarker. The biomarker level can be determined by using a first monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the biomarker and a second antibody that binds to the first antibody. This method can be used to determine the prognosis for cancer in the patient or to determine the susceptibility of the patient to a therapeutic treatment.","A further embodiment of the present invention is a method for the diagnosis of a tumor or the monitoring of a tumor growth or regression or a tumor therapy in a patient.

Such a tag can be any suitable tag which allows for detection of the reagents used to detect the biomarker or control marker and includes, but is not limited to, any composition or label detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means, as described herein and known in the art.","In addition, the means for detecting of the assay kit of the present invention can be immobilized on a substrate. Such a substrate can include any suitable substrate for immobilization of a detection reagent such as would be used in any of the previously described methods of detection. Briefly, a substrate suitable for immobilization of a means for detecting includes any solid support, such as any solid organic, biopolymer or inorganic support that can form a bond with the means for detecting without significantly effecting the activity and\/or ability of the detection means to detect the desired target molecule. Exemplary organic solid supports include polymers such as polystyrene, nylon, phenol-formaldehyde resins, acrylic copolymers (e.g., polyacrylamide), stabilized intact whole cells, and stabilized crude whole cell\/membrane homogenates.

The modulatory effect as described are useful for researches on signal transduction pathways, as well as disease treatment.","The invention provides an antisense nucleic acid that specifically hybridizes to a nucleic acid encoding a kinase of the present invention, wherein the antisense nucleic acid inhibits the expression of the kinase. The invention further provides a method of inhibiting the expression of a kinase of the present invention by contacting a sample in vitro, or in vivo, with an antisense nucleic acid of the present invention so that expression of the kinase is inhibited.","In another aspect, an antibody of the present invention may bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and\/or binding of a kinase of the invention to a ligand, thus modulate the activity of the kinase in signal transduction.","In one embodiment, an RTK-Mab, MAPKAP-K-Mab, or PI3 kinase-MAb, upon binding to the corresponding kinase located on a cell membrane, induces apoptosis in the cell expressing the corresponding kinase on its membrane. The MAb may also reduce the number of cells, or inhibits cell growth of cells that express corresponding kinase (kinase-expressing cells). Preferably, the reduction in cell number or inhibition of cell growth is by at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 65%, about 75%, or greater. Preferably, the kinase-expressing cells are disease cells, e.g., cancer or tumor cells.

More preferably, the cancers include but are not limited to, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and thyroid cancer.","Therefore, antibodies of the present invention can act as agonists or antagonists of the protein tyrosine kinase biomarker polypeptides of the present invention. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt receptor\/ligand interactions with polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. The invention also includes receptor-specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding, but do prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) can be determined by techniques described herein or as otherwise known in the art. For example, receptor activation can be determined by detecting the phosphorylation (e.g., on tyrosine or serine\/threonine) of the receptor or its substrate by immunoprecipitation followed by Western Blot analysis.","Accordingly, the method can be carried out with kinase therapeutics such as a monoclonal antibody, an antisense nucleic acid, or a kinase peptide of the invention which agonizes or antagonizes the effects of signaling from a kinase protein or ligand binding of a kinase protein. The antisense nucleic acid of the invention inhibits the expression of a target kinase gene, while the peptide or the antibody may competitively inhibit ligand interactions with the wild-type kinase protein.","The kinase peptides of the present invention can be introduced together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse). Alternatively, if the peptide is of sufficient length (e.g., at least about 15-25 amino acids), the polypeptide can be presented without a carrier.","In one embodiment, the composition for therapy is formulated for administration by intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intramuscular injections, and other forms of administration such as oral, mucosal, via inhalation, sublingually, etc.","The nucleic acids and antibodies of the present invention may be delivered with a carrier. As used herein, the term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which an active ingredient, e.g., a nucleic acid, peptide or antibody of the invention is administered. Such carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils. Water or aqueous solution, saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. As used herein, a \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s). A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier also refers to molecular entities and compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce untoward reactions when administered to a human. Preferably, as used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin, 20th Edition.","A nucleic acid encoding any of the antibodies of the present invention can also be used for delivery and expression of any of the antibodies of the present invention in a desired cell. It is apparent that an expression vector can be used to direct expression of an antibody. The expression vector can be administered by any means known in the art, such as intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally, intraventricularly, orally, enterally, parenterally, intranasally, dermally, sublingually, or by inhalation. For example, administration of expression vectors includes local or systemic administration, including injection, oral administration, particle gun or catheterized administration, and topical administration. One skilled in the art is familiar with administration of expression vectors to obtain expression of an exogenous protein in vivo. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,436,908; 6,413,942; and 6,376,471.","The therapeutic polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention can be delivered using gene delivery vehicles. The gene delivery vehicle can be of viral or non-viral origin (see generally, Jolly (1994), Cancer Gene Therapy 1:51; Kimura (1994), Human Gene Therapy 5:845; Connelly (1985) Human Gene Therapy 1:185; and Kaplitt (1994), Nature Genetics 6:148). Expression of such coding sequences can be induced using endogenous mammalian or heterologous promoters. Expression of the coding sequence can be either constitutive or regulated.","Viral-based vectors for delivery of a desired polynucleotide and expression in a desired cell are well known in the art. Exemplary viral-based vehicles include, but are not limited to, recombinant retroviruses, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO 90\/07936; WO 94\/03622; WO 93\/25698; WO 93\/25234; WO 93\/11230; WO 93\/10218; WO 91\/02805; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,219,740; 4,777,127; GB Patent No. 2,200,651; and EP Patent No. 0 345 242; alphavirus-based vectors, e.g., Sindbis virus vectors, Semliki forest virus (ATCC VR-67; ATCC VR-1247), Ross River virus (ATCC VR-373; ATCC VR-1246) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (ATCC VR-923; ATCC VR-1250; ATCC VR 1249; ATCC VR-532)), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, e.g., PCT Publication Nos.

Gene Ther. 3:147 can also be employed.","Non-viral delivery vehicles and methods can also be employed, including, but are not limited to, polycationic condensed DNA linked or unlinked to killed adenovirus alone (see, e.g., Curiel (1992), Hum. Gene Ther. 3:147); ligand-linked DNA (see, e.g., Wu (1989), J. Biol. Chem. 264:16985); eukaryotic cell delivery vehicles cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,482; PCT Publication Nos. WO 95\/07994; WO 96\/17072; WO 95\/30763; and WO 97\/42338) and nucleic charge neutralization or fusion with cell membranes.","Naked DNA can also be employed. Exemplary naked DNA introduction methods are described in PCT Publication No. WO 90\/11092 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,859. Liposomes that can act as gene delivery vehicles are described in U.S. Pat.

Biol. 14:2411 and in Woffendin (1994), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91:1581.","Other formulations include suitable delivery forms known in the art including, but not limited to, carriers such as liposomes. See, for example, Mahato et al. (1997) Pharm. Res. 14:853-859. Liposomal preparations include, but are not limited to, cytofectins, multilamellar vesicles and unilamellar vesicles.","In another embodiment, the present invention also contemplates administration of a composition comprising nucleic acids or antibodies of the present invention conjugated to other molecules, such as detectable labels, or therapeutic or cytotoxic agents. The agents may include, but are not limited to radioisotopes, toxins, toxoids, inflammatory agents, enzymes, antisense molecules, peptides, cytokines, or chemotherapeutic agents. Methods of conjugating the antibodies with such molecules are generally known to those of skilled in the art. See, e.g., PCT publications WO 92\/08495; WO 91\/14438; WO 89\/12624; U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,995; and EP 396,387; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The dosage required for the treatment depends on the choice of the route of administration, the nature of the formulation, the nature of the subject's illness, the subject's size, weight, surface area, age and sex; other drugs being administered, and the judgment of the attending physician. Suitable dosages are in the range of 0.01-1000.0 mg\/kg.","The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.","Such techniques are explained fully in the literature and herein above.

Forty (40) rabbits were used. Each rabbit was injected with a mixture of three panRTK epitopes, either combination #1 (YVHHRDLAAARNIL (SEQ ID NO. 1), CIHRRDLAARNNVL (SEQ ID NO. 2) and FVHRDLAAARNNCM (SEQ ID NO. 3) combination #1 is referred to as (\u201cpan-TK1\u201d)) or combination #2 (LVHRDDLLAARNVL (SEQ ID NO. 4) FIHHRDIAAARNCL (SEQ ID NO. 5), and FVHRDDLATRNCCL (SEQ ID No. 6) combination #2 is referred to as (\u201cpan-TK2\u201d)). The rabbits were bled, and the panRTK antisera were then affinity purified using the same combinations of epitopes against which they had been raised.","The purified pan-TK1 and pan-TK2 antisera were screened against the peptides used to raise the antibodies using ELISA and Western Blot assays.","The results of the ELISA assays for the pan-TK1 antisera are described below. ELISA assays were performed using the following BSA-conjugated peptides (one assay per
