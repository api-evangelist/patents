The leukotrienes constitute a group of locally acting hormones, produced in living systems from arachidonic acid. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived by enzymatic oxygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO).","The major leukotrienes are Leukotriene B(abbreviated as LTB), LTC, LTDand LTE. The biosynthesis of these leukotrienes begins with the action of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenases on arachidonic acid to produce the epoxide known as Leukotriene A(LTA), which is converted to the other leukotrienes by subsequent enzymatic steps. Further details of the biosynthesis as well as the metabolism of the leukotrienes are to be found in the book Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases, ed. J. Rokach, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1989). The actions of the leukotrienes in living systems and their contribution to various diseases states are also discussed in the book by Rokach.","In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton (ZYFLO\u00ae) which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul. 26, 91(2):120-126.","Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of conditions affected by 5-LO inhibition, further treatment options are needed. The instant invention addresses that need by providing novel 5-LO inhibitors which are useful for inhibiting leukotriene biosynthesis.","The instant invention relates to compounds of Formula I which are leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, methods for their preparation, and methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals, especially humans.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0008"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"18.03mm","wi":"57.66mm","file":"US07960409-20110614-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The compounds of Formula I are useful as pharmaceutical agents to slow or halt atherogenesis.

PEF <180 l\/min, increased SABA (short-acting beta-agonist) use >70% from baseline (minimum increase 2 puffs), or increased symptom score of >50%, (9) reduce the number of asthma attacks (measured as % of days with at least one attack over a specified period of total days), wherein the attack is one that requires systemic steroid use, an emergency room visit, hospitalization, or an unscheduled asthma related doctor visit, (10) reduce the number of acute asthma attacks, (11) reduce blood and sputum eosinophils, and\/or (12) prevent and treat EIB (exercised induced bronchoconstriction).","Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be administered to patients, including adult and pediatric patients, for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.","Thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian (especially, human) disease states such as erosive gastritis; erosive esophagitis; diarrhea; cerebral spasm; premature labor; spontaneous abortion; dysmenorrhea; ischemia; noxious agent-induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue; liver parenchymal damage caused by hepatoxic agents such as CCland D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage; trauma- or stress-induced cell damage; and glycerol-induced renal failure. Leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action.","The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684. In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor such as rofecoxib (VIOXX\u00ae), etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122), and celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae) and low-dose aspirin.","In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB, and treatment with the instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD and reduce the rate of COPD exacerbations. In particular, the compounds of this invention could be used for daily, preferably once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction associated with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.","The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for diseases and medical conditions affected by inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. A therapeutically effective amount or prophylactically effective amount, as appropriate, of a compound of Formula I is intended for use in the methods and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention.","The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of this invention will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. It is understood that a specific daily dosage amount can simultaneously be both a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., for treatment to slow progression of existing atherosclerosis, and a prophylactically effective amount, e.g., for prevention of an atherosclerotic disease event or formation of new lesions. In general, the daily dose range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic or anti-atherosclerotic use and generally, uses other than cytoprotection, lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.","In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable daily dosage range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic or anti-atherosclerotic use is, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day, and preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg per kg. For cytoprotective use a suitable daily dosage range is from 0.1 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, and more preferably from about 10 mg to about 100 mg, of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day.","For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable daily dosage range for anti-asthmatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic or anti-allergic use is from about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.01 mg to about 1 mg) of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day and for cytoprotective use from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg (preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg) of a compound of this invention per kg of body weight per day. For the treatment of diseases of the eye, ophthalmic preparations for ocular administration comprising 0.001-1% by weight solutions or suspensions of the compounds of this invention in an acceptable ophthalmic formulation may be used.","The exact amount of a compound of this invention to be used as a cytoprotective agent will depend on, inter alia, whether it is being administered to heal damaged cells or to avoid future damage, on the nature of the damaged cells (e.g., gastrointestinal ulcerations vs. nephrotic necrosis), and on the nature of the causative agent. An example of the use of a compound of this invention in avoiding future damage would be co-administration of a compound of this invention with an NSAID that might otherwise cause such damage (for example, indomethacin). For such use, the compound of this invention is administered from 30 minutes prior up to 30 minutes after administration of the NSAID. Preferably it is administered prior to or simultaneously with the NSAID, (for example, in a combination dosage form).","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of this invention as an active ingredient and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. For use in treating or preventing atherosclerosis and related disease events, oral formulation is preferred.","The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.","For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or nebulisers. The compounds may also be delivered as powders which may be formulated and the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of an insufflation powder inhaler device. The preferred delivery system for inhalation is a metered dose inhalation (MDI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a suspension or solution of a compound of this invention in suitable propellants, such as fluorocarbons or hydrocarbons.","Suitable topical formulations of a compound of this invention include transdermal devices, aerosols, creams, ointments, lotions, dusting powders, and the like.","In practical use, the compounds of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of this invention may also be administered by controlled release means and\/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 3,630,200; 4,008,719; and 5,366,738 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet, cachet or capsule contains from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, for example but not limited to 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg.

comprising combining a compound of this invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also encompassed is the pharmaceutical composition which is made by combining a compound of this invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for treating or preventing any of the medical conditions described herein, in dosage amounts described herein. For example, a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerotic disease, halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically manifest, and preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event. Additionally, a compound of this invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament useful for the treatment of asthma, allergies and allergic conditions, inflammation, COPD or erosive gastritis. The medicament comprised of a compound of this invention may also be prepared with one or more additional active agents, such as those described below.","One or more additional active agents may be used in combination with the compounds of this invention in a single dosage formulation, or the active agents of the combination may be administered to the patient in separate dosage formulations, which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. Unless otherwise specified, reference herein to compounds of this invention being used in combination with other active agents or used as part of combination therapy or the like encompasses both a single pharmaceutical composition comprised of a compound of this invention with one or more additional active agents, as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprised of a compound of this invention administered as part of a combination therapy with one or more other separately formulated active agents.","In addition to the compounds of this invention, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also contain other active agents (i.e., ingredients) and the pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a compound of this invention may be used for combination therapy with one or more other separately formulated active agents, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), peripheral analgesic agents such as zomepirac diflunisal and the like. The weight ratio of the compound of this invention to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of this invention is combined with an NSAID the weight ratio of the compound of said compound to the NSAID will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of this invention and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.","NSAIDs can be characterized into five groups: (1) propionic acid derivatives; (2) acetic acid derivatives; (3) fenamic acid derivatives; (4) oxicams; and (5) biphenylcarboxylic acid derivatives; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","The propionic acid derivatives which may be used comprise: alminoprofen, benoxaprofen, bucloxic acid, carprofen, fenbufen, fenoprofen, fluprofen, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, indoprofen, ketoprofen, miroprofen, naproxen, oxaprozin, pirprofen, prano-profen, suprofen, tiaprofenic acid, and tioxaprofen.

Human 5-lipoxygenase was purified from Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus rvH5LO (8-1) containing the coding sequence for human 5-lipoxygenase as described by Percival et al., (Eur. J. Biochem 210, 109-117, 1992).

(Biochem. Pharmacol. 38, 2313-2321, 1989) with minor modifications. The incubation mixture contained 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM CaCl, 24 \u03bcg\/ml phosphatidylcholine, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 20 \u03bcM arachidonic acid (2 \u03bcl from a 100-fold solution in ethanol), inhibitor (2 \u03bcl aliquot from a 100-fold solution in DMSO) and an aliquot of purified 5-lipoxygenase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the purified 5-lipoxygenase and the rate of conjugated diene production was followed for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was performed in a Costar UV plate (Cat. # 3635) and the absorbance changes at 238 nm were recorded with a Molecular Devices UV\/VIS 96 well spectrophotometer (Spectra Max 190) using SOFTmax PRO software. Enzymatic activity was calculated from the optimal rate of the reaction by a linear fit of the increase in absorbance at 238 nm over 36 seconds. When the rate of diene formation is low (<0.01 Absorbance Unit\/min) the linear fit is performed over 180 seconds. The results are expressed as percentage of inhibition of the reaction rate relative to controls (typically between 0.001-0.005 Absorbance Unit\/min) containing the DMSO vehicle.","Fresh blood is collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from volunteers with consent. The subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 4 days prior to blood collection. 250 \u03bcl aliquots of blood are pre-incubated with either 0.5 \u03bcl of vehicle (DMSO) or test compound at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. This is followed by incubation of the blood with 5 \u03bcl of either plasma or a 1.25 mM solution of the calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma, St Louis, Mo., USA) in plasma. The latter solution is prepared by centrifuging approximately 10 mls of blood from each donor and collecting the plasma. A 50 mM stock solution of A23187 in DMSO is diluted 40-fold in plasma to yield a 1.25 mM working solution. Five \u03bcls of this working solution is added to each appropriate 250 \u03bcl-aliquot of blood of the same donor from which the plasma was prepared to give a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM of A23187. The blood is then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the blood is centrifuged at 1500 g at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. Plasma is then collected from all samples and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until time of enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA).
