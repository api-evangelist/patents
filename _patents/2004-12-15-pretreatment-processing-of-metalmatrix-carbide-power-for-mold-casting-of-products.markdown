title: Pretreatment processing of metal-matrix carbide power for mold casting of products
abstract: A metal-matrix material in the form of a carbide powder together with a sodium fluoride flux is deposited as a charge within a crucible for induction heating thereof to a flux melting temperature to thereby initiate pretreatment. The molten flux is spread over and covers powder particles of the metal-matrix carbide throughout, in response to stirring by rotation of an agitator during said flux melt heating within the crucible. The charge may be covered within the crucible by an air-purging blanket of argon gas during said heating. The powder fluxed charge is then cooled within the crucible before removal therefrom and sealingly packaged within aluminum soda cans or foil wrappings for future use storage. Such packaged charges are transferred from storage and introduced into a casting mold for enhanced centrifugal cast molding of metallurgical products, such as a metallic ring having an outer carbide bronze surface.

Nos. 6,129,134 and 6,129,135 to Divecha. Such casting processes are performed within a crucible having an injection feeding mechanism positioned on top thereof through which a carbide powder is ball milled and injected into a melting chamber of the crucible within which the carbide powder mixed together with argon gas is melted and transferred to a product casting mold. It is an important object of the present invention to provide for enhanced mold casting of metallic products and significantly reduce complexity and costs associated therewith.","Pursuant to the present invention, a carbide powder mixture with flux is deposited without injection into a melting chamber of an inductive heating crucible to undergo pretreatment by initial heating thereof to a flux melt temperature under a blanket of air-purging argon gas injected before undergoing flux melting and mixture stirring for powder covering flux distribution. After such heating and stirring of the powder mixture to establish its molten fluxed condition, it is ground to remove any powder clumps before cooling. The fluxed powder is then withdrawn from the crucible and sealingly packaged within aluminum soda cans or aluminum foil wrappings for future use storage. The fluxed powder packages are withdrawn from storage for introduction into casting molds for enhanced centrifugal casting of metallurgical product such as a ring having an outer carbide surface.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  diagrams a process  for pretreatment of a charge  formed by a mixture of metal-matrix material and flux deposited together directly into an open upper end of an induction heating furnace crucible  as shown in . The pretreatment process  is completed when a resulting fluxed carbide powder is removed from the crucible  to undergo packaging  before transfer to future use storage . A packaged portion of the pretreated metal-matrix mixture from the storage  for future use is utilized in a mold casting process  to advantageously produce a centrifugally cast metallic ring product  as shown in .","With continued reference to , the pretreatment process  initiated within the crucible  undergoes heating by heat application  so as to raise the temperature therein above the flux melting point, such as 750\u00b0 C. to 800\u00b0 C., for a quantity of flux that is 7.5% of the content of the charge  which is a tungsten type of carbide powder according to one embodiment. A blanket of the air-purging argon gas  is applied inside of the crucible , as the heat is applied, to enhance the process . Stirring  of the heated mixture within the crucible  is then performed so as to spread the molten flux over the particles of the carbide powder charge . After cooling within the crucible , the fluxed powder charge  undergoes grinding  to some small extent for removal of powder clumps therefrom before transfer of the charge  from the crucible  to perform the packaging .","According to one embodiment, the packaging  of the fluxed powder involves placement of a 1700 gram amount thereof into a standard aluminum soda can, weighing less than 15 grams when empty. When filled, each of such soda cans is hermetically sealed by standard processing equipment before being placed in said storage . An appropriate number of the filled and sealed cans may be withdrawn from the storage  to undergo the mold casting process  at the proper time, with an insignificant affect on the product  thereby produced.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, 300 gram portions of the fluxed carbide powder charge  undergoes the packaging  by being wrapped as a packet in a piece of commercial aluminum foil, weighing about 10 grams. Such packet of the fluxed carbide powder undergoes the mold casting process  by being is introduced as a bronze melt under a melt temperature of approximately 50\u00b0 C. for example. The melt temperature is then raised to 1250\u00b0 C., during a dwell time of about 2 minutes, to complete the melt casting process , producing the product  in the form of a 4 inch diameter ring as shown in , having an outer continuous surface  of carbide bronze.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["14","32","12","10","13","33","32","34","14","13","24","36","32","14","26","38","32","40","33"]},"The pretreatment process  as hereinbefore described may be utilized with compatible carbides other than the tungsten aforementioned, such as titanium, with appropriate meltable fluxes associated therewith.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
