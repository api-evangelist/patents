For example, a mobile operator can offer zero rating, where all the charges for a particular user go onto the bill of an enterprise account. Plus, a mobile operator can provide special offers, where a user for example receives a special offer for a certain number of megabytes of data free, after which they must pay. However, if the mobile operator wanted to bill a user for their consumption of both mobile broadband services and virtualized cloud resources (computing, storage, network, as well as application usage) then the mobile operator would have to custom build a cloud operating system and connect their custom-built cloud operating system to their mobile broadband charging system. Although this particular process to bill the user would work it is still desirable to improve how a mobile operator can bill the user for their consumption of mobile broadband services and virtualized cloud resources.","A system, a device and various methods which improve how a mobile operator can bill a user for their consumption of mobile broadband services and virtualized cloud resources are described in the independent claims of the present application. Advantageous embodiments of the system, the device, and the various method have been described in the dependent claims of the present application.","In one aspect, the present invention comprises a system configured for billing a user for their consumption of mobile broadband services and virtualized cloud resources.

Service (PaaS) resources \u2032 consumed by the user  (steps 2a, 2b and 2c). Some exemplary PaaS resources \u2032 are as follows: (1) database storage and access; (2) hadoop big data analysis; (3) service catalog listing; and (4) service health monitoring.","The third virtualized resource usage metering module is configured to interact with the networked servers and and storage devices and and collect virtual resource usage data comprising virtualized Software as a Service (SaaS) resources \u2032 consumed by the user  (steps 2a, 2b and 2c). Some exemplary SaaS resources \u2032 are as follows: (1) unified communication (enterprise VOIP) and other communication applications like virtual Enhanced Packet Core (mobile core for LTE); (2) TV over the Internet (e.g., Netflix); and (3) products such as salesforce.com like B2B marketing automation, HR management, and business data analysis. The virtualized resource usage metering modules , , can also function as the aforementioned storage device(s) . It should be appreciated that the OpenStack cloud operating system  which performs the aforementioned steps 2a, 2b and 2c has other components and functionalities but for clarity those other components and functionalities have not been described herein.","The virtualized resource usage metering modules , , are shown connected to the mobile broadband charging system  via the specially configured device's data center charging adaptation module  and the usage reporting interface  (e.g., usage reporting REST API ). In operation, the data center charging adaptation module  periodically queries (step 3a) the virtualized resource usage metering modules , , for virtual resource usage metering data  of the user , receives the metered data  (step 3b), and converts the received metered data  into format that can be handled by the mobile broadband charging system  (step 3c). The data center charging adaptation module  calls the usage reporting REST API  to forward the converted metered data  to the mobile broadband charging system  (step 3d) (note: the data center charging adaptation module  can also perform the aforementioned step 3e). The mobile broadband charging system  rates the received metered data  and records the charges  in the charging database  for later billing (step 1d). In addition, the mobile broadband charging system  would perform the aforementioned steps 1a, 1b and 1c. The user  or mobile operator can obtain real time charging information  through the GUI . In operation, the GUI  sends the billing request  to the query REST API  to obtain billing information  for the user  indicating the mobile broadband service charges  and\/or the virtual resource charges  (see aforementioned steps 4a, 4b and 4c).","The following is a detailed discussion about an exemplary usage reporting REST API , an exemplary query REST API , an exemplary billing request , and an exemplary billing information .","Charging System REST APIs","The mobile broadband charging system  would typically use the Diameter protocol (see RFC 3588) for registering charges and querying for real time reporting on charges incurred by the user .
