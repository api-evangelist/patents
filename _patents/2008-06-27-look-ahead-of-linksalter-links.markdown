For ease of understanding, the flowcharts are organized such that the initial flowcharts present implementations via an example implementation and thereafter the following flowcharts present alternate implementations and\/or expansions of the initial flowchart(s) as either sub-component operations or additional component operations building on one or more earlier-presented flowcharts. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that the style of presentation utilized herein (e.g., beginning with a presentation of a flowchart(s) presenting an example implementation and thereafter providing additions to and\/or further details in subsequent flowcharts) generally allows for a rapid and easy understanding of the various process implementations. In addition, those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the style of presentation used herein also lends itself well to modular and\/or object-oriented program design paradigms.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that the state of the art has progressed to the point where there is little distinction left between hardware, software, and\/or firmware implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware, software, and\/or firmware is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software can become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that there are various vehicles by which processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies described herein can be effected (e.g., hardware, software, and\/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and\/or systems and\/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and\/or firmware vehicle; alternatively, if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and\/or firmware. Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and\/or devices and\/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware.","In some implementations described herein, logic and similar implementations may include software or other control structures suitable to operation. Electronic circuitry, for example, may manifest one or more paths of electrical current constructed and arranged to implement various logic functions as described herein. In some implementations, one or more media are configured to bear a device-detectable implementation if such media hold or transmit a special-purpose device instruction set operable to perform as described herein. In some variants, for example, this may manifest as an update or other modification of existing software or firmware, or of gate arrays or other programmable hardware, such as by performing a reception of or a transmission of one or more instructions in relation to one or more operations described herein. Alternatively or additionally, in some variants, an implementation may include special-purpose hardware, software, firmware components, and\/or general-purpose components executing or otherwise invoking special-purpose components. Specifications or other implementations may be transmitted by one or more instances of tangible transmission media as described herein, optionally by packet transmission or otherwise by passing through distributed media at various times.","Alternatively or additionally, implementations may include executing a special-purpose instruction sequence or otherwise invoking circuitry for enabling, triggering, coordinating, requesting, or otherwise causing one or more occurrences of any functional operations described above. In some variants, operational or other logical descriptions herein may be expressed directly as source code and compiled or otherwise invoked as an executable instruction sequence. In some contexts, for example, C++ or other code sequences can be compiled directly or otherwise implemented in high-level descriptor languages (e.g., a logic-synthesizable language, a hardware description language, a hardware design simulation, and\/or other such similar mode(s) of expression). Alternatively or additionally, some or all of the logical expression may be manifested as a Verilog-type hardware description or other circuitry model before physical implementation in hardware, especially for basic operations or timing-critical applications. Those skilled in the art will recognize how to obtain, configure, and optimize suitable transmission or computational elements, material supplies, actuators, or other common structures in light of these teachings.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link (e.g., transmitter, receiver, transmission logic, reception logic, etc.), etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, and\/or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of memory (e.g., random access, flash, read only, etc.)), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, optical-electrical equipment, etc.). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, memory such as volatile or non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors or digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices (e.g., a touch pad, a touch screen, an antenna, etc.), and\/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and\/or velocity; control motors for moving and\/or adjusting components and\/or quantities). A data processing system may be implemented utilizing suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing\/communication and\/or network computing\/communication systems.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components, and\/or wirelessly interactable, and\/or wirelessly interacting components, and\/or logically interacting, and\/or logically interactable components.","In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as \u201cconfigured to,\u201d \u201cconfigurable to,\u201d \u201coperable\/operative to,\u201d \u201cadapted\/adaptable,\u201d \u201cable to,\u201d \u201cconformable\/conformed to,\u201d etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that \u201cconfigured to\u201d can generally encompass active-state components and\/or inactive-state components and\/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be typically understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d","With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order. Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently. Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise. Furthermore, terms like \u201cresponsive to,\u201d \u201crelated to,\u201d or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1D","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 28","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 30","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 32","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
