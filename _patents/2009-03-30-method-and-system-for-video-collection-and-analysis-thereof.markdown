{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/040,468 filed Mar. 28, 2008, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND SYSTEM FOR VIDEO COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS THEREOF,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.","The present invention relates to a method and system for collecting and analyzing data feeds from various sources.","There are various fields, such as video surveillance, where multiple streams of data, from various sources, may be collected and analyzed. For example, signals from one or more video cameras and\/or other monitoring sensors may be collected and simultaneously sent to a control station to be displayed on one or more display monitors. In addition to being displayed, the visual streams may also be recorded and stored.","In a control station, for example the monitors displaying the visual information from the video cameras, may be viewed and analyzed by a human operator. The human operator may be, for example, a security officer, who will be scrutinizing the displays for suspicious activity. This analysis may be performed on the live feeds coming in from the cameras, or it may be performed on earlier, stored signals.","In the past, the analysis process of this visual information may become quite daunting, especially when surveillance is performed with many cameras and\/or on a large area. Since a human operator has all limitations native to humans, he or she may miss certain events that are displayed on the monitors. It is therefore advantageous, to provide a system that can assist human operators analyzing large amounts of visual data that solves the deficiency of the prior art systems.","In order to overcome the above deficiencies in the prior art, a system is needed to provide rich camera management that enables sophisticated recording and archiving of video and automated video alerts based on intelligent analysis and detection. A system is needed which allows users monitoring multiple video and other monitoring sources to easily access and interpret such information and data in a manner that allows greater flexibility and enhanced functionality.","In one embodiment there is disclosed a computer implemented method of performing video surveillance on a computer system, wherein the computer system comprises a video and a display with a graphical user interface, the graphical user interface including a source window to view play back of the video. The surveillance method comprises the steps of determining an area of interest of a frame of the video based upon a selection of the area of interest within the source window, and the step of generating a plurality of windows within the graphical user interface, each of the windows displaying the area of interest of the frame of the video at a point in time, wherein the graphical user interface includes controls to manipulate the playback of the video from a point in time relative to each displayed portion.","In another embodiment, there is disclosed a computer implemented method of detecting activity within a video on a computer system, wherein the computer system includes a video and a display with a graphical user interface. The surveillance method comprises the steps of acquiring a reference frame from the video, acquiring a comparison frame, comparing the pixels of the reference frame to the pixels of the comparison frame to detect pixels that have changed, showing at least a portion of the video on the graphical user interface, showing the change in pixels on the graphical user interface by coloring the changed pixels with a pre-defined color, and gradually altering the different color to reveal the actual color of the changed pixels.","In another embodiment, there is disclosed a computer implemented method of performing video surveillance on a computer system, wherein the computer system comprises a video and a display with a graphical user interface, the graphical user interface including a map designating a location of at least one monitoring sensor and a source window to view play back of a video. The surveillance method comprises the steps of displaying a video being detected by a monitoring sensor and displaying a section of the map representing the location of the monitoring sensor detecting the video.","Certain embodiments of the present invention will be discussed with reference to the aforementioned figures, wherein like referenced numerals will refer to like components. It should be noted that references in the specification to phrases such as \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances or phrases such as \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily, but can be, referring to same embodiment. The embodiments illustrate a system that integrates intelligent analytics and enables sending camera views to local or remote displays over the network. The embodiments further illustrate a system that greatly enhances productivity by facilitating and expediting video review and analysis by a human user.","Generally speaking, in one embodiment of the invention a monitoring system assists users in monitoring events, and includes a scalable computer system, operative with programming and related databases, the computer system connected to one or more monitoring sensors such as, for example, video cameras, network video recorders, scanners, keycard sensors, infra-red cameras, microphones, access control systems, pressure monitoring systems, or other similar devices. The system allows operators to quickly monitor a large number of cameras and auxiliary monitoring sensors in an efficient and expeditious manner.","In one embodiment a monitoring system comprises a plurality of various monitoring sensors deployed throughout an area that is subject to observation. The monitoring system preferably receives information from these monitoring sensors or monitoring devices and presents the information to the users in a structured way that allows the users to better monitor the situation.","For example, the monitoring system may provide a user of the system with a visual interface showing locations of various monitoring sensors overlaid over a schematic representation (such as a map) of an area being monitored. Thus, a user may, for example, select to view a stream of video information from a specific camera based upon its location in the area being monitored instead of having to keep a mental map of the various locations of the monitoring sensors. This may allow the user to find the location of a specific event or follow the movement of a subject of observation from the field of view of one monitoring sensor to the field of view of another monitoring sensor, faster and more efficiently than would be otherwise possible.","In various embodiments of the monitoring system, the system may merge various types of data, received from various monitoring sensors, in order to present the user with an optimal overview of a situation. Since various monitoring sensors provide various types of data, for example video cameras provide video streams, microphones provide audio data, access control systems provide events such as notifications of incorrect pass key entries, or other types of data, it is useful to have this information merged together in a manner that allows a user to extract the necessary information in an expedient manner. For example, a user viewing a stream of video information received from a video camera, may also receive information from a keypad monitoring sensor that is located in the video camera's field of view. This will allow the user to visually monitor the video feed data and monitor the data from the keypad monitoring sensor simultaneously. In certain embodiments the monitoring system may also analyze streams received from various monitoring sensors and embed metadata into those streams. As described in further detail below, information added to metadata may be anything relevant, for example a description of events being observed by the monitoring sensor, type of monitoring sensor performing the observation, time and date of observation, environmental properties at time of observation (e.g., temperature), or other related data.","In various embodiments of the monitoring system, the information received from various monitoring sensors may be analyzed by the system, in order to provide the users of the system with alerts to facilitate effective surveillance. For example, certain events or sequences of events may trigger corresponding alerts. If, for example, there is a loud sound in the vicinity of a particular camera that is sensed by, for example, a microphone, an alert may be sent to a user and a window displaying the stream of video information from that camera can be displayed to the user. Alerts and events can be configured to occur as a result of any event or sequence of events. Various alerts and events are described in further detail below.","In various embodiments of the monitoring system, the information received from various monitoring sensors may be analyzed by the system, and enhancements may be added to the information. For example, a video stream received from a video camera may be analyzed for motion, and where motion is detected the images may be altered or enhanced, by, for example, adding a red hue over the moving object. While any type of analysis and enhancement may be employed, certain types of analysis are described in further detail below.","In various embodiments, the monitoring system can provide users with additional functionality to assist them with reviewing streams of video information. By way of non-limiting example, monitoring system may allow users to analyze the stream of video information as a time line, by providing a user with a control that allows the users to select and view specific time spans from the stream of video information, and to bookmark those time spans. These bookmarks may contain additional information, such as, for example, information related to why the bookmark was placed, who should review the bookmark, or any other relevant information.","As described in further detail below with reference to , monitoring system  can allow users to focus on specific areas of streams of video information by giving users the ability to pan to, tilt to, or zoom in on, a certain area of a video stream. The system can also include the functionality that permits users to simultaneously view multiple videos of differing resolution sizes, from various points in time, of the area the user focused on. It should be noted that the multiple videos can be thumbnail sized or can be configured to be any size depending on the vision of the user, and the resolution, size, and number of monitors displaying the multiple videos.","Although the methods and systems are referenced primarily in the context of surveillance and video cameras, it will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention and its various embodiments could be applied to any situation where monitoring of streams of information is useful. Moreover, it will be understood that the methods and systems described herein are not limited to any particular type of monitoring device.","With reference to , there is shown and described an overview of an embodiment of a monitoring system . As will be described in further detail below, the system preferably includes system modules  (described in detail with reference to ) that enable functionality of the monitoring system , hardware control modules  (described in detail with reference to ) that preferably enable the system modules  to communicate with the hardware components  of monitoring system , and hardware components  (described in detail with reference to ) which allow the system to operate and interact with users.","Because different systems and hardware components frequently have different syntaxes for information streams and the accompanying streams of metadata related to those information streams, a proxy module  may be included in certain embodiments of monitoring system , to perform the function of an interpreter thereby, for example, allowing third party hardware, such as cameras, to be communicatively connected to the system. By way of non-limiting example, proxy module  may be used to convert the metadata specific to a hardware or software component that sends or creates the metadata to a syntax neutral format.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of a monitoring system  including monitoring computers ,  mapping stations , , monitors , databases (which may be part of monitoring computers , , mapping stations , , or separate), various monitoring sensors , and programming for providing functionality to one or more users. The components of monitoring system  are preferably in communication with one another by being communicatively interconnected via a network  which may be an internal network, such as a local area network or LAN, or an external network such as the internet, extranet, wide area network, metropolitan area network, or any other network. A monitoring sensor  can be connected directly to the network  or a monitoring sensor  can be connected to a video source , which can store the video information stream from the monitoring sensor  as it sends the video information stream to the network .","In various prior art monitoring systems, the various components would be connected to hardware switching mechanisms that would include devices such as video matrix switches, quads, multiplexers, splitters, or other costly and robust hardware devices. The use of these hardware switches necessitated large expenditures on purchase and maintenance of those switches. Additionally, expansion of the hardware switching mechanisms and interconnection of various premises housing hardware switching mechanisms is difficult, space consuming, costly, and limited. Further, the hardware switches would typically hinder the functioning of the prior art monitoring systems since signals sent by the users would be delayed by having to go through the hardware switching mechanism before reaching their destination. Furthermore, the use of hardware switching mechanisms in surveillance systems necessitated long training for operators and, in certain instances, the operators needed to memorize details about the hardware components in order to access them.","The use of communication over a network  using a protocol such as Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP\u201d) removes the need for the hardware switching mechanism and expedites the functioning of the system. Use of Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) instead of hardware switching, among other benefits, confers advantages such as broad use of numerous devices all of which are compatible with the monitoring system , no vendor lock-in since IP switches can be obtained from a number of independent vendors; transmission error resiliency since TCP allows reliable transmission of data through noisy environments; zero transmission loss since unlike analog copper based transmission that degrades based upon transmission distance, information can be sent using IP with no loss regardless of the distance; and ease in set up and management as compared to the hardware switching mechanisms.","Monitoring computers ,  and mapping stations ,  may be any type of computer processor, for example, they may be personal computer systems running any type of operating system such as, for example, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. Monitoring computers ,  preferably include networking capabilities. Monitoring computers ,  may be configured for optimal use in monitoring applications and thus may include keyboards, touch-pads, joysticks, microphones, speakers, printers and\/or any number of additional components and peripherals. In certain embodiments, the mapping stations ,  can include some or all of the functionality of monitoring computers , , and may even replace monitoring computers , .","The monitoring computers ,  are preferably connected to at least one monitor , though multiple monitors  may be utilized, The monitors may be displays of any type including but not limited to LCD, projection, CORT, and any other type of display.","In use, the stream of information is sent by the monitoring sensor  (which may be a video camera or any other monitoring sensor as described above), via network , to the mapping stations , . Mapping stations , , as described in further detail below, are preferably used to analyze the stream and\/or send the stream of information to a selected monitoring computer ,  where the stream of information may be viewed and\/or analyzed by the users of monitoring computer ,  on their respective monitors . It should be noted that the mapping stations ,  can be configured to send the stream of information to every monitoring computer , , or select monitoring computers ,  in response to input from users of mapping stations , , according to an algorithm, or a combination of both.","With reference to , there is shown and described a diagram of various system modules  of an exemplary embodiment of the monitoring system . The monitoring system  is just exemplary and should not be interpreted as limiting the methods and systems, described herein, in any manner. Some of the modules of the monitoring system  are software modules, while others are hardware components, as described in further detail below. The system modules shown in  are software modules that can be running on any number of computers or other hardware elements of monitoring system  (e.g. monitoring computers , ; mapping stations , ).","As shown in , the software live video review module  represents a module that preferably controls monitoring sensors  and receives streams of monitoring information from those monitoring sensors  and passes these streams to software mapping module , software event coordination module , and software video review module . In various embodiments the live video review module  may receive instructions and\/or data from mapping module , event coordination module , and video review module . By way of non-limiting example, the event coordination module  may, without user input, instruct live video review module  to instruct the monitoring sensor  to pan to, tilt to, or zoom in on an area where a pre-determined event is detected as taking place. Additionally or alternatively, the mapping module  may also instruct the live video module  to instruct the monitoring sensor  to pan to, tilt to, or zoom in on a particular area in response to a request by a user. As described in further detail below, live video review module  preferably allows users to conduct monitoring on the live information streams that are received","As described in further detail below, video review module  preferably allows users to conduct monitoring on previously recorded information streams received from monitoring sensors . The information streams may be recorded by and received from video source , although in alternate embodiments the information streams may also be recorded by live video review module .","Video review module  allows users to analyze the previously recorded streams. As described in further detail below, the video analysis of information streams may be assisted by analyzing specific time periods of the video stream, using the software drill down module , and incorporating bookmarks into the recorded streams. Drill down module  preferably divides the recorded streams of video information into sections of specific length of time, and displays those portions together on the monitor, to facilitate analysis. Bookmarks may be any type of data or computer code that can be used by a software bookmark display module  to direct a user of a mapping station ,  or monitoring computer ,  to a specific place or section of a recorded stream of video information. The bookmarks are preferably stored in an accompanying bookmark database controlled by the bookmark database module . The working of the bookmark display module  is further described below in reference to . The working of the drill down module is described below with reference to .","Mapping module  preferably provides the functionality of the mapping stations , . As described in further detail below, mapping module  preferably manages (and allows users to manage) how and which information streams (live streams from live video module  or recorded streams video review module ) are outputted to the users monitors , via the remote video monitor module .","The event coordination module  detects events for which an alert or alarm may need to be issued. The stream of information sent by monitoring sensor  can be received, via network , by event coordination module , which can analyze the stream of information to determine whether a particular event is occurring before passing the stream to the event processing module . If an event is occurring (e.g. motion has been detected), event coordination module  may send an alert or alarm to event processing module . Additionally or alternatively, event coordination module  may also embed information, related to the event being detected, into the stream received from monitoring sensor , or into the metadata of that stream. By way of non-limiting example, the information embedded into the metadata or the stream may include information directed to which cameras, audio sources, and information streams are related to the alert.","As described herein, event coordination module  may detect certain events by using data received from monitoring sensor  or by other event detection methods. For example, in certain embodiments a stream of video information received from monitoring sensor  may be analyzed by the event coordination module  to detect events such as loitering, motion, or a loud sound. In other embodiments, the monitoring sensor  or the video source  may itself include its own software modules that may analyze the visual information it receives. For example, if monitoring sensor  is a video camera, the video camera itself may detect events such as loud noises (if the video camera contains a microphone), or motion, and embed information about those events into the metadata accompanying the stream of information that video camera monitoring sensor  sends via network  to the event processing module . Upon reception of a stream of video information from such event detecting video camera monitoring sensor , event coordination module  may retrieve the information, about the events, from the metadata of the stream of video and use that data in its analysis.","When events are detected, software event coordination module  can further analyze the types and sequences of events. Event coordination module  is preferably configured to issue alarms or alerts in response to specific sequences of events. By way of non-limiting example, the event coordination module  may ignore an event if it detects that multiple incorrect passwords were inputted by various people into keypad monitoring sensor  in the field of view of a video camera monitoring sensor , but may issue an alarm if a single person inputs multiple wrong passwords.","When event coordination module  detects an event or sequence of events that trigger an alarm or alert, the event processing module preferably sends the alert or alarm to the event processing module . Event processing module , upon receiving an alert or alarm, may transmit instructions to the mapping module  and\/or live video review module . By way of non-limiting example, the event processing module may send instruction to mapping module  to send a specific information stream to the remote video monitor module  which, in turn, can display the information stream (which may include a video information stream, an alert or alarm, and\/or any other relevant information) on monitors  of mapping stations , .","By way of another non-limiting example, the event processing module , may transmit instructions to the live video module , which may include instructions relating to the operation of the monitoring sensors  creating the information streams, for example, in the example above, describing a single person incorrectly inputting a password, the event coordination module  may instruct the monitoring sensor , which can be a camera, to pan to, tilt to, and zoom in on the face of the person incorrectly entering the password. Event processing module  preferably directs the alerts and\/or alarms received from event coordination module  to the relevant monitoring computers , , mapping stations ,  and their respective monitors . The alerts displayed on the monitors  may take on any form, for example, they may be messages, sounds, flashing lights, or other warning methods as described in further detail below. It should be noted that the event processing module  may send alerts to every monitoring computer ,  or mapping station ,  in the monitoring system , or to only select monitoring computers . For example, alerts for major events (for example, an extremely loud sound such as an explosion) may be sent to every computer , , ,  on the network, alerting the users of a potential disaster, whereas alerts for minor events, for example loitering, may be sent to a specific individual's monitoring computer  that is monitoring the field of view of a camera wherein the loitering is occurring. In certain situations the event coordination module  may bypass the event processing module  and may, itself, send the alerts or alarms to the various monitoring computers ,  and or mapping computers , , to be displayed on physical monitors  via remote video monitor module .","The alerts are preferably displayed to the users by the mapping module  or live video review module  (depending on whether a user is in a mapping mode or live video review mode) as described in further detail below with reference to  respectively. As described in detail below, the users may then inspect the alert, by using GUI  or GUI , and mark the alert as handled and\/or provide additional information related to the alert. This input from the users is preferably collected by the event processor module  and sent to event coordinator module  which may keep track of alerts and any operation performed in relation to the alerts.","It should be noted that the various modules shown herein are for illustrative purposes only. In various embodiments the functionality of the modules may be assumed by a single software module, or several software modules. Likewise, the system should not be limited to any specific type of hardware, any type of computer, sensor, display device, or other components may be used.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of an exemplary operation of an embodiment of monitoring system . It should be noted that this exemplary operation should not be interpreted to limit the systems and methods described herein. In various embodiments many other operations may be performed by and on the monitoring system . Additionally the system may perform the steps described below in a different order than described.","First, the monitoring system  receives a stream of information from a monitoring sensor  (e.g. camera) across network .

Step .","Monitoring sensors  display the information stream by first connecting to the video source  and requesting the live relay of video from one or more monitoring sensors  to a predetermined monitor . It should be noted that this is exemplary and in other embodiments the displaying of video from the monitoring sensors  on the physical monitors  may be performed in other ways, for example by having the monitoring sensor directly send the information stream to the monitor , or in any other way heretofore known in the art or hereafter developed.","Next, the operator of the monitoring computer , may view the video stream and receive information as to the cause of the alert. Step .","After reviewing the information the operator can take whatever action is necessary to handle the situation (e.g. notify security that there is an unauthorized person loitering in a specified location). Next, the operator of the monitoring computer , may acknowledge the alert and what steps have been taken. Step .","Next, the event processing module  can receive the acknowledgement and send the acknowledgement to event coordination module . Step .","Once the event coordination module  receives confirmation that the alert has been handled, the event coordination module  instructs all mapping stations ,  and monitoring computers ,  that the alert has been handled and no further action is necessary, or that additional action is necessary.

In an embodiment of the monitoring system , in order to handle an audio stream the system may utilize the specific audio provider , audio provider factory , and audio provider url . The abstract audio provider  is an abstraction of an audio source containing the interface definitions of functions such as connect, login, startlive, and any other relevant function. The specific audio provider  is an instance that contains the implementation specific to the source. In use, audio provider factory  preferably parses the protocol identifier and creates a specific audio provider  that matches the specific source from which the audio stream is received. The specific audio provider  is then manipulated, by the audio stream handler  using the interface of the abstract audio provider .","After manipulation, the audio data is decoded by the audio stream decoder  and passed to an output device (e.g. speakers, headphones, or any other sound output device) via audio mixer  as described above.","It should be noted that the above description of the audio processing components of the monitoring system  are exemplary and may be substituted with any other sound processing methodology. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various hardware and software modules may be used to achieve the same goals of receiving, manipulating, and transferring sound streams This allows the user of monitoring system  to listen to the sound produced by monitoring sensor .","With reference to , there is shown a display engine  of the hardware control modules  of the monitoring system  according to an embodiment of the invention. The display engine  preferably provides access to the video hardware and may enable outputting various video streams to output devices such as monitors . For example, the display engine  is preferably used to display a stream of video information from a video camera monitoring sensor , as well as various GUI elements such as buttons, icons, windows, and other similar elements.","The display engine  may include a physical display driver , application programming interface , monitor class module , pixel shader module , texture cache , window module , and texture module . Display engine  preferably outputs to a physical display .","The physical display  may correspond to any type of display as described above. The display driver  enables the monitoring system  to communicate with the physical display.","Application programming interface  may be any type of interface that allows the monitoring system  to render graphics on the monitor. By way of non-limiting example, the application programming interface may be Direct X, Direct3D distributed by MICROSOFT Corp., or other programming interfaces.","The monitor module  preferably corresponds to a video output on a video adapter (not shown). The monitor module  handles the allocation of texture memory in the VRAM of the graphics adapter. The monitor module  may be configured to utilize system memory if the graphic adapter runs out of memory.","Texture cache module  preferably corresponds to the cache of the video adaptor which may be used to hold frequently used textures and thus may help conserve VRAM.","The pixel shader module  contains instructions related to rendering of textures. The pixel shader module  may be used to instruct the Graphic Processing Unit of the video card how to convert various pixel formats supported by various video providers (by way of non-limiting example, various surveillance cameras) to Red Green Blue Alpha (\u201cRGBA\u201d) format frequently used by graphic adapters, although it should be noted that the invention should not be limited to any specific format. By way of non-limiting example the pixel shader module  may be used to convert YcrCb 4:1:1 or ABGR formats to RGBA.","The window module  is preferably a collection of instructions to draw various elements of related information within a region. The window module may provide instructions related to the intricacies of dealing with the monitor module . The window module  may further provide various functions for drawing various geometric primitives such as gradients and filled rectangles, as well as the ability to draw textures such as rectangles. Window module  is also used to create window objects (described in further detail below) which are registered through the monitor module  and eventually displayed on the physical display . The window objects created using window module  may repaint themselves in each refresh cycle.","The texture module  contains various buffers and commands needed to load bitmap arrays (not shown) from memory, disk files, and\/or resources embedded in executable image files. Texture module  may consist of a plurality of buffers that are combined through pixel shaders to create a final RGBA output.","With reference back to , in an embodiment of the monitoring system , in order to handle a video stream the system utilizes video provider , a video decoder , an abstract video provider , a window module  and video stream handler . In use, the video stream mechanism  may be initialized by passing a video stream URL to the video stream provider factory (not shown). Subsequently the video stream handler  may receive instructions as to the resolution and pixel format of the display window object  associated with the video stream handler . The resolution and pixel format instruction may be farther passed to the video provider  which in turn may optimize the decoding path. The video stream handler  connects a window  and a video provider. In use, the video provider  may be a video stream from monitoring sensor  surveillance camera and the window  may be a window object displayed on the monitor.","Layout module  may be further used to manipulate video stream handler . When a user accesses a portion of a monitor  using a peripheral device (e.g. by clicking a mouse), the inputs are relayed to the video stream handler . Depending on the input, the video being displaying using the video stream handler  may be paused, rewound, played back, or have any other operation performed thereon. Panning, tilting, or zooming functions can also be invoked through the video stream handler  which preferably instructs the window  to pan tilt or zoom, or alternatively video stream handler can instruct the abstract video provider  to move the monitoring sensor  to monitor a particular object or instance.","In certain embodiments of the monitoring system  the video stream handler  can monitor the status of abstract video provider . Thus, video stream handler  may determine, for example, whether abstract video provider  still maintains a connection to its video source  or whether the connection has been lost and needs to be reestablished. Layout module  periodically causes video stream handler  to update itself and thereby can determine the connection status of the abstract video provider  and, if the abstract video provider  is connected and has a new video frame available, can cause a video frame from the abstract video provider  to be transferred to and displayed in window  and thereby on the identified monitor .","It should be noted that the above description of the display engine and video stream handling is purely exemplary and the invention should not be limited to the components and methods described. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are multiple ways of utilizing various modules and hardware elements in order to achieve the desired objects of receiving, transferring, modifying, converting and\/or outputting video streams.","With reference to , in certain embodiments of monitoring system , metadata stream is received along with an information stream from video source . The acquisition of metadata from event coordination module  is implemented in the metadata stream handler , abstract metadata provider  and specific metadata provider  with metadata renderer  finally creating a visual representation of the metadata. The abstract metadata provider  is contains the interface definitions of functions such as connect, login, and any other relevant function necessary to access the metadata. The specific metadata provider  is an instance that contains the implementation specific to the source. In use, a specific metadata provider  that matches the specific source from which the metadata is received is created. The specific metadata provider  is then manipulated, by the abstract metadata stream handler  using the interface of the abstract metadata provider . These modules allow metadata that can be generated by a monitoring sensor  that uses a distinct format to be received by and interpreted by the monitoring system  and eventually displayed to the user.","In certain embodiments metadata received from video source  may contain detailed information about the event monitored. The ability to receive and interpret this metadata may allow for performance of intelligent analytics and\/or enhanced surveillance by a human user of the monitoring system . For example, metadata received from video source  may be \u201calert, illegally parked car at (200, 120), (300, 160)\u201d in the video information stream being received from video source . Upon receiving such metadata, monitoring system  may in one embodiment, use proxy module , to convert the metadata to a syntax neutral format. The syntax neutral format may include, for example, a globally unique sensor identifier (provider URL) and a primitive defined as: primitive (1 . . . N)Type (Box, Circle, Text, Polygon) Type specific data (coordinates of the primitive) Color. For example, where the metadata is an alert of an illegally parked car having the form \u201calert, illegal parked car at (200, 120), (300),(160).\u201d The syntax neutral format may be:\n\n","For every video frame, a new metadata packet may be created and sent to event coordination module  which will in turn trigger metadata renderer  which will utilize metadata stream handler , abstract metadata provider , and specific metadata provider  as described above in order to create a visual representation of the metadata on the monitor of the user requesting the metadata. In the example used above, if a user of monitoring computer  was viewing the video stream from video provider  that had the metadata described above, and the user requested to view the metadata, the metadata renderer  would cause a green box to be drawn around the illegally parked car and red text informing the user that the car was an \u201cIllegally Parked Car\u201d is caused appear. This will notify the user of monitoring  about the illegally parked car, and will focus the user's attention on the specific area where the car is located thereby. It should be noted that it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that metadata may be rendered in any number of ways, and that the method described above is exemplary and should not be interpreted to be limiting.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of a mapping graphical user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d)  of a monitoring system . This is an exemplary GUI that users of the monitoring system  may use to select streams to monitor, receive alerts, send transfer streams to various other monitoring computers and place them graphically on a location map thereby informing the users of the location of the sensor  that is producing the video stream. The interface preferably includes a map  of the area being monitored, various camera icons  and auxiliary sensor icons , alert notification area , map navigation controls , remote monitor controls  and a remote video navigation panel .

The users of the mapping GUI  may interact with the various camera icons  auxiliary sensor icons  and thereby access the information stream associated with the camera  or monitoring sensor  being represented by the respective icon. The interaction with the icons ,  may be caused in any way including, but not limited to, clicking the mouse pointer over the icon, touching the icon via a touch-pad, referencing the icon via a voice command, or other indicative methods.","When a user selects a camera icon , a video window object  is preferably displayed for the user on the monitor. The video window object  preferably displays the stream of information received from the camera the icon of which was interacted with by the user. The window object  may have permanent controls embedded in it, or the controls may fade in on or out (to preserve viewing area) due to user interaction that may be, by way of non-limiting example, dragging a mouse cursor over a particular portion of the video window object. The controls of the window object may include any useful and compatible control, by way of non-limiting examples the controls may include icons representing buttons to pause, rewind, fast forward the stream and pan, tilt, and\/or zoom over the stream and may include controls for additional features (described in further detail below) such as motion-detection, night-vision, etc. The panning, tilting and zooming over the stream may be digital or optical. Thus, the user of the system may focus and enlarge particular areas of interest displayed in the window object .","The mapping GUI  allows the user of the mapping GUI  to select users to monitor various video streams. The mapping GUI  may include monitor icons  representing various computer monitors  located throughout the monitoring system . These monitors  may all be connected to the same computer and may even be part of the terminal where the mapping GUI  is being utilized, alternatively the monitors may also represent remote monitors connected to remote monitoring computers that are connected to the monitoring system  via the network. In use, by way of non-limiting example, the user of the mapping GUI  may drag, using a mouse, a video window  showing a video stream from one of the cameras, to a monitor icon  representing a remote monitor, thereby preferably giving the user of the remote monitor the ability to view the video stream. The user of the remote computer may view the stream by having a window with the video stream pop up on their monitor, or by receiving a prompt to open a video window with the stream, though any other method may be utilized. The user viewing the video stream may access a control  that reorients the map  to the location of the camera icon  that represents the video camera producing the video stream.","The mapping GUI  may further include a remote video navigation panel , which preferably provides the user of the mapping GUI  with the ability to navigate various remote computer monitors throughout the system. The tools may any type of tool including scroll bars, shortcuts, links, etc.","The mapping GUI  may further include an alert notification area  where alerts and alarms may appear. In use, as described above, there may be situations where the various monitoring sensors may detect events that were predetermined to set off alarms or alerts. These alarms, which may be messages, sounds, flashing window objects, or any other type of indicator, may pop up on the mapping GUI . The alerts and alarms may pop up on the GUI  on the bottom right hand corner, or any other predetermined area, and notify the user of the event.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of a live video review GUI  of a monitoring system . This is an exemplary GUI that users of the monitoring system  may use to monitor specific streams of live video from various monitoring sensors . The live review GUI  may include one or more window objects  displaying live video streams, alert notification area , and a video navigation panel . This GUI allows users to simultaneously view selected live video streams from specific monitoring sensor  of their choosing. The live video review GUI  may further include an embedded webpage , which may be used to access various websites on the internet.","The video windows  include a video information bar , which may contain any relevant information about the video stream, such as, for example time, camera, or other indicative information. The video window objects  may have the same functionality as the video window  or any other functionality so long as video is viewable. In various embodiments it is envisioned that a video navigation panel  may be used to control the video stream displayed in window . The video navigation panel  may be always visible, sometimes visible, or only visible upon user request. The video navigation panel  may include any relevant tools, for example the ability to pause video, play video, pan, tilt, zoom, etc.","The live video review GUI  may also include an event notification area , similar to the alert notification area , which may alert the user of various occurrences in the system.","It should be noted that the arrangement of the objects on the various user interfaces described above and below is only exemplary. Any layout may be utilized with different icons, various sized windows, etc. In various embodiments of the invention it is envisioned that users may customize the layout to fit their preferences by, for example dragging and resizing various objects of the GUI, or in any other manner.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of a video review GUI  of a monitoring system  which may be accessed by a user of the monitoring system  that wants to review the recorded live video stream. The video review GUI  is similar to the live video review GUI  except that it preferably includes an additional timeline control , and individual time-line indicators .","When reviewing recorded video, it is useful to know precisely when a particular event occurred, therefore in the present embodiment a timeline indicator , which indicates which time segment is being displayed in the video window object , is included.","The timeline control  maybe used to review video streams. The timeline may resemble a ruler that can be dragged in order to navigate. The timeline  may be bookmarked by the operator in order to define time segments of extra importance. The bookmarks  and  may be configured to contain additional information about the segment being bookmarked. Furthermore, the timeline control , may include additional navigation tools , which may include any tool such as fast forward, play, or other navigational features.","With reference to , there is shown and described an embodiment of a motion detection based search analysis that can be performed on a stream of video information. Motion detection GUI  may be accessed from the video review GUI . In an embodiment of monitoring system , motion is detected by performing a frame comparison. By performing frame comparison, monitoring system  can detect changes that occur over time in the area being monitored by monitoring sensor  and send those streams of video information to be displayed in GUI .","Frame comparison may be performed by drill down module  by first acquiring a reference frame (which may be selected by a user). This frame may be decoded from its compressed format (e.g. MJPEG or MPEG4) to an uncompressed 2-dimensional array of bytes. Each pixel of the frame consists of 3 bytes, 1 byte for the red component of the pixel, 1 byte for the green component of the pixel and 1 byte for the blue component of the pixel. The value of the byte ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 is \u201coff\u201d and 255 is \u201cfull intensity.\u201d By specifying different intensities for the 3 components more than 16 million different hues\/shades can be made. The dimensions of the uncompressed frame matches the resolution of the reference frame to enable proper comparison. If the frame is 640 by 480 pixels, the array will contain 640 columns and 480 rows of 3 byte values, each value specifying the pixel color.","Thereafter another frame is acquired from a video source. The distance in time between the reference frame and the new frame may be specified by the user. In some cases, a fine combing of the video data is needed (e.g. to focus on where an object the subject was holding was placed), and thus the distance in time may be very small, less than one second, while other times the distance in time can be larger than 10 seconds (e.g. to monitor when a certain vehicle left the parking lot).","Like the reference frame, the new frame is decompressed into a 2-Dimensional array. Depending on the area being examined for motion, different values of arrays of reference frame and the new frame are extracted and compared to one another. The difference between each of the components of each frame is then examined (e.g. Dred=Abs (PixelR.Red\u2212PixelN.Red), Dgreen=Abs (PixelR.Green\u2212PixelN.Green), Dblue=Abs (PixelR.Blue\u2212PixelN.Blue) where Dred represents the absolute value of difference in color between the red component of the pixel of the reference frame and the red component of the pixel of the new frame, Dgreen represents the absolute value of difference in color between the green component of the pixel of the reference frame and the green component of the pixel of the new frame, and Dblue represents the absolute value of difference in color between the blue component of the pixel of the reference frame and the blue component of the pixel of the new frame). If the difference in between one of the three components exceeds the sensitivity variable specified by the user then the system will consider the pixel to have changed value.","Once all the pixels have been compared between the two frames, the system determines whether sufficient number of pixels have changed to warrant a finding of a change between two frames. The number of pixels that need to have had changed may be set by a user of the monitoring system . Typically, the larger the number of pixels that need to have had changed, the more dramatic the change. A user looking for a large change would set the threshold higher than someone looking for a small change, thereby expediting the process by avoiding the need to look through extra video","As shown and described in , in use, a user defines an area of interest  in the stream of video information . Thereafter, using controls described in detail below the user can cause the drill down module  of monitoring system  to perform frame comparison. As the drill down module  detects change between frames, the location of the change may be initially indicated by displaying a red pixel  instead of the real pixel color. This change in pixel color alerts the user to focus on the area of interest where certain events have been detected. If the user pauses the search, the red pixel gradually fades and becomes transparent in order to reveal the original pixel color. In one embodiment, this creates a visible fading red trail showing a motion of an object.","It should be noted that the frame comparison process described above is purely exemplary and not limiting. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that frame comparison may be performed in any of a multitude of ways for example by using sections of pixels, using algorithms instead of (or in addition to) user inputs, or through use of different video formats, or any other modification. It should be further noted that although frame comparison has been described with reference to motion detection, it may be used to detect other events such as the setting of the sun, changes in lighting, appearance of new objects, or any other event that can be seen by a difference between frames.","As shown and described with reference to , a user performing frame comparison may be provided with a graphical user interface including controls  to select pixel count threshold , pixel change sensitivity , time step adjustment , and motion buttons  to navigate within the displayed video. These buttons are exemplary and other controls may be utilized to give user the ability to set the properties used in performing frame comparison.","In an embodiment, the monitoring system  can facilitate and expedite the process of locating a point in time when some particular event occurred. For that purpose, in response to user input to video review GUI  (e.g. clicking on an icon on timeline control , after selecting point in time of the recorded stream), monitoring system  may generate a thumbnail review GUI  (as shown and described with reference to ) which preferably contains a windows  showing images that are temporally displaced within a recorded stream of video information which itself is displayed in a larger separate window . The time-displaced windows  can be \u201cthumbnail\u201d size. These windows  may contain static images, although in alternate embodiments they maybe capable of video playback. Each of these individual frames  may show an entire image that was recorded, or it may be a section of that recorded image.","To attain this functionality, the monitoring system  may include a plurality of system modules  loaded on the hardware (described above with reference to ). As shown and described with reference to , system modules  of the monitoring system  preferably further include a drill down module  and a thumbnail review GUI control  which work together with the display engine , provider URL module , layout module , and video stream from video source  to display the relevant video in a user-friendly manner for the user. The thumbnail review GUI control  provides the functionality of thumbnail review GUI , and the drill down module  provides the functionality of controls that can allow the operator to for example digitally pan to, tilt to, or zoom in on to focus the plurality of video frames on a specific region of interest within the entire region captured by a camera.","As shown and described with reference to , in use, after a request from a user, via thumbnail review GUI  module, drill down module  is passed a master video stream which may contain visual information from, for example a live feed from a camera on the premises, a live feed from a camera located off the premises, or a previously recorded video stream from any storage medium and location. Drill down module  may then create a provider URL  and cause the provider URL  to connect to the same video stream that was sent to the drill down module . The video stream may be identified by a unique resource identifier such as a URL. After URL , makes the connection to the video stream, layout manager  may display the master video stream in window  that is rendered by display engine .","Drill down module  may also cause display engine  to create window objects . For example display engine  may create twenty window objects  with a 256 by 256 RBGA texture map attached. The drill down module  may keep track of the windows by keeping the references to the window objects , in a data structure, such as an array. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that any number of windows of any size, in any configuration, with any type of texture map, may be used.","The window objects may be populated with image frames from video stream by provider URL . Provider URL  preferably chooses frames, located at specific time intervals away from the time of the video stream that may be selected in any way, for example through the use of a timeline control . The provider URL  preferably copies one image frame into each window object . This process may be performed in a loop fashion, with the provider URL  choosing the first image frame, placing it into a window object, then choosing a second image frame that is a certain time interval removed from a timestamp of the first image frame, and placing the second image frame into a second window object, etc. until all of the window objects are populated with images. Alternatively, all the window objects  may be populated at once, or in sections.","It should be noted that in various embodiments the drill down manager  may be utilized together with a multitude of modules in order to create window objects  based upon any number of conditions. For example, in certain embodiments, the drill down manager  may be used in combination with frame comparison, thereby the various window objects  may be generated based upon an occurrence of a change between the frames of the video stream. In further embodiments, drill down manager  may be combined with analytics performed by video source , monitoring sensor , or event coordinator module  and the various window objects  may be created based upon occurrence of events or certain conditions being satisfied.","In order to fit the image frame into a window object , the display engine  may convert and scale the image frame. The conversion and scaling preferably causes the image frame to match the type, size, and texture map of the window objects that is configured to be thumbnail size. For example, the image frame chosen from the video source may be converted to RGBA and scaled to a 256 by 256 matrix using nearest neighbor interpolation, though any other method, including but not limited to bilinear interpolation may be used. The scaled RGBA matrix may then be copied into the window object texture map. The coordinates of the window object maybe adjusted so that the aspect ratio of the window object is the same as the aspect ratio of the master video image frame. This way, the final image displayed in the window object will appear to be correctly scaled, even though the aspect ratio of the texture map is 1 to 1. It should be noted that scaling and conversion may be performed in any way so long as the scaled and converted image frame is capable of being displayed in the window object.","The monitoring system  preferably enables the user to focus, by digitally tilting and panning, on a specific area of the entire video source, and having the window objects  digitally zoom in on that specific area. A thumbnail review GUI  should permit a user to select a region of interest  from the window  displaying the video source. For example, this may be performed by a user drawing a rectangle around the region of interest  in the thumbnail review GUI . Many alternate methods of selecting a region of interest  are possible, for example placing a pre-sized object over the area of interest, and the invention should not be limited to any specific method.","After the region of interest  is selected, it is passed to the drill down module  which may then perform offset removal, normalization, aspect correction, and\/or frame edge adjustment before having the display engine  place the region of interest  as the frame image inside the window object .","As shown in , depending on the programming language used and the display medium employed, offset removal may be performed prior to placing the frame image into the window object. Drill down module  may use the coordinates of the display medium, the coordinates of the stream of information, and the coordinates of the region of interest  in order to derive the location of the region of interest  within the stream of information.","As shown in , the region of interest  is preferably normalized before being displayed on monitor . Normalization may be necessary because in current systems the position of windows on the monitor is generally specified in either pixel coordinates or in 3-Dimensional space coordinates. The texture map, which, in current systems, constitutes the actual content of a window on the monitor may have dimensions that are different from the window itself. In order to specify what portion of the texture map is displayed inside the window, normalized coordinates may be used. By way of non-limiting example, the coordinate (0,0) may be used to represent the upper left corner of the texture map, while (1,1) may represent the lower right corner. Thus, to show the entire contents of the texture map in the window, the coordinates (0,0), (1,1) are used, and may be manipulated in order to allow a user to zoom in on an area. By way of non-limiting example (0,0), (0.5, 0.5) may be used to show the upper left of the texture inside the window. Since the position of the window displaying the texture map of an image on the monitor hasn't changed, it will appear to the user as if the window zoomed in on a portion of the image. It is possible that in alternate embodiments normalization may be accomplished in an alternative ways. If computers and displays utilize operating systems that map texture maps in ways other than pixel or 3-Dimensional space coordinates, normalization may not be necessary, or may need to be implemented in ways that are compatible with those systems.","As shown in , there may be instances where the aspect ratio of the window object does not match the aspect ratio of the region of interest . This may occur in instances where the window object is set to a certain aspect ratio , while the aspect ratio of the region of interest  is determined by the user. In such monitoring system  configurations, the drill down module  may adjust the size of the region of interest  to make its aspect ratio match the aspect ratio of the window object . In order to achieve this without stretching or shrinking the subjects within the region of interest , additional area of the master video stream may be automatically added, by the drill down module , to the region of interest .","As shown in , aspect ratio adjustment may cause the post ratio adjustment region of interest  to lie outside of the master video stream. To prevent this, the drill down module  may automatically adjust the edges of the region of interest  such that they lie within the borders of the master video stream. This is done by either subtraction or addition of values to the coordinates of the region of interest .","In one embodiment a user of monitoring system  can analyze certain portions of a video stream without viewing or scrolling through the entire video stream. Alternatively, a user of monitoring system  can view portions of multiple video streams that all correspond to the same exact time period.","The window objects, generated by the monitoring system , may be capable of displaying video. The operator may provide any type of applicable input to the monitoring system , for example pressing a key on a keyboard, touching a touchpad, or clicking a specific button or menu on the monitor, instructing the monitoring system  to play the video, in each of the window objects, from the point in time displayed of the image displayed in each window object. It should be appreciated that the monitoring system  may be configured to have all of the thumbnails play video at once, alternatively some thumbnails may play video while others remain paused. Additionally, each window object may have controls for performing operations such as fast forward, rewind, pause, on the video in each individual window object. Enhancements, such as motion tracking described above with reference to  may be shown within the thumbnails. In embodiments where the individual windows  contain static images, clicking on such windows  preferably results in the video playing back in source window  or another location, starting from the point in time of the static image in a window .","The GUI of the monitoring system  is purely exemplary, and the location and size and shape of the window objects, buttons, etc. may take on any configuration. Additionally, in various embodiments of the monitoring system , the user may have the ability to alter the positions and sizes of the various window objects on the monitor.","It should be noted that while the various GUIs are shown herein as being displayed on a single monitor, it should be appreciated that any number of monitors may be utilized. By way of non-limiting example, mapping GUI  may be displayed on a video wall of multiple monitors with one monitor showing the map , and the other monitors showing various live video window objects . These window objects can, for example, be particular portions of a longer video being displayed on GUI , or may be unrelated video monitors.","It should be noted that although the embodiments described herein refer to multiple software modules for performing the various functions of monitoring system , other embodiments could be implemented with a single module incorporating the functions of several, or all, of the modules. The precise design of the software and the programming language used may be designed differently within the scope of the present invention. The software modules can be created using art recognized programming languages, including but not limited to C, C++, Java, C#, or PHP or any combination of known or hereafter developed programming languages that allow the functionality described.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the method and system of the present invention has many applications, may be implemented in many manners and, as such is not to be limited by the foregoing embodiments and examples. In other words, functional elements being performed by a single or multiple components, in various combinations of hardware and software, and individual functions can be distributed among software applications.
