{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention was made with support from the United States Government under contract number C-3009 awarded by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. The United States Government may have certain rights in the invention.","A Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device is typically enclosed in a sensor block assembly (SBA) to facilitate mounting of the MEMS device in its application device. For example, a MEMS gyroscope or accelerometer may be used to determine angular rotation or acceleration, respectively, of the application device in which it is installed.","The MEMS device may be subject to severe temperature excursions when the application device is operating in the field. For example, if the application device is a satellite or space craft, the satellite or space craft will be subjected to extreme temperature variations. However, performance of the MEMS device varies as a function of temperature. It is particularly undesirable for the MEMS device to be subjected to changes in temperature.","Further, in addition to ambient temperature excursions, devices within the MEMS device and the SBA, including the SBA controller, generate heat while operating due to resistive loading losses. Such generated heat further complicates the maintenance of the MEMS device at a predefined temperature or within a predefined temperature range.","To prevent the MEMS device from exposure to cold temperatures, a heater may be physically coupled to, or implemented within, the sensor block assembly. As temperature of the application device decreases, the SBA heater will operate to maintain temperature of the MEMS device within a predefined temperature threshold.","However, the temperature control system of the SBA heater relies on an external power source, such as a battery. When a battery is used as the power source, output voltage of the battery changes as a function of temperature and\/or use. For example, as power within the battery is consumed, the output voltage of the battery will decrease. As the battery is recharged, output voltage increases. Such changes in the output voltage of the battery affects the performance of the SBA heater.","The output power of a resistive type SBA heater equals the magnitude of the input voltage squared (V), divided by the value of the heater resistor (R), and times the duty factor (D), as illustrated by Equation 1 below. The duty factor corresponds to the period of time for which the input voltage (V) is applied to the heater resistor (R).\n\nOutput Power=[()\/()]*()\u2003\u2003(Eq. 1)\n","The SBA heater control system is configured to adjust the duty cycle so that the SBA heater maintains the operating temperature of the MEMS device at its predefined operating temperature (or within its predefined operating temperature range). However, the SBA heater control system response time is not instantaneous. For example, if the power supply voltage doubles, the output power increases by a factor of four until the SBA heater control system is able to decrease the duty cycle by a factor of four. During this period of time wherein the SBA heater control system adjusts the duty cycle, the SBA heater may heat the MEMS device above the desired predefined temperature (or temperature slew rate).","Accordingly, it is desirable to improve the ability of the SBA heater control system to respond more accurately to changes in the power source voltage so that the SBA heater is able to maintain the predefined temperature of the MEMS device.","Systems and methods of sourcing a heating resistor to control temperature are disclosed. An exemplary embodiment generates a root mean square (RMS) pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal based upon an input voltage from a power source, controls a switch in accordance with the RMS PWM control signal; and sources a heater resistor from the power source in accordance with the controlling of the switch. Power to the heating resistor is controlled by the switch to provide a substantially constant value of power to the heating resistor for varying values of the input voltage.","In accordance with further aspects, an exemplary embodiment includes a heating resistor, a switch coupled between a power source and the heating resistor, and a root mean square (RMS) pulse width modulation (PWM) controller coupled to the switch. The switch is configured to source the heating resistor at the input voltage from the power source. The RMS PWM controller is configured to generate a RMS PWM control signal to control the switch. The RMS PWM control signal operates the switch to provide power to the heating resistor at a first duty cycle corresponding to the magnitude of the first input voltage and operates the switch to provide power to the heating resistor at a second duty cycle corresponding to the magnitude of a second input voltage. Accordingly, the power provided to the heating resistor at the first duty cycle is substantially the same as the power provided to the heating resistor at the second duty cycle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","100","104","106","102","108","110","106","108","110","106","104","100","106","108","110"],"sub":["IN","IN"]},"A temperature sensor  senses temperature of the sensor block assembly (SBA) . When the sensed temperature is less than a predefined temperature threshold, the RMS PWM controller  is enabled to control the switch . The switch  couples the heating resistor  and the power source  so that the heating resistor  is sourced at a substantially constant value of power for varying values of the magnitude of the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  in accordance with the RMS PWM control signal . Accordingly, the RMS PWM controller  controls temperature of a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device  residing in the SBA .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","202","204","206","208"]},"The ramp generator  receives a voltage from the power source . Based upon the input voltage (V) from the power source , the ramp generator  generates and communicates a control signal to the variable slope clock  which sets the slope of the variable ramp control signal . In an exemplary embodiment, the slope of the control signal output from the ramp generator  corresponds to the magnitude of the input voltage Vminus an offset voltage (K), multiplied by a gain (g), and divided by the clock capacitance (C). Equation 2 generally describes the ramped control signal output from the ramp generator .\n\nSlope=*()\/\u2003\u2003(Eq. 2)\n","The output control signal of the ramp generator  may be linear or nonlinear through suitable modification of Equation 2. For example, an exponential output control signal may be based upon a combination of coupled resistors (R) and capacitors (C) which define an RC slope. Further, some embodiments may employ a ramp rate with different slopes at predefined break points.","The fixed frequency clock  generates and communicates a clock control signal  to the variable slope clock  which sets the operating frequency of the variable ramp control signal  of the variable slope clock . For example, the clock control signal  may reset timing capacitors (not shown) of the variable slope clock  to a known voltage at the end of each clock cycle.","The variable ramp control signal  output from the variable slope clock  is input to the comparator . A demand signal  is also input to the comparator . The demand signal corresponds to a predefined value. The demand function may be a function of the temperature sensor . When the variable ramp control signal  is less than the demand signal , the output of the comparator  is a logical high such that the switch  is actuated to a closed position, thereby coupling the heating resistor  from the power source . When the variable ramp control signal  is equal to or greater than the demand signal , the output of the comparator  is a logical low such that the switch  is actuated to an opened position, thereby decoupling the heating resistor  from the power source .","When the magnitude of the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  is relatively high, the slope of the variable ramp control signal  is set relatively high. When the magnitude of the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  is relatively low, the slope of the variable ramp control signal  is set relatively low. Accordingly, the comparator  will transition from a logical high to a logical low more quickly with a higher slope of the variable ramp control signal . When the clock control signal  resets the variable slope clock , the comparator  transitions back to the logical high such that the switch  closes. Accordingly, \u201con\u201d time when the switch  is closed is relatively less with higher input voltages (V) than the \u201con\u201d time with lower input voltages (V). Thus, changing the slope of the variable ramp control signal  effectively changes the \u201con\u201d time of the switch, thereby resulting in the RMS PWM control signal .","In alternative embodiments, additional and\/or different components may be used which have different logical functionality, such as the comparator  and\/or the switch . For example, the switch  and comparator  may act cooperatively to close the switch  when the output of the comparator  is a logical low. Alternatively, the switch  may be placed in the ground leg of the resistor .","Embodiments of the RMS PWM controller  are operable to dynamically control the RMS power supplied to the heating resistor  as the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  changes. For example, as the power source  is discharged such that the voltage (V) supplied from the power source decreases, the slope of the variable ramp control signal  is decreased, thereby increasing the \u201con\u201d time of the switch . Conversely, as the power source  is recharged such that the voltage (V) supplied from the power source increases, the slope of the variable ramp control signal  is increased, thereby decreasing the \u201con\u201d time of the switch .","In one embodiment, the change in slope of the variable ramp control signal  is based on the magnitude of the RMS voltage across resistor  supplied from the power source  at minimum and maximum Vconditions. In another embodiment, the change in slope of the variable ramp control signal  is based upon a best least squares fit to the magnitude of the RMS voltage across resistor  supplied from the power source  at multiple Vconditions.","The output RMS PWM control signal  from the comparator  is a PWM signal that controls the switch . The control signal  is an RMS compensated signal that results in a substantially constant value of power to the heating resistor  for varying values of the magnitude of the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source . Accordingly, the RMS PWM controller  closes the switch  to couple the power source  to the heating resistor  and opens the switch  to decouple the heating resistor  from the power source  in accordance with the RMS PWM control signal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","100","306","302","304"]},"Embodiments of the RMS PWM controller  provide substantially the same amount of power as the input voltage varies, as illustrated in the plot .
