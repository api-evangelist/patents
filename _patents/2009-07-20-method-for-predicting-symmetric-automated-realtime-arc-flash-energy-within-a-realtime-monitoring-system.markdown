Technical Field","The present invention relates generally to computer modeling and management of systems and, more particularly, to computer simulation techniques with real-time system monitoring and prediction of electrical system performance.","II. Background","Computer models of complex systems enable improved system design, development, and implementation through techniques for off-line simulation of the system operation. That is, system models can be created that computers can \u201coperate\u201d in a virtual environment to determine design parameters. All manner of systems can be modeled, designed, and virtually operated in this way, including machinery, factories, electrical power and distribution systems, processing plants, devices, chemical processes, biological systems, and the like. Such simulation techniques have resulted in reduced development costs and superior operation.","Design and production processes have benefited greatly from such computer simulation techniques, and such techniques are relatively well developed, but such techniques have not been applied in real-time, e.g., for real-time operational monitoring and management. In addition, predictive failure analysis techniques do not generally use real-time data that reflect actual system operation. Greater efforts at real-time operational monitoring and management would provide more accurate and timely suggestions for operational decisions, and such techniques applied to failure analysis would provide improved predictions of system problems before they occur. With such improved techniques, operational costs could be greatly reduced.","For example, mission critical electrical systems, e.g., for data centers or nuclear power facilities, must be designed to ensure that power is always available. Thus, the systems must be as failure proof as possible, and many layers of redundancy must be designed in to ensure that there is always a backup in case of a failure. It will be understood that such systems are highly complex, a complexity made even greater as a result of the required redundancy. Computer design and modeling programs allow for the design of such systems by allowing a designer to model the system and simulate its operation. Thus, the designer can ensure that the system will operate as intended before the facility is constructed.","Once the facility is constructed, however, the design is typically only referred to when there is a failure. In other words, once there is failure, the system design is used to trace the failure and take corrective action; however, because such design are complex, and there are many interdependencies, it can be extremely difficult and time consuming to track the failure and all its dependencies and then take corrective action that does not result in other system disturbances.","Moreover, changing or upgrading the system can similarly be time consuming and expensive, requiring an expert to model the potential change, e.g., using the design and modeling program. Unfortunately, system interdependencies can be difficult to simulate, making even minor changes risky.","Conventional static Arc Flash simulation systems use a rigid simulation model that does not take the actual power system alignment and aging effects into consideration when computing predictions about the operational performance of an electrical system. These systems rely on exhaustive studies to be performed off-line by a power system engineer who must manually modify a simulation model so that it is reflective of the proposed facility operation conditions before conducting the static simulation or the series of static simulations. Therefore, they cannot readily adjust to the many daily changes to the electrical system that occur at a facility, e.g., motors and pumps may be put on-line or pulled off-line, utility electrical feeds may have changed, etc., nor accurately predict the various aspects, i.e., the quantity of energy released, the required level of worker PPE, the safe protection boundaries around components of the electrical system, etc., related to an Arc Flash event occurring on the electrical system.","Moreover, real-time Arc Flash simulations are typically performed by manually modifying the simulation model of the electrical power system such that the automatic transfer switch (ATS) of the bypass branch of the uninterrupted power supply (UPS) component is set to a bypass position. After, Arc Flash analyses and\/or simulations are performed using the modified simulation model. One challenge with this approach is that while the Arc Flash analysis and\/or simulation is being performed, the simulation model is not identical to the system being modeled. The Arc Flash analysis typically lasts for several seconds. If during that time another analysis (e.g., power flow, etc.) needs to be performed, the simulation model will not be indicative of the true state of the electrical power system (as it will have the ATS set to a bypass position), resulting in misleading data to be generated from the analyses and\/or simulations performed using the modified simulation model.","Methods for making real-time predictions about an Arc Flash event on an electrical system are disclosed.","In one aspect, a system for making real-time predictions about an arc flash event on an electrical system comprises a data acquisition component communicatively connected to a sensor configured to acquire real-time data output from the electrical system; an analytics server communicatively connected to the data acquisition component and comprising a virtual system modeling engine configured to generate predicted data output for the electrical system using a virtual system model of the electrical system, an analytics engine configured to monitor the real-time data output and the predicted data output of the electrical system, and an arc flash simulation engine configured to use the virtual system model updated based in the real-time data to forecast an aspect of the arc flash event.","These and other features, aspects, and embodiments of the invention are described below in the section entitled \u201cDetailed Description.\u201d","systems and methods for providing real-time predictions of Arch Flash incident energy, Arch Flash protection boundary, and required personal protective equipment (PPE) to comply with workplace safety standards are disclosed. It will be clear, however, that the systems and methods described herein are to be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the systems and methods described herein.","As used herein, a system denotes a set of components, real or abstract, comprising a whole where each component interacts with or is related to at least one other component within the whole. Examples of systems include machinery, factories, electrical systems, processing plants, devices, chemical processes, biological systems, data centers, aircraft carriers, and the like. An electrical system can designate a power generation and\/or distribution system that is widely dispersed, i.e., power generation, transformers, and\/or electrical distribution components distributed geographically throughout a large region, or bounded within a particular location, e.g., a power plant within a production facility, a bounded geographic area, on board a ship, etc.","A network application is any application that is stored on an application server connected to a network, e.g., local area network, wide area network, etc., in accordance with any contemporary client\/server architecture model and can be accessed via the network. In this arrangement, the network application programming interface (API) resides on the application server separate from the client machine. The client interface would typically be a web browser, e.g. INTERNET EXPLORER\u2122, FIREFOX\u2122, NETSCAPE\u2122, etc., that is in communication with the network application server via a network connection, e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, RSS, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","104","106","108","102","112","116","128","102","102","102","102","102","102"]},"The sensors ,  and  can be configured to provide output values for system parameters that indicate the operational status and\/or \u201chealth\u201d of the monitored system . For example, in an electrical power generation system, the current output or voltage readings for the various components that comprise the power generation system is indicative of the overall health and\/or operational condition of the system. In one embodiment, the sensors are configured to also measure additional data that can affect system operation. For example, for an electrical power distribution system, the sensor output can include environmental information, e.g., temperature, humidity, etc., which can impact electrical power demand and can also affect the operation and efficiency of the power distribution system itself.","Continuing with , in one embodiment, the sensors ,  and  can be configured to output data in an analog format. For example, electrical power sensor measurements, e.g., voltage, current, etc., are sometimes conveyed in an analog format as the measurements may be continuous in both time and amplitude. In another embodiment, the sensors ,  and  can be configured to output data in a digital format. For example, the same electrical power sensor measurements can be taken in discrete time increments that are not continuous in time or amplitude. In still another embodiment, the sensors ,  and  can be configured to output data in either an analog format, digital format, or both, depending on the sampling requirements of the monitored system .","The sensors ,  and  can be configured to capture output data at split-second intervals to effectuate \u201creal time\u201d data capture. For example, in one embodiment, the sensors ,  and  can be configured to generate hundreds of thousands of data readings per second. It should be appreciated, however, that the number of data output readings taken by a particular sensor can be set to any value as long as the operational limits of the sensor and the data processing capabilities of the data acquisition hub  are not exceeded.","Still referring to , each sensor ,  and  can be communicatively connected to the data acquisition hub  via an analog or digital data connection . The data acquisition hub  can be a standalone unit or integrated within the analytics server  and can be embodied as a piece of hardware, software, or some combination thereof. In one embodiment, the data connection  is a \u201chard wired\u201d physical data connection, e.g., serial, network, etc. For example, a serial or parallel cable connection between the sensor and the hub . In another embodiment, the data connection  is a wireless data connection. For example, a radio frequency (RF), BLUETOOTH\u2122, infrared or equivalent connection between the sensor and the hub .","The data acquisition hub  can be configured to communicate \u201creal-time\u201d data from the monitored system  to the analytics server  using a network connection . In one embodiment, the network connection  is a \u201chardwired\u201d physical connection. For example, the data acquisition hub  can be communicatively connected, e.g., via Category 5 (CAT5), fiber optic, or equivalent cabling, to a data server (not shown) that is communicatively connected, e.g., via CAT5, fiber optic, or equivalent cabling, through the Internet and to the analytics server  server. The analytics server  can also be communicatively connected with the Internet, e.g., via CAT5, fiber optic, or equivalent cabling. In another embodiment, the network connection  can be a wireless network connection, e.g., Wi-Fi, WLAN, etc. For example, utilizing an 802.11b\/g or equivalent transmission format. In practice, the network connection used is dependent upon the particular requirements of the monitored system .","Data acquisition hub  can also be configured to supply warning and alarms signals as well as control signals to monitored system  and\/or sensors , , and  as described in more detail below.","As shown in , in one embodiment, the analytics server  can host an analytics engine , virtual system modeling engine , and several databases , , and . The virtual system modeling engine  can, e.g., be a computer modeling system, such as described above. In this context, however, the modeling engine  can be used to precisely model and mirror the actual electrical system. Analytics engine  can be configured to generate predicted data for the monitored system and analyze difference between the predicted data and the real-time data received from hub .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["116","116","102","202","104","106","108","202","102","116","204","204","116","102"]},"The real-time data from hub  can be passed to a comparison engine , which can form part of analytics engine . Comparison engine  can be configured to continuously compare the real-time data with predicted values generated by simulation engine . Based on the comparison, comparison engine  can be further configured to determine whether deviations between the real-time and the expected values exists, and if so to classify the deviation, e.g., high, marginal, low, etc. The deviation level can then be communicated to decision engine , which can also comprise part of analytics engine .","Decision engine  can be configured to look for significant deviations between the predicted values and real-time values as received from the comparison engine . If significant deviations are detected, decision engine  can also be configured to determine whether an alarm condition exists, activate the alarm and communicate the alarm to Human-Machine Interface (HMI)  for display in real-time via, e.g., thin client . Decision engine  can also be configured to perform root cause analysis for significant deviations in order to determine the interdependencies and identify the parent-child failure relationships that may be occurring. In this manner, parent alarm conditions are not drowned out by multiple children alarm conditions, allowing the user\/operator to focus on the main problem, at least at first.","Thus, in one embodiment, and alarm condition for the parent can be displayed via HMI  along with an indication that processes and equipment dependent on the parent process or equipment are also in alarm condition. This also means that server  can maintain a parent-child logical relationship between processes and equipment comprising facility . Further, the processes can be classified as critical, essential, non-essential, etc.","Decision engine  can also be configured to determine health and performance levels and indicate these levels for the various processes and equipment via HMI . All of which, when combined with the analytic capabilities of analytics engine  allows the operator to minimize the risk of catastrophic equipment failure by predicting future failures and providing prompt, informative information concerning potential\/predicted failures before they occur. Avoiding catastrophic failures reduces risk and cost, and maximizes facility performance and up time.","Simulation engine  operates on complex logical models  of facility . These models are continuously and automatically synchronized with the actual facility status based on the real-time data provided by hub . In other words, the models are updated based on current switch status, breaker status, e.g., open-closed, equipment on\/off status, etc. Thus, the models are automatically updated based on such status, which allows simulation engine to produce predicted data based on the current facility status. This in turn, allows accurate and meaningful comparisons of the real-time data to the predicted data.","Example models  that can be maintained and used by server  include power flow models used to calculate expected kW, kVAR, power factor values, etc., short circuit models used to calculate maximum and minimum available fault currents, protection models used to determine proper protection schemes and ensure selective coordination of protective devices, power quality models used to determine voltage and current distortions at any point in the network, to name just a few. It will be understood that different models can be used depending on the system being modeled.","In certain embodiments, hub  is configured to supply equipment identification associated with the real-time data. This identification can be cross referenced with identifications provided in the models.","In one embodiment, if the comparison performed by comparison engine  indicates that the differential between the real-time sensor output value and the expected value exceeds a Defined Difference Tolerance (DDT) value, i.e., the \u201creal-time\u201d output values of the sensor output do not indicate an alarm condition, but below an alarm condition, i.e., alarm threshold value, a calibration request is generated by the analytics engine . If the differential exceeds the alarm condition, an alarm or notification message can be generated by the analytics engine . If the differential is below the DTT value, the analytics engine can do nothing and continues to monitor the real-time data and expected data.","In one embodiment, the alarm or notification message can be sent directly to the client or user) , e.g., via HMI , for display in real-time on a web browser, pop-up message box, e-mail, or equivalent on the client  display panel. In another embodiment, the alarm or notification message can be sent to a wireless mobile device, e.g., BLACKBERRY\u2122, laptop, pager, etc., to be displayed for the user by way of a wireless router or equivalent device interfaced with the analytics server . In still another embodiment, the alarm or notification message can be sent to both the client  display and the wireless mobile device. The alarm can be indicative of a need for a repair event or maintenance to be done on the monitored system. It should be noted, however, that calibration requests should not be allowed if an alarm condition exists to prevent the models from being calibrated to an abnormal state.","Once the calibration is generated by the analytics engine , the various operating parameters or conditions of model(s)  can be updated or adjusted to reflect the actual facility configuration. This can include, but is not limited to, modifying the predicted data output from the simulation engine , adjusting the logic\/processing parameters used by the model(s) , adding\/subtracting functional elements from model(s) , etc. It should be understood that any operational parameter used by models  can be modified as long as the resulting modifications can be processed and registered by simulation engine .","Referring back to , models  can be stored in the virtual system model database . As noted, a variety of conventional virtual model applications can be used for creating a virtual system model, so that a wide variety of systems and system parameters can be modeled. For example, in the context of an electrical power distribution system, the virtual system model can include components for modeling reliability, modeling voltage stability, and modeling power flow. In addition, models  can include dynamic control logic that permits a user to configure the models  by specifying control algorithms and logic blocks in addition to combinations and interconnections of generators, governors, relays, breakers, transmission line, and the like. The voltage stability parameters can indicate capacity in terms of size, supply, and distribution, and can indicate availability in terms of remaining capacity of the presently configured system. The power flow model can specify voltage, frequency, and power factor, thus representing the \u201chealth\u201d of the system.","All of models  can be referred to as a virtual system model. Thus, a virtual system model database  can be configured to store the virtual system model. A duplicate, but synchronized copy of the virtual system model can be stored in a virtual simulation model database . This duplicate model can be used for what-if simulations. In other words, this model can be used to allow a system designer to make hypothetical changes to the facility and test the resulting effect, without taking down the facility or costly and time consuming analysis. Such hypothetical can be used to learn failure patterns and signatures as well as to test proposed modifications, upgrades, additions, etc., for the facility. The real-time data, as well as trending produced by analytics engine  can be stored in a real-time data acquisition database .","As discussed above, the virtual system model is periodically calibrated and synchronized with \u201creal-time\u201d sensor data outputs so that the virtual system model provides data output values that are consistent with the actual \u201creal-time\u201d values received from the sensor output signals. Unlike conventional systems that use virtual system models primarily for system design and implementation purposes, i.e., offline simulation and facility planning, the virtual system models described herein are updated and calibrated with the real-time system operational data to provide better predictive output values. A divergence between the real-time sensor output values and the predicted output values generate either an alarm condition for the values in question and\/or a calibration request that is sent to the calibration engine .","Continuing with , the analytics engine  can be configured to implement pattern\/sequence recognition into a real-time decision loop that, e.g., is enabled by a new type of machine learning called associative memory, or hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), which is a biological approach to learning and pattern recognition. Associative memory allows storage, discovery, and retrieval of learned associations between extremely large numbers of attributes in real time. At a basic level, an associative memory stores information about how attributes and their respective features occur together. The predictive power of the associative memory technology comes from its ability to interpret and analyze these co-occurrences and to produce various metrics. Associative memory is built through \u201cexperiential\u201d learning in which each newly observed state is accumulated in the associative memory as a basis for interpreting future events. Thus, by observing normal system operation over time, and the normal predicted system operation over time, the associative memory is able to learn normal patterns as a basis for identifying non-normal behavior and appropriate responses, and to associate patterns with particular outcomes, contexts or responses. The analytics engine  is also better able to understand component mean time to failure rates through observation and system availability characteristics. This technology in combination with the virtual system model can be characterized as a \u201cneocortical\u201d model of the system under management","This approach also presents a novel way to digest and comprehend alarms in a manageable and coherent way. The neocortical model could assist in uncovering the patterns and sequencing of alarms to help pinpoint the location of the (impending) failure, its context, and even the cause. Typically, responding to the alarms is done manually by experts who have gained familiarity with the system through years of experience. However, at times, the amount of information is so great that an individual cannot respond fast enough or does not have the necessary expertise. An \u201cintelligent\u201d system like the neocortical system that observes and recommends possible responses could improve the alarm management process by either supporting the existing operator, or even managing the system autonomously.","Current simulation approaches for maintaining transient stability involve traditional numerical techniques and typically do not test all possible scenarios. The problem is further complicated as the numbers of components and pathways increase. Through the application of the neocortical model, by observing simulations of circuits, and by comparing them to actual system responses, it may be possible to improve the simulation process, thereby improving the overall design of future circuits.","The virtual system model database , as well as databases  and , can be configured to store one or more virtual system models, virtual simulation models, and real-time data values, each customized to a particular system being monitored by the analytics server . Thus, the analytics server  can be used to monitor more than one system at a time. As depicted herein, the databases , , and  can be hosted on the analytics server  and communicatively interfaced with the analytics engine . In other embodiments, databases , , and  can be hosted on a separate database server (not shown) that is communicatively connected to the analytics server  in a manner that allows the virtual system modeling engine  and analytics engine  to access the databases as needed.","Therefore, in one embodiment, the client  can modify the virtual system model stored on the virtual system model database  by using a virtual system model development interface using well-known modeling tools that are separate from the other network interfaces. For example, dedicated software applications that run in conjunction with the network interface to allow a client  to create or modify the virtual system models.","The client  can use a variety of network interfaces, e.g., web browser, CITRIX\u2122, WINDOWS TERMINAL SERVICES\u2122, telnet, or other equivalent thin-client terminal applications, etc., to access, configure, and modify the sensors, e.g., configuration files, etc., analytics engine , e.g., configuration files, analytics logic, etc., calibration parameters, e.g., configuration files, calibration parameters, etc., virtual system modeling engine , e.g., configuration files, simulation parameters, etc., and virtual system model of the system under management, e.g., virtual system model operating parameters and configuration files. Correspondingly, data from those various components of the monitored system  can be displayed on a client  display panel for viewing by a system administrator or equivalent.","As described above, server  is configured to synchronize the physical world with the virtual and report, e.g., via visual, real-time display, deviations between the two as well as system health, alarm conditions, predicted failures, etc. This is illustrated with the aid of , in which the synchronization of the physical world (left side) and virtual world (right side) is illustrated. In the physical world, sensors  produce real-time data  for the processes  and equipment  that make up facility . In the virtual world, simulations  of the virtual system model  provide predicted values , which are correlated and synchronized with the real-time data . The real-time data can then be compared to the predicted values so that differences  can be detected. The significance of these differences can be determined to determine the health status  of the system. The health stats can then be communicated to the processes  and equipment , e.g., via alarms and indicators, as well as to thin client , e.g., via web pages .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["422","414","416","418","114","414","416","418","408","410","412","402","404","406","414","408","402"]},"Each analytics server, i.e., analytics server A , analytics server B , analytics server n , can be configured to monitor the sensor output data of its corresponding monitored system and feed that data to the central analytics server . Additionally, each of the analytics servers ,  and  can function as a proxy agent of the central analytics server  during the modifying and\/or adjusting of the operating parameters of the system sensors they monitor. For example, analytics server B  can be configured as a proxy to modify the operating parameters of the sensors interfaced with monitored system B .","Moreover, the central analytics server , which is communicatively connected to one or more analytics server(s), can be used to enhance the scalability. For example, a central analytics server  can be used to monitor multiple electrical power generation facilities, i.e., monitored system A  can be a power generation facility located in city A while monitored system B  is a power generation facility located in city B, on an electrical power grid. In this example, the number of electrical power generation facilities that can be monitored by central analytics server  is limited only by the data processing capacity of the central analytics server . The central analytics server  can be configured to enable a client  to modify and adjust the operational parameters of any the analytics servers communicatively connected to the central analytics server . Furthermore, as discussed above, each of the analytics servers ,  and  can be configured to serve as proxies for the central analytics server  to enable a client  to modify and\/or adjust the operating parameters of the sensors interfaced with the systems that they respectively monitor. For example, the client  can use the central analytics server , and vice versa, to modify and\/or adjust the operating parameters of analytics server A  and use the same to modify and\/or adjust the operating parameters of the sensors interfaced with monitored system A . Additionally, each of the analytics servers can be configured to allow a client  to modify the virtual system model through a virtual system model development interface using well-known modeling tools.","In one embodiment, the central analytics server  can function to monitor and control a monitored system when its corresponding analytics server is out of operation. For example, central analytics server  can take over the functionality of analytics server B  when the server  is out of operation. That is, the central analytics server  can monitor the data output from monitored system B  and modify and\/or adjust the operating parameters of the sensors that are interfaced with the system .","In one embodiment, the network connection  is established through a wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. In another embodiment, the network connection is established through a local area network (LAN) such as the company intranet. In a separate embodiment, the network connection  is a \u201chardwired\u201d physical connection. For example, the data acquisition hub  can be communicatively connected, e.g., via Category 5 (CAT5), fiber optic, or equivalent cabling, to a data server that is communicatively connected, e.g., via CAT5, fiber optic, or equivalent cabling, through the Internet and to the analytics server  server hosting the analytics engine . In another embodiment, the network connection  is a wireless network connection, e.g., Wi-Fi, WLAN, etc. For example, utilizing an 802.11b\/g or equivalent transmission format.","In certain embodiments, regional analytics servers can be placed between local analytics servers , , . . . ,  and central analytics server . Further, in certain embodiments a disaster recovery site can be included at the central analytics server  level.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 5"],"b":["116","1"]},"The analytics server  includes a variety of components. In the example of , the analytics server  is implemented in a Web-based configuration, so that the analytics server  includes, or communicates with, a secure web server  for communication with the sensor systems , e.g., data acquisition units, metering devices, sensors, etc., and external communication entities , e.g., web browser, \u201cthin client\u201d applications, etc. A variety of user views and functions  are available to the client  such as: alarm reports, Active X controls, equipment views, view editor tool, custom user interface page, and XML parser. It should be appreciated, however, that these are just examples of a few in a long list of views and functions  that the analytics server  can deliver to the external communications entities  and are not meant to limit the types of views and functions  available to the analytics server  in any way.","The analytics server  also includes an alarm engine  and messaging engine , for the aforementioned external communications. The alarm engine  is configured to work in conjunction with the messaging engine  to generate alarm or notification messages , in the form of text messages, e-mails, paging, etc., in response to the alarm conditions previously described. The analytics server  determines alarm conditions based on output data it receives from the various sensor systems  through a communications connection, e.g., wireless , TCP\/IP , Serial , etc., and simulated output data from a virtual system model , of the monitored system, processed by the analytics engines . In one embodiment, the virtual system model  can be created by a user through interacting with an external communication entity  by specifying the components that comprise the monitored system and by specifying relationships between the components of the monitored system. In another embodiment, the virtual system model  can be automatically generated by the analytics engines  as components of the monitored system are brought online and interfaced with the analytics server .","Continuing with , a virtual system model database  can be communicatively connected with the analytics server  and can be configured to store one or more virtual system models , each of which represents a particular monitored system. For example, the analytics server  can conceivably monitor multiple electrical power generation systems, e.g., system A, system B, system C, etc., spread across a wide geographic area, e.g., City A, City B, City C, etc. Therefore, the analytics server  can use a different virtual system model  for each of the electrical power generation systems that it monitors. Virtual simulation model database  can be configured to store a synchronized, duplicate copy of the virtual system model , and real-time data acquisition database  can store the real-time and trending data for the system(s) being monitored.","Thus, in operation, analytics server  can receive real-time data for various sensors, i.e., components, through data acquisition system . As can be seen, analytics server  can comprise various drivers configured to interface with the various types of sensors, etc., comprising data acquisition system . This data represents the real-time operational data for the various components. For example, the data can indicate that a certain component is operating at a certain voltage level and drawing certain amount of current. This information can then be fed to a modeling engine to generate a virtual system model  that is based on the actual real-time operational data.","Analytics engine  can be configured to compare predicted data based on the virtual system model  with real-time data received from data acquisition system  and to identify any differences. In some instances, analytics engine can be configured to identify these differences and then update, i.e., calibrate, the virtual system model  for use in future comparisons. In this manner, more accurate comparisons and warnings can be generated.","But in other instances, the differences will indicate a failure, or the potential for a failure. For example, when a component begins to fail, the operating parameters will begin to change. This change may be sudden or it may be a progressive change over time. Analytics engine  can detect such changes and issue warnings that can allow the changes to be detected before a failure occurs. The analytic engine  can be configured to generate warnings that can be communicated via interface .","For example, a user can access information from server  using thin client . For example, reports can be generate and served to thin client  via server . These reports can, for example, comprise schematic or symbolic illustrations of the system being monitored. Status information for each component can be illustrated or communicated for each component. This information can be numerical, i.e., the voltage or current level, or it can be symbolic, i.e., green for normal, red for failure or warning. In certain embodiments, intermediate levels of failure can also be communicated, i.e., yellow can be used to indicate operational conditions that project the potential for future failure. It should be noted that this information can be accessed in real-time.

The HTM engine  can be configured to work in conjunction with the analytics engine  and a virtual system model of the monitored system to make real-time predictions, i.e., forecasts, about various operational aspects of the monitored system. The HTM engine  works by processing and storing patterns observed during the normal operation of the monitored system over time. These observations are provided in the form of real-time data captured using a multitude of sensors that are imbedded within the monitored system. In one embodiment, the virtual system model can also be updated with the real-time data such that the virtual system model \u201cages\u201d along with the monitored system. Examples of a monitored system can include machinery, factories, electrical systems, processing plants, devices, chemical processes, biological systems, data centers, aircraft carriers, and the like.

This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the simulated data output from the virtual system model, adjusting the logic\/processing parameters utilized by the virtual system modeling engine to simulate the operation of the monitored system, adding\/subtracting functional elements of the virtual system model, etc. It should be understood, that any operational parameter of the virtual system modeling engine and\/or the virtual system model may be modified by the calibration engine as long as the resulting modifications can be processed and registered by the virtual system modeling engine.","Method  proceeds on to operation  where the simulated real-time data indicative of the monitored system status is compared with a corresponding virtual system model created at the design stage. The design stage models, which may be calibrated and updated based on real-time monitored data, are used as a basis for the predicted performance of the system. The real-time monitored data can then provide the actual performance over time. By comparing the real-time time data with the predicted performance information, difference can be identified a tracked by, e.g., the analytics engine . Analytics engines  can then track trends, determine alarm states, etc., and generate a real-time report of the system status in response to the comparison.","In other words, the analytics can be used to analyze the comparison and real-time data and determine if there is a problem that should be reported and what level the problem may be, e.g., low priority, high priority, critical, etc. The analytics can also be used to predict future failures and time to failure, etc. In one embodiment, reports can be displayed on a conventional web browser (e.g. INTERNET EXPLORER\u2122, FIREFOX\u2122, NETSCAPE\u2122, etc., which can be rendered on a standard personal computing (PC) device.

In one embodiment, the data is converted from an analog signal to a digital signal. In another embodiment, the data is converted from a digital signal to an analog signal. It should be understood, however, that the real-time data may be processed into any defined format as long as the analytics engine can utilize the resulting data in a comparison with simulated output data from a virtual system model of the monitored system.","Method  continues on to operation  where the predicted, i.e., simulated, data for the monitored system is generated using a virtual system model of the monitored system. As discussed above, a virtual system modeling engine uses dynamic control logic stored in the virtual system model to generate the predicted output data.

In one embodiment, if the differential exceeds, the alarm condition, an alarm or notification message is generated by the analytics engine . In another embodiment, if the differential is below the DTT value, the analytics engine does nothing and continues to monitor the \u201creal-time\u201d data and \u201cvirtual\u201d data.

In one embodiment, the values are in units of electrical power output, i.e., current or voltage, from an electrical power generation or transmission system.

This means that the logic parameters of the virtual system model that a virtual system modeling engine uses to simulate the data output from actual sensors interfaced with the monitored system are adjusted so that the difference between the real-time data output and the simulated data output is minimized. Correspondingly, this operation will update and adjust any virtual system model output parameters that are functions of the virtual system model sensor values. For example, in a power distribution environment, output parameters of power load or demand factor might be a function of multiple sensor data values. The operating parameters of the virtual system model that mimic the operation of the sensor will be adjusted to reflect the real-time data received from those sensors. In one embodiment, authorization from a system administrator is requested prior to the operating parameters of the virtual system model being adjusted. This is to ensure that the system administrator is aware of the changes that are being made to the virtual system model. In one embodiment, after the completion of all the various calibration operations, a report is generated to provide a summary of all the adjustments that have been made to the virtual system model.","As described above, virtual system modeling engine  can be configured to model various aspects of the system to produce predicted values for the operation of various components within monitored system .

The calibration instruction can cause a calibration engine  to update the virtual model being used by system modeling engine  to reflect the new operating information.","It will be understood that as monitored system  ages, or more specifically the components comprising monitored system  age, then the operating parameters, e.g., currents and voltages associated with those components will also change.

For example, as mentioned, it is important to be able to assess the real-time ability of the power system to provide sufficient generation to satisfy the system load requirements and to move the generated energy through the system to the load points. Conventional systems do not make use of an on-line, real-time system snap shot captured by a real-time data acquisition platform to perform real time system availability evaluation.","It should also be noted that National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) have mandated that facilities comply with proper workplace safety standards and conduct Arc Flash studies in order to determine the incident energy, protection boundaries and personal protective equipment (PPE) levels required to be worn by technicians. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for performing such studies do not provide a reliable means for the real-time prediction of the potential energy released (in calories per centimeter squared) for an Arc Flash event, protection boundaries, or the PPE level required to safely perform repairs as required by NFPA 70E and Institute of Electrical and Electrics Engineers (IEEE) 1584.","When a fault in the system being monitored contains an arc, the heat released can damage equipment and cause personal injury. It is the latter concern that brought about the development of the heat exposure programs, i.e., NFPA 70E, IEEE 1584, referred to above. The power dissipated in the arc radiates to the surrounding surfaces. The further away from the arc the surface is, the less the energy is received per unit area.","As noted previously, conventional approaches are based on highly specialized static simulation models that are rigid and non-reflective of the facility's operational status at the time that a technician may be needed to conduct repairs on the electrical equipment. For example, static systems cannot adjust to the many daily changes to the electrical system that occur at a facility, e.g., motors and pumps may be on or off, on-site generation status may have changed by having diesel generators on-line, utility electrical feed may also change, etc., nor can they age with the facility. That is, the incident energy released is affected by the actual operational status of the facility and alignment of the power distribution system at the time that the repairs are performed. Therefore, a static model cannot provide the real-time analysis that can be critical for accurate safe protection boundary or PPE level determination.","Moreover, existing systems rely on exhaustive studies to be performed off-line by a power system engineer or a design professional\/specialist. Often the specialist must manually modify a simulation model so that it is reflective of the proposed facility operating condition and then conduct a static simulation or a series of static simulations in order to come up with incident energy estimates for determining safe working distances and required PPE levels. Such a process is not timely, efficient, and\/or accurate. Plus, the process can be quite costly.","Using the systems and methods described herein, a logical model of a facility electrical system can be integrated into a real-time environment with a robust arc flash simulation engine, a data acquisition system (data acquisition hub), and an automatic feedback system (analytics engine) that continuously synchronizes and calibrates the logical model to the actual operational conditions of the electrical system. The ability to re-align the logical model in real-time so that it mirrors the real facility operating conditions, coupled with the ability to calibrate and age the model as the real facility ages, as describe above, provides a desirable approach to predicting PPE levels, and safe working conditions at the exact time the repairs are intended to be performed.

This study determines the operational settings of that protective device and sends that information to the Arc Flash engine for use in the subsequent Arc Flash event simulation and incident energy calculations. In step , the Arc Flash engine calculates two different arcing current values, a 100% arcing current value and an 85% arcing current value, for the system using the bolted fault current value supplied by the short circuit study and the system voltage value supplied by the virtual system model simulation. This is to account for fluctuations in system voltage values that normally occur during the day to day operation of the electrical system. To account for the fluctuations two arcing current and incident energy calculations are made; one using the calculated expected arc current, i.e., 100% arcing current, and one using a reduced arc current that is 15% lower, i.e., 85% arcing current, to account for when the system operates at less than 1 kilovolts (kV).

The calculated incident arc energy level value is then used by the Arc Flash simulation engine to make predictions about certain aspects of the Arc Flash event.

Conventional calculation of Arc Flash energy and corresponding PPE as defined in both NFPA-70E, IEEE-1584 is based on calculation of both the arcing current and tripping time. In general, higher arcing current corresponds to higher energy; however, due to the nonlinear relationship between the arcing current and tripping time, it is possible that low arcing current can cause high tripping time and yield the higher Arc Flash energy. Therefore, conventional Arc Flash determinations are performed off-line and are based on the evaluation of several scenarios and calculation of the highest and lowest short-circuit, and arcing current, and then selecting the scenario that yields the highest Arcing Energy.
