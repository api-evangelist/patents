title: Method and apparatus for managing the provisioning of client devices connected to an interactive TV network
abstract: The present invention is directed to a system and method for managing the provisioning of an client device connected to a service distribution network, such as an interactive television service-providing network. Provisioning is managed by a provisioning manager that knows the specific provisioning data to collect and where the data is located and is to be forwarded. The provisioning manager thus acts as an intelligent provisioning data traffic manager by performing as a central collection and dissemination point for the provisioning data and directing provisioning data flows between a billing system, IP data network, server complex and/or other network systems.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","The ITV Network","The ITV Provisioning Manager","The Provisioning Process"],"p":["The invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for managing the provisioning of a telecommunication network and specifically to a method and apparatus for managing the provisioning of an interactive television (ITV) network and the associated ITV client devices connected thereto.","Implementation and operation of a communications service, whether it be a voice, video or data communications service, requires the interconnection of a plurality of networks, systems, devices and equipment, which may be geographically co-located or separated. Presently, each of these networks, systems, devices and equipment may need to be \u201cprovisioned\u201d to enable the establishment of a communications connection path. In general, \u201cprovisioning\u201d is the addition of a subscriber (e.g., a subscriber terminal device and\/or network component) to, deletion of a subscriber from, or modification of a subscriber's services provided by a network, system, or other type of infrastructure providing entitled services. Provisioning permits the pertinent architecture to recognize and\/or communicate with the subscriber.","Some form of provisioning is necessary, whether the communications connection path connects a plurality of subscriber terminal devices (e.g., telephones, televisions, streaming media players, set-top box audio\/video decoders, wireless device base station, etc.), as in a telephone, data or audio or video distribution network, or whether the path connects one or more subscriber terminal devices (e.g., work stations, personal computers, PDA, etc.) with one or more servers, as in a client-server computing network. In many operational situations, each of the interconnected plurality of networks, systems, devices and equipment may need to be provisioned independently and separately (either manually with human intervention or automatically), thereby resulting in potential time delays, inefficiencies, or errors in enabling the subscriber terminal to connect to and use the communications network services.","As a type of communications network, an interactive television (ITV) network and subscriber terminal devices connected thereto must be \u201cprovisioned\u201d to enable the subscriber terminal devices to use ITV services via the ITV network. Subscriber terminal devices, which are ITV client devices connected to the ITV network, may include television sets, set-top audio\/video decoder boxes, personal computers, and video recorders, among other video, audio and data devices. The convergence of television transmission networks, IP (i.e., Internet Protocol) data networks, and distributed client-server computing networks to implement an operational ITV network necessitates the interconnection of a plurality of networks, systems, devices and equipment, which may be geographically co-located or separated, as components of the ITV network as a whole. Presently, each of these component interconnected networks, systems, devices and equipment must be independently and separately \u201cprovisioned\u201d to enable the establishment of a communications connection path and the use of the ITV network by an ITV client device (i.e. subscriber terminal) for entitled ITV services.","Accordingly, there exists a need for a method and apparatus for commonly (i.e. as a whole) managing the automatic provisioning of all of these interconnected component networks, systems, devices and equipment comprising the entire ITV network.","The present invention provides a client-network provisioning manager for managing the provisioning of a telecommunication service network and a plurality of client devices connected to the network for using the telecommunication services. The teachings of the present invention are applicable to a broad variety of subscriber telecommunication services and\/or pay-for-use services, including interactive television, cable television, telephone, video, audio, on-line databases, noninteractive television, radio, music video, videojuke box, pay-for-view, video-on-demand, home-shopping, video conferences, telephone conferences, interfacing to imaging systems, automatic telephone call charge-backs (\u201c900\u201d numbers) and other telecommunication services. The teachings are also applicable to a variety of telecommunication systems, including multi-channel telecommunication services, single channel multi-service telecommunications, and single channel single service telecommunications. As will be appreciated from the foregoing, the user may be a subscriber or nonsubscriber.","The provisioning manager of the present invention communicates with the individual provisioning methods\/apparatus of each of the network components for the purpose of effectuating the overall provisioning of the client devices with all of the necessary network components in a coordinated, common (i.e., as a whole), and automated manner. By knowing the specific provisioning data to collect, where the data is found and is to be forwarded, the provisioning manager acts as an intelligent provisioning data manager by performing as a central collection and dissemination point for the provisioning data, directing provisioning data flows between the provisioning methods\/apparatus of the individual network components. As such a central point, the provisioning manager makes the automatic provisioning process more efficient. In one configuration the provisioning manager insures that dependent transactions (of each request\/response transaction which are typically handled independently) are made in the correct sequence. For example, a \u201cuser-add\u201d request is not issued until the related \u201csubscriber-add\u201d request has completed successfully.","Although the present invention is described as a central collection and dissemination point, the methods and apparatus described may be implemented as an independent unit coupled to the network, or may be distributed throughout the network.","The provisioning manager includes a user interface for use by customer support representative personnel, as well as application programming interfaces (\u201cAPI(s)\u201d), protocol and signal interfaces to the individual provisioning methods\/apparatus of the respective network components. The type of information managed by the provisioning manager includes, but is not limited to, data related to: IP provisioning of the client device for IP communication with the network; centralized provisioning from controlled data centers; support for self-provisioning of capabilities delivered to the client device; subscribers' services enrollment and entitlement; installation of the client device; and the provisioning process flow.","Message communications transactions between the provisioning manager and the provisioning systems of the other network components, e.g., the billing system, the various servers, the IP data network, and such other network components forming the ITV network, are conducted via appropriate protocol and signal interfaces and APIs defined for each respective network component provisioning system. The message communications transactions are stored in a provisioning manager database.","The teachings of the present invention are particularly applicable to an interactive television (ITV) network having an ITV provisioning manager. The ITV network comprises a plurality of component interconnected networks, systems, devices and equipment. The component interconnected networks, systems, devices and equipment (the \u201cITV network component(s)\u201d) include, but are not limited to, analog or digital television transmission networks, IP (i.e. internet protocol) data networks, distributed client-server computer networks, subscriber management billing systems, and one or more ITV client devices, which may be geographically co-located or separated. ITV client devices include, but are not limited to, set-top video\/audio converter decoder boxes, television receivers, video\/audio recorders or players, data modems and computers which can process video, audio or data signals for transmission, storage, visual display or sound emission.","In one configuration, operators\/providers of the ITV services are different business entities separate, distinct and independent from each of the ITV network component operators\/providers.","In one configuration, one or more of the ITV network components has its own independent, respective provisioning methods or apparatus particular to that component's function in the ITV network. Such methods or apparatus may represent only a fractional part of the overall provisioning functions necessary to provision the ITV client devices and\/or the ITV network as a whole.","In one configuration, a method of managing the provisioning of interactive client devices includes the steps of:","(a) receiving from the billing system (subscriber management system) a registration code number and associated billing system identification data relating to the subscriber (e.g., ITV client device), the registration code number being associated with billing system identification data identifying the subscriber, the billing system identification data describing the billing information and services preferences of the subscriber;","(b) storing the registration code number and associated billing system identification data in a provisioning management database;","(c) retrieving the billing system identification data in the provisioning management database; and","(d) communicating the billing system identification data to the provisioning system of an IP data network.","In another configuration, the method includes the steps of:","(a) receiving from a first ITV network component service information relating to the subscriber, the service information identifying the subscriber and describing at least one service preference of the subscriber;","(b) determining which of a plurality of other ITV network components are to receive at least some of the service information;","(c) communicating the at least some of the service information to a second ITV network component, the second ITV network component being different from the first ITV network component and providing a service requested by the subscriber;","(d) receiving from the second ITV network component service providing information, the service providing information enabling the subscriber to access the service provided by the second ITV component; and","(e) providing the service providing information to the subscriber. The above-described operation is exemplary, and the individual provisioning and intercommunication of messages between the provisioning manager and the other network components may be conducted in alternative orders of occurrence without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, the above description of configurations and\/or embodiments of the present invention is neither exhaustive nor limiting. As will be appreciated, the features of the present invention can be combined in a variety of other ways, which are within the spirit and scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"The ITV Provisioning Manager , via one or more communications link(s) , interconnects and communicates with ITV Network Components including, but not limited to, at least one IP provisioning system , at least one subscriber management billing system , at least one service server infrastructure , customer service center , head end in the sky or HITS , one or more head ends , and network operations , and other required additional ITV Network Components (not shown) comprising the ITV Network .","Each of the service server infrastructures includes or is connected to a plurality of application, content, and\/or control servers. The servers provide or control the provision of selected services to a subscriber. Examples of such servers include an e-mail server  to send and receive e-mail, an address book server  to enter and retrieve address information from the subscriber's personal records, a calendar server  to enter and retrieve calendar or scheduling information from the subscriber's calendaring records, a search server  to perform network-related searches, a registration server  to register new subscribers in the corresponding server infrastructure, a web server  to provide connection to the internet , and other servers  providing any number of other services (e.g., a home page server, chat server, and messaging server).","The service server infrastructures are each assigned to serve a number of subscribers having selected common attributes. In one configuration, the service server infrastructures each serve subscribers from a unique geographical area.","Each of the head ends is connected to a distribution network including various feeders  and branches  and connections to subscriber locations or nodes . At each subscriber location or node , an ITV client device (not shown) is located.","As will be appreciated, an ITV client device can access a number of services. For example, the subscriber can access programming material for the subscriber's television. The material is transmitted by the HITS  via satellite  to a head end and via feeder  and branch  to the subscriber's client device. The subscriber can also access any of the services provided by the service server infrastructure. The services are accessed via branch , feeder , and link .","The numbering of ITV Components - is not intended to be a limitation on the number of additional ITV Components comprising the ITV Network ; and the preferred embodiment of the present invention contemplates any number of ITV Network Components comprising the ITV Network .","Link(s) , feeder(s)  and branch(es)  may include any combination of one or more wired or wireless, electrical or optical connections or telecommunications data networks, whether packet or circuit switched, global, national, regional, wide-area, local area, or in-home networks, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Similarly, the IP provisioning system can provision any IP data network that may be implemented on any combination of one or more wired or wireless, electrical or optical connections or telecommunications data networks, whether packet or circuit switched, global, national, regional, wide-area, local area, or in-home networks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["104","104","204","207","208","212","216","220","224","122","104","228","206","212","216","220","224","110","118","114","122","104","204","212","216","220","224","228","100","100","104","166","104","130","126","118","114","122"]},"The controller  stores provisioning message communications transactions in one or more database(s) contained in data storage . Data storage  may include semiconductor memory, as well as magnetic, electrical or optical mass storage devices or combinations thereof, without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.","The one or more provisioning message interface(s) , , , and  may be implemented using proprietary protocols specially developed for the present invention, or industry-standard protocols widely known in the art, including, but not limited, to any combinations of XML (i.e., extended mark-up language), LDAP (i.e., Light-Weight Directory Protocol), SQL (i.e. Structured Query Language), WTVP (ie., Web TV Protocol), HTTP (i.e., hypertext transport protocol), HTML (i.e., hypertext markup language), DLLs (i.e., dynamic link libraries), ODBC (i.e., Open Database Connectivity), RDBMS (i.e., remote data base management system), RDO (i.e., Remote Data Objects), ADO (ie., Active-X Data Objects), and COBRA (i.e. Common Object Resource Broker Architecture).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIGS. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIGS. 3-5"],"b":["228","2","4","5"]},"Referring again to , the controller memory  includes one or more queues  containing one or more transactions . If the ITV provisioning manager  determines that an ITV network component is unavailable during the provisioning process, the manager  will suspend or queue the transactions(s) for transmission at a later time. Likewise if the ITV provisioning manager  is unavailable, otherITV network components will queue the transactions for transmission at a later time.","In operation, the controller  communicates through the message interface(s), via the communications link(s) , with an ITV Network Component -, data messages containing provisioning-related information including, but not limited to, customer order registration code(s), ITV client device unit address(es), IP address(es), medium access control or MAC address(es), billing system identification number(s), server registration assignment(s), and the like.","Referring to , the provisioning process is initiated at box . The typical event leading to the provisioning of a new subscriber is a customer calling the ITV operator's support center to initiate a new service to a household. The process is also applicable to a current subscriber requesting a second set-top box installation or a conversion from an older set-top box to a newer set-top box. For a new subscriber, a customer support representative (\u201cCSR\u201d) and the customer determine in box  the ITV services and\/or service package that the customer desires. The CSR verifies that the services and\/or service package are available at the customer's location. The customer identification (name, address, etc.) and selected services or package (e.g., video, audio, and\/or data services) are entered into the subscriber management billing system , which is an ITV network component. The customer is assigned a unique registration code (which is used on a temporary basis to initialize the set-top box), a unique subscriber key (which is used identify the customer in the database of the billing system ), an installation technician and truck are scheduled, with the registration code included on an installation work order, or, in some circumstances, the customer may install the ITV client device himself\/herself.","Referring to , during or after the order entry process the entered customer or subscriber information in box  is sent by the billing system  (via billing system interface ) to the ITV provisioning manager . This information includes without limitation the registration code, the subscriber key, name, home phone, business phone, the identity of the service(s) or package(s) selected, and address. As will be appreciated, services may be defined per subscriber, per user, and\/or per client device. In box  (FIG. ), the ITV provisioning manager receives the information and enters the information into data storage .","In boxes  and  (FIG. ), respectively, the ITV provisioning manager typically forwards all of the information received from the billing system  to the IP provisioning system  (via IP provisioning system interface ) and the subscriber key, customer name, zip code, and headend code to the central initial registration routing server  (via service delivery infrastructure interface ). As noted, a plurality of service server infrastructures are typically connected to the network, and, in box  () the initial registration routing server  receives the subscriber information and in box  () assigns the appropriate infrastructure to the customer. In box  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system receives and records the subscriber information. The ITV provisioning manager may communicate messages relating to provisioning, registration, and billing system identification to the respective provisioning systems of as many ITV network components as are necessary to comprise the ITV network, storing the messages and\/or other details of each such communication transaction in the ITV provisioning manager data storage .","In box  (FIG. ), the initial registration routing server  responds by sending (via interface ) a message(s) indicating to which service server infrastructure  the customer is assigned and a unique subscriber id for purposes of identifying the customer in the infrastructure . In boxes  and  (FIG. ), the information is received from the server  and entered into data storage . Although not shown in the flow chart, other network components, such as the IP provisioning system , could provide similar provisioning, registration, and\/or billing system information to the ITV provisioning manager  in response to message(s) received from the provisioning manager . In that event, the manager  would enter such information into data storage .","In box  () after the ITV client device, which is a set-top box in this application, is installed by the installation technician or customer, the ITV client device identification number (e.g. a unit address) is called in via telephone to the CSR. In box  (FIG. ), the CSR enters the device identification or serial number into the billing system, which binds the set-top box to the customer account. In box  (FIG. ), the billing system  communicates a \u201cservices turn-on\u201d message to HITS , thereby turning on the TV services that the customer has selected. HITS  relays the message via feeder  and branch  to the appropriate head end  connected to the set-top box.","In box  (FIG. ), the billing system  may also send a message confirming this turn-on message to the ITV Provisioning Manager , which receives the messege in box  () and stores this transaction in data storage  in box  (FIG. ). This message confirms that the set-top box is assigned to the specific customer.","In boxes  and  (FIG. ), the head end  and IP provisioning system , respectively, establish MAC (medium access control) layer and IP (internet protocol) layer connectivity with the set-top box, assigning the set-top box modem a temporary IP address.","Regarding the establishment of MAC layer connectivity, the standard procedure for establishing MAC layer connectivity with the head end  is set forth in DOCSIS specification SP-RFI-105-991105 and will only be briefly discussed in this application. As will be appreciated, MAC layer connectivity is established by scanning for a downstream channel and establishing Quadrature Amplitude Modulated (\u201cQAM\u201d)\/packet synchronization with the respective head end , obtaining upstream channel transmission parameters, and performing upstream ranging.","Likewise, the standard procedure for establishing IP layer connectivity with the IP provisioning system  is set forth in DHCP specifications (RFC-2131) and will only be briefly discussed in this application. As will be appreciated, the set-top box modem broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet (which contains the set-top model identification and the set-top unit address) to a server (not shown) in IP provisioning system , the server responds by granting the set-top box modem a temporary IP address that is routable only to an IP provisioning system server and providing the set-top box modem with the IP address of the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (\u201cTFTP\u201d) server (in the IP provisioning system ), the IP address of the Time-of-Day (\u201cTOD\u201d) server (in the IP provisioning system ), and the IP address of the system log (\u201cSYSLOG\u201d) server (in the IP provisioning system ).","In box  (FIG. ), the set-top box modem is placed in the \u201cUnprovisioned Modem\u201d state.","In box  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system  system database (not shown) is updated with the DHCP package including the MAC address, the set-top unit address (which is an electronic identifier that is different from the unit's serial number which was previously provided to the ITV provisioning manager ), and the assigned private IP address of the modem.","In box  (FIG. ), the modem contacts the TOD server to obtain the current date and time (for time stamping purposes) and the TFTP server to download a file containing configuration parameters (which includes class of service configuration settings, baseline privacy settings, software upgrade file name(s), modem description of capabilities, and message integrity checks (e.g., checksums)), registers with the head end , and initializes baseline privacy.","In boxes  and  (FIG. ), the head end  and IP provisioning system , respectively, establish MAC (medium access control) layer and IP (internet protocol) layer connectivity with the customer's computer, assigning the computer a temporary IP address. As will be appreciated, the customer's computer may also be connected to the ITV network. Because the set-top box computer function is a separate computational component from the modem, the same steps set forth above in boxes  and  () are followed to establish MAC and IP layer connectivity with the set-top box computer function. In other words, the standard procedures for establishing MAC layer connectivity with the head end  as set forth in DOCSIS specification SP-RFI-105-991105 and for establishing IP layer connectivity with the IP provisioning system  as set forth in DHCP specifications (RFC-2131) are followed by the network. As a result of this procedure, the set-top box computer function in box  () will be placed in an \u201cUnprovisioned Consumer Premises Equipment\u201d state and assigned a temporary IP address.","In box  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system updates its database accordingly.","In box  (FIG. ), the set-top box computer function obtains initialization information in the same manner as the modem in box  (FIG. ). At this point, fill set-top box IP connectivity is achieved, but the set-top box is only routable to a server of the IP provisioning system . In box  (FIG. ), the connectivity-related information provided to the IP provisioning system  in boxes - is entered into the system's database.","The technician will thereafter initiate a browser session. The first-time universal resource locator (\u201cURL\u201d) is configured to go to the initial registration routing server . However, the IP provisioning system  will route\/resolve all IP requests to the IP provisioning system registration page. The service technician\/customer is present with a login\/registration page. In box  (FIG. ), the technician\/customer enters the temporary registration code from the work order. In decision diamond  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system determines if the correct registration code is entered. If so, the set-top box is provisioned in box . In box  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system will provision ITV network components (e.g., servers, head end , and routers(not shown)) and updates its database to reflect that the box is provisioned.","If an incorrect temporary registration code is entered, the IP provisioning system  provides the technician\/customer with a new login\/registration page requesting reentry of the code. The IP provisioning system  repeats box  and decision diamond  upon receipt of a reentered code.","In boxes  and  (FIG. ), the network assigns a separate, permanent IP address to the set-top box modem and computer functions, respectively and updates its database in box  (FIG. ). The procedure followed by the network to assign the permanent IP addresses to these components is set forth in Simple Network Management Protocol (\u201cSNMP\u201d) standard protocol. Briefly, an SNMP command causes the DOCSIS channel to reset. A server in the IP provisioning system  issues the set-top box computational component (modem or computer) a permanent IP address. The computational component is then placed in the Provisioned State (known as the \u201cProvisioned Modem State\u201d for the modem and the \u201cProvisioned Consumer Premises Equipment State\u201d for the computer function). The IP provisioning system's database is updated with DHCP information (including the permanent IP addresses assigned to the computational components). At this point, the customer is online with a permanent IP address.","In box  (FIG. ), the IP provisioning system  generates a device notification transaction to the ITV provisioning manager  that links the set-top box unit address, and the IP and MAC addresses of the set-top box and computer to the subscriber key of the billing system .","In box  (FIG. ), the device notification transaction is received by the ITV provisioning manager . In response, the ITV provisioning manager  in box  () generates a device notification transaction providing this information (e.g., the subscriber key, unit address, MAC addresses, and IP addresses) to the billing system  and in box  () a device notification transaction providing some of this information (e.g., subscriber key, unit address, MAC addresses) to the corresponding service server infrastructure  assigned to the customer.","The billing system in box  receives the device notification transaction and in box  enters the transaction into the billing system database. The registration server  in box  receives the notification transaction and in box  assigns a unique device identifier to the set-top box and provides the identifier and unit address to the ITV manager. Through communication with the registration server , the initial registration routing server  will now be aware of the installed set-top box.","The manager in box  () receives the unique device identifier assigned to the set-top box by the registration server  in the infrastructure and unit address (discussed supra). In box  (FIG. ), the presence of the ITV client device on the ITV network and its associated information (e.g., subscriber key, unit address, MAC addresses, IP addresses, and device identifier) is stored in the ITV Provisioning Manager data storage .","In box , () the set-top box is authorized within the service server infrastructure environment. Upon initial connection to the network (after the completion of the foregoing steps), the set-top box will connect directly with the initial registration routing server . The set-top box will be configured to the assigned service server infrastructure  and given a registration server universal resource locator (\u201cURL\u201d) for the registration server  located within the assigned infrastructure.","In box  (FIG. ), the subscriber registers with the registration server  of the assigned infrastructure . Typically, this is done by providing the customer with one or more subscription screens containing user account set-up and login information. For example, the customer will select and\/or set up an email address, calendar, address book, and other features for each user account to be created. In response, the provisioning system (not shown) of the infrastructure  will set-up and provision the required user accounts for each of the selected services.","In box  (FIG. ), the provisioning system of the infrastructure  provides, for each user, this account information, e.g., subscriber key, service group identification, user identification, e-mail set-up information (i.e., login and password information), etc., to the ITV provisioning manager . As noted, each user in a given household will typically have the same subscriber key and service group identification but different user-specific information, such as user identification and e-mail set-up information.","In box  (FIG. ), the ITV provisioning manager  receives the registration information and in box  forwards certain of the information, e.g., subscriber key, e-mail login, and e-mail password for each user account, to the billing system .","In box  (FIG. ), the billing system  receives the registration information and in box  creates appropriate data structures and enters this information into the billing system's database (not shown). The billing system , for example, creates a unique billing identifier for each user that is different from the user identification provided by the infrastructure . This information is used by the billing system for billing and support services.","In box  (FIG. ), this information (e.g., subscriber key, service group identification, user identification from server infrastructure , billing identifier from billing system , e-mail set-up, etc. is entered into data storage  of the ITV provisioning manager.","As will be appreciated, all message communications transactions between the ITV provisioning manager and the provisioning systems of the billing system , the IP provisioning system , the server infrastructure  and related initial registration routing server , and such other ITV network components comprising the ITV network are conducted via appropriate protocol and signal interfaces and APIs defined for each respective ITV network component provisioning system.","While this invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, preferred embodiments of the invention as set forth herein are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. By way of example, the ordering or sequence of the steps may be reversed or rearranged in an order other than that set forth above. Steps may be omitted from the provisioning process. ITV network components described above can be omitted or replaced by other ITV network components. Moreover, the teachings of the present invention are not limited to ITV networks but are extendible to any network offering good(s) or service(s) to subscribers or nonsubscribers. These and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is described in detail with regards to the following figures, in which like elements are referred to with like numerals, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIGS. 3-5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["228","2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
