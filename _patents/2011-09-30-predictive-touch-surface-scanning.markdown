{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/844,798, filed on Jul. 27, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/229,236, filed on Jul. 28, 2009, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This disclosure relates to the field of touch-sensors and, in particular, to performing measurement scans of capacitive touch-sensor arrays.","Computing devices, such as notebook computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), kiosks, and mobile handsets, have user interface devices, which are also known as human interface devices (HID). One user interface device that has become more common is a touch-sensor pad (also commonly referred to as a touchpad). A basic notebook computer touch-sensor pad emulates the function of a personal computer (PC) mouse. A touch-sensor pad is typically embedded into a PC notebook for built-in portability. A touch sensor pad replicates X\/Y movement using a collection of capacitive sensor elements, arranged along two defined axes, that detect the presence or proximity of one or more conductive objects, such as a finger. Mouse right\/left button clicks can be replicated by two mechanical or capacitive-sensed buttons, located in the vicinity of the touchpad, or by tapping commands on the touch-sensor pad itself. The touch-sensor pad provides a user interface device for performing such functions as positioning a pointer, or selecting an item on a display. These touch-sensor pads may include multi-dimensional sensor arrays for determining movement of the conductive object in multiple axes. The sensor array may include a one-dimensional sensor array, detecting movement in one axis. The sensor array may also be two dimensional, detecting movements in two axes.","Another user interface device that has become more common is a touch screen. Touch screens, also known as touchscreens, touch windows, touch panels, or touchscreen panels, are transparent display overlays which are typically either pressure-sensitive (resistive or piezoelectric), electrically-sensitive (capacitive), acoustically-sensitive (surface acoustic wave (SAW)) or photo-sensitive (infra-red). Such overlays allow a display to be used as an input device, removing the keyboard and\/or the mouse as the primary input device for interacting with the displayed image's content. Such displays can be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. Touch screens have become familiar in retail settings, on point-of-sale systems, on ATMs, on mobile handsets, on kiosks, on game consoles, and on PDAs where a stylus is sometimes used to manipulate the graphical user interface (GUI) and to enter data. A user can touch a touch screen or a touch-sensor pad to manipulate data. For example, a user can apply a single touch, by using a finger to touch the surface of a touch screen, to select an item from a menu.","The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems, components, methods, and so forth, in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in a simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the spirit and scope of the present invention.","In one embodiment, a capacitive touch-sensing surface may be used to track locations of one or more conductive objects in contact or in close proximity to the touch-sensing surface by scanning each of a number of intersections between capacitive sensor elements. In one embodiment, a touch may be detected at the touch-sensing surface when a conductive object, such as a finger, contacts or is in close proximity to the touch-sensing surface. An intersection between two sensor elements may be understood as a location at which one sensor element crosses over or overlaps another, while maintaining galvanic isolation from each other. A scan may include a series of mutual capacitance measurements between pairs of intersecting sensor elements spanning all or a portion of the touch-sensing surface. An embodiment of such a capacitive touch-sensing surface may decrease power consumption and increase noise immunity by limiting the number of intersections scanned for identifying a location of the conductive object. In one embodiment, limiting the number of scanned intersections may further increase accuracy, reduce response time, and improve refresh rate of the touch-sensing device.","In one embodiment, a processing device may perform a first scan of the touch-sensing surface to detect and resolve the location of a conductive object. Based on this resolved (i.e., calculated) location, the processing device may predict a location or a set of possible future locations for the conductive object. For example, the processing device may calculate an predicted location of the conductive object based on the last known or previously resolved locations of the conductive object, the velocity, the acceleration, or a mix thereof of the conductive object. Alternatively, the processing device may determine a search window including all or most of the locations that the conductive object is likely to be found during a subsequent scan. In one embodiment, the prediction may also be based on the duration between the first scan and the next subsequent scan. In one embodiment, the search window may be rectangular. In an alternative embodiment, the search window may be some other non-square or non-rectangular shape.","Having determined a search window associated with the predicted location of the conductive object, the processing device may invoke a scan of intersections within the search window, which may include intersections near the predicted location. The conductive object can thus be tracked over time by performing a series of local scans comprising the limited number of intersections where the conductive object is likely to be located. In the rare event that the location of conductive object cannot be accurately resolved using data from a local scan, additional intersections, up to or including the whole panel may be sensed in order to determine the location of the object with the desired accuracy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","116","101","121","100","116","110","150","116","121","116"]},"In one embodiment, the sensor element array  includes sensor elements ()-(N) (where N is a positive integer) that are disposed as a two-dimensional matrix (also referred to as an XY matrix). The sensor element array  is coupled to pins ()-(N) of the processing device  via one or more analog buses  transporting multiple signals. In this embodiment, each sensor element ()-(N) is represented as a capacitor.","In one embodiment, the capacitance sensor  may include a relaxation oscillator or other means to convert a capacitance into a measured value. The capacitance sensor  may also include a counter or timer to measure the oscillator output. The processing device  may further include software components to convert the count value (e.g., capacitance value) into a sensor element detection decision (also referred to as switch detection decision) or relative magnitude. It should be noted that there are various known methods for measuring capacitance, such as current versus voltage phase shift measurement, resistor-capacitor charge timing, capacitive bridge divider, charge transfer, successive approximation, sigma-delta modulators, charge-accumulation circuits, field effect, mutual capacitance, frequency shift, or other capacitance measurement algorithms. It should be noted however, instead of evaluating the raw counts relative to a threshold, the capacitance sensor  may be evaluating other measurements to determine the user interaction. For example, in the capacitance sensor  having a sigma-delta modulator, the capacitance sensor  is evaluating the ratio of pulse widths of the output (i.e., density domain), instead of the raw counts being over or under a certain threshold.","In one embodiment, the processing device  further includes processing logic . Operations of the processing logic  may be implemented in firmware; alternatively, it may be implemented in hardware or software. The processing logic  may receive signals from the capacitance sensor , and determine the state of the sensor element array , such as whether an object (e.g., a finger) is detected on or in proximity to the sensor element array  (e.g., determining the presence of the object), resolve where the object is on the sensor array (e.g., determining the location of the object), tracking the motion of the object, or other information related to an object detected at the touch sensor.","In another embodiment, instead of performing the operations of the processing logic  in the processing device , the processing device  may send the raw data or partially-processed data to the host . The host , as illustrated in , may include decision logic  that performs some or all of the operations of the processing logic . Operations of the decision logic  may be implemented in firmware, hardware, software, or a combination thereof. The host  may include a high-level Application Programming Interface (API) in applications  that perform routines on the received data, such as compensating for sensitivity differences, other compensation algorithms, baseline update routines, start-up and\/or initialization routines, interpolation operations, or scaling operations. The operations described with respect to the processing logic  may be implemented in the decision logic , the applications , or in other hardware, software, and\/or firmware external to the processing device . In some other embodiments, the processing device  is the host .","In another embodiment, the processing device  may also include a non-sensing actions block . This block  may be used to process and\/or receive\/transmit data to and from the host . For example, additional components may be implemented to operate with the processing device  along with the sensor element array  (e.g., keyboard, keypad, mouse, trackball, LEDs, displays, or other peripheral devices).","The processing device  may reside on a common carrier substrate such as, for example, an integrated circuit (IC) die substrate, or a multi-chip module substrate. Alternatively, the components of the processing device  may be one or more separate integrated circuits and\/or discrete components. In one embodiment, the processing device  may be the Programmable System on a Chip (PSoC\u2122) processing device, developed by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, San Jose, Calif. Alternatively, the processing device  may be one or more other processing devices known by those of ordinary skill in the art, such as a microprocessor or central processing unit, a controller, special-purpose processor, digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or other programmable device. In an alternative embodiment, for example, the processing device  may be a network processor having multiple processors including a core unit and multiple micro-engines. Additionally, the processing device  may include any combination of general-purpose processing device(s) and special-purpose processing device(s).","In one embodiment, the electronic system  is implemented in a device that includes the touch-sensing surface  as the user interface, such as handheld electronics, portable telephones, cellular telephones, notebook computers, personal computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), kiosks, keyboards, televisions, remote controls, monitors, handheld multi-media devices, handheld video players, gaming devices, control panels of a household or industrial appliances, or other computer peripheral or input devices. Alternatively, the electronic system  may be used in other types of devices. It should be noted that the components of electronic system  may include all the components described above. Alternatively, electronic system  may include only some of the components described above, or include additional components not listed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["121","101","121","121","101","100","121","225","222","223","225","101","212","213"]},"Capacitance sensor  includes multiplexer control , demultiplexer  and multiplexer , clock generator , signal generator , demodulation circuit , and analog to digital converter (ADC) . ADC  is further coupled with touch coordinate converter . Touch coordinate converter  may be implemented in the processing logic .","The transmit and receive electrodes in the electrode matrix  may be arranged so that each of the transmit electrodes overlap and cross each of the receive electrodes such as to form an array of intersections, while maintaining galvanic isolation from each other. Thus, each transmit electrode may be capacitively coupled with each of the receive electrodes. For example, transmit electrode  is capacitively coupled with receive electrode  at the point where transmit electrode  and receive electrode  overlap.","Clock generator  supplies a clock signal to signal generator , which produces a TX signal  to be supplied to the transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment, the signal generator  includes a set of switches that operate according to the clock signal from clock generator . The switches may generate a TX signal  by periodically connecting the output of signal generator  to a first voltage and then to a second voltage, wherein said first and second voltages are different.","The output of signal generator  is connected with demultiplexer , which allows the TX signal  to be applied to any of the M transmit electrodes of touch sensor . In one embodiment, multiplexer control  controls demultiplexer  so that the TX signal  is applied to each transmit electrode  in a controlled sequence. Demultiplexer  may also be used to ground, float, or connect an alternate signal to the other transmit electrodes to which the TX signal  is not currently being applied. In an alternate embodiment the TX signal  may be presented in a true form to a subset of the transmit electrodes  and in complement form to a second subset of the transmit electrodes , wherein there is no overlap in members of the first and second subset of transmit electrodes .","Because of the capacitive coupling between the transmit and receive electrodes, the TX signal  applied to each transmit electrode induces a current within each of the receive electrodes. For instance, when the TX signal  is applied to transmit electrode  through demultiplexer , the TX signal  induces an RX signal  on the receive electrodes in matrix . The RX signal  on each of the receive electrodes can then be measured in sequence by using multiplexer  to connect each of the N receive electrodes to demodulation circuit  in sequence.","The mutual capacitance associated with each intersection between a TX electrode and an RX electrode can be sensed by selecting every available combination of TX electrode and an RX electrode using demultiplexer  and multiplexer . To improve performance, multiplexer  may also be segmented to allow more than one of the receive electrodes in matrix  to be routed to additional demodulation circuits . In an optimized configuration, wherein there is a 1-to-1 correspondence of instances of demodulation circuit  with receive electrodes, multiplexer  may not be present in the system.","When a conductive object, such as a finger, approaches the electrode matrix , the object causes a decrease in the measured mutual capacitance between only some of the electrodes. For example, if a finger is placed near the intersection of transmit electrode  and receive electrode , the presence of the finger will decrease the charge coupled between electrodes  and . Thus, the location of the finger on the touchpad can be determined by identifying the one or more receive electrodes having a decrease in measured mutual capacitance in addition to identifying the transmit electrode to which the TX signal  was applied at the time the decrease in capacitance was measured on the one or more receive electrodes.","By determining the mutual capacitances associated with each intersection of electrodes in the matrix , the presence and locations of one or more conductive objects may be determined. The determination may be sequential, in parallel, or may occur more frequently at commonly used electrodes.","In alternative embodiments, other methods for detecting the presence of a finger or other conductive object may be used where the finger or conductive object causes an increase in measured capacitance at one or more electrodes, which may be arranged in a grid or other pattern. For example, a finger placed near an electrode of a capacitive sensor may introduce an additional capacitance to ground that increases the total capacitance between the electrode and ground. The location of the finger can be determined based on the locations of one or more electrodes at which a change in measured capacitance is detected, and the associated magnitude of capacitance change at each respective electrode.","The induced current signal  is integrated by demodulation circuit . The rectified current output by demodulation circuit  can then be filtered and converted to a digital code by ADC .","A series of such digital codes measured from adjacent sensor intersections, when compared to or offset by the associated codes of these same sensors in an un-touched state, may be converted to touch coordinates indicating a position of an input on touch sensor element array  by touch coordinate converter . The touch coordinates may then be used to detect gestures or perform other functions by the processing logic .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","320","320","331","340","341","348","331","348","310","101","310","320","320","320"]},"In one embodiment, the processing device  is connected to a host  which may receive the measured capacitances or calculated centroid locations from the processing device .","The sensor array  illustrated in  includes sensor electrodes arranged to create a pattern of interconnected diamond shapes. Specifically, the sensor electrodes - of sensor array  form a single solid diamond (SSD) pattern. In one embodiment, each intersection between a row electrode and a column electrode defines a unit cell. Each point within the unit cell is closer to the associated intersection than to any other intersection. For example, unit cell  contains the points that are closest to the intersection between row electrode  and column electrode .","In one embodiment, a capacitive touch-sensing system may collect data from the entire touch-sensing surface by performing a scan to measure capacitances from the unit cells that comprise the touch-sensing surface, then process the data serially or in parallel with a subsequent scan. For example, one system that processes data serially may collect raw capacitance data from each unit cell of the entire touch-sensing surface, and filter the raw data. Based on the filtered raw data, the system may determine local maxima in the measured changes in capacitance to calculate positions of fingers or other conductive objects, then perform post processing of the resolved positions to report locations of the conductive objects, or to perform other functions such as motion tracking or gesture recognition.","In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system may be configured to perform one or both of self-capacitance sensing and mutual capacitance sensing. One embodiment of a capacitive touch-sensing system that is configured to perform self-capacitance sensing may sequentially measure the self capacitance of each row and column sensor element of the touch-sensing surface, such that the total number of sense operations is N+M, for a capacitive sensor array having N rows and M columns. In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may be capable of connecting individual sensor elements together to be sensed in parallel with a single operation. For example, multiple row and or column sensor element may be coupled together and sensed in a single operation to determine whether a conductive object is touching or near the touch-sensing surface.","In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system may perform mutual capacitance sensing by individually sensing each intersection between a row electrode and a column sensor electrode. Thus, a total number of sense operations for a capacitive touch sensor having X rows and Y columns is X\u00d7Y. In one embodiment, performing a mutual capacitance measurement of a unit cell formed at the intersection of a row electrode and a column electrode includes applying a signal (TX) to one electrode and measuring characteristics of the signal on another electrode resulting from the capacitive coupling between the electrodes.","In one embodiment, multiple capacitance sensing circuits may be used in parallel to measure a signal coupled to multiple column electrodes simultaneously, from a signal applied to one or more row electrodes. In one embodiment, for a capacitive sensor array having X rows, Y columns, and N columns that can be sensed simultaneously, the number of mutual capacitance sensing operations is the smallest whole number greater than or equal to X\u00d7Y\/N.","The power consumption of a self-capacitance or mutual capacitance touch-sensing system may be decreased by limiting scans to a portion of the touch-sensing surface. Limiting the scan may further result in higher immunity from noise, as well as higher accuracy, response time, and refresh rate when tracking a conductive object.","As an example, a touch-sensing system may have X=16 rows, Y=24 columns, and N=8 columns that can be sensed simultaneously. Such a touch-sensing system, when configured to measure an 8\u00d78 block of unit cells as a search window, may track a presence and location of a conductive object using 8 sensing operations per scan. The same system performing a scan of the entire touch-sensing surface would use 48 sensing operations per update. Thus, in this particular example, local scanning results in a 6\u00d7 improvement in scan time and similar reduction in power to perform the scan.","In one embodiment, a 5.5 inch diagonal panel composed of >700 unit cells, using a 7\u00d77 search window may reduce scanning time by a factor of 15, as compared to a full scan. This reduced scanning speed may further affect many of the critical parameters of a touchscreen system, such as power consumption, signal to noise ratio, refresh rate, and accuracy.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["404","401","401","402","402"]},"In one embodiment, a size of a search window over which a touch-sensing system may perform a local scan may be determined based on an expected maximum velocity of a finger or other conductive object to be tracked by the touch-sensing system. For example, a capacitive sensor array may have an electrode pitch of 5 mm and may be scanned at a rate of 100 Hz. For a touch-sensing application, a finger on a touchscreen may move as fast as 1 meter per second over the sensor array, with speeds much faster than a few hundred millimeters per second being relatively uncommon.","In such a touch-sensing system, it will be unusual for a finger to have moved more than a few millimeters during a time interval between scans. Thus, the search window may be sized to include substantially all of the predicted locations of the conductive object, given the expected rate of travel of the conductive object. For example, the local scan may include all or a subset of the intersections within an 8\u00d78 area of unit cells, which would be large enough to accommodate the maximum expected travel distance for the finger or other conductive object of a few millimeters per scan interval if the local scan window were centered on the centroid of the resolved touch in the previous scan.","In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system may determine a location of the search window over which to perform a local scan based on a predicted location of a conductive object, such as a finger. For example, the system may predict a location where a finger is expected to be during the time of a subsequent scan and perform a local scan including intersections of sensor elements around the predicted location. In one embodiment, the system identifies a search window, which is an area including intersections to be scanned during the local scan. In one embodiment, the search window includes the predicted location of the conductive object. In one embodiment the predicted location of the conductive object is the calculated location of the conductive object from the previous scan.","In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system uses the location of the conductive object, as determined by an initial scan, as the predicted location of the conductive object for a subsequent local scan. In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may also account for the velocity or acceleration of a conductive object that is in motion. For example, the system may determine the last known position, velocity, and acceleration of the conductive object based on previously resolved positions of the conductive object in order to calculate a predicted location for the conductive object at a time when the subsequent local scan is scheduled to be performed.","In one embodiment, a process for locating a contact using a local scan begins by predicting a contact location. In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system may operate based on assuming that the contact point of a conductive object proximate to the touch-sensing surface is moving sufficiently slowly that the last known location of the contact can be used to approximate the predicted location of the contact for a subsequent scan.","In one embodiment, the suitability of using the last known contact location as an predicted location may depend on factors including the scanning rate of the touch-sensing system, the size of the sensor elements, the expected maximum velocity of the conductive object, and the size of the search window.","For example, for a touch-sensing panel that is scanned at 200 Hz with a unit cell size of 5\u00d75 mm, would still be able to locate a conductive object, such as a finger, moving at 200 Hz\u00d75 mm=1 m\/s using a search window that includes a border that is at least one additional \u201cbuffer\u201d unit cell wide on all sides of the minimum area for determining the centroid location of the contact. For example, if the touch-sensing system uses minimum of a 6\u00d76 grid of unit cells to calculate the centroid location of the conductive object, the size of the search window would be 8\u00d78 unit cells.","In an alternative embodiment, the predicted location of the conductive object may be predicted based on previously determined locations of the contact location. In one embodiment, the previous locations of the contact may be used to calculate a velocity and acceleration of the contact. Calculation of the predicted contact location based on velocity may increase the accuracy of the prediction, particularly for a contact moving at a substantially constant rate. Compensating for acceleration of the moving contact may further increase the prediction accuracy for contacts that are not moving at a constant velocity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","501","500","501","502","501","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["611","600","610","610","611","610","611"]},"In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system scans the intersections within the search window  by performing capacitance measurements using the rows  and columns , the result of such measurements used to resolve a location of the conductive object within the search window . In one embodiment, the capacitance measurements may be mutual capacitance measurements between individual row and column sensor elements. Alternatively, the touch-sensing system may perform a self-capacitance scan of each of the rows  and columns  to determine a detected location of the conductive object within the search window . For example, a self-capacitance scan of local scan search window  may result in a self-capacitance profile including column capacitances  and row capacitances .","Capacitance measurements collected from scanning the search window  may be analyzed to determine whether a presence of a finger or other conductive object has been detected within the search area . In one embodiment, if a contact is detected wholly within the search area , the touch-sensing system may proceed with resolving a location of the conductive object based on the capacitance measurements. In one embodiment, a location can be resolved based on a minimum number of capacitance measurements. Thus, a location of a conductive object that is completely within the search window is resolvable using only capacitance measurements of sensor elements that intersect within the search window. In contrast, a contact that is only partially within the search window may be resolved using the capacitance measurements of sensor elements intersecting within the search window , in addition to capacitance measurements of sensor elements intersecting outside the search window . In one embodiment, a contact may be detected to be only partially (i.e., not wholly) within the search window if the highest (or lowest) capacitance value in either the X or Y direction is within a predetermined number of intersections of the edge of the search window. In another embodiment, a contact may be determined to be only partially within the search window if the measured capacitance value at one or more (or another predetermined number) of the intersections forming the boundary of the search window differs more than a predetermined amount from a reference level; this predetermined level may be an absolute capacitance value, or may be a value relative to the highest or lowest capacitance value measured within the search window.","For example, a contact at location  may be completely within the search window , while a contact at location  may be partially within the search window . Notably, although the contact location  is centered outside of the search window , a contact at location  may still cause changes in capacitance measurable at some intersections inside the search window .","In response to determining that the contact location is partially or completely outside the search window , the touch-sensing system may expand the size of the search window  by scanning additional sensor elements, such as columns  and rows . Thus, the initial search window  may be expanded to the extended search window . Note that it in some embodiments it may not be possible to distinguish between a touch having moved outside the search window and the conductive object having moved away from proximity to the touch sensing surface. However, in one embodiment the system responds in the same way\u2014by expanding the size of the search window. In one embodiment the search window may be increased to cover the entire touch sensing surface. If no touch is detected within the expanded search window then it may be inferred that the conductive object has moved away from proximity to the sensing surface.","For example, a finger may be proximate to the touch-sensing surface  at a touch location  even after the touch-sensing system has predicted a location  based on previously determined locations of the finger. In one embodiment, this situation may arise when the finger is removed and replaced on the touch-panel or has moved faster than can be accommodated by the prediction method.","In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may extend the search window  by the same number of sensor electrodes in each direction. For example, an extended search window may include the initial search window and one additional sensor electrode on each of the four sides of the initial search window. Alternatively, the touch-sensing system may extend the search window  in a direction depending on the capacitances measured from within the search window , or a direction of travel of the contact.","In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may extend the initial search window on the same side as the strongest capacitance signals measured from the initial search window. This process accommodates situations where a contact location  is partially within the initial search window , or at least causes measurable changes in capacitance at the intersections within the search window . In one embodiment, the search window  may be extended until a minimum sufficient amount of capacitance data for resolving the contact location is collected.","In one embodiment, the touch-sensing surface may extend the search window  in the same direction as a direction of travel of the contact. For example, the touch-sensing system may extend the search window  upwards and to the left (with reference to ) to find the position of a contact that is traveling from location  to location , in response to determining that the contact is not completely within the search window .","In one embodiment, if a touch-sensing system is not able to detect a presence of a contact based on a local scan limited to a search window, the touch-sensing system may extend the search to scan the entire capacitive sensor array. Thus, the touch-sensing system may be able to locate the contact even if the contact travels completely outside the search window, such that the conductive object does not affect any capacitance measurements within the search window .","In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system implementing the local scan method may also be configured to detect the presence of additional conductive objects while tracking an initial contact using the local scan method, to allow local scanning to be used with multi-touch applications. There are several methods that can be used to detect new contacts, including detecting a change in the total self-capacitance of the capacitive sensor array, or scanning all or part of the sensor array using self or mutual capacitance sensing methods.","In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system may perform a scan of the remaining area of the touch-sensing surface, in addition to the area of the local scan, in order to detect the presence of additional conductive objects, such as additional fingers proximate to the touch-sensing surface.","In one embodiment, a quick detection of a new contact at the touch-sensing surface may be performed using a single self-capacitance measurement of the entire sensor, which may be performed in a single processing cycle. In one embodiment, when there is no touch location currently being tracked, the detecting the presence of a new touch may include a self-capacitance sensing of sensor elements of only one axis. Once a touch is detected, then that touch can be localized and verified to be a single touch by a self-capacitance measurement of the second axis. If more than one touch is present, then one or more fine scans using mutual capacitance may be used to resolve the locations of the individual touches. In one embodiment where the self capacitance measurements are of low resolution to only perform reliable detection of touch presence, resolution of touch location may always be performed using mutual capacitance fine scans.","In one embodiment, the sensor array may be sensed in sections to detect a new contact by electrically coupling sensor elements to make up such sections. For example, a touch-sensing system may sense three overlapping sections of a capacitive sensor array, with each section covering approximately half the area of the entire capacitive sensor array. In one embodiment, a touch-sensing system with overlapping sections may more easily detect the presence of a conductive object in an overlapping area, particularly when the change in measured capacitance caused by the conductive object is relatively small. In an alternative embodiment, the sections may be adjacent, but non-overlapping. For systems having a capacitance sensor with multiple sensing channels, the self-capacitance of all row and column sense electrodes can all be measured in parallel, wherein each sense electrode may be connected to a separate sensing channel.","In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may detect the presence of additional contacts by scanning all or part of the capacitive sensor array using mutual-capacitance sensing methods. Depending on the ratio of sensor pitch to a minimum expected contact size, the intersections of the sensor electrodes may be sensed according to various patterns, such as striped or checkerboard patterns. In one embodiment, the touch-sensing system may sense intersections associated with alternate rows and columns to detect the presence of a contact. Alternatively, a touch-sensing system may sense intersections associated with every third row and column to detect the contact.","For example,  illustrates an embodiment of a touch-sensing surface  including a 16\u00d724 sensor array with N=8. A touch-sensing system may detect a contact at the touch-sensing surface  by performing a self or mutual capacitance scan that includes scanning one of every three rows (rows ) in conjunction with alternating columns (columns ). Mutual capacitance measurements are thus performed for the unit cells (including unit cells ) at the intersections of the scanned rows  and columns . Alternatively, the touch-sensing system may apply a TX signal to multiple rows simultaneously. In one embodiment, these rows may be interleaved with unsensed rows.","In one embodiment, a scan for new contacts may be performed at a lower rate than a tracking of a known contact using a local scanning method. In one embodiment, a scan of the entire sensor array to detect a new contact may be performed over several local scan periods. For example, a touch-sensing system may perform a self-capacitance scan of each of three sections, where one section is scanned for new contacts after every local scan for tracking a known contact. In such a case, with a 200 Hz update rate for local scan tracking, the typical \u201ctouch latency\u201d for detecting a new contact would be approximately 15 ms to 20 ms.","In one embodiment where new contacts are detected using mutual capacitance measurements, the mutual capacitance scan for new contacts may be interleaved between a series of local tracking scans. For example, if 12 mutual capacitance sensing operations (corresponding to alternating rows and columns and N=8 channels and measuring 48 independent intersections) are used to find new contacts over the full area of the touch-sensing surface, then three rows may be sensed for each local scan, resulting in a 20 ms typical latency for detecting new contacts. Note that when performing these new contact scans, in one embodiment the area already covered by a local scan may be excluded since it has already been measured.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 6C","b":["670","671","672","673","674","675","672","675"]},"In one embodiment, the local scanning method is used only when tracking the location of a single conductive object in contact with or proximate to the touch-sensing surface. Alternatively, the local scanning method may be used to track a number of proximate conductive objects, such as finger touches.","In one embodiment, the system may use the local scan method for tracking a limited number of touches in a system that is capable of tracking more than the limited number of contacts. For example, a touch-sensing system capable of tracking up to ten contacts may use the local scan mode when tracking up to two simultaneous contacts at the touch-sensing surface, and may switch to a different mode for tracking more than two contacts. In this example, two separate search windows may be used when tracking two fingers. In one embodiment, if the two search windows overlap, a single larger window may be used for as long as the two centroids are within a predetermined distance of each other.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["700","700","700","110","150","700"]},"In one embodiment, scanning process  begins at block . At block , a touch-sensing system may perform an initial scan of a touch-sensing surface to detect a new contact at the touch-sensing surface. In one embodiment, the scan may be a mutual capacitance scan of a touch-sensing surface, such as touch-sensing surface , as illustrated in . In one embodiment, the scan at block  may cover the entire sensing area of a touch-sensing surface to detect a new contact anywhere in the sensing area. In one embodiment, process  repeats the scanning operations associated with block  until a touch is initially detected. In an alternate embodiment, the scan at block  may be a self-capacitance scan of electrodes comprising one axis of the touch-sensing surface, such as touch-sensing surface , as illustrated in . In one embodiment, a self-capacitance scan that indicates more than one touch may cause the system to switch to a mutual capacitance scanning method to determine the number of touches. From block , the process  continues at block .","At block , based on the scan performed at block , the touch-sensing system determines whether the number of contacts at the touch-sensing surface has changed since the previous scan. From block , if the number of contacts has not changed, then the process  continues at block . Otherwise, if the number of contacts has changed, then the process  continues at block .","At block , the process  locates new contacts by a full panel scan or a coarse scan of the touch sensing surface. In one embodiment, the number of contacts at block  may change because a contact was added to or removed from the touch-sensing surface. In one embodiment, if the number of contacts has increased, the touch-sensing system locates the one or more new contacts by performing a full self-capacitance scan (for a single contact) or mutual capacitance scan (for multiple contacts) of the entire touch-sensing panel, or a coarse scan of a pattern of sensor elements. The coarse scan may include, for example, a self-capacitance scan of alternate rows and columns of sensor elements. Alternatively, a coarse scan may include a mutual capacitance scan of a subset of unit cells of the touch-sensing panel. From block , the process  continues at block .","At block , the touch-sensing system may perform a local scan to collect raw capacitance data from sensor unit cells around a predicted contact location. In one embodiment, if the contact is a new contact identified at block , then the local scan of block  may be performed within a search window surrounding an approximate location of the new contact as determined by the full panel or coarse scan of block . Otherwise, if the contact is not a new contact, then the predicted contact location may have been calculated at block . In one embodiment, the local scan is performed on unit cells within a search window, such as search window  or , as illustrated in , respectively. In one embodiment, the search window may be centered around the contact location predicted at block . For example, search window  of  is centered around predicted contact location . From block , the process  continues at block .","At blocks  and , the touch-sensing system determines whether the raw capacitance data represent a whole contact (block ) or a partial contact (block ). In one embodiment, a centroid location for a whole contact can be determined based on only the capacitance values measured from within the search window, while a centroid location for a partial contact may be determined based on capacitance values measured from within the search window in addition to capacitance values measured from outside the search window. If the touch-sensing system determines that the capacitance data represents a whole contact, the process  continues at block . If the touch-sensing system instead identifies a partial contact, the process  continues at block .","At block , the touch-sensing system scans an expanded area to obtain additional capacitance data for resolving a location of the partial contact from block . For example, the touch-sensing system may scan sensor elements in an extended search window, such as extended search window , as illustrated in . From block , the process  continues at block .","At block , the touch-sensing system calculates a resolved contact location of the whole contact or of multiple contacts, based on the capacitance data from blocks  and . The touch-sensing system may report the location as touch coordinates to a host computer, such as host  of . From block , the process  continues back to block .","At block , the touch-sensing system predicts a contact location based on the scan at block , where the predicted contact location is associated with a time of a subsequent scan. In one embodiment, the prediction of the contact location may be based on one or more previously determined locations of the same contact. For example, the touch-sensing system may determine a velocity or acceleration for the contact based on previous locations of the contact, and determine a predicted location that accounts for the velocity or acceleration. Alternatively, the touch-sensing system may use a last known location of the contact, such as the contact location determined at block , as the predicted location of the contact.","In one embodiment, the next predicted location following the resolution of a first touch location may be centered on the first touch location. Once the second touch location is resolved, the two touch locations provide a velocity vector that may be used to predict a location for the third scan. Once three resolved touch locations are available, then an acceleration of the conductive object can be determined. In one embodiment, the previous one, two, or three resolved locations of the touch can then be used for a subsequent prediction depending on the velocity and acceleration. In one embodiment, the previously resolved locations of the touch may also be used to shape the area of the fine scan window. If the acceleration is 0, then the last two points may be used. If the velocity is zero, then the last point may be used in the prediction. The predicted location of block  may be used for a local scan performed as provided at block . From block , the process  continues at block .","At block , if a timeout has elapsed, the process  continues at block . Accordingly, in one embodiment, the timeout determines an interval for periodically scanning for new contacts, as provided at block . If, at block , the timeout has not elapsed, the process  continues with a local scan as provided at block . In one embodiment, the timeout may elapse upon the passage of a time duration; alternatively, the timeout may expire after a pre-selected number of scans have been performed.","In one embodiment, the process  thus repeats while the touch-sensing system is in operation to continuously track the locations of one or more conductive objects on or proximate to the touch-sensing surface.","In one embodiment, the local scanning and additional contact detection methods are not limited to detection and tracking of fingers, but may be used to track other objects such as active or passive styli, or may be used to detect and track conductive objects in proximity to, but not necessarily contacting, the touch-sensing surface. In one embodiment, the local scanning and additional contact detection methods may also be applicable to non-capacitive touchscreen sensing methods which use an array of sensing locations.","Embodiments of the present invention, described herein, include various operations.
