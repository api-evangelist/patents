More particularly, a watercraft having a first subassembly and one or more second subassemblies. The first subassembly and each of the one or more second subassemblies have commensurate shapes allowing for attachment and\/or replacement of the one or more replaceable hull structures.","Current watercraft designs are fixed and fabricated by manufacturers. Different mission scenarios require different craft capabilities in order to maximize performance. Different mission scenarios may require different payloads, hull forms, structures, materials or propulsion systems. Typically, in order to alter a craft's performance, substantial manufacturing modifications are necessary. This task is made more difficult because one craft alteration to improve a desired characteristic may have adverse effects on other desired characteristics. Thus it is desired to have a watercraft design that accommodates for different mission scenarios without the need for making substantial manufacturing modifications.","In one aspect, the invention a watercraft having a replaceable hull structure. In this aspect, the watercraft has a first subassembly and a second subassembly. The first subassembly includes a sponson and a flooring attached to the sponson. The flooring has an outer circumferential area defining a substantially V-shaped receiving region. The first subassembly also includes a transom. In this aspect, the second subassembly is a hull structure. The hull structure has a bow end, a stern end, and an upper rim. The upper rim is substantially V-shaped commensurate with the substantially V-shaped receiving region of the first subassembly so that the upper rim matingly attaches at the substantially V-shaped receiving region. The watercraft having the replaceable hull structure also includes one or more elongated connectors. Each elongated connector includes a first elongated connector portion extending on the flooring at the substantially V-shaped receiving region, and a second elongated connector portion extending along the substantially V-shaped upper rim, wherein the first and second elongated connector portions lockingly mate, replaceably attaching the hull structure to the first subassembly.","In another aspect, the invention is a watercraft assembly. The watercraft assembly includes a first subassembly and a plurality of second subassemblies. In this aspect, the first subassembly includes a sponson and a flooring attached to the sponson. The flooring has an outer circumferential area defining a substantially V-shaped receiving region. The first subassembly also includes a transom. In this aspect, each of the plurality of second subassemblies is a replaceable hull structure. Each replaceable hull structure has a bow end, a stern end, and a upper rim. The upper rim is substantially V-shaped commensurate with the substantially V-shaped receiving region of the first subassembly so that the upper rim matingly attaches at the substantially V-shaped receiving region. The watercraft assembly also includes one or more elongated connectors. Each elongated connector has a first elongated connector portion extending on the flooring at the substantially V-shaped receiving region, and a second elongated connector portion extending along the substantially V-shaped upper rim of each of the plurality or replaceable hull structures, wherein the first and second elongated connector portions lockingly mate replaceably attaching one of the plurality of replaceable hull structures to the first subassembly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","101","201","100","101","105","101","140","100","201","201","201","201","101","201","201","101"]},"Different mission scenarios require different watercraft capabilities in order to optimize performance.

Additionally, according to embodiments of the invention, the apex of substantially V-shaped upper rim  may be more rounded and the overall shape may be more akin to being substantially U-shaped. It should also be noted that the shape of the upper rim  and the shape of the receiving region  are designed to match, so a substantially U-shaped upper rim is commensurate with a substantially U-shaped opening, allowing for a matching connection between the first and second subassemblies  and .","It should be noted that the watercraft  as outlined herein may a solid fixed structure. Alternatively, according to a desired embodiment, the watercraft  may be primarily inflatable. Consequently, before and after use, the air may be discharged and the watercraft  may be folded-up and stowed in a relatively small container or area, making it an easy asset to transport. According to this embodiment, each of the sponson , the flooring , and the hull structure  is inflatable and made from a coated fabric material. The fabric may be, for example, nylon, polyester, or the like.
