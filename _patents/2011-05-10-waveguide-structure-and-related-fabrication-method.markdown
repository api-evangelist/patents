title: Waveguide structure and related fabrication method
abstract: A method for fabricating a waveguide structure (i.e., preferably an optical waveguide structure) uses a two mask process step sequence for forming a waveguide layer over a substrate. A first mask within the two mask step process sequence is used to etch the substrate to provide a pillar within the substrate. A second mask within the two mask process step sequence is self aligned to, and covers a top and at least a portion of the sidewalls of, the pillar. The second mask is used as a thermal oxidation mask that provides an optical waveguide layer from a top portion of the pillar that is separated from a thinned substrate derived from the substrate by a waveguide isolation layer formed from thermal oxidation of at least a bottom portion of the pillar. Under conditions of manufacturing economy, and as a result of the processing sequence, the waveguide layer is formed with a non-planar bottom surface including a valley in the bottom surface of the waveguide layer and the substrate is formed with a non-planar top surface including a peak in the top surface of the substrate that corresponds with the valley in the bottom surface of the waveguide layer.

No. 61\/332,893, filed 10 May 2010, and titled \u201cWaveguide and Fabrication Method,\u201d the content of which is incorporated herein fully by reference.","This invention was made with government funding under National Science Foundation grant EEC-0646547. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","Conventional electron physics based semiconductor device technology has been reaching physical limitations in terms of semiconductor structure layer thicknesses and semiconductor structure separation distances that are used in fabricating conventional semiconductor devices. Thus, a need has recently evolved for alternative technical approaches that may be used to augment or replace conventional semiconductor device technology to assure that continued advances in information technology may be realized in the absence of advances in conventional semiconductor device technology.","One particular alternative technology approach that may be used to augment or replace conventional semiconductor device technology uses optoelectronic devices rather than conventional semiconductor devices. Optoelectronic devices fundamentally provide for potentially higher signal processing speeds and signal propagation speeds in comparison with conventional semiconductor devices. In addition, optoelectronic devices and optoelectronic structures that are used within optoelectronic circuits often provide for multiple simultaneous parallel signal processing characteristics and multiple simultaneous parallel signal transmission characteristics.","In conjunction with optoelectronic devices as replacements for conventional electron physics based semiconductor devices, there also exists a need for optical waveguide structures to replace metallic interconnect structures that are typically used to interconnect conventional semiconductor devices. Desirably, such optical waveguide structures will include adequate isolation to secure optimal performance and minimized cross-talk with respect to adjacent optical waveguide structures or other further separated optical waveguide structures.","Thus, desirable are optical waveguide structures and methods for efficiently fabricating those optical waveguide structures, to provide for enhanced operation of optoelectronic devices within advanced optoelectronic circuits.","The embodiments are directed towards a waveguide structure and a method for fabricating the waveguide structure. Typically, but not necessarily exclusively, the waveguide structure comprises an optical waveguide structure. An optical waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments is intended for transmission of optical signals in wavelength regions including but not limited to the infrared, the visible and the ultraviolet wavelength regions ranging from about 100 nanometers to about 20 microns.","In particular, the method for fabricating the waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments includes masking a thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate (i.e., a bulk substrate) with a first mask to provide a first masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate and etching the first masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate to provide an etched first masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate having a pillar beneath the first mask. The method for fabricating the waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments also provides for masking the sidewalls and the top of the pillar within the etched first masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate with a second mask to provide a second masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate and thermally oxidizing the second masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate in a fashion that oxidizes a lower portion of the pillar but not an upper portion of the pillar, to provide: (1) a waveguide layer from the unoxidized upper portion of the pillar; separated from (2) a thinned substrate derived from the second masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate; by (3) a waveguide isolation layer formed at least in part from an oxidized lower portion of the pillar.","As a result of the particular foregoing method in accordance of the embodiments, the embodiments provide a waveguide structure that may include: (1) a waveguide layer having a valley in a bottom (or lower) surface of the waveguide layer (i.e., generally a waveguide layer having a non-planar bottom surface or interface); that corresponds with (2) a peak in a top (or upper) surface of the thinned substrate (i.e., generally a thinned substrate having a non-planar top surface or interface) over which is located the waveguide layer that contains the valley within the bottom surface of the waveguide layer. Thus, in accordance with the foregoing description, a non-planar bottom surface of a waveguide layer or a non-planar top surface of a thinned substrate is also intended to include a non-planar bottom interface of the waveguide layer or a non-planar top interface of the thinned substrate with a layer, such as but not limited to a waveguide isolation layer, interposed between the waveguide layer and the thinned substrate, either or both of which may have the non-planar surface or interface.","A particular waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments includes a waveguide layer located over a substrate. The waveguide layer comprises a waveguide material and includes a non-planar bottom surface of the waveguide layer.","A particular optical waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments includes a substrate. The particular optical waveguide structure also includes an optical waveguide isolation layer located over the substrate. The particular optical waveguide structure also includes an optical waveguide layer comprising an optical waveguide material located over the optical waveguide isolation layer. The optical waveguide layer has a valley within a bottom surface of the optical waveguide layer that corresponds with a peak within a top surface of the substrate","A particular method for fabricating a waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments includes forming a first mask layer upon a substrate that comprises a thermally oxidizable waveguide material to provide a first masked substrate. The particular method also includes etching the first masked substrate to provide a pillar beneath the first mask layer within an etched first masked substrate. The particular method also includes forming a second mask layer upon the sidewalls and top of the pillar within the etched first masked substrate to provide a second masked substrate. The particular method also includes thermally oxidizing the second masked substrate to provide a waveguide layer from a top portion of the pillar beneath the second mask layer separated from a thinned substrate derived from the second masked substrate by a waveguide isolation layer derived from thermal oxidation of the thermally oxidizable waveguide material interposed between the waveguide layer and the thinned substrate.","A particular method for fabricating an optical waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments includes forming a first mask layer over a bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate to provide a first masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate. The particular method also includes etching the first masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate to provide a pillar beneath the first mask layer within an etched first masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate. The particular method also includes forming a second mask layer upon the sidewalls and top of the pillar within the etched first masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate to provide a second masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate. The particular method also includes thermally oxidizing the second masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate to provide a monocrystalline silicon waveguide layer from a top portion of the pillar beneath the second mask layer separated from a thinned substrate derived from the second masked bulk monocrystalline silicon substrate by a waveguide isolation layer derived from thermal oxidation of the monocrystalline silicon waveguide material interposed between the monocrystalline silicon waveguide layer and the thinned substrate.","The embodiments provide a waveguide structure and a method for fabricating the waveguide structure. The method for fabricating the waveguide structure comprises a multistep masking and etching method. The multistep masking and etching method includes a first masking step that uses a first mask layer located over a thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate to provide via a first etching a pillar beneath the first mask layer within an etched first masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate. The multistep masking method then uses a second mask layer upon the top and at least a portion of the sidewalls of the pillar to form a second masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate, prior to thermally oxidizing the second masked thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate to consume a bottom portion of the pillar but not a top portion of the pillar. The unconsumed top portion of the pillar comprises a waveguide layer within a waveguide structure that is separated from a thinned thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate by a waveguide isolation layer that is formed at least in-part from the consumed bottom portion of the pillar.","As a result of the foregoing particular method in accordance with the embodiments, within the resulting waveguide structure the waveguide layer has a non-planar bottom surface (i.e., at an interface with a top surface of the waveguide isolation layer) that typically includes a valley within a bottom surface of the waveguide layer that corresponds with a peak within a non-planar top surface of the thinned thermally oxidizable waveguide material substrate (i.e., at an interface with a bottom surface of the waveguide isolation layer) that also comprises the waveguide structure.","While the embodiments are described within the context of a bulk monocrystalline silicon semiconductor substrate as a thermally oxidizable optical waveguide material substrate for fabricating a monocrystalline silicon optical waveguide layer within an optical waveguide structure in accordance with the embodiments, such is only intended as a non-limiting illustrative embodiment.
