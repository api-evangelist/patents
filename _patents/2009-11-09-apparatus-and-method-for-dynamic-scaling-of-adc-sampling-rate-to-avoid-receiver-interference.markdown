Field","This disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for scaling the sampling rate of an analog-to-digital converter.","2. Background","Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as broadcast, voice, video, packet data, messaging, etc. These wireless systems include broadcast systems, cellular systems, etc. A wireless system may operate in an environment where jammers may be present. Jammers are large amplitude undesired signals. The jammers may correspond to strong narrowband frequency components (e.g., for color carrier, sound carrier, etc.) from an interfering source or intermodulation distortion generated by a receiver. The jammers may cause various deleterious effects such as failure to detect and acquire a signal from a desired system, degradation in decoding performance, etc.","Analog filters are often used in a receiver to pass the desired signal while suppressing out-of-band jammers that couple to the antenna. Any residual jammer energy remaining prior to an analog-to-digital conversion can potentially alias into the signal band. This may cause a degradation in receiver sensitivity, bit rate error, and\/or other types of signal degradation.","Analog-to-digital (ADC) and other digital logic clocked at the ADC sampling rate may also degrade receiver performance For example, a sample clock may have a harmonic falling inside the RF signal bandwidth of one of the active receivers in a user device. Digital signals in the sample clock domain may couple to sensitive low noise amplifier (LNA) and\/or mixer circuits, where a harmonic component creates an in-band jammer.","Another common problem is that the sampling clock, or other digital signals in the sample clock domain may couple into the receiver synthesizer, thereby modulating the VCO control voltage. As a result, spurious components may be presented in the VCO output. These spurious components may create continuous wave (CW) jammers at the receiver output and\/or other broadband interference resembling jammer aliasing.","There is a need in the art for improved techniques for avoiding jammer aliasing and other similar interference.","The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects.

It is noted that the specific configurations depicted in  are merely exemplary. Other configurations may also be used.","A wireless device may include one or more receivers and\/or one or more transmitters. As a result of the close coupling of the electronic components, interference signals may occupy a receiver's desired signal bandwidth. For example, interference signals may be generated as a result of a portion of a transmitter's signal leaking into the receiver front-end circuitry and subsequently aliasing in the receiver ADC, harmonics of a co-located receiver's sampling clock falling in the receiver's RF signal bandwidth, LO spurs generated by the receiver's sampling clock mixing with a signal leaking from a co-located transmitter, and\/or other interference sources. Dynamically selecting a sampling frequency, based on the frequencies in use by all co-located device elements, may be used to prevent interference.  depicts processor\/controller  for controlling a wireless device, in accordance with some aspects. Processor\/controller  may include an interference determination module , a sampling frequency determination module , and a sampling frequency adjustment module .","Interference determination module  may be configured to determine the source of one or more potential interfering signals. For example, interference determination module may be configured to determine whether there are potential interferences sources such as co-located transmitters and\/or receivers which may generate signals which could alias into the desired receiver signal band. Interference determination module  may also be configured to determine the frequency of any potential interferers. For example, if there is a potential for a jammer signal to be received as a result of transmitter leakage, the interference determination module  may be configured to determine the frequency of the transmitter oscillator. For co-located receivers, the interference determination module  may be configured to determine the operating frequency of each co-located receiver. When a jammer is generated by a co-located receiver or transmitter in an integrated chipset, software and\/or firmware controlling the receiver may also be used to control the co-located receiver or transmitter. Accordingly, frequency information and\/or band and channel information associated with the co-located receiver or transmitter may be passed to the code module associated with the receiver in real time. In some aspects, the receiver code module may periodically request frequency information from code modules associated with the co-located receiver or transmitter via a high-level application programming interface (API). In some aspects, a real-time spectrum analyzer may be used to determine frequency information for any potential interferers. Other methods may also be used.","Based on the interference information determined by interference determination module , sampling frequency determination module  may be configured to determine an ADC sampling frequency which will avoid interference. According to some aspects, an appropriate sampling frequency may be determined by consulting a look-up table which stores a precomputed sampling frequency for all channels of a potential interference source. For example, for a receiver co-located with a transmitter that operates in one of ten transmitter channels, a desired sampling frequency associated with those ten transmitter channels may be stored in a table. For example, the sampling frequency for each channel in the table may be determined by calculating the alias frequency of the transmitter leakage in that channel for all candidate sampling frequencies and selecting one sampling frequency that avoids aliasing into the desired signal bandwidth.","In accordance with some aspects, sampling frequency determination module  may be configured to calculate a desired sampling rate without consulting a look-up table. The sampling frequency determination module  may be configured to calculate a sampling frequency Fwhich avoids all potential interference. For example, in the case of potential interference due to transmitter leakage, a jammer at baseband frequency F=N*F+\u0394F, where N is an integer and |\u0394F|<F\/2, will appear at the ADC output as if its baseband frequency were actually \u0394F. Thus, sampling frequency determination module  may be configured to select a value for F, based on the above-identified equation, such that the aliased jammer is sufficiently far from the signal bandwidth.","In the case of harmonics generated by a co-located receiver's sampling clock, the sampling frequency determination module  may be configured to select a sampling frequency Ffor the co-located receiver such that no multiple N*Ffalls inside the RF signal bandwidth for any active receiver in the device. In the case of LO spurs generated by the receiver's sampling clock mixing with a signal leaking from a co-located transmitter, a sampling frequency Fmay be determined such that no mixing products of the transmitter leakage with LO spurs at frequency offsets N*Fwill fall into the desired signal bandwidth. According to some aspects, the sample frequency determination module  selects a sampling frequency which avoids interference caused by all potential mechanisms. In other embodiments, fewer than all potential mechanisms may be considered.","Sampling frequency adjustment module  may be configured to determine when an adjustment to the sampling frequency is desirable. For example, the module may determine that an adjustment is desirable when a user device is powered on, when there is a signal handoff, when there is a communications channel change, when a voice or data call is originated or terminated, and\/or other desirable times.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","440","410","412","414","416","418","420","440","442","444","446","448","450","450","420","412","400"]},"On the transmit path, transmit data is supplied to DAC  which converts the digital data signal into an analog signal. The analog signal is then filtered via analog filter . Mixer  modulates a transmit local oscillator signal supplied by LO  with the analog data signal, and provides a modulated RF signal. The modulated RF signal is then amplified by amplifier  and a transmit signal is then routed through a duplexer  and transmitted via an antenna .","On the receive path, antenna  receives a transmitted signal, and duplexer  routes the received signal from antenna  to amplifier . Mixer  demodulates the amplified signal with a receive local oscillator signal supplied by LO , and provides a baseband signal. Analog filter  filters the baseband signal to remove noise and other components, and provides a filtered signal. The filtered analog signal is then converted to a digital signal via ADC .","In addition to the transmitted signal, antenna  may also receive interference signals, such as signals transmitted by other base stations or a portion of the transmit signal leaking from amplifier . The transmitter leakage may generate a jammer signal which, depending on the sampling frequency of ADC, may alias into the desired signal bandwidth. Thus, according to some aspects, the sampling frequency of ADC  may be calculated and adjusted such that an aliased transmitter leakage component does not fall into the desired signal bandwidth. Adjustments to the sampling frequency may be made automatically if there are any changes to the operating environment, such as a channel change.","Dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency may also be used to prevent sampling clock harmonics from falling inside the RF signal bandwidth of an active receiver in a user device.  depicts a block diagram of an electronic device having two receiver components housed therein.

According to some aspects, one or both of ADC  and ADC  may be included on a baseband IC (not shown). For example, each of the first receiver  and the second receiver  may employ CDMA, FDMA, TDMA, and\/or other communication protocols. According to some aspects, first receiver  and second receiver  may employ the same communication protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","540","510","518","520"]},"Harmonics may also fall in the receive band of second receiver , as depicted at path (b). According to some aspects, the sampling frequency of the second receiver is not generated by oscillator , but rather by first oscillator . As such, the sample clock may have a harmonic component falling inside the RF signal bandwidth of another active receiver in the user device, such as second receiver . Digital signals in the sample clock domain may couple to sensitive amplifier\/mixer circuits, where a harmonic component may create an in-band jammer. The jammer may be, for example, substantially unmodulated if the coupling is predominately from the clock signal, or it may have broader bandwidth if there is significant coupling from the data signals.","According to various aspects, the sampling frequency generated in first receiver  may be dynamically adjusted such that no multiple N*F(where Fis the sampling frequency) falls inside the RF signal bandwidth for any active receiver in the user device, such as second receiver . Thus, a processor (such as the processor\/controller depicted in ) controlling the receivers may be configured to maintain a database of the frequencies in use by all active receivers in the system. In some aspects, software and\/or firmware controlling the receiver may also be used to control the co-located receiver. Accordingly, frequency information and\/or band and channel information associated with the co-located receivers may be passed to the code module associated with the first receiver in real time. In some aspects, the first receiver code module may periodically request frequency information from code modules associated with the co-located receivers via a high-level application programming interface (API). Other methods may also be used. According to some aspects, each receiver has its own processor which stores frequency information for all other receivers. In other aspects, a single processor is used to control all active receivers. An appropriate sampling frequency may be calculated and adjusted whenever an active receiver (e.g., first receiver , second receiver ) is tuned to a new channel. For example, for a CDMA receiver, the sampling frequency may be calculated and adjusted during a hard handoff.","Dynamically adjusting the sampling frequency may also be used to mitigate the effects of potential LO spurs mixing with an RF jammer  depicts a user device  comprising a receiver  and a transmitter . Receiver  may comprise an amplifier , a mixer , a filter , an ADC , an oscillator , a divider , and a phase-locked loop (PLL) . Transmitter  may comprise an amplifier , mixer , filter , DAC , and oscillator . According to some aspects, receiver  and transmitter  operate using different communication protocols. In some aspects, the same communication protocol may be used. One or both of ADC  and DAC  may be located on a baseband IC (not shown), in accordance with some aspects.  will be described wherein receiver  is a GPS receiver and transmitter  is a CDMA transmitter. However, it is noted that this is merely an exemplary configuration, and any other receiver\/transmitter combination may be used.","As depicted in , oscillator  may be used to generate a sampling clock through divider . Path (a) indicates possible coupling of sampling clock\/data signals to the GPS synthesizer. More particularly, PLL  may generate a tuning voltage for oscillator . However, clock and\/or data signals from ADC  may couple to the tuning port of oscillator , and modulate the oscillator control voltage. As a result, the output of the oscillator may include spurious components at frequency offsets N*Ffrom the desired oscillator frequency. Through oscillator self-mixing, these spurs may appear as CW jammers at the receiver output, and\/or they may mix with transmitter leakage to create broadband interference resembling jammer aliasing.","As described above, a co-located transmitter, such as CDMA transmitter  may generate transmit signal leakage, indicated by path (b). The transmitter leakage may generate a baseband jammer that is the mixing product of the leakage and the fundamental tone of oscillator . A CW spur on oscillator  will also mix with the transmitter leakage to create a second baseband jammer at a different frequency. Given sampling frequency Fof ADC  and fundamental frequency Fof oscillator , the RF frequency of the transmitter leakage may be written as F=F+N*F+\u0394F, where N is an integer and |\u0394F|<F\/2. If the oscillator spur has a frequency offset N*Ffrom the oscillator fundamental, then the second baseband jammer has a frequency of F=\u0394F. At the ADC output, this second baseband jammer is indistinguishable from aliasing of the first baseband jammer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7C"],"b":["620","610"],"sub":["S ","GPS ","TX "]},"In accordance with various aspects, the sampling frequency may be dynamically chosen to avoid mixing a jammer signal with an oscillator spur.
