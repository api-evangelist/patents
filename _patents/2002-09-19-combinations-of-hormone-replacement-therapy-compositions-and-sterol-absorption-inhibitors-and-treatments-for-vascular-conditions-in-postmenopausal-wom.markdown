No. 60\/324,118, filed Sep. 21, 2001, and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/166,942, filed Jun. 11, 2002, each incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to compositions, therapeutic combinations and methods for treating vascular conditions in post-menopausal women comprising at least one hormone replacement therapy composition and at least one sterol and\/or 5\u03b1-stanol absorption inhibitor.","Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure and other cerebro- or peripheral vascular diseases are a leading risk factor and a major cause of death worldwide. Recently, trends have shown post-menopausal women to be at a greater risk than previously thought. It is now generally acknowledged that after menopause, protection from vascular disease slowly dwindles over time and by the seventh and eighth decade of life even approaches the frequency found in men. A number of ongoing studies have and are in the process of evaluating this aspect of women's health and determining recommended courses of therapy which may be effective in preventing or treating post-menopausal women who suffer from vascular diseases.","Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been widely used, but has not always been effective. In fact, some studies have suggested increased risks for cancer and vascular conditions when HRT compositions have been administered. Thus, there is a definite need for an effective treatment for vascular disease in post-menopausal women, which has heretofore not been met.","Despite the current approaches for the treatment or prevention of vascular conditions in post-menopausal women, there remains a need in the art for improved compositions and treatments for vascular conditions in post-menopausal women.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising (a) at least one hormone replacement therapy composition; and (b) at least one sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol absorption inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a solvate thereof.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising (a) at least one hormone replacement therapy composition; and (b) at least one substituted azetidinone compound or substituted \u03b2-lactam compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a solvate thereof.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides a combination comprising (a) a first amount of at least one hormone replacement therapy composition; and (b) a second amount of at least one sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol absorption inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a solvate thereof, wherein the first amount and the second amount together comprise a therapeutically effective amount for the treatment or prevention of a vascular condition in a subject or lowering a concentration of a sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol in plasma of a subject.","Pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment or prevention of vascular conditions in subjects such as post-menopausal women, women needing hormone replacement therapy or lowering a concentration of a sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol in plasma of a subject, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the above composition(s) or therapeutic combination(s) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier also are provided.","Methods of treating or preventing vascular conditions in subjects such as post-menopausal women, women needing hormone replacement therapy or lowering a concentration of a sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol in plasma of a subject, comprising the step of administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of the above composition(s) or therapeutic combination(s) also are provided.","Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term \u201cabout.\u201d","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, therapeutic combinations, kits and methods of treatment using the same comprising at least one (one or more) hormone replacement therapy composition and at least one (one or more) sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol absorption inhibitor or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof, such as but not limited to, substituted azetidinone or substituted \u03b2-lactam sterol or 5\u03b1-stanol absorption inhibitors discussed in detail below.","Useful hormone agents and compositions for hormone replacement therapy of the present invention include androgens, estrogens, progestins, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives.

Vascular inflammation refers to arterial damage and bodily responses thereto. Vascular inflammation is an etiological event that often recedes the development and the continual process of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Vascular inflammation, beginning with an injury or change in the endothelial wall of the artery, may cause an alteration in the intimal layer that increases platelet adhesion to the endothelium.","Vascular stimuli to mammals, such as cellular injury or inflammation, may lead to the production of various proteins, commonly called acute response proteins, in the body. One particular type of acute phase protein is c-reactive protein (CRP). Manufactured in the liver and deposited in damaged tissue, CRP is found in high levels in inflammatory fluids and in both the intimal layer of the atherosclerotic artery and within the lesions of atherosclerotic plague.","Studies have shown a positive association between CRP and coronary artery disease. For example, in a survey of 388 British men aged 50\u201369, the prevalence of coronary artery disease increased 1.5 fold for each doubling of CRP level (Mendall MA, Patel P, Ballam L, et al., \u201cC-reactive protein and its relation to cardiovascular risk factor: A population based cross sectional study \u201d, 1996; 312:1061\u20131065.). Multiple prospective studies have also demonstrated that baseline CRP is a good marker of future cardiovascular events (Riker P, Haughie P. Prospective studies of C-reactive protein as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 1998; 46:391\u2013395.).","For example, cholesteryl esters are a major component of atherosclerotic lesions which results in vascular inflammation and an increase in plasma c-reactive protein levels. The inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation and reduction of serum cholesterol can inhibit the progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation, thereby treating or preventing vascular inflammation. Moreover, these sterol absorption inhibitors are useful lowering or controlling c-reactive protein blood levels in a mammal to less than about 3.4 mg\/dL, desirably to less than 1.0 mg\/dL, and more desirably to less than 0.4 mg\/dL. Methods for reducing blood c-reactive protein levels are further described in assignee's U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/247,032, entitled \u201cMETHODS FOR TREATING OR PREVENTING VASCULAR INFLAMMATION USING STEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR(S)\u201d and filed on same day herewith, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Mixtures of any of the pharmacological or therapeutic agents described above can be used in the compositions and therapeutic combinations of these other embodiments of the present invention.","The compositions and therapeutic combinations of the present invention can be administered to a subject in need of such treatment in a therapeutically effective amount to treat vascular conditions, such as vascular conditions in post-menopausal women.
