{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to cloud computing, and more particularly, to secure password-based authentication for cloud computing resource access.","Cloud computing is becoming an increasingly popular mode for computerized access to both data and application programs. By using cloud computing, users may provide a centralized depository for shared data, a secure backup and file storage, use of applications programs that can run on relatively higher-speed cloud servers, etc. By using cloud computing services, users may increase the level of integrity of their data in that a third party with a dedicated focus on data processing is in charge of maintaining the security and integrity of data. Cloud computing users may feel relatively certain that their data is backed up and their security maintained by the cloud service provider (CSP).","Another advantage for users of cloud-computing services is the access to powerful application programs that may be prohibitively or unnecessarily expensive for a user to acquire and maintain. A cloud-service provider may provide access to certain application programs either for a small fee or on some other revenue model that is advantageous to their users as compared to the users having the same or equivalent programs running locally on user machines.","One crucial aspect for the cloud computing model to work is that the data managed by the CSPs on behalf of their users must be secure and that only authorized individuals and entities may access application programs hosted in the cloud. Traditionally such user validation is performed using the username-password model. The username-passwords are transmitted to the API of the CSP by a client program executing on a client computer. Often the username-passwords are embedded in requests made to the CSP by the client program.","The aforementioned authentication mechanism is prone to attack. Because client computers and client programs are used to formulate requests, the client program is aware of the password and thus cannot be completely trusted. Furthermore, the password is vulnerable to phishing attacks, to snooping, to poor user practices such as leaving passwords on notes, to keystroke loggers, etc.","However, even with such vulnerabilities, cloud service providers are reluctant to adopt more secure authentication methods\u2014such as digital signatures, TLS mutual authentication, or cryptographic hash\u2014that do not reveal passwords to the client programs because doing so would require expensive and cumbersome modifications to the cloud service infrastructure.","From the foregoing it will be apparent that there is still a need for an improved mechanism for secure password-based cloud computing application programming interfaces without burdening cloud computing service providers with extensive modifications to cloud computing infrastructure.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.

In addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.

Such requests must be authenticated. Therefore, each API request includes a client authentication that proves to the cloud service provider that the client has been authorized to access the requested cloud resource .","In the scenarios of , the user  knows and enters the password on the personal computer , for example, in the client program  or in a web browser  that is interacting with the client program . The password is then transmitted to the cloud services  with each API request, for example in an HTTP request header, and the cloud services  verify the correctness of the password against a password database.","Because the client application  forms and sends the request, the client application  has direct access to the password . Password-based authentication is very weak and vulnerable to many forms of attack including phishing, snooping, user error such as leaving notes with passwords where visible, keystroke logging, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIGS. 5 and 6","FIGS. 1 and 3"],"b":["501","501","103","503","103","103","501"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["501","701","703","801","701","701","801","503"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["801","501","801","803","805","807","809","811","503","103","801","701","813","801","805","809","203","805","809"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["501","203","105","105"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["The cloud service  uses password-based authentication methodology, albeit, modified as described below.","The user stores a password or password equivalent on the security device . The techniques described herein are primarily described as password-based. However, in many cases password-equivalent information may be used in lieu of an actual password memorized by a user. Such password-equivalents may be obtained using one-way hash or encryption techniques. The same password or password-equivalent is stored by the cloud service  in a password database.","The client application  executing on the client computer  requests the security device  to provide the username-password when client application  sends requests to the server to access cloud resources .","The security device  presents a derivative of the password. The derivative is unique for each use, i.e., for each request, and contains some information by which the cloud service  may verify the derivative of the password. The cloud service  verifies the derivative of the password against its existing database of passwords\/password-equivalents."]}}}},"The following steps are predicated on successful authentication of the user to the security device . This authentication is not shown in .","The client program  determines the need for access to a cloud resource , step . This may occur when a user makes a request to, for example, execute a software program residing in the cloud, retrieve a computer file stored as a cloud resource, or perform any certain task using the client program  which needs to access a cloud resource .","The client program  requests the security device  to return the username and password of the user, step . The request may be directed to a password applet  of the security device .","The security device , for example, directed by instructions from the password applet , computes a derivative password (P\u2032) derived from the user's password, step . The user's password may be stored in NVM  of the security device .","To compute the derivative password the password module  uses a function F which takes the password and a parameter R as input:\n\n(,Password)\n","Function F may be a pre-specified one-way cryptography function. R should change on each computation of the derived password. R could be a pseudo-random number, a time based number, or any other number that is near-guaranteed to not repeat. For example, the derived password is a one-way cryptographic hashing of R using the password as the key.","In an alternative embodiment, multiple parameters are used in conjunction with the password to compute the value F. It is, for example, advantageous to combine a pseudo-random number with a time stamp. Such a combination provides a powerful tool against replay attacks and brute force attacks attempting to foil a password-based authentication mechanism.","P\u2032 is a concatenation of R and F(R, Password):\n\n(,Password)\n\nwherein the word concatenation is used broadly to mean any method of combining R and F(R,Password) such that R may be backed out of P\u2032. That could be a concatenation in a traditional sense where R is of some certain length. However, it could be any other method of combining R and F in which R may be determined from the result.\n","Let's consider an example. If the password is \u201cloesenord\u201d and R is 333333, F(R,password)=F(333333, loesenord) which, for the purpose of the example, could be A4FE337D. P\u2032 would then be\u2014using strict concatenation\u2014333333A4FE337D. If it is known that R is always the first 6 digits of a request, the recipient may back out that R has the value 333333.","The security device  responds with the username and derived password P\u2032, step .","The client program  then formulates the request including the username and the derived password P\u2032, step .","The client computer  then transmits the request to the cloud service  executing on the cloud server , step .","The cloud service  determines R from the received request, step . As in the example above, if the received request contains the derivative password P\u2032 and by convention R is the first 6 digits of the derivative password P\u2032, the cloud service would determine that R equals 333333.","If multiple parameters are used to calculate the derivative password, the cloud service  determines each of the parameters by backing them out of the received request.","Having determined the value of the parameter(s) R, the cloud service  computes a derivative password (P\u2033) by applying the same parameter(s) R to the password for the user having the received username stored in a password database  that the cloud service maintains, step . The password database  may be stored in the cloud server  or as a separate network node.","If the password or password-equivalent used by the client program  to compute the derivative password is the same as the password or password-equivalent stored on the cloud server , the derivative password (P\u2033) computed by the cloud service  would be the same as the received derivative-password (P\u2032).","The cloud service  compares the received derivative-password (P\u2032) and the computed derivative-password (P\u2033), step . If the two passwords do not match, access to the cloud resource is denied, step . Some form of recovery from having an incorrect password maybe offered to the user, e.g., to try using a different security device or inviting the user to use a password recovery mechanism.","If the two passwords do match, the requested access is granted, step .","As noted above, in an alternative, the cloud service  may store the hash of the password in the password database . In that case, the security device  uses a one-way hash of the password instead of the actual password as the basis for the derivative password. To compute the derivative password, the client program would include the hash (H(P)) instead of P directly in the function F:\n\n((password))\n\nA corresponding formula is used by the cloud service .\n","In yet another alternative, the derivative password is computed using the public key of the cloud service :\n\nEncr(,password)\n\nA corresponding formula is used by the cloud service . The cloud service  is further modified to compute the server-side derivative password (P\u2033) by:\n\nDecr()\n\nIn other regards, this alternative operates in the same manner as previously discussed alternatives.\n","Alternatively, the security device  computes the derivative password (P\u2032) by encrypting the password and the timestamp using a secret key shared with the server. In this embodiment, the security device  is operated to compute the derivative password (P\u2032) by:\n\nEncr(,password)\n","Conversely, the cloud service  computes the server-side derivative password (P\u2033) by:\n\nDecr()\n","In yet another alternative, the security device  creates the derivative password (P\u2032) by encrypting the password using a secret key shared with the cloud service .","From the foregoing it will be apparent that a password-based authentication mechanism has been provided. The described mechanism enhances security to password-based authentication without adding a burden on cloud service providers to significantly redesign their authentication platforms.","Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated, the invention is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangements of parts so described and illustrated herein.
