No. 09\/545,237, filed Apr. 7, 2000, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,400, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","It has become increasingly clear in recent years that cell death is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division: where proliferation exists, so must a means of regulating its cellular progeny. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair, surplus or even harmful cells are generated, and they must be removed or killed. In adults, senescent cells are removed and replaced by newly generated cells to maintain homeostasis.","The delicate interplay between growth and cell death in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division; arrests in the cell cycle; or commits to programmed cell death. Signal transduction is the term describing the process of conversion of extracellular signals, such as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and others, to a specific intracellular response such as gene expression, cell division, or apoptosis. This process begins at the cell membrane where an external stimulus initiates a cascade of enzymatic reactions inside the cell that typically include phosphorylation of proteins as mediators of downstream processes which most often end in an event in the cell nucleus. The checks and balances of these signal transduction pathways can be thought of as overlapping networks of interacting molecules that control \u201cgo-no go\u201dcontrol points. Since almost all known diseases exhibit dysfunctional aspects in these networks, there has been a great deal of enthusiasm for research that provides targets and therapeutic agents based on signal transduction components linked to disease.","Dysregulation of cell proliferation, or a lack of appropriate cell death, has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation, inflammation, tissue remodelling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers, restenosis, neointimal hyperplasia, angiogenesis, endometriosis, lymphoproliferative disorders, graft-rejection, polyposis, loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodelling, and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division, and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.","In one example, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, muscle cells, and others undergo apoptosis when they lose contact with extracellular matrix, or bind through an inappropriate integrin. This phenomenon, which has been termed \u201canoikis\u201d(the Greek word for \u201chomelessness\u201d), prevents shed epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere, thus protecting against neoplasia, endometriosis, and the like. It is also an important mechanism in the initial cavitation step of embryonic development, in mammary gland involution, and has been exploited to prevent tumor angiogenesis. Epithelial cells may become resistant to anoikis through overactivation of integrin signaling. Anoikis resistance can also arise from the loss of apoptotic signaling, for example, by overexpression of Bcl-2 or inhibition of caspase activity.","An aspect of hyperproliferation that is often linked to tumor growth is angiogenesis. The growth of new blood vessels is essential for the later stages of solid tumor growth. Angiogenesis is caused by the migration and proliferation of the endothelial cells that form blood vessels.","In another example, a major group of systemic autoimmune diseases is associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation, as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often such diseases are associated with inflammation, for example with rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and the like. Recent progress has been made in understanding the causes and consequences of these abnormalities. At the molecular level, multiple defects may occur, which result in a failure to set up a functional apoptotic machinery.","The development of compounds that inhibit hyperproliferative diseases, particularly where undesirable cells are selectively targeted, is of great medical and commercial interest.","Relevant literature:","Triazolylated tertiary amine compounds are provided in U.S. Pat.

The method of Pechmann and Nold (Ber. 29:2588, 1896) is one of the earliest reported methods to synthesize 1,2,3-thiadiazoles. This method utilizes the reaction of diazomethane and phenyl isothiocyanate (or more broadly, thiocarbonyl compounds) and may be utilized to prepare 5-amine substituted 1,2,3-thiadiazoles and 4,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-thiadiazoles. The method of Wolff (Ann. Chemie, 325:129, 1902) is another long-standing method to synthesize 1,2,3-thiadiazoles. According to the Wolff method, 1,2,3-thiadiazoles are obtained by treating diazoketones with a thionating reagent. A modification of the Wolff method utilizes diazoacetonitriles and hydrogen sulfide. The method of Hurd and Mori (J Am. Chem. Soc. 77:5359, 1955) provides a reaction between hydrozones and thionyl chloride to afford 1,2,3-thiadiazole compounds, and is a preferred approach to preparing compounds of the present invention.","More specifically, compounds of the present invention may be prepared by one or more of the following general synthetic methods. One general synthetic method is illustrated in Scheme 1. \n\n","As shown in Scheme 1, a solution of t-BuOK (1 equivalent) in anhydrous THF was cooled in an ice water bath under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Suitable acetoacetamide and isothiocyanate compounds are commercially available and\/or have been described in the chemical literature. The ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was brought back to room temperature and stirred for about 1 hour. Water was added to the mixture and the resulting solution was kept stirring at room temperature for about 1 h. A solution of 1 N HCl solution was added to adjust the pH of the solution to about 7. The precipitate obtained was collected and dried to provide the amidoamine compound of the formula RRNC(\u2550O)CHC(S)NHR.","The amidoamine compound of the formula RRNC(\u2550O)CHC(S)NHR(1 equivalent) was dissolved in a solution of anhydrous ethanol and triethylamine (1 equivalent).

More particularly, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by combination with appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants, gels, microspheres, and aerosols. As such, administration of the compounds can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, intracheal, etc., administration.

They may also be used in appropriate association with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.","For oral preparations, the compounds can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.","The compounds can be formulated into preparations for injections by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.","The compounds can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.","Furthermore, the compounds can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.","Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more compounds of the present invention. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the compound of the present invention in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Implants for sustained release formulations are well-known in the art. Implants are formulated as microspheres, slabs, etc. with biodegradable or non-biodegradable polymers. For example, polymers of lactic acid and\/or glycolic acid form an erodible polymer that is well-tolerated by the host. The implant containing the inhibitory compounds is placed in proximity to the site of the tumor, so that the local concentration of active agent is increased relative to the rest of the body.","The term \u201cunit dosage form\u201d, as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of compounds of the present invention calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present invention depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host.","The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.","The combined use of the provided inhibitory compounds and other cytotoxic agents has the advantages that the required dosages for the individual drugs is lower, and the effect of the different drugs complementary. Depending on the patient and condition being treated and on the administration route, the subject inhibitory compounds may be administered in dosages of 0.1 \u03bcg to 10 mg\/kg body weight per day. The range is broad, since in general the efficacy of a therapeutic effect for different mammals varies widely with doses typically being 20, 30 or even 40 times smaller (per unit body weight) in man than in the rat. Similarly the mode of administration can have a large effect on dosage. Thus for example oral dosages in the rat may be ten times the injection dose. Higher doses may be used for localized routes of delivery.","A typical dosage may be a solution suitable for intravenous administration; a tablet taken from two to six times daily, or one time-release capsule or tablet taken once a day and containing a proportionally higher content of active ingredient, etc. The time-release effect may be obtained by capsule materials that dissolve at different pH values, by capsules that release slowly by osmotic pressure, or by any other known means of controlled release.","Those of skill will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific compound, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to side effects. Some of the specific compounds are more potent than others. Preferred dosages for a given compound are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. A preferred means is to measure the physiological potency of a given compound.","For use in the subject methods, the subject compounds may be formulated with other pharmaceutically active agents, particularly other anti-metastatic, anti-tumor or anti-angiogenic agents. Angiostatic compounds of interest include angiostatin, endostatin, carboxy terminal peptides of collagen alpha (XV), etc. Cytotoxic and cytostatic agents of interest include adriamycin, alkeran, Ara-C, BICNU, busulfan, CNNU, cisplatinum, cytoxan, daunorubicin, DTIC, 5-FU, hydrea, ifosfamide, methotrexate, mithramycin, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, nitrogen mustard, velban, vincristine, vinblastine, VP-16, carboplatinum, fludarabine, gemcitabine, idarubicin, irinotecan, leustatin, navelbine, taxol, taxotere, topotecan, etc.","The subject compounds are administered to a subject having a hyperproliferative disorders, e.g. to inhibit tumor growth, to inhibit angiogenesis, to decrease inflammation associated with a lymphoproliferative disorder, to inhibit graft rejection, or neurological damage due to tissue repair, etc. The present compounds are useful for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes. As used herein, the term \u201ctreating\u201d is used to refer to both prevention of disease, and treatment of pre-existing conditions. The prevention of proliferation is accomplished by administration of the subject compounds prior to development of overt disease, e.g. to prevent the regrowth of tumors, prevent metastatic growth, diminish restenosis associated with cardiovascularsurgery, etc. Alternatively the compounds are used to treat ongoing disease, by stabilizing or improving the clinical symptoms of the patient.","The host, or patient, may be from any mammalian species, e.g. primate sp., particularly humans; rodents, including mice, rats and hamsters; rabbits; equines, bovines, canines, felines; etc. Animal models are of interest for experimental investigations, providing a model for treatment of human disease.","The susceptibility of a particular cell to treatment with the subject compounds may be determined by in vitro testing. Typically a culture of the cell is combined with a subject compound at varying concentrations for a period of time sufficient to allow the active agents to induce cell death or inhibit migration, usually between about one h and one week. For in vitro testing, cultured cells from a biopsy sample may be used. The viable cells left after treatment are then counted.","The dose will vary depending on the specific compound utilized, specific disorder, patient status, etc. Typically a therapeutic dose will be sufficient to substantially decrease the undesirable cell population in the targeted tissue, while maintaining patient viability. Treatment will generally be continued until there is a substantial reduction, e.g. at least about 50%, decrease in the cell burden, and may be continued until there are essentially none of the undesirable cells detected in the body.","The compounds also find use in the specific inhibition of signaling pathway mediated by protein kinases. Protein kinases are involved in signaling pathways for such important cellular activities as responses to extracellular signals and cell cycle checkpoints. Inhibition of specific protein kinases provides a means of intervening in these signaling pathways, for example to block the effect of an extracellular signal, to release a cell from cell cycle checkpoint, etc. Defects in the activity of protein kinases are associated with a variety of pathological or clinical conditions, where there is a defect in signaling mediated by protein kinases. Such conditions include those associated with defects in cell cycle regulation or in response to extracellular signals, e.g. hyperglycemia and diabetes Type I and Type II, immunological disorders, e.g. autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases; hyperproliferative disorders, which may include psoriasis, arthritis, inflammation, angiogenesis, endometriosis, scarring, cancer, etc.","The compounds of the present invention are active in inhibiting purified kinase proteins, i.e. there is a decrease in the phosphorylation of a specific substrate in the presence of the compound. A protein kinase of particular interest in integrin linked kinase (ILK). ILK is a serine threonine kinase. The DNA and predicted amino acid sequence may be accessed at Genbank, no. U40282, or as published in Hannigan et al. (1996) 379:91-96. ILK regulates integrin extracellular activity (ECM interactions) from inside the cell via its direct interaction with the integrin subunit. Interfering with ILK activity allows the specific targeting of integrin function, while leaving other essential signaling pathways intact. Increased levels of cellular ILK activity short circuits the normal requirement for adhesion to extracellular membrane in regulating cell growth. Thus, inhibiting ILK activity may inhibit anchorage-independent cell growth.","It is also known that many cell types undergo apoptosis if the appropriate contacts with extracellular matrix proteins are not maintained (anoikis). The induction of apoptosis by the subject compounds in such cells predicts an association with the ILK signaling pathway.","The compounds of the present invention bind to protein kinases at a high affinity, and find use as affinity reagents for the isolation and\/or purification of such kinases. Affinity chromatography is used as a method of separating and purifying protein kinases and phosphatases using the biochemical affinity of the enzyme for inhibitors that act on it. The compounds are coupled to a matrix or gel. Preferably a microsphere or matrix is used as the support. Such supports are known in the art and commercially available. The inhibitor coupled support is used to separate an enzyme that binds to the inhibitor from a complex mixture, e.g. a cell lysate, that may optionally be partially purified. The sample mixture is contacted with the inhibitor coupled support under conditions that minimize non-specific binding. Methods known in the art include columns, gels, capillaries, etc. The unbound compounds are washed free of the resin, and the bound proteins are then eluted in a suitable buffer.","The compounds of the invention may also be useful as reagents for studying signal transduction or any of the clinical disorders listed throughout this application.","There are many disorders associated with a dysregulation of cellular proliferation. The conditions of interest include, but are not limited to, the following conditions.","The subject methods are applied to the treatment of a variety of conditions where there is proliferation and\/or migration of smooth muscle cells, and\/or inflammatory cells into the intimal layer of a vessel, resulting in restricted blood flow through that vessel, i.e. neointimal occlusive lesions. Occlusive vascular conditions of interest include atherosclerosis, graft coronary vascular disease after transplantation, vein graft stenosis, peri-anastomatic prosthetic graft stenosis, restenosis after angioplasty or stent placement, and the like.","Diseases where there is hyperproliferation and tissue remodelling or repair of reproductive tissue, e.g. uterine, testicular and ovarian carcinomas, endometriosis, squamous and glandular epithelial carcinomas of the cervix, etc. are reduced in cell number by administration of the subject compounds","Tumor cells are characterized by uncontrolled growth, invasion to surrounding tissues, and metastatic spread to distant sites. Growth and expansion requires an ability not only to proliferate, but also to down-modulate cell death (apoptosis) and activate angiogenesis to produce a tumor neovasculature. Angiogenesis may be inhibited by affecting the cellular ability to interact with the extracellular environment and to migrate, which is an integrin-specific function, or by regulating apoptosis of the endothelial cells. Integrins function in cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesive interactions and transduce signals from the ECM to the cell interior and vice versa. Since these properties implicate integrin involvement in cell migration, invasion, intra- and extra-vasation, and platelet interaction, a role for integrins in tumor growth and metastasis is obvious.","Tumors of interest for treatment include carcinomas, e.g. colon, duodenal, prostate, breast, melanoma, ductal, hepatic, pancreatic, renal, endometrial, stomach, dysplastic oral mucosa, polyposis, invasive oral cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, transitional and squamous cell urinary carcinoma etc.; neurological malignancies, e.g. neuroblastoma, gliomas, etc.; hematological malignancies, e.g. childhood acute leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, malignant cutaneous T-cells, mycosis fungoides, non-MF cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, lymphomatoid papulosis, T-cell rich cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, bullous pemphigoid, discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, etc.; and the like.","Some cancers of particular interest include breast cancers, which are primarily adenocarcinoma subtypes. Ductal carcinoma in situ is the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer. In DCIS, the malignant cells have not metastasized through the walls of the ducts into the fatty tissue of the breast. Infiltrating (or invasive) ductal carcinoma (IDC) has metastasized through the wall of the duct and invaded the fatty tissue of the breast. Infiltrating (or invasive) lobular carcinoma (ILC) is similar to IDC, in that it has the potential metastasize elsewhere in the body. About 10% to 15% of invasive breast cancers are invasive lobular carcinomas.","Also of interest is non-small cell lung carcinoma. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is made up of three general subtypes of lung cancer. Epidermoid carcinoma (also called squamous cell carcinoma) usually starts in one of the larger bronchial tubes and grows relatively slowly. The size of these tumors can range from very small to quite large. Adenocarcinoma starts growing near the outside surface of the lung and may vary in both size and growth rate. Some slowly growing adenocarcinomas are described as alveolar cell cancer. Large cell carcinoma starts near the surface of the lung, grows rapidly, and the growth is usually fairly large when diagnosed. Other less common forms of lung cancer are carcinoid, cylindroma, mucoepidermoid, and malignant mesothelioma.","Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes. Although most melanomas arise in the skin, they also may arise from mucosal surfaces or at other sites to which neural crest cells migrate. Melanoma occurs predominantly in adults, and more than half of the cases arise in apparently normal areas of the skin. Prognosis is affected by clinical and histological factors and by anatomic location of the lesion. Thickness and\/or level of invasion of the melanoma, mitotic index, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and ulceration or bleeding at the primary site affect the prognosis. Clinical staging is based on whether the tumor has spread to regional lymph nodes or distant sites. For disease clinically confined to the primary site, the greater the thickness and depth of local invasion of the melanoma, the higher the chance of lymph node metastases and the worse the prognosis. Melanoma can spread by local extension (through lymphatics) and\/or by hematogenous routes to distant sites. Any organ may be involved by metastases, but lungs and liver are common sites.","Other hyperproliferative diseases of interest relate to epidermal hyperproliferation, tissue remodelling and repair. For example, the chronic skin inflammation of psoriasis is associated with hyperplastic epidermal keratinocytes as well as infiltrating mononuclear cells, including CD4+ memory T cells, neutrophils and macrophages.","The proliferation of immune cells is associated with a number of autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. Diseases of interest include multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Evidence suggests that abnormalities in apoptosis play a part in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Other lymphoproliferative conditions the inherited disorder of lymphocyte apoptosis, which is an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, as well as a number of leukemias and lymphomas. Symptoms of allergies to environmental and food agents, as well as inflammatory bowel disease, may also be alleviated by the compounds of the invention.","The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the subject invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what is regarded as the invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to the numbers used (e.g. amounts, temperature, concentrations, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be allowed for. Unless otherwise indicated, parts are parts by weight, molecular weight is average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees centigrade; and pressure is at or near atmospheric.","Compounds are screened using a series of disease related kinase targets, such as integrin linked kinase-1. Synthesized libraries of compounds are tested against each of the targets to find compounds that inhibit one of the targets preferentially. The desired in vitro potency of the inhibitor is such that the compound is useful as a therapeutic agent, i.e. in the nanomolar or micromolar range.","Inhibition of the targets is measured by scintillation counting; the incorporation of radioactive phosphate onto a specific substrate which is immobilized onto a filter paper at the end of the assay. To provide meaningful measurements of inhibition, the assays are performed both in the absence and presence of specific and known inhibitors, and the amount of incorporated radioactivity is compared to provide a baseline measurement.","The baseline activity is the amount of radioactivity incorporated in the absence of inhibitor. The amount of radioactivity incorporated in the presence of an inhibitor is called the \u2018sample activity\u2019, and the % inhibition is expressed by the following formula:\n\n% inhibition=100\u2212sample activity\/baseline activity*100) \n\nand is usually expressed in conjunction with the compound concentration. By using a range of inhibitor concentrations, the ICof an inhibitor is estimated (i.e. the concentration at which enzymatic activity is reduced by 50%). The ICof various compounds against a particular target can be compared, where a lower IC50 indicates a more potent compound.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n","Inhibition Assay: Compounds listed in Table 1 were lyophilized and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. Stock solutions were made by weighing out the compounds and dissolving them in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a standard concentration, usually 20 mM, and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. The compounds were diluted to a starting intermediate concentration of 250 \u03bcM in 1% DMSO, then serially diluted across a row of a 96 well plate using serial 2 fold dilution steps. Diluted 100% DMSO was used as a negative control.","A volume of 5 \u03bcl of each compound dilution were robotically pipetted to Costar serocluster plates maintaining the same plate format. All assays consisted of the following volumes:","5 \u03bcl diluted compound","10 \u03bcl enzyme preparation","5 \u03bcl substrate","5 \u03bcl assay ATP","and were then incubated 15 min at room temperature.","From each reaction, 10 \u03bcl of reaction mix was spotted onto Millipore Multiscreen-PH opaque plates and washed 2\u00d710 min in 1% phosphoric acid. The plates were dried for at 40\u00b0 C. for 30 min, then the substrate phosphate complexes were quantitated by scintillation counting. These Millipore plates are in a 96 well format with immobilized P81 phosphocellulose membranes. Both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated form of the substrate bind to the membrane while ATP (unincorporated phosphate) is removed in the subsequent wash steps. Results for various compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1 below.","Integrin Linked Kinase: The target integrin linked kinase is a full-length recombinant protein expressed in sF9 insect cells by baculovirus infection. The ILK1 substrate is CKRRRLASLR-amide.","Recombinant ILK protein was expressed using cultured insect cells and a baculovirus expression system. Standard techniques for DNA manipulation were used to produce recombinant DNA molecules and baculoviruses (Sambrook. J., Fritsch, E.F. and Maniatis, T. 1989. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. Second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. NY; Crossen, R. and Gruenwald, S. 1998. Baculovirus expression Vector System Manual. 5Edition. Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) The ILK open reading frame (Hannigan et al., supra.), excluding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032untranslated regions, was inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen) to produce a GST fusion protein under the control of the strong AcNPV polyhedrin promoter. A large scale plasmid preparation of the resulting transfer construct was made using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit. This ILK transfer construct was then co-transfected with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) and a high titre preparation of GST-ILK recombinant baculovirus was produced by amplification in Sf9 cells. Liter scale expression of GST-ILK recombinant protein was done in 1000 ml spinner flasks (Bellco) by infection of Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen) grown in Ex-Cell 400 Serum Free Media (JRH Biosciences) at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 5. The cells were harvested three days after infection and lysed in Hypotonic Lysis Buffer (HLB; 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ug\/ml PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine) by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 20 min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed twice in HLB and then washed twice in High Salt Buffer (HSB; 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ug\/ml PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine). The pellet was then resuspended in DNAse-ATP Buffer (DAB; 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM MnCl, \u03b2-methyI aspartic acid, 2 mM NaF, 0.55 mg\/ml ATP, 1 ug\/ml DNAse I, 1% NP-40, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ug\/ml PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine) and stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 10,000 xg for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in High Salt Detergent Buffer (HDB; 1% NP-40, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 10 ug\/ml PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine), stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and then centrufuged at 10,000 xg for 20 min. The pellet was then washed once in each of HDB, HSB, and HLB, centrifuging at 10,000 xg each time. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in HLB.","The recombinant ILK expressed in insect cells with a baculovirus system was solubilized by treating the insoluble ILK protein with DNAse I and detergents. This produced an ILK protein preparation in the form of a microparticle suspension. This preparation had a high specific activity and was amenable to automated kinase assays.","Results:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0140","num":"0139"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"357pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The detection of cell death due to apoptosis relies on the cleavage of specific protease substrates, which are assayed by colorimetric or fluorometric methods.
