title: Systems and methods for retirement gap insurance
abstract: Methods and systems for retirement planning that provides an insurance against a failure to obtain a desired retirement savings amount because of market forces. A retirement planning engine may run on a server and operates to determine a customer's retirement plans. The retirement planning engine may define a customer's retirement plan using one or more savings or investment vehicles, and details an amount to be saved of time in order to provide a desired income for the customer's retirement years. In some implementations, the retirement planning engine may offer a retirement “gap” insurance product to the customer to protect against a difference between the amount saved by the customer and the amount needed to achieve desired annual income for the retirement years. The insurance policy may cover this “gap” if the customer adheres to the plan defined by the retirement planning engine.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["When tough economic times hit, individuals wonder whether they will be able to live comfortably on their retirement income. People who do not save for retirement during their employment years may face disappointment in the quality of life during their retirement years. As a general rule, people need 60 to 80 percent of their preretirement income to maintain their present standard of living. Government benefits, such as social security benefits, provide only a portion of that retirement income. Because income from social security and employer-sponsored plans may not meet retirement income needs, individuals may supplement their social security and pension income with personal savings and investments.","However, setting aside funds into personal savings and investments is not a guarantee for success. For example, market forces beyond a person's control may adversely affect retirement savings. If negative market forces should come into play during years close to retirement, a person may find that his\/her expected standard of living in retirement may be much lower than expected. In addition, there is a likelihood that individuals in such a position will not be able to make up for losses before entering retirement.","Methods and systems for retirement planning that provides an insurance against a failure to obtain a desired retirement savings amount because of market forces. A retirement planning engine may run on a server and operates to determine several factors associated with a customer's retirement plans. The retirement planning engine may define a customer's retirement plan using one or more savings or investment vehicles, and details an amount to be saved of time in order to provide a desired income for the customer for in the customer's retirement years.","In some implementations, the retirement planning engine may offer a retirement \u201cgap\u201d insurance product to the customer. For example, a difference (i.e., gap) may exist between the amount saved by the customer and the amount needed to achieve desired annual income for the retirement years. The retirement gap insurance policy may cover this \u201cgap\u201d in exchange for the customer adhering to the plan defined by the retirement planning engine and paying a policy premium.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.","Illustrated in  is an example environment in which the systems and methods for providing retirement gap insurance may be implemented. The system  may be implemented as a client\/server system through a network infrastructure , such as the Internet, a WAN, LAN, etc. In this regard, any computer system or environment having any number of processing, memory, or storage units, and any number of applications and processes occurring simultaneously, is considered suitable for use in connection with the system  and methods described herein below. An example computing device is illustrated in .","An enterprise system  is provided which may include a web server , an application server , and a database server  with an associated data store . Also included in the enterprise system may be a plurality of enterprise client computers , such as computers may be operated by customer service representatives. The data store  may include internal customer account information, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts and\/or liability accounts (e.g., lines of credit, mortgages, auto loans, etc.) that may be held at a financial services institution associated with the system .","An external source  may be other financial services institutions that hold the one or more accounts associated with an individual. The account information may be stored in a data store . The data store  may include customer account information, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, brokerage accounts, retirement accounts and\/or liability accounts that may affect a customer's retirement planning determinations.","A retirement planning engine  may run on a server and operates to determine several factors associated with a customer's retirement plans. For example, the retirement planning engine  may determine and\/or receive information regarding: an age the customer wishes to retire, an annual desired income for the customer's retirement years (e.g., 80% of a current annual salary), a current market value of all of the customer's savings and investments (both internal and external accounts), an annualized rate of return (net of inflation) on investments (e.g., inflation may be 4% annually and a rate of return may be 6-10%), an estimate of a customer's pension plan value, and an estimate the value of the customer's social security benefits. As will be described below in greater detail, the retirement planning engine  may query the customer with regard to personal and financial information in order to determine an appropriate retirement plan.","The retirement planning engine  may define a customer's retirement plan using one or more savings or investment vehicles. One type of savings plan is the employer-sponsored retirement plan allowing employee deferrals (401(k) plans). In such a plan, an employee's contributions are deducted from their salary as a pretax contribution (reducing their current taxable income) and any investment earnings are tax deferred until withdrawn. These plans often include employer-matching contributions that make these types of plans an effective savings plan for retirement.","Individual retirement accounts (IRAs), like employer-sponsored retirement plans, feature tax deferral of earnings. An IRA is a personal savings plan that offers specific tax benefits. Traditional IRAs may enable a consumer to lower their taxable income through deductible contributions. Roth IRAs do not permit tax-deductible contributions, but do allow the consumer to make tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.","Another way of saving for the future is through annuities. Annuities are generally funded with after-tax dollars, but their earnings are tax-deferred. There is generally no annual limit on contributions to an annuity. A typical annuity provides income payments beginning at some future time, usually at retirement. Other savings vehicles may life insurance products, non-deferred investment accounts, etc.","The retirement planning engine  may produce a retirement or investment plan for the customer that details an amount to be saved of time in order to provide a desired income for the customer for in the customer's retirement years. In some implementations, the retirement planning engine  may offer a retirement \u201cgap\u201d insurance product to the customer. As noted above, to achieve the desired annual income for the customer's retirement years, the above factors of inflation and rate of return are utilized. However, it is possible that inflation is higher than expected or the rate of return is lower than the rate utilized by the retirement planning engine  in its analysis. As such, a customer approaching retirement years may not have enough actual saving to achieve the desired annual income input to the retirement planning engine . This difference between the amount saved by the customer and the desired annual income for the retirement years is the \u201cgap.\u201d In accordance with some implementations, the retirement gap insurance policy may cover this \u201cgap\u201d in exchange for the customer adhering to a plan defined by the retirement planning engine  and paying a policy premium.","For example, if the customer is 40 years old and would like to retire at age 65 with an annual income of $50,000 per year, the retirement planning engine  may determine the customer needs to accumulated $1.125 million in retirement savings. The retirement planning engine  may determine that the customer should save $1,700 per month in a combination of tax-deferred retirement and taxable savings accounts. An additional premium amount may be added for the retirement gap coverage (e.g., $250\/month) based on the customer's age, economic forecasts, historical investment performance, etc., as underwriting factors. If the customer agrees to terms the conditions of the retirement gap insurance policy, the customer would deposit, e.g., $1,950 per month with the financial services institution as a periodic payment amount to cover the retirement savings and premium amounts. The premium amount may be adjusted during the coverage period for changes in inflation, rate of return, age of the customer, and other risk factors.","The financial services institution may invest the funds as determined or adjusted by the retirement planning engine  or accordance with other parameters. Thus, if the customer adheres to the investment schedule set by the retirement planning engine  by making the periodic payments until the retirement age, and the market forces should adversely affect the rate of return or rate of inflation such that the customer falls short of the goal of $1.125 million (i.e., the retirement savings), the retirement gap insurance policy would make up the difference between the shortfall and the $1.125 million amount determined by the retirement planning engine . As such, the customer may be provided with peace of mind because the retirement gap insurance policy would insure against adverse market conditions.","It some implementations, the retirement planning engine  may provide a drawdown schedule whereby the customer will receive periodic payments upon attaining the specified retirement age. The drawdown schedule may be created based on expected number of years a customer will live into retirement, the rate of inflation, the rate of return of the customer's investments, and the annual income the customer desires to receive during the retirement years. The drawdown schedule may be enforced by the retirement planning engine  such that the customer is unable to withdraw funds at a rate exceeding the schedule except under predetermined circumstances.","In some implementations, the retirement planning engine  may pool funds of all customers to reduce exposure to market fluctuations. For example, a severe downturn may occur which has an adverse effect on older customers in the pool. However, because younger customers are still paying into the pool, the risk to the financial services institution may be mitigated if the downturn is not for an extended period of time. In some implementations, the financial services institution may mitigate exposure by placing a cap on the gap to be insured. For example, coverage may be limited to a gap of 25% between the customer's actual savings and the determined retirement savings needed to provide the annual income requested by customer when performing the retirement planning using the retirement planning engine .","Referring again to , it should be noted that the enterprise system  may comprise a plurality of web servers , application servers  and database servers , or all may be combined in a single computer device that provides the various functionalities of those servers. A user access system may be implemented as the web servers , in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user computer  through which access to and maintenance of their financial accounts can be accomplished. The user computers  may be Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), handheld computing devices, wireless handsets, audio\/video devices, music players, personal computers. As explained in more detail herein, the web server  may provide web pages that include a retirement planning service.","The network infrastructure  may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a user of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , any entity can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances.","A server is typically, though not necessarily, a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d Typically, a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address that may be entered into a web browser to access the server or client. Any technology that provides interactivity through the web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.Access to the web servers  is provided to a plurality of user computers  through the Internet. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","Referring now to , there is illustrated an example operational flow  of obtaining retirement gap insurance. At , a customer accesses the retirement planning engine. For example, using the user computer , the customer may access the web server  over the network infrastructure . The web server  may provide markup language or other instructions to the user computer  to render an interface on a browser.","At , is determined if the user has saved data associated with a plan at the retirement planning engine. If the user has saved data, at , the data is retrieved from the data store , and loaded by the retirement planning engine . Data entry fields may be pre-filled with the inputs saved from a previous session. The user may then have the option to keep or update the pre-filled inputs as the process continues at . If the user does not have saved data, then at , input data is requested from the customer with regard to conditions, parameters, family status, etc. that may have a bearing on in common in the customer's retirement years. Examples of such input data may include but are not be limited to:","1. First name","2. First name: (Spouse)","3. Date of birth: (User)","4. Date of birth: (Spouse)","5. Are you currently employed?: (User)","6. Are you currently employed?: (Spouse)","7. Age to retire: (User)","8. Age to retire: (Spouse)","9. Life expectancy: (User)","10. Life expectancy: (Spouse)","11. Current retirement savings (User)","12. Current retirement savings (Spouse)","13. Estimated yearly pension in retirement (User)","14. Estimated yearly pension in retirement (Spouse)","15. Is pension adjusted for inflation? (User)","16. Is pension adjusted for inflation? (Spouse)","17. Social Security Amount Expected: (User)","18. Social Security Amount Expected: (Spouse)","19. Total Annual Gross Income: (User)","20. Total Annual Gross Income: (Spouse)","21. Other income: (User)","22. Other income: (Spouse)","23. Rate of inflation: (User)","24. Rate of inflation: (Spouse)","25. Expected rate of return: (User)","26. Expected rate of return: (Spouse)","27. Expected replacement ratio: (User)","28. Expected replacement ratio: (Spouse)","29. Amount needed at Retirement in Future dollars","30. Monthly savings amount needed in today's dollars.","31. Estimated amount received yearly from user's investments","32. Estimated amount received monthly from user's investments.","Other data may not reside in the data store and may be requested for input by the user. Such data may include but is not limited to information at external sources  that is stored in the data store . This information may be retrieved by the retirement planning engine  over the network infrastructure . For example, a customer may provide a username and password to the retirement planning engine  in order for the retirement planning engine to access the external source . Information from the external source  may be ingested by the retirement planning engine  and factored with the information noted above.","At , determinations are made by the retirement planning engine. The customer may select an option to have a retirement plan determined. The process may validate the input data that has been provided at  or by external sources . If any requested data is missing or invalid, the process may notify the customer and may request that the customer provide or correct the data. The process may then determine a recommendation according to rules-based transactions and formulas, and may present a retirement plan to the customer. As part of the retirement plan, in some implementations, the retirement planning engine  may offer retirement gap insurance policy to the customer to counter any shortfalls that may occur in the customer's retirement plan.","At , it is determined if the customer accepts the plan with the retirement gap insurance policy. If the customer does not accept, the process ends. The customer does accept the retirement plan having the retirement gap insurance policy, then at , the plan is implemented. For example, the retirement planning engine  may provide the periodic policy payment amount, the total amount needed at retirement in future currency values, the monthly savings amount needed in terms of present value, etc. In further implementations, the estimated amount received yearly and\/or monthly from the customer's investments may also be provided.","In some implementations, the retirement planning engine  provides directives as to the accounts where the customer's periodic policy payment amount will be used for retirement savings. The retirement planning engine  may provide an order in which the policy payment funds will be invested (i.e., 401(k), followed by IRA, followed by Annuities or Mutual Funds, followed by taxable savings). Where possible, the retirement planning engine  may require the investment\/savings accounts be held at the financial services institution. The accounts and\/or order of investment may be altered by the financial services institution to increase a rate of return.","The retirement planning engine  may provide additional helpful information to the customer to further understand the results, as well as provide suggestions for next steps. For example, the retirement planning engine  may present contact information for questions, links to other available online planning calculators, links to account application pages on the website, or inputs and assumptions used in the calculations. The retirement planning engine  may further provide options to edit the inputs in order to determine a new plan. The customer may be provided an option to return to  to update\/edit\/modify\/delete inputs. Otherwise, the process then ends.","Referring now to , there is illustrated an example operational flow  of funding and receiving retirement gap insurance coverage at retirement. At , the periodic policy payment amount is received by the financial services company. The payment may be invested, as noted above in accordance with determinations made by the retirement planning engine . Policy premiums are collected to be applied to the gap insurance. At , it is determined if the customer has reached the retirement age profiled by the retirement planning engine . If not, the process returns to await an additional payment. If so, then at , the customer information is accessed. This may be retrieved from the data store  and include account information, beneficiary information, etc. A check may be made to determine that the customer has complied with the retirement plan set by the retirement planning engine .","At , a determination is made as to the accumulated value of the customer's portfolio. This determination may include any accounts that will provide funds that may be applied to the customer's annual income during the retirement years. At , it is determined if a \u201cgap\u201d exists. The gap may be determined as the difference between the amount saved by the customer in the account accessed at , and the desired annual income for the retirement years, as set in the retirement planning engine .","If at , no gap exists, the process ends. In some implementations, some or all of the premium payments made during the policy period may be returned to the customer as cash, an annuity or other product, as a savings vehicle.","If at , there is a gap, then at , the retirement gap insurance policy covers the gap if the terms and conditions of the policy are met. At , payments to the customer commence according to a schedule set by the retirement planning engine. The schedule may be set in accordance with the data received at  such that desired annual income during the customer's retirement years can be achieved.","Thus, as described above, a customer may develop a retirement plan and apply for gap coverage to insure against shortfalls in retirement savings due to market forces that are beyond the customer's control. This may provide comfort to the customer, especially as the customer nears retirement, that he\/she will be able to maintain an expected lifestyle in retirement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations may be used.
