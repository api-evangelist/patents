Networks  and  may translate to or from other protocols to one or more protocols of network devices. Although networks  and  are each depicted as one network, it should be appreciated that according to one or more embodiments, networks  and  may each comprise a plurality of interconnected networks.","Storage devices A(1)-(N), B(1)-(N), and\/or (1)-(N) may be network accessible storage and may be local, remote, or a combination thereof to server A or B. Storage devices A(1)-(N), B (1)-(N), and\/or (1)-(N) may utilize a redundant array of inexpensive disks (\u201cRAID\u201d), magnetic tape, disk, a storage area network (\u201cSAN\u201d), an internet small computer systems interface (\u201ciSCSI\u201d) SAN, a Fibre Channel SAN, a common Internet File System (\u201cCIFS\u201d), network attached storage (\u201cNAS\u201d), a network file system (\u201cNFS\u201d), optical based storage, or other computer accessible storage.

Servers A and B may be hosts, such as an application server, which may process data traveling between clients , , and  and a backup platform, a backup process, and\/or storage. According to some embodiments, servers A and B may be platforms used for deduplicating, backing up and\/or archiving data. One or more portions of data may be deduplicated, backed up, and\/or archived based on a backup policy and\/or an archive applied, attributes associated with the data source, space available for backup, space available at the data source, or other factors.","According to some embodiments, clients , , and\/or  may contain one or more portions of software for data backup management such as, for example, data backup management module . One or more portions of data backup management module  may reside at a network centric location. For example, server A may be a server, a firewall, a proxy server, a gateway, a search engine, or other network element that may perform one or more actions to provide data backup management. According to some embodiments, network  may be an external network (e.g., the Internet) and server A may be a gateway, a proxy server, a search engine, and\/or a firewall between one or more internal components and clients and the external network.","According to some embodiments, data backup management module  may be implemented in several portions which may be co-located or located remote from one another. According to one or more embodiments, data backup management may be performed by a third party (e.g., a service provider).","According to some embodiments, clients , , and  may be smartphones, PDAs, desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, other computers, or other devices coupled via a wireless or wired connection to network . Clients , , and  may receive data from user input, a database, a file, a web service, and\/or an application programming interface.","According to some embodiments, clients , , and  may contain backup management module . Backup management module  may provide one or more backup management services.","Backup management module  may identify and\/or generate a common base image containing files common to a plurality of endpoints (e.g., clients , , and ). According to some embodiments, one or more portions of backup management module  may be implemented on server A and\/or B. Backup management module  may provide a user interface allowing selection of data to be contained in a base image. As an example, a base image may contain an operating system used by a plurality of backup endpoints (e.g., employee devices and\/or servers being backed up in an enterprise environment.) A base image may also contain other data that is common across the plurality of endpoints (e.g., corporate approved applications, utilities, and\/or data). Generation of a base image may also include security software updates, patches, and\/or new software deployments. Backup management module  may deploy the base image to a plurality of endpoints. Backup management module  may generate a backup of a base image. According to some embodiments, Backup management module  may perform a restore operation using the backup image to deploy the base image to the plurality of endpoints. According to some embodiments, a backup of the base image may be stored once (e.g., on cloud based storage and\/or a storage area network) and may eliminate a need for endpoints using the base image to backup data in the base image. For example, server A may be a media server or a backup server containing backup management module . The base image may be distributed by server A to clients , , and\/or . Subsequent backups of clients , , and\/or  may be incremental backups which may contain only changes to a base image and may not require transmission of, processing, and\/or storage of data contained in a base image which has not been modified.","Endpoints which may have different hardware or different software needs may have incremental backups generated containing additional data supporting the different hardware and\/or software needs. These incremental backups may be applied to the endpoints having different hardware and\/or software needs during deployment (e.g., a restore operation for some clients may include the base image backup and an incremental backup containing data specific to an endpoint such as, for example, additional drivers for additional hardware.)","According to some embodiments, backup management module  on clients , , and\/or  may contain a change tracking module (e.g., a driver) which may track modifications to a base image on an endpoint. This change tracking driver may be distributed to an endpoint as part of a distribution of a base image. After distribution, an endpoint may boot. Once an endpoint boots, a change tracking driver may begin tracking changes to a base image of the endpoint. According to some embodiments, an endpoint may contain a change tracking driver (e.g., as part of a prior install of backup software) which may be utilized to track modifications to a base image.","According to some embodiments, backup management module  may calculate a fingerprint for one or more files of a base image. For example, backup management module  of server A may generate fingerprints for each file of a base image. Generated fingerprints may be distributed with a base image. An endpoint performing deduplication save significant processing by not having to generate fingerprints for files in a base image. According to some embodiments, a fingerprint may be a hash file (e.g., a MD5 hash file). According to at least one embodiment, a deduplication agent may be provided with a base image. For example, a base image provided from a server may have deduplication agent incorporated into and\/or transmitted to one or more endpoints with a base image.","If a full backup is not performed and endpoints rely on a centralized backup of a base image and incremental backups, a chain of incremental backups may grow over time. According to at least one embodiment, incremental backups may be collapsed periodically or on demand into synthetic incremental backups. In some embodiments, incremental backups and a copy of the base image backup may be collapsed into a synthetic full backup.","According to some embodiments, additional steps may be performed to update an existing base image previously deployed. The prior base backup image (i.e., a parent image) may be deployed on an endpoint. Updates may be performed on the endpoint (e.g., security software updates, patches, new software deployments, etc.). A change tracking module or driver may keep track of one or more of the changes to the prior base backup image. A new incremental backup may be generated from this endpoint by using the tracked changes. Fingerprints corresponding to the changed files may also be generated and the new incremental backup image may contain and\/or be deployed with the new fingerprints (e.g., for endpoints which use deduplication). According to some embodiments, the fingerprints may be stored in an endpoints fingerprints database. In order to deploy this new parent base image to one or more additional endpoints, this new incremental base image may be restored on top of the prior parent base image. This may allow upgrading to a new base image for endpoints using the new incremental. This may also allow coexistence of an old base parent image and the new incremental base image (e.g., perhaps clients are being upgraded in increments).","According to some embodiments, an existing group of backup endpoints (e.g., backup client devices) may have an older base image installed and may also each have older incremental backup chains generated depending on that older base image. Older endpoints with one or more associated incremental backups may be migrated to a new base image. An incremental backup may be taken using existing backup software for the endpoint. A snapshot of the older endpoint may be taken. This may ensure that backups are intact up to a current point of a snapshot. A comparison between the snapshot and a new common base image backup (e.g., a new base image that the older endpoint is being migrated to) may be performed by using file level comparison and\/or file level fingerprints. A delta incremental file may be generated using this comparison. This delta incremental may provide a transition from the prior existing base image to the new base image. Additionally, change tracking which may be started following the snapshot may now provide an incremental backup which may be consistent with an old chain of incremental backups as well as a new chain generated by change tracking following the snapshot. According to embodiments using deduplication, generated fingerprints for the files changed in the delta incremental may be embedded into the delta incremental. This may reduce a burden on deduplication software since the deduplication software may not have to generate fingerprints. This may be a onetime process, which may be done at a convenient time when the CPU\/network load is negligible (e.g., overnight or on the weekend.) Once the migration is done, the old endpoints may now keep tracking and taking incremental backups with respect to a common base backup image which may be stored on the cloud. This may allow migration and reduce backup storage and processing as well as deduplication processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","212","200","214","217","218","220","222","224","226","228","230","232","233","234","237","238","235","290","235","239","240","242","246","212","228","247","212","230","248","212","250","252"]},"Bus  allows data communication between central processor  and system memory , which may include read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory (neither shown), and random access memory (RAM) (not shown), as previously noted.
