title: Methods and apparatus for geospatial management and visualization of events
abstract: Methods and apparatus are provided for geospatial management and visualization of events, by presenting a dynamic, user-interactive geospatial environment for performing real-time operations management and pre/post-mission analytical activities. A geospatial event management system integrates geospatial imagery data from geospatial imagery data sources, and determines a geographic area of interest based on user input, stored settings, or other relevant parameters. The geospatial event management system then provides a user-interactive geospatial environment based on the geospatial imagery data associated with the geographic area of interest, and ingests geospatially-referenced event data associated with the events, such as tracking data, telemetry data, or sensor data. The geospatial event management system further filters the event data based on parameters such as geospatial or temporal parameters, and then superimposes the filtered event data over the geospatial imagery data associated with the geographic area of interest.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application relates to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/371,919 filed Aug. 9, 2010, entitled \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Geospatial Management and Visualization of Events,\u201d by Abraham J. Clark, John-Isaac Clark, and Jordon Mears, from which provisional application priority is claimed, and which provisional application is incorporated by reference herein.","The present teachings relate generally to methods and apparatus for geospatial management and visualization of events, by providing a dynamic geospatial environment for performing real-time operations management and pre\/post-mission analytical activities.","Humanitarian operations involving many different aid organizations are often undertaken in response to catastrophic disasters, particular those that strike developing parts of the world. For example, following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti that killed , people, international aid organizations rushed in to help the 300,000 people injured and over a million people displaced by the earthquake. Although many of the participating aid organizations possessed pertinent data and their own management practices, there did not exist any comprehensive understanding of other organizations' activities and data. Information was fragmented and held separately and locally, restricting an overall and up-to-date understanding of the situation. The breakdown of coordination and information sharing between the participating aid organizations resulted in delays in the transport and delivery of much needed aid. To exacerbate the problem, non-standardization of nomenclature made information sharing and logistics coordination even more difficult, particularly as more and more ad hoc tent cities, aid stations, and distribution points were being set up. For instance, English, French, and Caribbean languages like Creole were all commonly used in Haiti, so a single location could conceivably, and often did, have three separate names. In such an environment, collaborative sharing of accurate and relevant information would facilitate aid organizations in identifying locations that have duplicate names and coordinating their efforts to provide aid in a timely basis.","Collaborative sharing of relevant information can also be applied to other endeavors. For instance, with the climate of the world changing and more political envoys being dispersed world-wide, particularly in volatile regions of the world, the demand for security details or protective services is growing. As situations can change rapidly, the ability for these security details to gain situational awareness or assess potential threats to their clients and evaluate possible escape routes is paramount. These specially trained individuals need real-time, heads-up, accurate, and relevant information to maintain the safety of their clients and themselves.","According to the present teachings in one or more aspects, methods and apparatus are provided for geospatial management and visualization of events. As described herein, a geospatial event management system provides a dynamic, user-interactive geospatial environment for performing real-time operations management and pre\/post-mission analytical activities.","The geospatial event management system, according to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, provides a framework for users to geospatially visualize and manage events, track personnel and assets, and gain situational awareness. The geospatial event management system can integrate current and legacy geospatial data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of topography and composite situational awareness. The geospatial event management system can store the integrated data in accordance with an abstract data model, the integrated data including, for example, geospatial events, collections of objects, key\/value text data stores, and the like. The geospatial event management system, in various embodiments, can determine a geographic area of interest based on user input, stored settings, or other relevant parameters, and then provide a user-interactive geospatial environment based on the geospatial imagery data associated with the geographic area of interest. The geospatial event management system can ingest geospatially-referenced event data associated with the events, such as tracking data, telemetry data, or sensor data, filter the event data based on parameters such as geospatial or temporal parameters, and present the filtered event data superimposed over the geospatial imagery data associated with the geographic area of interest.","The geospatial event management system can include or interface with one or more user applications, through which a user can (1) conduct pre-operational planning for a deployment of personnel (e.g., security details) or assets (e.g., aircrafts, vehicles, etc.) anywhere in the world; (2) obtain real-time operational support by gathering and viewing pertinent information on events within a geo-location; and (3) perform post-operational analysis by reviewing and analyzing the events and potential consequences or reactions to the presence of the deployed personnel or assets.","To facilitate pre-operational planning, the geospatial event management system can include a mission planner that assists a user in constructing mission information sheets for detailing an upcoming mission. Mission information sheets can include mission parameters and requirements, such as personnel, assets, waypoints, tracker identifications, and other details that affect or influence mission movements and timeline. The geospatial event management system can also include an image manager that facilitates a user in importing, viewing, and managing recently-acquired imagery that may be relevant to the planning or execution of a mission.","To provide real-time operational support, the geospatial event management system can include an operations monitor that provides real-time tracking and display of units and assets within a geospatial environment. The operations monitor can monitor one or more events within a geographical area, such as, for example, the entire world, a specific area of interest, a defined geo-radius covered by one or more designated transmitters, and the like. Users can utilize the operations monitor to monitor data ingestion, quickly access codebook lookup and emergency alerts, obtain and generate tactical overlays for Blue Force coding, perform range finding, perform geo-positioning via latitude\/longitude and military grid reference system, and the like.","To facilitate post-operational analysis, the geospatial event management system can include a post-operational analyzer that receives spot reports for documenting events, provides a recap of routes and waypoints for mission review, and provides a complete playback of one or more missions with a display of indicators and imagery review.","Exemplary embodiments of the geospatial event management system enable users to rapidly develop and incorporate geospatial capabilities into systems already in operational use. By ingesting, categorizing, and integrating structured and\/or unstructured geospatial data from multiple sources, the geospatial event management system can transform diverse geospatial data into meaningful information. For example, the geospatial event management system can enable users to visualize and exploit geospatially-referenced data in a two- or three-dimensional environment, integrate the information environment with kinetic and non-kinetic operations, and rapidly process, analyze, and disseminate pertinent information.","The geospatial event management system can integrate real-time data feeds and sensor data with static information, enhance decision capability with geo-referenced information and intelligence, create and manage the operational picture for a common visualization across domains, and link centers and distributed systems with a robust dissemination architecture. The geospatial event management system, in various embodiments, can serve as a physical security and blue force tracking system, document and media exploitation system, public health surveillance system, an information and intelligence analysis tool, etc., or a combination thereof.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice these embodiments and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present teachings. The following description is, therefore, merely exemplary.","Additionally, in the subject description, the word \u201cexemplary\u201d is used to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as \u201cexemplary\u201d is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs.

As to keyboard , pointing device , and display , these components may be implemented using components that are well known to those skilled in the art. One skilled in the art will also recognize that other components and peripherals may be included in system .","Main memory  serves as a primary storage area of system  and holds data that is actively used by applications, such as geospatial event management system , running on processor . One skilled in the art will recognize that applications are software programs that each contains a set of computer instructions for instructing system  to perform a set of specific tasks during runtime, and that the term \u201capplications\u201d may be used interchangeably with application software, application programs, and\/or programs in accordance with embodiments of the present teachings. Memory  may be implemented as a random access memory or other forms of memory as described below, which are well known to those skilled in the art.","OS  is an integrated collection of routines and instructions that are responsible for the direct control and management of hardware in system  and system operations. Additionally, OS  provides a foundation upon which to run application software. For example, OS  may perform services, such as resource allocation, scheduling, input\/output control, and memory management. OS  may be predominantly software, but may also contain partial or complete hardware implementations and firmware. Well known examples of operating systems that are consistent with the principles of the present teachings include MICROSOFT WINDOWS (e.g., WINDOWS CE, WINDOWS NT, WINDOWS 2000, WINDOWS XP, and WINDOWS VISTA), MAC OS, LINUX, UNIX, ORACLE SOLARIS, OPEN VMS, and IBM AIX.","The foregoing description is illustrative, and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For instance, the various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, and circuits described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor (e.g., processor ), a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.","In one or more exemplary embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. For a software implementation, the techniques described herein can be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, subprograms, programs, routines, subroutines, modules, software packages, classes, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. A module can be coupled to another module or a hardware circuit by passing and\/or receiving information, data, arguments, parameters, or memory contents. Information, arguments, parameters, data, or the like can be passed, forwarded, or transmitted using any suitable means including memory sharing, message passing, token passing, network transmission, and the like. The software codes can be stored in memory units and executed by processors. The memory unit can be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art.","If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over a computer-readable medium as one or more instructions or code. Computer-readable media includes both tangible computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available tangible media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such tangible computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, flash memory, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes CD, laser disc, optical disc, DVD, floppy disk and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. Resources described as singular or integrated can in one embodiment be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined. The scope of the present teachings is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate aspects of the present teachings and together with the description, serve to explain principles of the present teachings.
