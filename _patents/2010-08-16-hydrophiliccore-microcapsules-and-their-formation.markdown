No. 11\/239,445 entitled \u201cCoatings and Methods for Corrosion Detection and\/or Reduction,\u201d filed Sep. 19, 2005, the contents of which are commonly assigned and incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and by an employee of the United States Government and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 U.S.C. \u00a7202) and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7202, the contractor elected not to retain title.","The present invention relates generally to microcapsules, and, in particular, the present invention relates to hydrophilic-core microcapsules and their formation.","Metals and metal alloys are present in some shape or form in nearly every facet of our lives. Many metals and metal alloys are subject to corrosion that causes these metals and metal alloys to lose their structural integrity. As such, methods have been developed to detect the presence of corrosion and to inhibit corrosion.","For example, color or fluorescent indicators have been combined directly with liquid coating materials, such as paints, temporary coating materials, etc., to indicate corrosion, based on the pH or electrical changes associated with corrosion, when the coating materials are applied to corrosion containing surfaces. However, problems, such as the solubility of the indicator in a coating material and\/or chemical reactions, interference with the coating material, etc., can arise when an indicator is combined directly with a coating material. Another problem is that the indicator may not be compatible with the coating material and may negatively affect the coating capability of the coating material when the indicator is combined directly with the coating material.","Nondestructive evaluation methods, such as X-ray techniques, including X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, are sometimes used to detect the presence of corrosion under coatings. However, the resolution and\/or sensitivity of such methods can make it difficult to detect corrosion in its early stages. In addition, these techniques can be excessively time intensive and typically require bulky, expensive equipment.","Corrosion inhibitors have also been combined directly with coating materials. However, directly combining a corrosion inhibitor with a coating material can lead to compatibility issues between the corrosion inhibitor and the coating material that can negatively affect the coating properties and\/or reduce the corrosion protection capability of the corrosion inhibitor.","Microcapsules, containing a corrosion inhibitor, have been added to protective coatings, such as paints, that are applied to metal surfaces and dried. The microcapsules have a frangible wall material that confines the corrosion inhibitor until the dried coating is subjected to a mechanical force, due to an impact, abrasion, or cutting, etc., sufficient to fracture and fragment the wall material. When the fracture occurs, the corrosion inhibitor leaks into and spreads through damage sites to provide corrosion protection. However, there can be other defects in a coating applied to a surface besides those caused by mechanical forces, such as air bubbles occurring in the coating, pin holes occurring in the coating, uneven coating thickness, poor coating adhesion to an unclean metal substrate, poor coating adhesion at corners, etc., that can result in corrosion of the metal. In addition, the frangible capsules may include a dye that marks the damage sites for notice and possible detailed repair, but the dye is only released in response to the fracture of the capsules and indicates mechanical damage that could possibly, but not necessarily, result in corrosion.","Hydrophilic-core microcapsules and methods of their formation are provided. A hydrophilic-core microcapsule including a shell that encapsulates a core substance which can be dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophobic material, such as dye, corrosion indicator, corrosion inhibitor, film forming compound, healing agent, or various combinations thereof. Hydrophilic-core microcapsules may be formed from an emulsion having hydrophilic-phase dispersed in a hydrophobic phase, with shell-forming compounds contained in the hydrophilic phase or the hydrophobic phase and the core substance contained in the hydrophilic phase. The shells of the hydrophilic-core microcapsules are broken down in response to being contacted by an alkali, e.g., produced during corrosion, contacting the shell. The hydrophilic-core microcapsules may be dispersed in a coating formulation, such as paint.","In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","110","100","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","120","130","140","140","140","140"]},"A suitable film-forming compound may be a clear varnish, such as an acrylic varnish. A suitable indicator may be a pH indicator that changes color over the alkaline region, e.g., pHs from about 8 to about 10, such as phenolphthalein. Another suitable indicator is one that fluoresces, such as 7-hydroxycoumarin, coumarin, Rhodamine B, etc., in the presence of or upon the oxidation of a metal or in the presence or upon the formation of a metal cation complex. A suitable corrosion inhibitor may be sodium nitrate, camphor, polyamine fatty acid salts in a solvent (such as toluene, vegetable oil, etc.), sodium molybdate, cerium nitrate, sodium phosphate, calcium metaborate, or the like. Suitable healing agents may include epoxy resin and its hardeners, siloxane resin and its catalysts, any one part coating suspension in a solvent or two-part coating system that would cure at room temperature, or the like.","For some embodiments, microcapsules  may be substantially spherical as shown in .","Shell  is broken down or disintegrates in the presence of a base (such as an alkali), e.g., having a pH above about 8, for releasing encapsulant . That is, shell  is pH sensitive and breaks down by interacting with a compound, such as an alkali, having a particular pH. For example, shell  breaks down and releases its contents when an alkali produced during a corrosion reaction contacts shell .","A microcapsule  may be formed by forming an emulsion having droplets of a hydrophilic substance, such as water and water soluble compounds, dispersed in a hydrophobic phase, e.g., toluene, vegetable oil, xylene, mineral oil, or a mixture of hydrocarbons, e.g., diesel fuel, or any other non-water soluble organic material. Microcapsules, such as microcapsules , formed from emulsions with hydrophilic droplets (e.g., water) dispersed in a continuous (e.g., substantially continuous) hydrophobic phase may be termed hydrophilic (e.g., water core microcapsules.","A surfactant, such as an oil-soluble surfactant, is added to the emulsion to disperse the water in the oil. A pre-polymer, such as an amino resin pre-polymer, a cross-linking agent having one or more ester and mercapto groups that are broken down under basic conditions, and one or more core materials are added to the hydrophilic phase. A catalyst, such as an organic acid, is added to the hydrophobic phase. The emulsion is heated, causing a polymerization reaction to occur at the water-oil interface, which forms shell  around encapsulant . Such a process is known as an interfacial polymerization process.","It is the interaction of alkaline conditions with the shell material that causes shell  to break down under alkaline conditions. Alternatively, encapsulant  can be released mechanically, such as by scratching or compressing a surface to which coating  is applied.","A basic condition, e.g., alkaline, often forms in the presence of corrosion in a metal or a metal alloy. A basic condition often forms next to corrosion-induced pits, crevices, etc. For example, as is known in the art, when a drop of salt water is applied to steel, the anodic reaction occurs to produce a rust spot, and the cathodic reaction (the reduction reaction of the oxygen in the presence of water) occurs to produce a basic condition. Therefore, when coating  is applied to a metal surface, and if corrosion occurs, shells  of the microcapsules  can be exposed to the basic condition (e.g., alkaline) and will break down under the basic condition resulting from the corrosion, thereby releasing encapsulant . Hereinafter, corrosion will refer to any chemical or electrochemical process involving the deterioration or degradation of metals, including pitting, crevice corrosion, dissimilar metal corrosion, or the like.","For one embodiment, coating  is temporarily applied to a metal surface by spraying or brushing, to detect whether corrosion has occurred. Examples of a metal surface include a bare metal surface, a metal surface coated with paint, varnish, epoxy, etc., a metal coated with a previous application of coating , or the like. For example, a coating containing the microcapsules disclosed herein may be applied as a primer coating, a top coating, or an intermediate coating between a primer coating and a top coating. Other examples of a metal surface include metal or metal alloy, e.g., a ferrous metal or alloy. For this embodiment, coating vehicle  is an aqueous gel and encapsulant  includes a suitable indicator, such as the pH indicator or florescent indicator as described above. In the presence of corrosion, the shells  of the microcapsules  break down, releasing the indicator. The pH indicator will change color or the florescent indicator will fluoresce to indicate the presence of corrosion. Another example of a temporary coating is a water suspension of microcapsules .","Coating vehicle  is not limited to an aqueous gel, or other temporary coatings, but can be a clear paint or varnish, opaque paint or varnish, etc. that is substantially permanently applied to the metal surface by spraying, brushing, or rolling, for example. For another embodiment, coating  is applied substantially permanently to a bare metal surface as a primer coat that may be clear coated.","For some embodiments, where coating  is substantially permanently applied, encapsulant  may include the indicator or the corrosion inhibitor or both. For other embodiments, encapsulant  may include the indicator, the healing agent, or the corrosion inhibitor, or various combinations thereof. If corrosion occurs, encapsulant , due to shells  breaking down in the presence of the basic condition resulting from the corrosion, is released, and the corrosion inhibitor acts to prevent further corrosion, while the indicator indicates the corrosion location. For another embodiment, a trauma, such as a scratch, an impact, etc., to coating  may act to expose metal. The trauma can also break shells  so as to release corrosion inhibitor that acts to reduce the degree of the corrosion of the exposed metal.","For another embodiment, where coating  is substantially permanently applied, encapsulant  may include the film-forming compound; the film-forming compound and corrosion inhibitor; the film-forming compound, corrosion inhibitor, and indicator; the film-forming compound and healing agent; the film-forming compound, indicator, and healing agent; or the film-forming compound and the indicator. For example, encapsulant  may include the film-forming compound, corrosion inhibitor, indicator, healing agent, or various combinations thereof. For one embodiment, if coating  is exposed to trauma that causes shells  to break, the film-forming compound covers at least a portion of the trauma and acts to reduce the degree of any exposed metal of corroding. For some embodiments, the corrosion inhibitor acts to further reduce the degree of corrosion of any exposed metal.","Note that if corrosion occurs at locations away from the trauma location due to small breaks in the coating, such as chips, or other coating defects, corrosion inhibitor and film-forming compound will be released due to shells  breaking down in the presence of the basic condition, resulting from the corrosion. In other embodiments, the indicator will indicate the presence of the corrosion.","For some embodiments, the different functions of the core components can be incorporated into a coating by encapsulating different core components into the same capsules, or by incorporating different capsules with different components within the coating. For example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain corrosion inhibitor and\/or the healing agent and another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator. In another example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain corrosion inhibitor and\/or the healing agent, another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator, and yet another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain film-forming compound. In another example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain film-forming compound and another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator. For some embodiments, microcapsules  having different contents are randomly distributed within coating vehicle  so that microcapsules  having the different functions of indicating, inhibiting, healing, and\/or film-forming may be adjacent each other, as well as microcapsules  having like functions being adjacent each other.","Hydrophilic-core microcapsules, such as water-core microcapsules, may be formed from emulsions having hydrophilic-phase droplets dispersed in a hydrophobic substance. One example is water-in-oil emulsions. Water-in-oil emulsions include hydrophilic-phase droplets (e.g., as the dispersed phase) dispersed in the hydrophobic phase (e.g., as the continuous phase). If a compound (active substance) is hydrophilic, or it can be dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophilic solvent (e.g. water), then it is possible to encapsulate it in hydrophilic- (e.g., water-) core microcapsules. When a compound does not have sufficient solubility in the hydrophilic solvent, a co-solvent may be used to improve the dissolution of the compound and to facilitate the encapsulation process. Similarly, when a compound cannot be dispersed into the hydrophilic phase to form a reasonably stable suspension (e.g., indicated by droplets of the compound being dispersed throughout the hydrophilic phase and the compound remaining dispersed during emulsion formation and encapsulation processes), a surfactant may be used to improve the dispersion of the compound and facilitate the encapsulation process. So if a compound can be dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophilic solvent, with or without the aid of a co-solvent or a surfactant, it is possible to encapsulate it into hydrophilic-core microcapsules.","Hydrophilic-core microcapsules are typically used for encapsulating water-soluble materials, but not oil-soluble materials, such as non-polar molecules. Oil-soluble materials can be incorporated into hydrophilic-core microcapsules by first adding them to a co-solvent, and then adding the resulting solution to the hydrophilic phase. Alternatively, a surfactant can be added to the hydrophilic phase. This will dissolve or disperse the non-polar or oil-soluble reagents into the hydrophilic phase. The emulsion (e.g. water-in-oil emulsion) can then be formed by adding the hydrophilic phase to a hydrophobic phase and a reaction can be initiated to encapsulate the oil, with the active substance dissolved or dispersed therein, into the core of the hydrophilic-core microcapsules.","In general, oil-core as well as water-core microcapsules include an encapsulant contained within a shell (shell ), such as a polymeric shell (). Alternatively, the core (encapsulant ) of an oil-core microcapsule may include a hydrophobic substance, such as oil, an active substance dissolved in the oil, with or without the aid of a co-solvent, or an active substance dispersed in the oil, with or without the aid of a surfactant. The active substance dissolved or dispersed in the encapsulated oil may include a dye, a corrosion indicator, a corrosion inhibitor, a film-forming compound, a healing agent, or various combinations thereof. The encapsulant , of a water-core microcapsule, may include water, an active substance dissolved in the water, with or without the aid of a co-solvent, or an active substance dispersed in the water, with or without the aid of a surfactant. The active substance dissolved or dispersed in the encapsulated water may include a dye, a corrosion indicator, a corrosion inhibitor, a film-forming compound, a healing agent, or various combinations thereof.","The polymeric shell of either oil-core or water-core microcapsules may include a polymer formed from a shell-forming compound (e.g., shell-forming precursor) that comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of a cross-linking agent having one or more ester and mercapto groups and\/or a film-forming pre-polymer. The shell-forming compound may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of about 5 to about 75 percent (e.g., about 20 to about 50 percent) by mass of a cross-linking agent and about 25 to about 95 percent (e.g., about 50 to about 80 percent) by mass of a film-forming pre-polymer. Examples of the cross-linking agent include, but are not limited to, pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate) or compounds with similar structure (e.g., pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT), pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate tetra(mercaptoacetate), pentaerythritol tetra(acrylate), and their derivatives. Examples of the film-forming pre-polymer include, but are not limited to, urea formaldehyde pre-polymer resin (e.g., butylated urea-formaldehyde resin, such as CYMEL\u00ae U80), melamine formaldehyde resin, polyurethane prepolymers, polyols, or film forming monomers, such as urea and formaldehyde solution, melamine and formaldehyde solution, isocyanates and various glycols, etc. Note that the shell-forming compound forms the shells of the oil-core as well as the water-core microcapsules.","The microcapsule shell of either oil-core or water-core microcapsules may include one or more chemical bonds due to the ester group in the cross-linking agent that are cleavable (e.g., broken down) at ambient temperature when the surrounding pH changes due to the occurrence of a corrosion process. For example, the ester groups may undergo an irreversible hydrolysis reaction under basic pH, e.g., when exposed to an alkali.","Pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate)-type molecules are normally not a good film former by themselves. As such, the film-forming pre-polymers, such as urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde pre-polymers serve as the precursor that provides the structural integrity of the capsule shell.","Cross-linking agents that have three or four functional groups, such as pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate), penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT), pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate tetra(mercaptoacetate), and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate can also provide chemical resistance (e.g. solvent resistance) to the microcapsule shells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","310"],"sub":["2","4","2","4 ","2","4","3","3","3","4","2","4"]},"A first hydrophobic phase is formed at block . For example, the first hydrophobic phase may be formed by adding surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate (SPAN\u00ae 85) and AEROSOL\u00ae OT (AOT) or an alkyl anhydride (Lubrizol ADX101K), to oil, such as toluene, e.g. during mixing. In other embodiments, the first hydrophobic phase may include the alkyl anhydride and methyl myristate as the hydrophobic material. For one embodiment, the first hydrophobic phase may be about 70 to about 90 percent, by mass, oil and about 10 to about 30 percent, by mass, surfactant.","The hydrophilic phase is then added to the first hydrophobic phase, e.g., a drop at a time, to form a water-in-oil emulsion at block . For example, the hydrophilic phase may be mixed into the first hydrophobic phase so that hydrophilic-phase droplets are dispersed within the first hydrophobic phase. A second hydrophobic phase is formed at block  by adding a shell-forming compound, e.g., comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of pre-polymer, such as CYMEL\u00ae U80, and cross-linking agent, such as penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT), to oil, such as toluene or a mixture of toluene and methyl myristate, e.g., while stirring. For one embodiment, the second hydrophobic phase may be about 88 to about 92 percent, by mass, oil, about 4 to about 7 percent, by mass, pre-polymer, and about 4 to about 5 percent, by mass, cross-linking agent.","At block, , the second hydrophobic phase is then added to the water-in-oil emulsion formed at block , e.g., a drop at a time. At this point, the water-in-oil emulsion includes hydrophilic-phase droplets dispersed in a continuous hydrophobic phase that includes the first and second hydrophobic phases. For example, the water-in-oil emulsion may include about 40 to about 55 percent, by mass, hydrophobic phase I; about 30 to about 35 percent, by mass, hydrophobic phase II; and about 10 to about 30 percent, by mass, water.","At block , the water-in-oil emulsion, containing the second hydrophobic phase (e.g., dissolved in the first hydrophobic phase), is heated to a particular temperature, causing a polymerization reaction that forms a microscopic shell. For example, the emulsion may be heated to temperature of about 70\u00b0 C. and may be maintained at about 70\u00b0 C. for a particular time, e.g., a reaction time that lies in the range of about 3 to about 5 hours.","In Example 1, as shown in Table 1, the water phase was prepared by adding 4N HSOto water, a drop at a time, until the pH was about 3.5. An oil phase I was formed by adding sorbitan trioleate (SPAN\u00ae 85) and AEROSOL\u00ae OT (AOT) to toluene while mixing. The water phase was then added to the oil phase I, a drop at a time, as the water phase was stirred to produce a water-in-oil emulsion. An oil phase II was formed by adding CYMEL\u00ae U80 and PTT to toluene while stirring. Oil phase II was then added to the water-in-oil emulsion, a drop at a time, to produce a water-in-oil emulsion. The water-in-oil emulsion was then heated to about 70\u00b0 C. to initiate an interfacial polymerization reaction.

These interactions are weak and are not as effective at keeping the water-phase droplets from clustering, thus making it difficult to incorporate the microcapsules into coating formulations, such as paints. However, it is possible to obtain water-in-oil emulsions that are relatively stable, e.g., good dispersion of water-phase droplets with little clustering, when the right water\/surfactant\/oil combination is used. For example, it was discovered that water, a surfactant (such as the alkyl anhydride), and oil (such as methyl myristate), is a good combination to form a water-in-oil emulsion that forms a stable emulsion (e.g., indicated by droplets of the water phase being substantially uniformly dispersed throughout the oil phase) with a substantially mono-dispersed size distribution and a dispersed phase size lying in the range of about one micron to about five microns.","In Example 4, Table 4, cerium nitrate Ce(NO)was dissolved in water to produce a water phase. 4N HSOwas then added to the water phase until the pH of the water phase was about 2.8.

The water-in-oil emulsion was maintained at about 70\u00b0 C. for a reaction time of about 16 hours to form water-core microcapsules having shells encapsulating a core of calcium borate dissolved in water.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example 9 formula for water-core microcapsules"},{"entry":"with calcium metaborate."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Weight (gram)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Water Phase"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Water (pH ~2.3)","80"]},{"entry":[{},"CaBO","0.111"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Oil (I)"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Methyl Myristate","200"]},{"entry":[{},"Lubrizol ADX 101K","80"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Oil (II)"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"PTT","8"]},{"entry":[{},"U80","8"]},{"entry":[{},"Toluene","40"]},{"entry":[{},"Methyl Myristate","120"]},{"entry":[{},"heating","70\u00b0 C. for 16 hours"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","410"]},"A hydrophilic phase is formed at block  by mixing water with a water-soluble shell-forming compound formed from a mixture of pre-polymers. For example, the shell-forming compound may be mixture comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of melamine, formaldehyde, and penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT). For some embodiments, the hydrophilic phase may also include triethanolamine. Note that the mixture of pre-polymers in the hydrophilic phase forms the shell (e.g., wall) of a finished water-core microcapsule. For other embodiments, the hydrophilic phase may include a co-solvent, such as ethanol, with a corrosion indicator, such as phenolphthalein, dissolved therein.","The hydrophilic phase is then added to the hydrophobic phase at block  to form a water-in-oil emulsion. For example, the hydrophilic phase may be mixed into the hydrophobic phase so that hydrophilic-phase droplets are dispersed within the hydrophobic phase. That is, the emulsion includes hydrophilic-phase droplets dispersed within a hydrophobic phase. As such, the hydrophilic-phase portion of the emulsion may be referred to as the dispersed phase, while the hydrophobic-phase portion of the emulsion may be referred to as the continuous phase. Note that shell-forming compound is contained in the dispersed phase (hydrophilic phase), as opposed to a shell-forming compound being contained in the continuous phase (hydrophobic phase).","For some embodiments, formation of the hydrophilic phase includes forming a mixture of water, a 37 percent formaldehyde solution, melamine, and triethanolamine, heating the mixture, e.g., to about 70\u00b0 C., stirring the mixture, e.g., until clear, and adding the PTT to the mixture. The resulting mixture, e.g., after it turns clear, is added to the hydrophobic phase to form the water-in-oil emulsion.","The water-in-oil emulsion is then heated to a particular temperature, e.g., about 70\u00b0 C., at block . A catalyst, e.g., an organic acid catalyst, such as stearic acid, is added to the heated water-in-oil emulsion at block , and the water-in-oil emulsion with the catalyst is maintained at the particular temperature for a particular time, e.g., a reaction time of about 2 to about 3 hours, as the water-in-oil emulsion reacts.","Note that the catalyst is added to the continuous phase of the emulsion. Adding the catalyst to the continuous phase prevents the catalyst from being encapsulated, as is the case when the catalyst is added to the dispersed phase. For example, encapsulating an acid catalyst may be undesirable for some applications, such as dispersing microcapsules containing acids in certain paints.","In Example 10, Table 10, empty water-core microcapsules were formed by forming an oil phase by mixing methyl myristate and an amide surfactant. For example, the oil phase may include methyl myristate and amide surfactant. The water phase was formed by mixing water, a 37-percent formaldehyde solution, melamine, and triethanolamine, heating the mixture to about 70\u00b0 C., stirring the mixture until clear, and adding the PTT to the mixture. The resulting mixture, e.g., after it turned clear, was added to the oil phase to form the water-in-oil emulsion. The water-in-oil emulsion was heated to about 70\u00b0 C. and stearic acid was added to the heated emulsion to initiate a polymerization reaction. The water-in-oil emulsion was maintained at about 70\u00b0 C. for a reaction time of about 2 to about 3 hours to form water-core microcapsules having a size of about one micron.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00010","num":"00010"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example 10 formula for water-core microcapsules with"},{"entry":"water-soluble wall material."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Reagent","Weight (gram)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Water Phase"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Water","40"]},{"entry":[{},"melamine","3.0"]},{"entry":[{},"Formaldehyde (37%)","6.4"]},{"entry":[{},"PTT","2"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Oil Phase (I)"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Methyl Myristate","160"]},{"entry":[{},"Amide Surfactant","5"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"Catalyst"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Stearic Acid","0.5"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In Example 11, Table 11, water-core microcapsules containing the corrosion indicator phenolphthalein were formed by forming an oil phase by mixing methyl myristate and amide surfactant.
