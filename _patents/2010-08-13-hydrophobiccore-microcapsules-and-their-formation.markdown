No. 11\/239,445 entitled \u201cCoatings and Methods for Corrosion Detection and\/or Reduction,\u201d filed Sep. 19, 2005, the contents of which are commonly assigned and incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and by an employee of the United States Government and is subject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 U.S.C. \u00a7202) and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7202, the contractor elected not to retain title.","The present invention relates generally to microcapsules, and in particular, the present invention relates to hydrophobic-core microcapsules and their formation.","Metals and metal alloys are present in some shape or form in nearly every facet of our lives. Many metals and metal alloys are subject to corrosion that causes these metals and metal alloys to lose their structural integrity. As such, methods have been developed to detect the presence of corrosion and to inhibit corrosion.","For example, color or fluorescent indicators have been combined directly with liquid coating materials, such as paints, temporary coating materials, etc., to indicate corrosion, based on the pH or electrical changes associated with corrosion, when the coating materials are applied to corrosion containing surfaces. However, problems, such as the solubility of the indicator in a coating material and\/or chemical reactions, interference with the coating material, etc., can arise when an indicator is combined directly with a coating material. Another problem is that the indicator may not be compatible with the coating material and may negatively affect the coating capability of the coating material when the indicator is combined directly with the coating material.","Nondestructive evaluation methods, such as X-ray techniques, including X-ray scattering and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, are sometimes used to detect the presence of corrosion under coatings. However, the resolution and\/or sensitivity of such methods can make it difficult to detect corrosion in its early stages. In addition, these techniques can be excessively time intensive and typically require bulky, expensive equipment.","Corrosion inhibitors have also been combined directly with coating materials. However, directly combining a corrosion inhibitor with a coating material can lead to compatibility issues between the corrosion inhibitor and the coating material that can negatively affect the coating properties and\/or reduce the corrosion protection capability of the corrosion inhibitor.","Microcapsules, containing a corrosion inhibitor, have been added to protective coatings, such as paints, that are applied to metal surfaces and dried. The microcapsules have a frangible wall material that confines the corrosion inhibitor until the dried coating is subjected to a mechanical force, due to an impact, abrasion, or cutting, etc., sufficient to fracture and fragment the wall material. When the fracture occurs, the corrosion inhibitor leaks into and spreads through damage sites to provide corrosion protection. However, there can be other defects in a coating applied to a surface besides those caused by mechanical forces, such as air bubbles occurring in the coating, pin holes occurring in the coating, uneven coating thickness, poor coating adhesion to an unclean metal substrate, poor coating adhesion at corners, etc., that can result in corrosion of the metal. In addition, the frangible capsules may include a dye that marks the damage sites for notice and possible detailed repair, but the dye is only released in response to the fracture of the capsules and indicates mechanical damage that could possibly, but not necessarily, result in corrosion.","Hydrophobic-core microcapsules and methods of their formation are provided. A hydrophobic-core microcapsule may include a shell that encapsulates a core substance which can be dissolved or dispersed in a hydrophobic material, such as dye, corrosion indicator, corrosion inhibitor, film forming compound, healing agent, or various combinations thereof. The hydrophobic-core microcapsules may be formed from an emulsion having hydrophobic-phase dispersed in a hydrophilic phase, with shell-forming compounds contained in the hydrophilic phase or the hydrophobic phase and the core substance contained in the hydrophobic phase. The shells of the hydrophobic-core microcapsules may be capable of being broken down in response to being contacted by an alkali, e.g., produced during corrosion, contacting the shell. The hydrophobic-core microcapsules may be dispersed in a coating formulation, such as paint.","In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and chemical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","110","100","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","120","130","140","140","140","140"]},"A suitable film-forming compound may be a clear varnish, such as an acrylic varnish. A suitable indicator may be a pH indicator that changes color over the alkaline region, e.g., pHs from about 8 to about 10, such as phenolphthalein. Another suitable indicator is one that fluoresces, such as 7-hydroxycoumarin, coumarin, Rhodamine B, etc., in the presence of or upon the oxidation of a metal or in the presence or upon the formation of a metal cation complex. A suitable corrosion inhibitor may be sodium nitrate, camphor, polyamine fatty acid salts in a solvent (such as toluene, vegetable oil, etc.), sodium molybdate, cerium nitrate, sodium phosphate, calcium metaborate, or the like. Suitable healing agents include epoxy resin and its hardeners, siloxane resin and its catalysts, any one part coating suspension in a solvent or two-part coating system that would cure at room temperature, or the like.","For some embodiments, microcapsules  may be substantially spherical as shown in .","Shell  is broken down or disintegrates in the presence of a base (such as an alkali), e.g., having a pH above about 8, for releasing encapsulant . That is, shell  is pH sensitive and breaks down by interacting with a compound, such as an alkali, having a particular pH. For example, shell  breaks down and releases its contents when an alkali produced during a corrosion reaction contacts shell .","A microcapsule  may be formed by forming an emulsion having droplets of a hydrophobic substance such as oil (e.g., toluene, vegetable oil, xylene, mineral oil), a mixture of hydrocarbons (e.g., diesel fuel), or any other non-water soluble organic material dispersed in a hydrophilic phase (e.g., an oil-in-water emulsion). Microcapsules, such as microcapsules , formed from emulsions with hydrophobic droplets (e.g., hydrophobic phase, such as an oil phase) dispersed in a substantially continuous hydrophilic phase may be termed hydrophobic- (e.g., oil-) core microcapsules.","A surfactant, such as xanthan gum (available from Fisher Scientific, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.), attapulfite clay (e.g., aluminum magnesium silicate, such as ATTAGEL\u00ae 40, a thickener available from Engelhard Corporation, Iselin, N.J.), alkylnaphthalene sulphonate powder (e.g., Petro BAF\u00ae powder from Akzo Nobel Chemicals, Inc., Chicago, Ill.), and\/or mid-level sulfonation kraft lignin dispersants (e.g., REAX\u00ae 83A available from MeadWestvaco Corporation, Stamford, Conn.) is added to the emulsion to disperse the oil in the water. A pre-polymer, such as an amino resin pre-polymer, a cross-linking agent having one or more ester and mercapto groups that are broken down under basic conditions, and one or more core materials are added to the hydrophobic phase. A catalyst, such as an inorganic or organic acid, is added to the hydrophilic phase. The oil-in-water emulsion is heated, causing a polymerization reaction to occur at the water-oil interface, which forms shell  around encapsulant . Such a process is known as an interfacial polymerization process.","It is the interaction of alkaline conditions with the shell material that causes shell  to break down under alkaline conditions. Alternatively, encapsulant  can be released mechanically, such as by scratching or compressing a surface to which coating  is applied.","A basic condition, e.g., alkaline, often forms in the presence of corrosion in a metal or a metal alloy. A basic condition often forms next to corrosion-induced pits, crevices, etc. For example, as is known in the art, when a drop of salt water is applied to steel, the anodic reaction occurs to produce a rust spot, and the cathodic reaction (i.e., the reduction reaction of the oxygen in the presence of water) occurs to produce a basic condition. Therefore, when coating  is applied to a metal surface, and if corrosion occurs, shells  of the microcapsules  can be exposed to the basic condition (e.g., alkaline) and will break down under the basic condition resulting from the corrosion, thereby releasing encapsulant . Hereinafter, corrosion will refer to any chemical or electrochemical process involving the deterioration or degradation of metals, including pitting, crevice corrosion, dissimilar metal corrosion, or the like.","For one embodiment, coating  is temporarily applied to a metal surface, by spraying or brushing, to detect whether corrosion has occurred. Examples of a metal surface include a bare metal surface; a metal surface coated with paint, varnish, epoxy, etc.; a metal coated with a previous application of coating ; or the like. For example, a coating containing the microcapsules disclosed herein may be applied as a primer coating, a top coating, or an intermediate coating between a primer coating and a top coating. Other examples of a metal surface include metal or metal alloy, e.g., a ferrous metal or alloy. For this embodiment, coating vehicle  is an aqueous gel and encapsulant  includes a suitable indicator, such as the pH indicator or florescent indicator as described above. In the presence of corrosion, the shells  of the microcapsules  break down, releasing the indicator. The pH indicator will change color or the florescent indicator will fluoresce to indicate the presence of corrosion. Another example of a temporary coating is a water suspension of microcapsules .","Coating vehicle  is not limited to an aqueous gel, or other temporary coatings, but can be a clear paint or varnish, opaque paint or varnish, etc., that is substantially permanently applied to the metal surface by spraying, brushing, or rolling, for example. For another embodiment, coating  is applied substantially permanently to a bare metal surface as a primer coat that may be clear coated.","For some embodiments, where coating  is substantially permanently applied, encapsulant  may include the indicator or the corrosion inhibitor or both. For other embodiments, encapsulant  may include the indicator, the healing agent, or the corrosion inhibitor, or various combinations thereof. If corrosion occurs, encapsulant , due to shells  breaking down in the presence of the basic condition resulting from the corrosion, is released, and the corrosion inhibitor acts to prevent further corrosion, while the indicator indicates the corrosion location. For another embodiment, a trauma, such as a scratch, an impact, etc., to coating  may act to expose metal. The trauma can also break shells  so as to release corrosion inhibitor that acts to reduce the degree of the corrosion of the exposed metal.","For another embodiment, where coating  is substantially permanently applied, encapsulant  may include the film-forming compound; the film-forming compound and corrosion inhibitor; the film-forming compound, corrosion inhibitor, and indicator; the film-forming compound and healing agent; the film-forming compound, indicator, and healing agent; or the film-forming compound and the indicator. For example, encapsulant  may include the film-forming compound, corrosion inhibitor, indicator, healing agent, or various combinations thereof. For one embodiment, if coating  is exposed to trauma that causes shells  to break, the film-forming compound covers at least a portion of the trauma and acts to reduce the degree of any exposed metal of corroding. For some embodiments, the corrosion inhibitor acts to further reduce the degree of corrosion of any exposed metal.","Note that if corrosion occurs at locations away from the trauma location due to small breaks in the coating, such as chips or other coating defects, corrosion inhibitor and film-forming compound will be released due to shells  breaking down in the presence of the basic condition, resulting from the corrosion. In other embodiments, the indicator will indicate the presence of the corrosion.","For some embodiments, the different functions of the core components can be incorporated into a coating by encapsulating different core components into the same capsules, or by incorporating different capsules with different components within the coating. For example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain corrosion inhibitor and\/or the healing agent and another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator. In another example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain corrosion inhibitor and\/or the healing agent, another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator, and yet another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain film-forming compound. In another example, a portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain film-forming compound and another portion of microcapsules  in coating  may contain indicator. For some embodiments, microcapsules  having different contents are randomly distributed within coating vehicle  so that microcapsules  having the different functions of indicating, inhibiting, healing, and\/or film-forming may be adjacent each other, as well as microcapsules  having like functions being adjacent each other.","As indicated above, hydrophobic-core microcapsules, such as oil-core microcapsules, may be formed from emulsions (e.g., oil-in-water emulsions). These emulsions include hydrophobic-phase droplets, such as oil-phase droplets, (e.g., as the dispersed phase) dispersed in a hydrophilic phase, such as a water phase, (e.g., as the continuous phase). If a compound (active substance) is hydrophobic, or it can be dissolved or dispersed in hydrophobic substance, (e.g. an oil), then it is possible to encapsulate it in hydrophobic-core microcapsules. When a compound does not have sufficient solubility in the hydrophobic phase, a co-solvent may be used to improve the dissolution of the active compound and facilitate the encapsulation process. Similarly, when a compound cannot be dispersed into oil to form a reasonably stable suspension (e.g., indicated by droplets of the compound being dispersed throughout the oil and the compound remaining dispersed during emulsion formation and encapsulation processes), a surfactant may be used to improve the dispersion of the compound and facilitate the encapsulation process. So if a compound is an oil, or it can be dissolved or dispersed in oil, with or without the aid of a co-solvent or a surfactant, it is possible to encapsulate it into oil-core microcapsules.","Hydrophobic-core microcapsules are typically used for encapsulating oil-soluble materials, but not water-soluble materials, such as salts or polar molecules. Water-soluble materials can be incorporated into oil-core microcapsules by first adding them to a co-solvent, such as a polar co-solvent, and then adding the resulting solution to the hydrophobic phase. Alternatively, a surfactant can be added to the hydrophobic phase. This will dissolve or disperse the polar or water-soluble reagents into the hydrophobic phase. The emulsion (e.g. oil-in-water emulsion) can then be formed by adding the hydrophobic phase (e.g. oil phase) to a hydrophilic phase (e.g. water phase) and a reaction can be initiated in the oil-in-water emulsion to encapsulate oil, with the active substance dissolved or dispersed therein, into the core of the hydrophobic-core microcapsules.","In general, oil-core and water-core microcapsules include an encapsulant contained within a shell (shell ), such as a polymeric shell (). For example, the core (encapsulant ) of an oil-core microcapsule may include a hydrophobic substance, such as oil, an active substance dissolved in the oil, with or without the aid of a co-solvent, or an active substance dispersed in the oil, with or without the aid of a surfactant. The active substance dissolved or dispersed in the encapsulated oil may include a dye, a corrosion indicator, a corrosion inhibitor, a film-forming compound, a healing agent, or various combinations thereof. The encapsulant, , of a water-core microcapsule, may include water, an active substance dissolved in the water, with or without the aid of a co-solvent, or an active substance dispersed in the water, with or without the aid of a surfactant. The active substance dissolved or dispersed in the encapsulated water may include a dye, a corrosion indicator, a corrosion inhibitor, a film-forming compound, a healing agent, or various combinations thereof.","The polymeric shell of oil-core microcapsules may include a polymer formed from a shell-forming compound (e.g., shell-forming precursor) that comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of a cross-linking agent having one or more ester and mercapto groups and\/or a film-forming pre-polymer. The shell-forming compound may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of about 5 to about 75 percent (e.g., about 20 to about 50 percent) by mass of a cross-linking agent and about 25 to about 95 percent (e.g., about 50 to about 80 percent) by mass of a film-forming pre-polymer. Examples of the cross-linking agent include, but are not limited to, pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate) or compounds with similar structure (e.g., pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT)), pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate tetra(mercaptoacetate), pentaerythritol tetra(acrylate), and their derivatives. Examples of the film-forming pre-polymer include, but are not limited to, urea formaldehyde pre-polymer resin (e.g., butylated urea-formaldehyde resin, such as CYMEL\u00ae U80), melamine formaldehyde resin, polyurethane prepolymers, polyols, or film forming monomers, such as urea and formaldehyde solution, melamine and formaldehyde solution, isocyanates and various glycols, etc. Note that the shell-forming compound forms the shells of the oil-core and water-core microcapsules.","The microcapsule shell of oil-core microcapsules may include one or more chemical bonds due to the ester group in the cross-linking agent that are cleavable (e.g., broken down) at ambient temperature when the surrounding pH changes due to the occurrence of a corrosion process. For example, the ester groups may undergo an irreversible hydrolysis reaction under basic pH, e.g., when exposed to an alkali.","Pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate)-type molecules are normally not a good film former by themselves. As such, the film-forming pre-polymers, such as urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde pre-polymers serve as the precursor that provides the structure integrity of the capsule shell.","Cross-linking agents that have three or four functional groups, such as pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate), pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT), pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol pentaacrylate tetra(mercaptoacetate), and pentaerythritol tetraacrylate can also provide chemical resistance (e.g. solvent resistance) to the microcapsule shells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310"]},"In general, the hydrophilic phase may include about 0.05 to about 30 percent, by mass, surfactant and about 70 to about 99.5 percent, by mass, water. For example, the hydrophilic phase may include about 1 percent, by mass, of the surfactant having branched polyoxyethylene(5) nonylphenyl ether, (IGEPAL\u00ae CO-520) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and about 99 percent, by mass, water. Alternatively, the hydrophilic phase may include about 5 to about 6 percent, by mass, of a surfactant, including a mixture of xanthan gum, Petro BAF, ATTAGEL\u00ae 40, and REAX 83A\u00ae, and about 94 to about 95 percent, by mass, water.","At block  a hydrophobic phase (e.g., an oil phase) is formed. For example, a monomer and pre-polymer may be added to oil to form the hydrophobic phase. For example, shell-forming compounds comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of a cross-linking agent and a pre-polymer may be added to the hydrophobic phase. For example, the shell-forming compounds form the shells of the completed microcapsules. The active substances such as dye, corrosion indicator, corrosion inhibitor, film-forming compound, healing agent, or various combinations thereof may be also added to the hydrophobic phase. For some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase may include two hydrophobic phases that are formed individually to avoid the possible incompatibility between different ingredients.","The hydrophobic phase may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of a solvent, the shell-forming compound, dye, corrosion indicator, corrosion inhibitor, film-forming compound, healing agent, or various combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of the hydrophobic material include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as toluene, xylene), mineral oil, vegetable oil, a mixture of hydrocarbons (such as diesel fuel), or any other nonpolar organic material. The pre-polymer or the cross-linking agent of the shell-forming compound should have chemical bonds that are susceptible to a hydrolysis reaction under basic conditions, e.g., the cross-linking agent should provide an ester group. This causes the shell to break down when exposed to an alkali. For example, when a butylated urea-formaldehyde resin (CYMEL\u00ae U80) is used as the pre-polymer, a suitable shell-forming precursor that provides an ester group may be the cross-linking agent penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT). For some embodiments, a co-solvent, such as ethanol or isopropanol may be added to the hydrophobic phase.","For some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase may include about 5 to about 20 percent, by mass, pre-polymer, about 2 to about 20 percent, by mass, cross-linker, about zero to about 10 percent, by mass, corrosion indicator or corrosion inhibitor, about zero to about 30 percent, by mass, co-solvent, and about 20 to about 93 percent solvent.","For embodiments, where two hydrophobic phases are formed individually, a first hydrophobic phase (hydrophobic phase I) may include an oil-soluble surfactant, such as sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AEROSOL\u00ae OT) and a dye, such as water-soluble dye, e.g., Rhodamine B (a fluorescent dye), and\/or a healing agent, such as chlorobenzene. The second hydrophobic phase (hydrophobic phase II) may include pre-polymer, such as CYMEL\u00ae U80, and a cross-linking agent, such as penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT). For embodiments, where the first hydrophobic phase includes healing agent, the healing agent may be used as the solvent.","The hydrophobic phase is then added to the hydrophilic phase to form an oil-in-water emulsion at block . For example, the hydrophobic phase may be mixed into the hydrophilic phase so that hydrophobic phase droplets are dispersed within the hydrophilic phase. For example, the oil-in-water emulsion may be about 20 to about 60, percent, by mass, hydrophobic phase and about 40 to about 80 percent, by mass, hydrophilic phase. For embodiments, involving two hydrophobic phases, the hydrophobic phase containing the surfactant (hydrophobic phase I) is usually added to the hydrophilic phase before adding hydrophobic phase II containing the pre-polymer and cross-linking agent. The resulting oil-in-water emulsion includes oil droplets that include hydrophobic phase I and hydrophobic phase II and that are dispersed in the hydrophilic phase. For example, the oil-in-water emulsion may be about 1 to about 15 percent, by mass, hydrophobic phase I, about 10 to about 20 percent, by mass, hydrophobic phase II, and about 65 to about 89 percent, by mass, hydrophilic phase. At block , a catalyst is added to the oil-in-water emulsion. Acids, both inorganic and organic, can be used as catalysts. For example, an acid may be added to the oil-in-water emulsion until its pH is in the range of about 2 to about 5.","At block , the oil-in-water emulsion, including the catalyst, is heated to a particular temperature, causing an interfacial polymerization reaction. For example, heating the emulsion to a temperature that lies in the temperature range of about 50 to about 70\u00b0 C. may result in a reaction time of less than about 3 hours for solid microcapsule shell (e.g., wall) formation.","The capsule size can be controlled by the emulsion formula, but the mixing speed of the mixer (e.g., a homogenizer) during the emulsion formation at block  also acts to control the capsule size. By adjusting both the emulsion formula and the mixing speed, microcapsules with a relatively narrow size distribution can be formed. For example, sizes from about 100 nanometers to about 500 microns can be formed with a typical size from about 1 to about 5 microns. For other embodiments, the microcapsules have a size in the range from about 1 to about 50 microns.","The shell forming precursor, such as the cross-linking agent pentaerythritol tetrakis(2-mercaptoacetate) or penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT), and urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde prepolymer or their monomers, results in a desirable combination of the pH sensitivity and the structural integrity of the shell. Heating time can also affect the pH sensitivity and the structural integrity of the shell. Shorter heating times result in thinner capsule walls, meaning high pH sensitivity. Increasing the amount of cross-linking agent can also increase the pH sensitivity of the microcapsule.","After heating for a particular time, and before terminating the reaction, a sample of the mixture may be tested, e.g., by centrifuging, to determine whether any of the hydrophobic phase still remains, which indicates that not all of the hydrophobic phase is encapsulated, and thus a longer heating time may be required. If there is substantially no remaining hydrophobic phase in a centrifuged sample, then the solid microcapsule walls are formed. After the solid wall forms, the reaction is allowed to continue to allow sufficient time for the microcapsule wall to cure, and then the reaction can be terminated, e.g., by neutralizing the reaction mixture to a pH of about 7, such as by adding an ammonia water solution. Another way to determine if the solid microcapsule walls are formed is to take an emulsion sample and allow the water within to evaporate. Then observe the remaining sample. If liquid oil remains, the microcapsule wall is not yet completely formed. If only solid particles are observed, then the solid microcapsules walls are already formed.","Hydrophobic-core (oil-core) microcapsules were prepared using the following example processes formulas:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example 1A - Empty oil-core microcapsule formula."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Weight (gram)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Oil Phase",{}]},{"entry":[{},"U-80","16"]},{"entry":[{},"PTT","12"]},{"entry":[{},"Toluene","121"]},{"entry":[{},"Isopropanol","50"]},{"entry":[{},"Water Phase"]},{"entry":[{},"Water","400"]},{"entry":[{},"Gum","0.48"]},{"entry":[{},"BAF","0.96"]},{"entry":[{},"Attagel 40","9.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Reax 83A","12.8"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"In Example 1A, the water phase was prepared by respectively dissolving water-soluble surfactants, such as xanthan gum, Petro BAF powder, ATTAGEL\u00ae 40, and REAX 83A\u00ae, in water, one at a time, while stirring, as shown in Table 1. The oil phase in Example 1A was prepared by adding a pre-polymer, such as CYMEL\u00ae U80, and a cross-linking agent, such as penta erythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PTT) to the oil, such as toluene, and stirred, e.g., using a Powergen 500 homogenizer (available from Fisher Scientific, Inc.), until mixed. A co-solvent, such as isopropanol, was added to the oil phase in Example 1A to assist emulsion formation. The oil phase was dispersed into the water phase by stirring, e.g., at a Powergen 500 homogenizer stirrer speed of about 10000 rpm, to form an oil-in-water emulsion.","When the sizes of the oil-phase droplets are substantially uniform within the emulsion, the polymer shell of the microcapsules is formed through a polymerization reaction initiated by adding the catalyst, e.g., an acid catalyst, such as an inorganic and\/or organic acid, and heating the emulsion.
