{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT\/SE2008\/051394 filed 2 Dec. 2008, which designated the U.S. and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional No. 61\/050,370 filed 5 May 2008, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Embodiments described herein relate generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to improved uplink coverage in wireless communication systems via autonomous retransmission.","Enhanced uplink (EUL) is proposed in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 6 to improve uplink performance of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) systems. Two transmission time intervals (TTIs) are proposed for enhanced uplink, a ten (10) milliseconds TTI and a two (2) milliseconds TTI. The ten milliseconds TTI provides similar cell coverage as previous Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) releases, but its cell throughput is too small. The two milliseconds TTI provides better cell throughput than the ten milliseconds TTI, but its cell coverage is insufficient.","One technique that improves enhanced uplink coverage is hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) retransmission. According to current 3GPP specifications, enhanced uplink HARQ retransmission can occur only after expiration of a round trip time (RTT). Since the RTT for the two milliseconds TTI is sixteen (16) milliseconds and three (3) retransmissions may be required to guarantee reliable reception of a packet, a retransmission delay of forty-eight (48) milliseconds could be introduced by enhanced uplink HARQ. Such a delay may not be acceptable for some delay sensitive services (e.g., voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services, etc.).","Autonomous retransmission has been proposed as an effective way to reduce such HARQ retransmission delay. A core concept of autonomous retransmission is that user equipment (UE) sends a number of retransmissions consecutively, without waiting for receipt of a negative acknowledgment (NACK) before starting the next retransmission. However, if three retransmissions are required, autonomous retransmission may only reduce the retransmission delay to six (6) milliseconds. Some autonomous retransmission techniques describe how a receiver knows that a bundle of transmissions are designated for a single packet, how the receiver decodes the packets transmitted with autonomous retransmission correctly, how to apply autonomous retransmission in high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), how to use autonomous retransmission for extended coverage, how to apply autonomous retransmission to notify a non-serving Node B, etc.","Although autonomous retransmission is an effective way to improve uplink coverage, it still suffers from several drawbacks. For example, if autonomous retransmission is applied with an excessively large number of transmission attempts or at an inappropriate time, autonomous retransmission will generate unnecessary interference in a system. On the other hand, autonomous retransmission with less (or an inadequate number of) transmission attempts can not take full advantage of the benefits of the technique.","It is an object of the invention to overcome at least some of the above disadvantages and to trigger autonomous retransmission at an appropriate time and with an appropriate number of HARQ retransmissions.","Embodiments described herein may apply autonomous retransmission techniques to improve enhanced uplink coverage for systems (e.g., WCDMA systems providing two milliseconds TTIs). In one embodiment, for example, user equipment (UE) may receive condition information, may receive communicated information from a base station (BS), and may generate an appropriate number of retransmissions and an appropriate timing for the retransmissions based on the received information. The appropriate number of retransmissions and the appropriate timing for the retransmissions may ensure that enhanced uplink coverage is improved.","In an exemplary embodiment, the condition information may include power usage in the user equipment, whether the user equipment is using a minimum usable enhanced dedicated channel (E-DCH) transport format combination (ETFC), a measured downlink channel quality, whether a number of consecutive NACKs are received by the user equipment, etc. The user equipment may trigger autonomous retransmission when power in the user equipment is limited, when the user equipment is using a minimum usable ETFC, and when one of the measured downlink channel quality is less than a predefined threshold or the number of consecutive NACKs received by the user equipment is greater than a predefined number. The user equipment may determine the appropriate number of retransmissions based on a measured power clipping associated with the user equipment.","In another exemplary embodiment, the user equipment may estimate a data signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) (also known as a carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR)) associated with a channel, and may determine whether a difference between the estimated data SIR and a SIR for a transport format is greater than a certain decibel level. The user equipment may trigger autonomous retransmission when power in the user equipment is limited, when the user equipment is using a minimum usable ETFC, and when the difference is greater than the certain decibel level.","In still another exemplary embodiment, the condition information may include an estimate of the SIR in the base station, positive acknowledgments (ACKs) received by the user equipment, NACKs received by the user equipment, etc. The user equipment may determine the appropriate number of retransmissions, may increase the number of retransmissions when a certain number of consecutive NACKs are received, and may decrease the number of retransmissions when a certain number of consecutive ACKs are received.","In a further exemplary embodiment, the base station may determine a required SIR for a transport format, may measure a current SIR associated with the base station, and may calculate the number of retransmissions based on the required SIR and the current SIR. The base station may provide the calculated number of retransmissions to the user equipment (e.g., as the communicated information), and the user equipment may generate the calculated number of retransmissions when power in the user equipment is limited and when the user equipment is using a minimum usable ETFC.","Such an arrangement may ensure that autonomous retransmission is triggered at an appropriate time and with an appropriate number of HARQ retransmissions. This may reduce unnecessary interference generated by autonomous retransmission (e.g., such as occurs when the number of autonomous retransmissions are excessively large or not necessary), may reduce packet transmission delay, and may improve cell coverage for delay sensitive services.","The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.","Embodiments described herein may apply autonomous retransmission techniques to improve enhanced uplink coverage for systems (e.g., WCDMA systems providing two milliseconds TTIs).
