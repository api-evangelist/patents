When such a configuration is adopted, for example, if a display region is small, information about all peripheral devices associated with the applications may not be able to be displayed. Even if the information about the all peripheral devices can be displayed in the one display region, as long as the display region is limited, when the peripheral devices associated with the applications are increased, information about an added peripheral device may not be displayed in the display region.","A system for solving such a problem will be described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},"A client computer  includes the system illustrated in . Details will be described below.","A central processing unit (CPU)  controls an entire apparatuses according to a program stored in a read only memory (ROM)  or random access memory (RAM)  in a main storage apparatus , or an auxiliary storage device . The RAM  is used as a work area when the CPU  executes various types of processing. The auxiliary storage device  records an OS  and an application .","Input devices such as a keyboard  and a pointing device  including a mouse and a touch panel are used to give various types of instructions from a user to the computer connected via an input interface (I\/F) .","An output I\/F  is used to output data to outside the client computer , in other words, the output I\/F  outputs the data to an output device such as a monitor  and a printer . The printer  may not be directly connected with a local input\/output (I\/O). In other words, the printer  may be connected to a network  via a communication I\/F .","Further, a common data system bus  is used to transmit\/receive the data between the I\/Fs and the modules","Additionally, the CPU  executes the processing based on the program stored in the auxiliary storage device  to realize a software configuration of the client computer  illustrated in  and each step of the flowcharts described below.","As illustrated in , a printer driver  and a print queue  retain a device identification (ID) corresponding to a connected printer. Further, a device management control file  describes how the device ID is associated with a device management system  and a device management application . With reference to the device management control file , the OS  can determine how the printer driver , the print queue , the device management system , and the device management application  are associated with one another.","Further, when a print queue associated with the device management application  is generated, the OS  installs the device management application .","However, the device management system cannot manage the print queue corresponding to each function of a plurality of peripheral devices to which internet protocol (IP) addresses, which are different among the peripheral devices, are allocated. The device management system manages either a single print queue corresponding to the peripheral device or a plurality of print queues each corresponding to a plurality of peripheral devices to which a same IP address is allocated.","On the other hand, the device management application can manage the print queue corresponding to the each function of the plurality of peripheral devices to which the IP addresses, which are different among the peripheral devices, are allocated.","Furthermore, when the OS  retains a media access control (MAC) address of the peripheral device, the device management system cannot manage the print queue corresponding to each function of the plurality of peripheral devices to which the MAC addresses, which are different among the peripheral devices, are allocated. On the other hand, the device management application can manage the print queue corresponding to the each function of the plurality of peripheral devices to which the MAC addresses, which are different among the peripheral devices, are allocated.","The IP address and the MAC address are collectively referred to as an address.","According to the specification, the printer will be described as an example of the peripheral device corresponding to the print queue, however, the peripheral device may also be a facsimile (FAX). Similarly, printer information described below may be information about the FAX.","The device management control file may be generated for each device, or one device management control file may be generated for all types of devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["1061","100","202","203","204","205","205"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B","b":"1057"},"As illustrated in , the OS  displays functions  and  aligned in a tile-like arrangement. The OS  displays a tile  for the device management application  as one of the tiles in a tile-like shape. According to the specification, for convenience, a screen illustrated in  is referred to as a home screen. The home screen displays information provided by various applications installed in the OS . Also, the home screen is provided by the OS  to launch the application in response to a user's click operation.","Further, when the tile  is clicked, a screen  indicating a state of the plurality of peripheral devices managed by the device management application  (associated with the device management application ) is displayed as illustrated in . In the device management application , via the screen for indicating the information about the plurality of peripheral devices, the user can confirm a current state of the displayed device and consumable goods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["530","1053","1057","5300","530","5311","5320","5300","5311","5320","1057","1053"]},"The specification describes examples in which the live tile content is generated in steps of the flowcharts described below. However, the device management application  may hold an image including predetermined printer information as the live tile content.","According to the example illustrated in , after the contents  to  are sequentially displayed, the loop display is performed by returning to the content  again. Further, according to the example illustrated in , the live tile contents , , and  display the printer information about the print queues of Printer AAA, Printer BBB, and Printer CCC, respectively.","The printer information refers to an icon, a queue name, and status information such as errors of the peripheral device including the printer and the FAX. More specifically, with reference to , the live tile contents , , and  display the icon and the queue name of the peripheral device corresponding to each print queue. Additionally, the live tile content  indicates that the Printer AAA is out of toner as the status information included in the printer information. Further, the live tile content  indicates that the Printer CCC is out of toner and out of paper as the status information included in the printer information. Furthermore, since the Printer BBB keeps a normal status, the live tile content  indicates nothing at a position corresponding to a position where the status is displayed in the live tile content  and the live tile content .","All of the icon, the queue name, and the status information do not need to be displayed in the live tile content as the printer information. One kind of the printer information described above may be displayed.","In the specification, a list (gathering) of the live tile contents is referred to a tile list. The tile list is managed by the OS . By performing loop display according to the tile list, the user can recognize that the device management application  is associated with each of the Printer AAA, the Printer BBB, and the Printer CCC. At the same time, the printer information about each printer is displayed and thus the information about the printer having a problem can be displayed, so that the user can easily recognize the printer state.","With reference to , processing in which the device management application  generates the live tile content will be briefly described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["100","100","1057","5300","5310","5320","1057","5330","5330","1057"]},"On the other hand,  illustrates processing performed when the status of the Printer BBB is changed from \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201cout of toner\u201d. At this point, the device management application  generates a new live tile content  indicating that the Printer BBB is out of toner. Subsequently, as illustrated in , the live tile content  indicating that the Printer BBB is in a normal status is replaced with the live tile content . Since the live tile content  is replaced with the live tile content , the OS , instead of performing the loop display of the live tile contents , , , and , performs the loop display of the live tile contents , , , and . With this display, the user can find the printer having a problematic status, of the printers associated with the device management application , only by browsing the home screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 5 and 6"]},"Each step illustrated in  are performed by the device management application .","In step S, the device management application  receives a \u201cnotification\u201d from the OS . When a printer is connected to the client computer  and a print queue is generated, the OS  performs the \u201cnotification\u201d to the device management application  associated with the printer. Association is performed with reference to the device management control file . Similarly, the OS  performs the \u201cnotification\u201d to the device management application  also when receiving information about a status change from the connected printer.","In step S, the device management application  confirms whether the notification indicates generation of the print queue. When the notification indicates the generation of the print queue (YES in step S), then in step S, the queue name, which is the name of the generated print queue, is acquired from the OS . In step S, a new live tile content  is generated with the acquired queue name set as a tag name. More specifically, an empty live tile content is generated and then the icon, the queue name, and the status information about the corresponding printer are arranged on the tile. The icon of the printer retained by the device management application  is used. Further, the status information is acquired from the peripheral device corresponding to the print queue.","In step S, the generated live tile content  is added to the tile list, and then the processing ends. The device management application  uses an application programming interface (API) prepared by the OS  to add the live tile content  to the tile list.","On the other hand, in step S, when the notification from the OS  does not indicate the generation of the print queue (NO in step S), then in step S, the device management application  confirms whether the notification indicates the status change of the print queue. When the notification indicates the status change of the print queue (YES in step S), then in step S, the queue name of the print queue whose status has been changed is acquired from the OS . In step S, the live tile content  is generated to which the status change is reflected with the acquired queue name set as a tag name. In step S, the device management application  replaces the live tile content  having the same tag name in the tile list with the generated live tile content . With such arrangement, when the new printer is connected to the client computer and thus the print queue is added, or when the status of the printer that has been already connected to the client computer is changed, the live tile content can be correctly updated.","The live tile contents retain their own \u201ctag names\u201d. The OS  performs processing described below when the live tile content having the same tag name as that of the live tile content included in the tile list is added to the tile list. The processing is performed for replacing the live tile content having the same tag name that has been already included in the tile list with the new live tile content. Thus, in step S, the device management application  may only request the OS  to add the live tile content  to the tile list. Further, according to the present exemplary embodiment, both the processing for generating the print queue and the processing for changing the status are performed in one flowchart. However, only one of the two processing operations may be performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 4","FIG. 3A","FIG. 4"],"b":["1053","651","1053","652","530","653","1053","1053","653","654","1053","654","651","1053","653","1053","1053","654","1053"]},"The device management application  and the OS  perform the above operations so that the user can confirm the status of the printer associated with the device management application  on the home screen without clicking the device management application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":["530","1053","1057","653","1053","1057"]},"By specifying the number of seconds of display to the tile list, the device management application  indirectly notifies the OS  of the number of seconds of display.","The device management application  may use the API to notify the OS  of the specified number of seconds of display.","In other words, to the tile list, the device management application  specifies movement to the next live tile content when a predetermined time elapses after each live tile content is displayed. The device management application  specifies the number of seconds of display at timing for adding the live tile content to the tile list in step S or timing for the replacement in step S. The predetermined time herein is three seconds for the live tile contents  and , and ten seconds for the live tile content  and . The processing proceeds to step S when the specified number of seconds elapses in step S, and thus the OS  can perform an operation illustrated in .","Further, as illustrated in , the live tile contents of the Printer AAA in a status of being out of toner and the Printer CCC in a status of being out of toner and paper are highlighted. The device management application  generates the highlighted live tile contents in step S or in step S to realize the highlighted display. More specifically, the emphatic display is realized by differentiating background of the live tile contents of the Printer AAA and the Printer CCC (black background according to the present exemplary embodiment) from the background of the Printer BBB. In other words, the highlighted display is realized by using the image including the background of the live tile content of the print queue having the problematic status (the errors), which is different from the background of the live tile content of another print queue having the normal status.","As described above, the live tile content of the problematic print queue is generated to be more noticeable than the live tile content of the normal print queue, so that the user can easily recognize the problems.","Other configurations are not repeatedly described since they are similar to the first exemplary embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["530","1053","1057","1053","1057"]},"With this arrangement, of the print queues associated with the device management application , only the problematic print queues are displayed as the tiles on the home screen, and thus the user can easily recognize the problematic print queues even when a great number of print queues are associated with the device management application .

If the display order of the live tile content in the tile list is determined with the importance of the status of the print queue ignored, and when the live tile contents are sequentially displayed on the home screen according to a descending order of the tile list, the problems described below will arise. If the live tile content listed upper in the tile list is displayed prior to the print queue having the more important status, the print queue having the more important status takes time to be displayed on the home screen. If the live tile contents with print queues having high-important statuses are displayed in order, this problem can be avoided.","More specifically, the Printer CCC  indicates the status of being out of toner and paper, which is the most important status, and the Printer AAA  indicates is the status of being out of toner, which is secondary important, and thus the Printer AAA  is displayed next to the Printer CCC . The Printer BBB indicating a less-important status and the Printer DDD indicating a normal status are not displayed.","The importance for each status is specified by a status point table  managed by the device management application .  illustrates an example of the status point table .
