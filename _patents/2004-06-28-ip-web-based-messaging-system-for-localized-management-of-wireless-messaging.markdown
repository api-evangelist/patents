title: IP web based messaging system for localized management of wireless messaging
abstract: An application server, configured for executing a messaging application defined by XML documents, is able to provide messaging services to a calling party for a remote subscriber based on retrieval of subscriber attribute information obtained from a remote information database server (such as LDAP) via an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The application server, upon receiving a voice application operation request having subscriber identifier information from a browser serving the calling party, obtains from the remote information database server attribute information for responding to the voice application operation request based on the subscriber identifier information. The application server generates an HTML document having media content and control tags for personalized execution of the voice application operation based on the attribute information obtained from the standardized database server. The application server also is configured for sending and retrieving messages from a standardized remote messaging server via the IP network.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to messaging operations for users of wireless communications systems based on voice enabled web applications within a hypertext markup language (HTML) and hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) framework.","2. Description of the Related Art","The evolution of the public switched telephone network has resulted in a variety of voice applications and services that can be provided to individual subscribers and business subscribers. Such services include voice messaging systems that enable landline or wireless subscribers to record, playback, and forward voice mail messages. However, the ability to provide enhanced services to subscribers of the public switched telephone network is directly affected by the limitations of the public switched telephone network. In particular, the public switched telephone network operates according to a protocol that is specifically designed for the transport of voice signals; hence any modifications necessary to provide enhanced services can only be done by switch vendors that have sufficient know-how of the existing public switched telephone network infrastructure.","An open standards-based Internet protocol (IP) network, such as the World Wide Web, the Internet, or a corporate intranet, provides client-server type application services for clients by enabling the clients to request application services from remote servers using standardized protocols, for example hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). The web server application environment can include web server software, such as Apache, implemented on a computer system attached to the IP network. Web-based applications are composed of HTML pages, logic, and database functions. In addition, the web server may provide logging and monitoring capabilities.","In contrast to the public switched telephone network, the open standards-based IP network has enabled the proliferation of web based applications written by web application developers using ever increasing web development tools. Hence, the ever increasing popularity of web applications and web development tools provides substantial resources for application developers to develop robust web applications in a relatively short time and an economical manner. However, one important distinction between telephony-based applications and web-based applications is that telephony-based applications are state aware, whereas web-based applications are stateless.","In particular, telephony applications are state aware to ensure that prescribed operations between the telephony application servers and the user telephony devices occur in a prescribed sequence. For example, operations such as call processing operations, voicemail operations, call forwarding, etc., require that specific actions occur in a specific sequence to enable the multiple components of the public switched telephone network to complete the prescribed operations.","The web-based applications running in the IP network, however, are state-less and transient in nature, and do not maintain application state because application state requires an interactive communication between the browser and back-end database servers accessed by the browsers via a HTTP-based web server. However, an HTTP server provides asynchronous execution of HTML applications, where the web applications in response to reception of a specific request in the form of a URL from a client, instantiate a program configured for execution of the specific request, send an HTML web page back to the client, and terminate the program instance that executed the specific request. Storage of application state information in the form of a \u201ccookie\u201d is not practical because some users prefer not to enable cookies on their browser, and because the passing of a large amount of state information as would normally be required for voice-type applications between the browser and the web application would substantially reduce the bandwidth available for the client.","Commonly-assigned, copending application Ser. No. 09\/480,485, filed Jan. 11, 2000, entitled Application Server Configured for Dynamically Generating Web Pages for Voice Enabled Web Applications, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference, discloses an application server that executes a voice-enabled web application by runtime execution of extensible markup language (XML) documents that define the voice-enabled web application to be executed. The application server includes a runtime environment that establishes an efficient, high-speed connection to a web server. The application server, in response to receiving a user request from a user, accesses a selected XML page that defines at least a part of the voice application to be executed for the user. The XML page may describe any one of a user interface such as dynamic generation of a menu of options or a prompt for a password, an application logic operation, or a function capability such as generating a function call to an external resource. The application server then parses the XML page, and executes the operation described by the XML page, for example dynamically generating an HTML page having voice application control content, or fetching another XML page to continue application processing. In addition, the application server may access an XML page that stores application state information, enabling the application server to be state-aware relative to the user interaction. Hence, the XML page, which can be written using a conventional editor or word processor, defines the application to be executed by the application server within the runtime environment, enabling voice enabled web applications to be generated and executed without the necessity of programming language environments.","Hence, web programmers can write voice-enabled web applications, using the teachings of the above-incorporated application Ser. No. 09\/480,485, by writing XML pages that specify respective voice application operations to be performed. The XML documents have a distinct feature of having tags that allow a web browser (or other software) to identify information as being a specific kind or type of information. Hence, the XML documents define the application to be executed by the application server within the runtime environment, enabling voice enabled web applications to be generated and executed without the necessity of programming language environments.","Wireless communications systems have been developed with enhanced functionality, relative to conventional landline networks, based on the unique characteristics of wireless communications. In particular, voice messaging becomes an important part of the wireless service offering due to the transient nature of wireless telephone users and the limited access to the wireless telephone. Wireless telephone users often are unavailable, for example when their wireless telephones are turned off to conserve battery power, when they are on an existing wireless telephone call, when they are roaming within an area where they cannot receive incoming calls, or when they are not within a coverage area. Consequently, voice messaging services are essential for wireless users.","A particular problem with messaging for wireless subscribers is the costs associated with accessing the subscriber's voice mail system for storage or retrieval of voice mail messages. In particular, telephony based voice mail systems for wireless subscribers of a prescribed home region typically are deployed coresident with the subscribers' mailbox storage within the home region, requiring the routing of a call to the subscriber's voice mail system location using telephony network facilities. If a subscriber calling into his or her mailbox is not in his or her voice mail system location, the call needs to be routed over a long distance or international long distance facilities back to the subscriber's voice mail location. In addition, callers leaving messages for a wireless subscriber that is not accessible are routed over telephony network facilities to the subscriber voice mail system location.","The routing of these calls presents a substantial traffic dilemma for the wireless service provider. Since wireless subscribers pay for incoming calls on some wireless networks, calls that terminate in a mailbox in response to a detected no answer condition or a busy condition results in additional charges for incoming calls. However, the wireless carrier must incur the additional expense of routing these calls over telephony network facilities.","There is a need for an arrangement that enables access to voice messaging systems for wireless subscribers to be terminated locally at the nearest wireless point of presence for a calling party accessing the voice messaging system for storage or retrieval of a message.","There is also a need for an arrangement that enables wireless service providers to avoid the costs associated with routing calls destined for a voice messaging system over telephony network facilities, such as interexchange carrier facilities or international facilities.","These and other needs are attained by the present invention, where an application server, configured for executing a messaging application defined by XML documents, is able to provide messaging services to a calling party for a remote subscriber based on retrieval of subscriber attribute information obtained from a remote information database server (such as LDAP) via an Internet Protocol (IP) network. The application server, upon receiving a voice application operation request having subscriber identifier information from a browser serving the calling party, obtains from the remote information database server attribute information for responding to the voice application operation request based on the subscriber identifier information. For example the subscriber identifier information may include a dialed number identification string (DNIS) in the case of a message storage operation for a calling party attempting to reach the subscriber; alternately, the subscriber identifier information may include a subscriber number and password in the case of a roaming subscriber accessing his or her message mailbox. The application server generates an HTML document having media content and control tags for personalized execution of the voice application operation based on the attribute information obtained from the standardized database server. The application server also is configured for sending and retrieving messages from a standardized remote messaging server (such as IMAP) via the IP network based on a destination address specified in the subscriber attribute information. The access of the remote information database server and the standardized remote messaging server via the IP network enables the application server to provide portable application services for roaming subscribers or calling parties. Hence, application infrastructure can be shared among multiple servers to provide portable application servers, eliminating the necessity of routing telephone calls across interexchange carrier facilities or international facilities.","One aspect of the present invention provides a method in an application server for executing a messaging application. The method includes receiving a first HTTP request, from a proxy browser serving a user, for execution of a prescribed messaging application operation related to a specified remote subscriber. Subscriber attribute information is obtained for the specified remote subscriber from an Internet Protocol (IP) based database server configured for storing subscriber attributes for local subscribers and retrieving the subscriber attributes for remote subscribers from remote IP based database servers. A Web page is generated, for execution of the prescribed messaging application operation and having media content and control tags, based on the first HTTP request and the obtained subscriber attribute information. The method also includes accessing via an IP network an IP-based messaging server for at least one of retrieval and storage of subscriber messaging information for the specified remote subscriber, based on a prescribed messaging address retrieved from the obtained subscriber attribute information and a second HTTP request received from the proxy browser and having a reference to the prescribed messaging application operation. Hence, the application server is configured for obtaining via the IP network subscriber attributes and subscriber messaging information, even for remote subscribers having information stored on remote servers. Hence, the application server can provide portable application services for mobile subscribers having devices lacking browser capabilities, eliminating the necessity that a mobile subscriber needs a browser to directly access a given server at the prescribed location.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a method in a wireless communications system of storing a message for a wireless subscriber. The method includes terminating by a mobile switching center an incoming wireless telephone call from a wireless user to a proxy device configured for generating HTTP requests and playback of media content based on selective execution of tagged information within Web pages. The method also includes initiating by the proxy device a messaging application session, related to the wireless subscriber, between the wireless user and an application server configured for generating the Web pages based on the respective HTTP requests, at least one of the HTTP requests specifying the wireless subscriber. The application server obtains subscriber attribute information related to the wireless subscriber from an Internet Protocol (IP) based database server via an IP network, and the proxy device supplies an HTTP request containing a message from the user to the application server. The application server sends the message via the IP network to an IP-based messaging server for storage based on a prescribed messaging address retrieved from the obtained subscriber attribute information. The retrieval of subscriber attribute information by the application server enables the application server to locate the prescribed messaging address for the wireless subscriber in order to send the message via the IP network, eliminating the necessity for telephony network facilities between the mobile switching center and the wireless subscriber's messaging system. Moreover, the retrieval of subscriber attribute information enables the application server to provide local messaging services for the wireless user via the mobile switching center, with personalized options as specified by the wireless subscriber, for example a personalized prompt.","Still another aspect of the present invention provides a method in a wireless communications system of retrieving a stored message for a roaming wireless subscriber. The method includes terminating by a mobile switching center an incoming wireless telephone call from the roaming wireless subscriber to a proxy device configured for generating HTTP requests and playback of media content based on selective execution of tagged information within Web pages. The method also includes initiating by the proxy device a messaging application session executed by an application server for the roaming wireless subscriber, the application server configured for generating the Web pages based on the respective HTTP requests, at least one of the HTTP requests specifying the wireless subscriber. The application server obtains subscriber attribute information related to the roaming wireless subscriber from an Internet Protocol (IP) based database server via an IP network, and obtains the stored message via the IP network from an IP-based messaging server based on a prescribed address retrieved from the obtained subscriber attribute information. The application server generates a Web page including tags for playback of the stored message to the roaming wireless subscriber by the proxy device. The initiation of a messaging application session with the application server enables the roaming wireless subscriber to access stored messages from remote messaging servers via the IP network, eliminating the necessity of establishing a long distance call between the mobile switching center and the roaming wireless subscriber's message store using telephony circuits. Hence, voice mail services may be provided for roaming wireless subscribers without reliance on telephony network facilities between the mobile switching center and the roaming wireless subscriber's message store.","Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the present invention may be realized and attained by means of instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["42","42","64","44","42","44","50","42","56"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b "]},"As shown in , each of the clients (tiny clients, skinny clients, thin clients and fat clients) are able to communicate via a single, unified architecture  that enables voice communications services between different clients, regardless of whether the client actually has browser capabilities. Hence, the fat client and the thin client are able to execute voice enabled web applications without any hardware modification or any modification to the actual browser; rather, the browsers  in the clients and merely are provided with an executable voice resource configured for providing browser audio control, described below.","The user devices , , and , illustrated as a cordless telephone , a fax machine having an attached telephone, and an analog telephone , are referred to herein as \u201cskinny clients\u201d, defined as devices that are able to interface with a user to provide voice and\/or data services (e.g., via a modem) but cannot perform any control of the associated access subnetwork.","The wireless user devices , , and , illustrated as a cellular telephone (e.g., AMPS, TDMA, or CDMA) , a handheld computing device (e.g., a 3-Com Palm Computing or Windows CE-based handheld device) , and a pager , are referred to as tiny clients. \u201cTiny clients\u201d are distinguishable from skinny clients in that the tiny clients tend to have even less functionality in providing input and output interaction with a user, rely exclusively on the executable application in an access subnetwork to initiate communications; in addition, tiny clients may not be able to send or receive audio signals such as voice signals at all.","Hence, the skinny clients , , and and the tiny clients , , and access the unified voice messaging services in the unified network  via a proxy browser , configured for providing an IP and HTTP interface for the skinny clients and the tiny clients. In particular, browsers operate by interpreting tags within a web page supplied via an HTTP connection, and presenting to a user media content information (e.g., text, graphics, streaming video, sound, etc.) based on the browser capabilities; if a browser is unable to interpret a tag, for example because the browser does not have the appropriate executable plug-in resource, then the browser typically will ignore the unknown tag. Hence, the proxy browser  can provide to each of the skinny clients and tiny clients the appropriate media content based on the capabilities of the corresponding client, such that the cordless telephone and telephone would receive analog audio signals played by the proxy browser  and no text information (unless a display is available); the fax machine and pager would only receive data\/text information, and the cellular telephone and the handheld computing device would receive both voice and data information. Hence, the proxy browser  interfaces between the IP network and the respective local access devices for the skinny clients and the tiny clients to provide access to the unified messaging network .","The proxy browser  and the web browsers  within the fat client and the thin client execute voice enabled web applications by sending data and requests to a web server , and receiving hypertext markup language (HTML) web pages from the web server , according to hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). The web server  serves as an interface between the browsers and an application server  that provides an executable runtime environment for XML voice applications. For example, the web server  may access the application server  across a common gateway interface (CGI) as illustrated in , by issuing a function call across an application programming interface (API), or by requesting a published XML document or an audio file requested by one of the browsers  or . The application server , in response to receiving a request from the web server , may either supply the requested information in the form of an HTML page having XML tags for audio control by a voice resource within the browser, or may perform processing and return a calculated value to enable the browser  or  to perform additional processing.","The application server  accesses selected stored XML application pages (i.e., XML pages that define an application) and in response generate new HTML pages having XML tags during runtime and supply the generated HTML pages having XML tags to the web server . Since multiple transactions may need to occur between the browser  or  and the application server , the application server  is configured for storing for each existing user session a data record, referred to as a \u201cbrownie\u201d, that identifies the state of the existing user session; hence, the application server  can instantiate a procedure, return the necessary data, and terminate the procedure without the necessity of maintaining the instance running throughout the entire user session.","Hence, the application server  executes voice application operations from a stored XML document based on a transient application state, where the application server  terminates the application instance after outputting the generated XML media information to the browser  or .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["66","20","22","18","24","28","25","62","26","66","66","86","88","92","66"],"i":["a ","d ","a","a ","a","a","a ","a"]},"Since the application server is configured for accessing the IMAP message store directory , the LDAP directory , and the registry according to IP protocol, the application server is able to access any directory having a valid IP address via the IP network , including the directories and associated with the wireless communications system . In particular, the application server can either directly access subscriber profile information from the LDAP directory via the IP network , or the application server may send a request to the LDAP directory , relying on the LDAP directory to search and retrieve from the LDAP directory the necessary subscriber profile information for a roaming subscriber.","Hence, assuming a wireless subscriber of the wireless communications system using the mobile telephone is roaming within the wireless communications system , but has all of his or her subscriber profile information stored in the LDAP directory , the roaming wireless subscriber can access the local application server for retrieval of messages stored in the IMAP message store , without relying on telephony network facilities within the public switched telephone network .","In addition, the access of the LDAP directory and the IMAP message store by the application server enables the application server to initiate a messaging operation, personalized on behalf of the roaming wireless subscriber , for a calling party attempting to reach the roaming wireless subscriber . In particular, the MSC , in response to detecting a determined unavailability of the roaming wireless subscriber , terminates the incoming call from the calling party to the IP gateway , causing the browser  to initiate a messaging application session with the application server by sending an HTTP request that includes the dialed number identification string (DNIS) of the roaming wireless subscriber . The application server , in response to receiving the HTTP request including the DNIS of the roaming wireless subscriber , obtains the subscriber profile information from the LDAP directory and possibly a personalized prompt from the IMAP message store , enabling the application server to provide for the calling party a messaging session on behalf of the roaming wireless subscriber .","Hence, the application server can provide local messaging services for either roaming subscribers , or wireless subscribers attempting to reach remote wireless subscribers, without the necessity of telephony network facilities of the public switched telephone network . Hence, the application server can provide portable application services based on accessing subscriber profile information via the IP network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["66","66","64","42","62","18","66","66"]},"The voice application server  is configured for accessing service application programming interfaces (API's)  to external resources based on prescribed procedures that may be called during parsing of an XML tags in a selected XML document. As described below, the application server  issues function calls to an API  for accessing the external resources for prescribed operations, enabling the deployment of a robust, scalable unified messaging system having messaging operations distributed across multiple platforms. In particular, the application server  accesses subscriber profile information from an IP-based database server  according to LDAP protocol. As described below, the application server  is configured for storing and retrieving messages in a standardized format (e.g., e-mail with binary encoded attachments) in an IMAP messaging server . In addition, the application server  may issue function calls for a text to speech resource, or an outgoing fax server, in order to deliver different-format messages to users, depending on the capability of the user devices. Hence, the voice application server  may access the text to speech resource for converting an e-mail message into a audio-based message to be played for the user of the telephony device . Similarly, the voice application server  may determine that the proxy browser  does not interface with a telephony gateway device having facsimile transmission capabilities, hence the fax message retrieved from the IMAP message store  would be sent to the outgoing fax server for retransmission to another telephone number identified as serving a fax machine.","The application server  is implemented as a server executing a PHP hypertext processor with XML parsing and processing capabilities, available open source on the Internet at http:\/\/www.php.net. As shown in , the server system  includes an XML parser  configured for parsing the application-defining XML documents stored in the XML document database , or the XML documents (i.e., \u201cbrownies\u201d) stored in the registry  and configured for specifying the state and attributes for respective user sessions. As described below with respect to , the application server  may store subscriber profile information for roaming subscribers for a minimum prescribed time interval beyond the duration of an individual user session, minimizing the number of times the application server  needs to access remote LDAP directories such as the directory of . The application server  also includes a high speed interface  that establishes a high-speed connection between the application server  and the web server . For example, the PHP hypertext processor includes a high-speed interface for Apache Web servers.","The application server  also includes a runtime environment  for execution of the parsed XML documents. As described above, the runtime environment  may selectively execute any one of user interface operation , a logic operation , or a procedure call  as specified by the parsed XML document by executing a corresponding set of executable functions based on the rule set for the corresponding operation. In particular, the application runtime environment  includes a tag implementation module  that implements the XML tags parsed by the XML parser . The tag implementation module  performs relatively low-level operations, for example dynamically generating an XML menu page using executable functions specified by a menu rule set in response to detecting a menu tag, performing a logical operation using executable functions specified by a logic rule set in response to a decision tag, or fetching an audio (.wav) file in response to detecting a sound tag. Hence, the tag implementation module  implements the tag operations that are specified within the XML framework of the stored XML documents.","The application server  also includes a set of libraries  that may be implemented as dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) or application programming interface (API) libraries. The libraries  enable the runtime environment  to implement the procedures  as specified by the appropriate XML document. For example, the application server  may issue a function call to one of a plurality of IP protocol compliant remote resources , , or  according to IMAP protocol, LDAP Protocol, or SMTP protocol, respectively, described below. For example, the PHP hypertext processor includes executable routines capable of accessing the IMAP or LDAP services. Note that the mechanisms for accessing the services , , or  should be established within the application server before use of XML documents that reference those services. Once the services , , or  are established, the application runtime environment  can perform a function operation by using executable functions specified by a function call rule set.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIGS. 4A and 4B"],"b":"20"},"As shown in , the method begins by the mobile switching center  attempting to terminate an incoming call from the calling party to the remote (e.g., roaming) wireless subscriber . The mobile switching center  terminates in step  the incoming call to a proxy device  (including the IP gateway  and the browser ) in response to detecting that the roaming wireless subscriber is unavailable. In response to detecting a connection established by the MSC , the proxy browser  posts in step  an HTTP request for initiation of a session enabling a calling party to leave a message. The proxy browser  posts the HTTP request to a prescribed URL that specifies the application server , and includes in the HTTP request the DNIS of the roaming wireless subscriber .
