title: Solid and liquid hybrid current transferring brush
abstract: The moving slip ring surface of electrical machinery transfers electrical current by contact thereof with liquid metal directly or through the tips of a plurality of closely spaced brushes positioned along the bottom of a housing under pressure within which the liquid metal is contained. The brush tips are respectively connected to lower ends of fibers electrically interconnected within the housing and exposed to the liquefied metal received and retained within the housing. According to one embodiment, the liquefied metal is retained within containment material filling the housing for contact exposure of the fibers therewith. According to another embodiment, exposure of the fibers to the liquefied metal within the housing is effected by entry of the liquefied metal into hollow brush tubes connected to and extending from the bottom of the housing, through which stem portions of the fibers extend to the brush tips.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention relates to the transfer of electrical current across a moving surface in an electric current collecting device.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","Currently many slip-ring brushes are made from solid carbon. Metal fiber brushes are generally known for providing a large number of electrical contact points on a rotor running surface, thereby providing low contact voltage drop. However such metal fiber brushes, supported by holders to which they are attached by soldering, as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,628,036, to Lynch, are readily deformed by high external forces which may arise in an electrical motor type of environment because of current and magnetic field interactions. Excessive loading of such metal fiber brushes when applied to the running rotor surface results in excessive brush spreading distortion, sometimes referred to as splay. While brushes may be made stronger by using larger fibers, this would result in fewer contact points and poor following of imperfections in the rotor surface. The use of liquid metal brushes has also been proposed so as to increase surface coverage and significantly reduce losses, which however introduces other problems requiring control over atmospheric environment and fluid stability. Much of the latter referred to problems are avoided by the present invention for a more efficient electrical current collector.","Pursuant to the present invention, a physical type of container is provided for retention therein of liquefied conductive metal  sealingly enclosed within a housing from which porous brush components project into contact with a moving conductive slip-ring surface of electrical machinery for transfer of electrical current thereto under a light contact pressure applied to the housing. During operation of the machinery, the slip-ring surface is exposed to some of the liquefied metal at tips of the brush components in contact with the moving surface, while the slip-ring is atmospherically exposed to the liquefied metal. The quantity of liquid metal exposed to the atmosphere within the machinery is thereby limited so as to significantly increase the life of the current collector.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate a hybrid brush assembly , constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, positioned in contact with a moving slip ring surface  within an electric current collector region of electrical machinery. The brush assembly  has closely spaced pore openings through which liquid metal at a lower bottom  of a reservoir housing  is applied to the slip-ring running surface  through fiber tips  in contact therewith as shown in .","A small amount of the liquid metal from the reservoir housing  enters the tips  through fibers  connected thereto, made of a low-melting point metallic alloy or a porous liquid containment material  such as aero-gel foam. The liquefied metal completely fills the chamber within the housing  about the fibers . When the brush assembly  is fabricated, the liquid metal is drawn into the containment material  by vacuum.","According to another embodiment of the present invention as shown in , a hybrid brush assembly \u2032 is positioned above the slip ring surface . The brush assembly \u2032 has a support housing \u2032 with a lower bottom \u2032 from which a plurality of hollow brush tubes  extend. Brush tips \u2032 are connected to lower ends of the brush tubes  for contact with the slip ring surface . As shown in , each of the hollow brush tubes  encloses an evacuated chamber formed about an optional fiber stem  to increase conductivity. The fiber stems  within the tubes  are exposed to liquefied metal  withdrawn from the liquid containment material  filling a reservoir housing \u2032 thereabove. Such fiber stems  are electrically interconnected through conductive attachments  with an electrically conductive base plate  positioned on the bottom \u2032 of the housing \u2032. The fiber tips \u2032 environmentally exposed outside of the tubes  at their lower ends may be provided with a protective inert material coating , such as varnish to protect the liquid metal absorbed within the tips \u2032 when the brush assembly \u2032 is in storage prior to use. Additionally, the fiber stem  may be removed from the hollow tube  which is completely filled with the liquid metal  to produce a liquefied metal drop held in place by combined actions of surface tension and vacuum.","Since the liquid metal  is well contained and sealed within the housing \u2032 and within the brush tubes  as hereinbefore described, there is very little reaction thereof with the environmental atmosphere so as to minimize reaction of the liquid metal  with the atmosphere. Furthermore, the brush assembly  or \u2032 is effective to perform transfer of current to the surface  under a very light pressure force  applied to the housing  or \u2032 as diagrammed in . Friction related losses and wear rates are accordingly very low.","In accordance with other embodiments of the present invention, the liquefied metal containment material  within the housing  or \u2032 may be formed from carbon or silica aerogel for example, within which the liquid metal  is retained by capillarity and vacuum. Conductive metal or non-conductive micro-tubes made of polymers for example could also be used in association with a conductive base interface in contact with the liquid metal . According to still other alternative embodiments, the liquid metal containment tubes  may be replaced by fabric strips  as shown in , with button holes at each strip end through which the strips are attached to retention hooks  and stretched over a current collector region of the reservoir housing \u2033. The liquid metal passes through a screen  forming a bottom of the housing \u2033 and then between fabric micro fibers  making contact with the slip-ring surface . The liquid metal reservoir within the housing \u2033 may be refilled with the material  or pressurized through a filling port  connected to the top of the housing \u2033.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
