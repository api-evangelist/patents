title: Search-based filtering for property grids
abstract: Technologies for search-based filtering of a property grid. Such filtering allows a user to enter a search term into an easily recognized search text box, or apply a user or pre-defined term to a property grid, thus reducing the set of properties visible so that the user has a smaller list to search to find the one on which they desire to operate. The search term is typically applied to all properties shown in the property grid. Elements that match the search term are made visible in an updated property grid while those that do not match are not presented. Also, the search term may be applied to more than just the name of the property. It may be applied to a category within which the property appears, the type of the property, or any of a number of attributes or tags that may be applied to the property.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["It is common for user interface design and development tools to make use of a \u201cproperty grid\u201d to provide a user one place to look for the properties of selected objects. Via such a property grid the user can inspect the values of properties and edit properties as appropriate. While such a property grid allows the user to easily discover where a property can be edited, there are often so many properties that the user must spend time finding the particular property that he wants to inspect or edit.","Some property grids attempt to mitigate this problem by providing two views of the property grid: a first view that is categorized such that, if the user can find the category for the property he wants to edit, then the number of properties that they have to search is reduced to only those in the category; and a second view that is arranged alphabetically by property name, allowing the user to search visually if he knows the name of the property.","There are several issues with this approach. First, the user can only effectively search the categorized view if he knows how to categorize the property for which he is looking in the same way that the creators of the categorization did. For this reason most users tend to use a property grid in the alphabetically sorted view. But in the alphabetically sorted view the user must first know the name of the property and then visually search a long list of entries to find the property for which they are looking. This adds overhead or cognitive load to every operation the user wishes to perform in the property grid.","The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding to the reader. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure and it does not identify key\/critical elements of the invention or delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts disclosed herein in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","To solve the problems described herein above, the present examples provide search-based filtering of a property grid. Such filtering allows the user to enter a search term into an easily recognized search text box or apply a user or pre-defined term to a property grid, thus reducing the set of properties visible so that the user has a smaller list to search to find the one on which they desire to operate. The search term is typically applied to all properties shown in the property grid. Elements that match the search term are made visible in an updated property grid while those that do not match are not presented. Also, the search term may be applied to more than just the name of the property. It may be applied to a category within which the property appears, the type of the property, or any of a number of attributes or tags that may be applied to the property.","Many of the attendant features will be more readily appreciated as the same become better understood by reference to the following detailed description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.","Like reference numerals are used to designate like parts in the accompanying drawings.","The detailed description provided below in connection with the accompanying drawings is intended as a description of the present examples and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present examples may be constructed or utilized. The description sets forth at least some of the functions of the examples and\/or the sequence of steps for constructing and operating examples. However, the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different examples.","Although the present examples are described and illustrated herein as being implemented in a computing environment, the environment described is provided as an example and not a limitation. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the present examples are suitable for application in a variety of different types of computing environments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","110","100","120","120","110","100","140","120","130"]},"SBF system  typically includes a search string parser (\u201cSSP\u201d)  that accepts search term . Search term  may be a single or compound term. For example, a user may filter a property grid using the search term \u201cwidth\u201d. Alternatively, the user may filter based on several terms such as \u201cwidth height depth\u201d. SSP  generally parses the search term string provided by the user into filter , providing input validation and error checking as is common in the art.","SBF system  also typically includes filter  that maintains a set of search predicates based on the parses search term string provided by SSP . Filter  may be applied to an input property grid to search for elements matching the search predicates. For example, given the search term \u201cwidth\u201d, a single search predicate representing the term \u201cwidth\u201d is maintained by filter . Alternatively, for given the search term \u201cwidth height depth\u201d, three search terms are maintained: one for \u201cwidth\u201d, a second for \u201cheight\u201d and a third for \u201cdepth\u201d. Filter  generally searches the input property grid  for metadata that either match or contain the search predicates. In one example, such metadata may include properties names, categories, and\/or types. Additionally or alternatively, other metadata may be used.","In one example, SBF system  includes ApplyFilter Method (\u201cAFM\u201d) . In this example, AFM  checks with filter  to see if a match exists between the search term  and each property of each category that is currently editable. Generally a category is editable if it is currently presented in property grid , such as when an associated object is selected in a host UI tool. For each category or property match, the result is stored in search results data store (\u201cSRDS\u201d) . Upon completion of the matching by AFM , SBF system  updates the property grid with the results stored in SRDS  resulting in updated property grid . SRDS  may be any suitable data storage mechanism coupled to SBF system , and may or may not be an integral component of SBF system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","120","202","204","200","220","230","240","230","232","234","234","240","242","200","210","110"]},"A property editor is typically some form of edit control used to edit a property value, such as the input field of Width property  shown containing the value . As used herein, the term property editor generally refers to a UI mechanism operable to display the name or identifier or the like of the property along with a means of editing the property value.

In one example, testing for a match is performed on multiple pieces of metadata associated with the category, including category name and type.

Testing is generally performed for each search predicate. In one example, testing for a match is performed on multiple pieces of metadata associated with the property, including property name, category, and type. Alternatively or additionally, other metadata may be tested. In one example, if a search predicate is located in a tested piece of metadata, the property is considered matching. For example, the advanced property name \u201cMaxWidth\u201d  is considered a match to the search predicate \u201cwidth\u201d. Note that case may be ignored.
