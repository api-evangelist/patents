Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an image receiving material for electrophotography for forming a reflected image and particularly to an image receiving material for electrophotography capable of forming a highly qualified toner reflected image similar to photography with respect to smoothness.","2. Description of Related Art","An electrophotographic method is an image forming method applying a photoconductive effect and electrostatic phenomenon, and the method is widely utilized in a variety of fields. The electrophotographic method has two kinds: one is to form an image on a semiconductor material itself such as zinc oxide paper; the other is to form an image by further transferring a toner image to a recording medium capable of receiving toner images. The latter, called a xerography method, is widely employed in copying machines for offices, and the image forming principle is described below.","First, electrostatic charges are placed in the dark on a photosensitive plate having a photoconductor such as selenium by using corona charge or the like, and when the charged plate is exposed to an original image, charges are dissipated only in irradiated portions to form a latent image where the charges remain. Negatively charged toners, after mixed with carriers and introduced to the latent image, are attracted to the latent image. Then, the image receiving material made of, for example, a paper is applied on the toners and the toners are transferred by heating to a recording medium to form an image on the recording medium.","In recent years, color copying machines are further widely used, and those color copying machines carry out the aforementioned method by utilizing color toners. Because the color copying machines are mostly used for copying images rather than letters, the images to be formed are sought to be clear and highly qualified. However, when color copying is made on a plain paper, clear and highly qualified images cannot be achieved. Particularly, inferiority of glossiness has been raised as a major problem. Thus, it has been sought to improve image receiving materials used for photography application.","It is an object of the invention to eliminate the aforementioned problems of the prior art. In other words, the invention provides, as an object to be accomplished, an image receiving material for electrophotography capable of forming a toner reflected image excelling in smoothness (glossiness) and serving as material for photography application. The invention further provides, as another object to be accomplished, an image receiving material for electrophotography capable of forming a highly qualified toner reflected image without degrading image quality caused by image roughness or removal.","The inventors diligently studied to solve the above problems, and they found that controlling a flow starting temperature of a toner image receiving layer can form highly qualified toner reflected image without image roughness and removal, and therefore the invention has been reached.","This invention provides an image receiving material for electrophotography having, on a support, one or more structural layers including a toner image receiving layer, in which at least one layer of the structural layers contains plasticizer, and in which a flow starting temperature of the toner image receiving layer is at 30\u00b0 C. or higher that is, as well, lower than a temperature of a flow starting temperature of toner resin+10\u00b0 C.","Plasticizer used in the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention preferably has a logP value of 20 or lower, an (organic\/inorganic) value of 6 or lower, a molecular weight of 150 to 20000, and a partial structure derived from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. In addition, a toner image receiving layer of the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention preferably contains one or more additives selected from a group consisting of a plasticizer, a charge controlling agent, electroconductive metal oxide, a fluoroorganic compound and additives for photography.","An image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention will be further explained in detail hereinafter.","The image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention is characterized in having a toner image receiving layer with a flow starting temperature of 30\u00b0 C. or higher that is, as well, lower than a temperature of a flow starting temperature of toner resin+10\u00b0 C. \u201cFlow starting temperatures\u201d referred in the specification are temperatures measured by a flow tester CFT. 500 D model manufactured by Shimidzu Corporation using a die (nozzle) having a diameter of 0.5 mm and a thickness of 1.0 mm under conditions of an extrusion load application of 50 kg and initial set temperature of 50\u00b0 C. After preheating time of 300 seconds, a stroke of a piston is measured at each temperature while temperature is uniformly up at a rate of 5\u00b0 C. per minute, and consequently a temperature at which a flow starts is designated as a flow starting temperature. According to attached , the temperature at D corresponds to a flow starting temperature. The inventors confirmed that a flow starting temperature is an important solid state property during toner fixation, and then they reached the invention by controlling the range of the flow starting temperature.","In the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention, a flow starting temperature of the toner image receiving layer is not especially limited as long as the flow starting temperature is 30\u00b0 C. or higher that is, as well, lower than the temperature of a flow starting temperature+10\u00b0 C. The range of the temperature is preferably from 30 to 90\u00b0 C., especially preferably from 35 to 85\u00b0 C.","In the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention, at least one layer of the structural layers is a layer containing plasticizer. \u201cPlasticizer\u201d as used here is a compound for facilitating fluidization and softening (referred to as \u201cplasticization\u201d hereinafter) of binder or solid components constituting layers by heating during toner fixation.","The image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention preferably uses plasticizer having a logP value of 20 or lower. The logP value is more preferably 15 or lower, and further preferably in a range of 0.70 to 15. The logP value of 21 or higher tends to reduce an effect improving smoothness (glossiness) when a toner reflected image is formed. A \u201clogp value\u201d used in the specification is calculated with a commercially available MacLogP Version2.0.3 (manufactured by Biobyte).","The (organic\/inorganic) value of plasticizer used in the invention is preferably 6 or lower, and the lower limit is preferably 0.20 or higher. The (organic\/inorganic) value of 7 or higher tends to reduce an effect improving smoothness (glossiness) when a toner reflected image is formed. Here, \u201corganic\u201d and \u201cinorganic\u201d are concepts for predicting a property of a compound, and the details of the concepts are described, for example, in \u201cYu-ki Gainenzu. Kiso to Ouyo.\u201d, or Organic Conceptual Diagram. Fundamentals and Applications., Ch. 1, p. 13 (Yoshio Kohda, published by Sankyo Syuppan). It is experimentally known that such solvent for dissolving organic compound is generally preferred as having an (organic\/inorganic) value close to the (organic\/inorganic) value of the organic compound.","The plasticizer used in the invention has a molecular weight of, preferably, 150 to 20000, further preferably, 200 to 10000, especially preferably 300 to 10000. The plasticizer having a molecular weight of less than 150 volatilizes and scatters or the like in the air during preservation, so this may cause air pollution. On the other hand, the plasticizer having a molecular weight of more than 20000 cannot fully plasticize the layer, so an effect improving smoothness (glossiness) of a toner reflected image formed tends to be lower.","The plasticizer is contained in at least one layer of the layers constituting the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention. Thus, the plasticizer can be added to either layer of a toner image receiving layer, a protective layer, an interlayer, or an undercoating layer and the like. Preferable is the case where plasticizer is contained in a layer to which tension caused by filling of toner particles in an image receiving material is carried. In particular, the plasticizer is preferably contained in a layer to which strain caused by tension (physical strain such as elasticity or viscosity, strain by material balance at molecules, binder main chains, or pendant parts, or other strains) is carried, and within the layer, the plasticizer is preferably contained in portions capable of easing these tension or strain. For example, a toner image receiving layer, a layer adjacent to the toner image receiving layer, or a surface layer is desirable as containing the plasticizer. The plasticizer contained in a layer may be in a micro-scattered state, in a phase separating state with micro-sea island forms, or in a state of fully mixing and dissolving with the other component such as binder or the like.","The plasticizer should fulfill a function facilitating plasticization of binder or solid components constituting layers by heat during the toner fixation. Thus, thermophysical properties such as a flow starting point, a softening point, or a melting point of the plasticizer is desirably lower than a toner fixing temperature in a state of mixing with components constituting the layers. It is generally known that mixing two or more kinds of compounds makes thermophysical property temperature lowered. Commercially available electrophotographic printers have generally a toner fixing temperature of 100 to 170\u00b0 C., but the temperature differs depending on conveying speeds, sizes of fixing part, types of paper to be passed, or the like. The thermophysical property of the plasiticizer of the invention is suitably selected depending on binder or other components constituting the layer. For example, a melting point is preferably 300\u00b0 C. or lower, further preferably in a range from 0.100 to 250\u00b0 C., especially preferably in a range from 0.100 to 200\u00b0 C., and T1\/2 method temperature of flow tester tests also has the same ranges mentioned above. Glass transition temperature is preferably 250\u00b0 C. or lower, more preferably in a range from 0.100 to 200\u00b0 C., especially preferably in a rage from 0.50 to 150\u00b0 C.","Provided that a total weight of binder, plasticizer, and other components constituting a layer is 100% by weight, the adding amount of the plasticizer is preferably in a rage from 0.001 to 90% by weight, more preferably in a range from 0.1 to 60% by weight, especially preferably in a range from 1 to 40% by weight.","The plasticizer usable in the invention may be selected by referring to the followings: \u201cKagaku Binran\u201d (ed. Chemical Society of Japan, published by Maruzen), \u201cKatozai Sono Riron to Ouyo\u201d (Kouichi Murai, published by Saiwai Shobo), \u201cKatozai no Kenkyu, First volume\u201d, \u201cKatozai no Kenkyu, Second volume\u201d (ed.

When the electric resistance is less than 1. 10., the density of the resulting toner images tends to become low due to an insufficient amount of toners to be transferred to the toner image receiving layer. On the other hand, when the electric resistance is over 1. 10., the density of the images tends to become low since more than a required amount of electric charges are produced, resulting in that toners are not sufficiently transferred.

For example, known toners for color electrophotographic method can be used, and it is preferable to form images with three colors constituted of yellow, magenta, and cyan, or with four colors constituted of those three colors and black. Furthermore, two or more toners having different densities of respective colors can be used. Also, transparent or white toners can be used.","Furthermore, toners having a UV absorbability, or toners containing various additives raised above as additives for the toner image receiving layer may be used. For example, the toner containing an anti-color fading agent provides an advantage capable of forming toner images excelling in an image preserving property. It may be possible to use two or more toners which are reacted to develop some functions. Furthermore, the toner having a higher softening point than others may be used together as, what is called, a matte agent. It also may be possible that effective density is changed to form a part of the gradation by using toners having different contact angles with respect to the toner image receiving layer in a melting state and controlling the spreading of each toner during fixation.","The present invention will now be described in details with reference to the following examples. Materials, utilization amounts, proportions, operations or the like shown in the following examples can be suitably changed as long as they are not deviated from the effect of the invention. Thus, the scope of the invention is not limited to the examples shown below.","Note, in the examples and comparative examples, \u201c%\u201d and \u201cparts\u201d indicates \u201c% by weight\u201d and \u201cparts by weight\u201d respectively.","Manufacture process of a support A used in examples is shown in the present manufacturing examples.","Support A was prepared by using materials shown in Table 11 described below. Polyethylene layers (PE layers) were formed on the both sides of a quality paper, and the both sides were subjected to corona discharge treatment. Then, the back surface was coated with composition for back layers by using a wire coater and then dried to form a back layer, and the surface was coated with composition for surface undercoating layer and then dried to form a surface undercoating layer. Thus, a support A was prepared by corona discharge treatment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e5982","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 11"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Film"]},{"entry":[{},{},"thickness"]},{"entry":["Layer name","Structure of Substrate A","(\u03bcm)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Surface under-","Gelatin",{},"0.1"]},{"entry":"coating Layer"},{"entry":["Surface PE","Low density polyethylene","50 Parts","26"]},{"entry":["layer (Glossy)","(Density 0.923)"]},{"entry":[{},"High density polyethylene","50 Parts"]},{"entry":[{},"(Density 0.955)"]},{"entry":["Pulp layer","High quality paper (LBKP\/",{},"152"]},{"entry":[{},"NBSP = 6\/4, Density 1.053)"]},{"entry":["Back surface","Low density polyethylene","35 Parts","23"]},{"entry":["PE layer (Matte)","(Density 0.923)"]},{"entry":[{},"High density polyethylene","65 Parts"]},{"entry":[{},"(Density 0.955)"]},{"entry":["Back layer","Polyester resin","63 Parts","0.1"]},{"entry":[{},"(VYLONAL MD-1930, manu-"]},{"entry":[{},"factured by Toyobo Co., Ltd.)"]},{"entry":[{},"Matte agent","35 Parts"]},{"entry":[{},"(EPOSTER L15, manufactured"]},{"entry":[{},"by Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd.)"]},{"entry":[{},"Surfactant (Chemical formula 1)","\u20022 Parts",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"201.2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Coating liquid for forming the surface undercoating layer shown in Table 11 was made using following composition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e6389","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Gelatin","\u20025 g"]},{"entry":[{},"Water","95 g"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":"2 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e6471","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Polyester resin","90","g"]},{"entry":[{},"(VYLONAL MD- 1930 manufactured"]},{"entry":[{},"by Toyobo Co., Ltd.)"]},{"entry":[{},"Matte agent","50","g"]},{"entry":[{},"(EPOSTER L15 manufactured"]},{"entry":[{},"by Nippon Shokubai Co., Ltd.)"]},{"entry":[{},"Surfactant (Chemical formula 1)","3","g"]},{"entry":[{},"Water","10000","g"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"The surfactant used in Table 11 and aforementioned composition was a compound having a following structure. \n\n","A support A prepared in the manufacturing example, a support B made of Mirrorcoat.Platinum (manufactured by Oji paper Co., Ltd.), a support C made of Whitemirrorcoat Cover.

of 11 inches 0.17 inches. The A4 size sheets were set on color laser printers (Color Laser Window 3320 PS manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd.), and the sheets of 11 inches 0.17 inches were set on color printers (DocuColor 5750 manufactured by Xerox Co., Ltd.). Images from computers were printed on the respective sheets. The images printed included four types, that is, white, grey (image: R=G=B=50%), black, and a woman portrait.","After printing process, the gloss degree at 45. was measured by using a glossmeter. Table 12 to 16 showed results of measuring the same positions with respect to images of white, grey and black. Table 12 to 16 also showed results of glossiness evaluations where indicated 15 or lower of the difference of the three gloss degrees, indicated 30 or lower, and indicated over 30. Table 12 to 16 further showed results of evaluations of the images of the woman portrait where indicated that 25 or more among 30 persons judged the image as preferable, indicated that 20 or more judged the image as preferable, and indicated that less than 20 judged the image as preferable.","Each example of the invention had good conditions with respect to image roughness, removal and fragility. In addition, each example, after printed, was able to be printed again on its back surface.","In addition, printings were made on the image receiving materials for electrophotography manufactured in Examples and Comparative examples by using commercially available color laser printers, more specifically, a full-color laser printer (A color 629) manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., LP. 8000C manufactured by Seiko Epson Corporation, COLOR PAGEPRESTO N4. ST manufactured by Casio Denshi Kogyo, COLOR LASER SHOT LBP. 2030 manufactured by Canon Inc., magicolor2 manufactured by QMS Japan K.K., color LaserBit KL. 201 manufactured by Konica Corporation, JX. 8200 manufactured by Sharp Corporation, BEAMSTAR. RW manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd., and Color Page Pro POWER SUPPLY manufactured by Minolta Co., Ltd, and the same results were gained as shown in Table 12 to 16.","Flow starting temperatures of the toner image receiving layers of the image receiving materials for electrophotography manufactured in Examples and Comparative examples are measured as follows. Toner image receiving layers of the manufactured image receiving materials were cut off and crushed finely in a mortar, and subjected to vacuum drying. The samples were treated with a flow tester CFT. 500 D model manufactured by Shimidzu Corporation using a die (nozzle) having a diameter of 0.5 mm and a thickness of 1.0 mm under conditions of an extrusion load application of 50 kg and initial set temperature of 50\u00b0 C. After preheating time of 300 seconds, a stroke of a piston was measured at each temperature while temperature was uniformly up at a rate of 5\u00b0 C. per minute, and consequently a temperature at which a flow starts was designated as flow starting temperature (Temperature at D in FIG. ). The results were shown in Table 12 to 16.","The toner resins of the color laser printer (Color Laser Window 3320 PS) manufactured by Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., and the color Copiers (DocuColor 5750) manufactured by Xerox Co., Ltd. were measured, and as a result, the toner resin of the Color Laser Window 3320 PS had flow starting temperatures of 73.6\u00b0 C., 73.5\u00b0 C., 74.0\u00b0 C., and 73.9\u00b0 C. in yellow, magenta, cyan and black respectively in this order and the toner resin of the DocuColor 5750 had flow starting temperatures of 74.8\u00b0 C., 74.1\u00b0 C., 76.2\u00b0 C., and 73.9\u00b0 C. in the same order mentioned above.","Using an image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention having a toner image receiving layer with a flow starting temperature lower than the temperature of a flow starting temperature of toner resin+10\u00b0 C. can provide formation of toner reflected images similar to photographs with respect to smoothness (glossiness) and also provide no image degradation by image roughness or removal. Consequently, the image receiving material for electrophotography of the invention can be in wide use for photography applications.","The foregoing description of preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
