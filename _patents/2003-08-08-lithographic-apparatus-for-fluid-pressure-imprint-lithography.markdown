The foregoing '140 application, '174 application and '742 patent are each incorporated herein by reference.","This application is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

The foregoing Jan. 27, 2003 application, the '594 application, the '006 application and the '809 application are each incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was supported in part under DARPA, Grant N66001-98-1-8900. The government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates to apparatus for performing imprint lithography wherein direct fluid pressure is used to press a mold into a thin film. The apparatus is particularly useful to provide nanoimprint lithography of enhanced resolution and uniformity over an increased area.","Lithography is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits and many optical, magnetic and micromechanical devices. Lithography creates a pattern on a thin film carried on a substrate so that, in subsequent process steps, the pattern can be replicated in the substrate or in another material which is added onto the substrate.","Conventional lithography typically involves applying a thin film of resist to a substrate, exposing the resist to a desired pattern of radiation, and developing the exposed film to produce a physical pattern. In this approach, resolution is limited by the wavelength of the radiation, and the equipment becomes increasingly expensive as the feature size becomes smaller.","Nanoimprint lithography, based on a fundamentally different principle offers high resolution, high throughput, low cost and the potential of large area coverage. In nanoimprint lithography, a mold with nanoscale features is pressed into a thin film, deforming the shape of the film according to the features of the mold and forming a relief pattern in the film. After the mold is removed, the thin film can be processed to remove the reduced thickness portions. This removal exposes the underlying substrate for further processing. Details of nanoimprint lithography are described in applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905 issued Jun. 30, 1998 and entitled \u201cNanoimprint Lithography\u201d. The '905 patent is incorporated herein by reference.","The usual method of pressing the mold into the thin film involves positioning the mold and the substrate on respective rigid plates of a high precision mechanical press. With such apparatus, the process can generate sub-25 nm features with a high degree of uniformity over areas on the order of 12 in 2. Larger areas of uniformity would be highly advantageous to increase throughput and for many applications such as displays.","Improved apparatus for imprint lithography involves using direct fluid pressure to press a mold into a substrate-supported film. Advantageously the mold and\/or substrate are sufficiently flexible to provide wide area contact under the fluid pressure. Fluid pressing can be accomplished by sealing the mold against the film and disposing the resulting assembly in a pressurized chamber. The result of this fluid pressing is enhanced resolution and high uniformity over an enlarged area.","It is to be understood that these drawing are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and are not to scale.","The use of a high precision mechanical press to press a mold into a thin film presents tolerance problems in replicating small patterns over large areas. Presses move on guide shafts through apertures, and the spacings between the shafts and their respective apertures can be large compared to the features to be replicated. Such spacings permit undesirable relative translational and rotational shifts between the substrate and the mold. Moreover, despite the most careful onstruction, the molds and the substrates used in lithography are not perfectly planar. When these molds and substrates are disposed on the rigid plates of a press, the deviations from planarity over large areas can result in variations in the molding pressure and depth of imprint. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method of imprint lithography which avoids the limitations of mechanical presses.","In accordance with the invention, the problem of unwanted lateral movements of mechanical presses is ameliorated by using direct fluid pressure to press together the mold and the moldable surface. The inventive methods apply fluid pressure over a surface of the mold, the substrate supporting the moldable surface or both. Because the fluid pressure is isostatic, no significant unbalanced lateral forces are applied. Direct fluid pressure also includes fluid pressure transmitted to the mold or substrate via a flexible membrane, as it does not interfere with the transmission of isostatic pressure from the fluid. And streaming pressurized fluid from numerous openings in a pressure vessel can also apply nearly isostatic direct fluid pressure on the mold or substrate.","It is contemplated that the invention will have important applications in the molding of a pattern on a previously patterned substrate. The mold can be aligned with the previous pattern using conventional alignment techniques, and imprinting by direct fluid pressure minimizes any relative lateral shifts with consequent improvement in the alignment of the two patterns.","This description is divided into two parts: Part I describes the method of fluid pressure imprint lithography, and Part II describes apparatus for performing the method.","I. Fluid Pressure Imprint Lithography","Referring to the drawings,  is a schematic flow diagram of an improved process for imprint lithography using direct fluid pressure. An initial step shown in Block A, is to provide a mold having a plurality of protruding features and a substrate-supported thin film of moldable material. The protruding features are preferably micrometer scale features and, more advantageously, nanoscale features. The method is highly advantageously where the mold surface has at least two protruding features spaced apart by at least one lateral dimension less than 200 nm. A moldable material is one which retains or can be hardened to retain the imprint of protruding features from a mold surface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","20","21","11","12","13","11","12","12","13","21","13","21"]},"In high resolution applications, the mold and the substrate are advantageously made of the same material in order to minimize misalignment due to differential thermal expansion or contraction.","Preferably the mold body , the substrate  (or both) is flexible so that, under the force of fluid pressure, the mold and the substrate will conform despite deviations from planarity. Silicon substrates of thickness less than 2 mm exhibit such flexibility for typical imprint pressures.","The next step, shown in Block B, is to place the mold and the thin-film together and to seal the interface of the mold with the thin film, forming a mold\/film assembly. If the thin film already includes a previously formed pattern, then the pattern of the mold should be carefully aligned with the previous pattern on the film in accordance with techniques well known in the art. The objective of the sealing is to permit external fluid pressure to press the mold into the film. The sealing can be effected in a variety of ways such as by providing a ring of material such as an elastomeric gasket around the area to be molded and peripherally clamping the assembly.","The third step (Block C) is to press the mold into the film by direct fluid pressure. One method for doing this is to dispose the assembly in a pressure vessel and introduce pressurized fluid into the vessel. The advantage of fluid pressure is that it is isostatic. The resulting force uniformly pushes the mold into the thin film. Shear or rotational components are de minimus. Moreover since the mold and\/or substrate are flexible rather than rigid, conformation between the mold and the film is achieved regardless of unavoidable deviations from planarity. The result is an enhanced level of molding resolution, alignment and uniformity over an increased area of the film. The pressurized fluid can be gas or liquid. Pressurized air is convenient and typical pressures are in the range 1-1000 psi. The fluid can be heated, if desired, to assist in heating the moldable thin film. Cooled fluid can be used to cool the film.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","31","30","32","31","34","35","31","36","37","38"]},"The next step shown in Block D, is to harden the moldable thin film, if necessary, so that it retains the imprint of the mold and to remove the mold. The process for hardening depends on the material of the thin film. Some materials will maintain the imprint with no hardening. Thermoplastic materials can be hardened by preliminarily heating them prior to molding and permitting them to cool after imprint. PMMA, for example, can be suitably softened by heating to 200\u00b0 C. prior to molding and hardened by cooling after imprint. Heat curable materials can be hardened by applying heat during imprint. The above-described heater  and\/or the use of a heated pressurized fluid can effectuate such hardening. Radiation curable materials can be hardened by the application of UV radiation during imprint. Such radiation can be supplied through the window  of the pressure vessel. The mold can be made of transparent material to permit the radiation to reach the film. Alternatively, the substrate can be transparent and the window positioned to illuminate the film through the substrate.","The fifth step shown in Block E is optional in some applications. It is to remove contaminants (if any) and excess material from the recesses of the molded thin film. The molded film will have raised features and recesses. In many lithographic operations it is desirable to eliminate the material from the recesses so that the underlying substrate is exposed for further processing. This can be conveniently accomplished using reactive ion etching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["4","4","21","10","40","13","21","41","42","21","43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["21","21","41","43"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["44","20"]},"In important applications the resulting structure is a resist-covered semiconductor substrate with a pattern of recesses extending to the substrate as shown in .

The groove  can hold an o-ring  between the cap  and the mold . The o-ring decreases fluid outflow between the cap  and the mold , increasing the molding pressure and making it more uniform.","Alternatively, the substrate holder  can have the same structure as cap  so that the substrate is also pressed by jets of pressurized fluid.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","801","802","803","804","805","801","806","804","800","807","808","809","810","808","810"]},"In an advantageous embodiment, the substrate  and mold  have alignment features  which permit their precise alignment prior to the imprinting step.","Also advantageously, the aligned substrate and mold are disposed on a tray  which can be withdrawn from chamber , loaded with the substrate and mold and inserted into the chamber. The tray  preferably includes shoulders  for supporting the substrate and mold and an opening  underlying the substrate. A fluid impermeable layer  is disposed between the fluid source openings  and the substrate and the mold.","The upper cylindrical section , which can include heating lamps  is fixed between planar top  and a fixed bottom plate .

During the imprinting process, precise alignment of mold  and substrate  is crucial. This is achieved using optical or electrical alignment techniques. For example, sensor  and alignment marks  and  may be an optical detector and optical alignment marks which generate a moire alignment pattern such that moire alignment techniques may be employed to position mold  relative to substrate .

Using this technique, alignment is achieved by moving block  in the x-y plane to maximize the capacitance between alignment marks  and . The controller directs imprinting by controlling the introduction and removal of pressurized fluid into the pressure chamber. The controller  may monitor and control the temperature of the substrate .","The heating of the substrate can be supplied by a radiation heating, which can be provided by a light source or light sources. The radiation sources can radiate from one side of the wafer and mask assembly or from several sides or from all sides.","The chamber of the apparatus can be opened or closed by a piston or a screw-powered lift. The chamber will be evacuated by a vacuum pump.","The invention may now be better understood by consideration of the following specific examples.","A silicon wafer of 4\u2033 diameter is coated with a layer of PMMA 150 nm thick. A mold is made of a 4\u2033 diameter silicon wafer and has plural silicon dioxide protruding patterns 100 nm thick on one side of its surface. The mold is placed on the PMMA layer with the protruding patterns facing the PMMA. The mold and the substrate are sealed in a plastic bag within a chamber, and the chamber is evacuated. Then nitrogen gas at 500 psi is introduced in the chamber. A heater in the chamber heats the PMMA to 170\u00b0 C., which is above the glass transition temperature of the PMMA, softening the PMMA. Under the gas pressure, the mold is pressed into the PMMA. After turning off the heater and introducing a cold nitrogen gas, the PMMA temperature drops below its glass transition temperature, and the PMMA hardens. Then the nitrogen gas is vented to the atmosphere pressure. The mold and substrate assembly is removed from the chamber. The bag is cut off, and the mold is separated from the substrate.","A silicon wafer of 4\u2033 diameter is coated with a layer of PMMA 150 nm thick and is placed on a chuck. The chuck has a plurality of small holes on its surface. The holes can be connected either to vacuum or to pressurized gas. When the holes are connected to vacuum, the chuck holds the wafer on the chuck's surface. A mold made of a 4\u2033 diameter silicon wafer has a plurality of silicon dioxide protruding patterns (100 nm thick) on one of its surface. The mold is held by a second chuck, which has the same design as the substrate chuck. The mold is placed on top of the PMMA layer with the protruding patterns facing the PMMA. The mold and the substrate are placed in a chamber. The PMMA can be heated from the chuck.","During the imprint process, the PMMA is first heated above its glass transition temperature. A ring pattern on the mold seals off the mold pattern inside the ring from the pressure outside. Then the holes of both chucks are changed from vacuum to a gas pressure of 500 psi. The pressurized gas presses the mold protruding patterns into PMMA. Importantly, the pressurized gas presses the mold protruding pattern into the PMMA uniformly in submicron scale, despite the roughness of the backsides of the mold and the substrate as well as the roughness of the chuck surfaces.","It is to be understood that the above described embodiments are illustrative of only a few of the many embodiments which can represent applications of the invention.
