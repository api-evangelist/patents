Such a touch panel is configured to receive contact to the touch panel as input operations but does not provide tactile senses according to different input operations. The related art touch panel has thus been desired to incorporate a device capable of providing the tactile senses according to the different input operations.","Thus, in order to provide tactile senses according to the different input operations, attempts have been made to utilize vibrations generated by an LRA (linear resonant actuator). Further, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2012-20284 (Patent Document 1) proposes an example of a technology for driving the LRA, and a dedicated IC (an integrated circuit) for controlling a tactile presenting device.","However, the vibrations generated by the LRA do not immediately stop even if a user stops inputting, and hence, the vibrations produced by the LRA may fail to provide quick responding tactile senses generated by a user pressing a metal dome button. Moreover, Patent Document 1 proposes an example of a vibration control unit configured to input an antiphase signal immediately after the input by the LRA has been stopped; however, a more satisfactory suppression effect may be required. The related art technology may thus require distinctively differentiated tactile senses according to different types of operations.","Patent Document 1: Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2012-20284","Hence, it is desirable to provide a drive control apparatus, an electronic apparatus, and a drive control method capable of providing tactile senses according to different operations.","According to an aspect of an embodiment, there is provided a drive control apparatus that includes a storage configured to store waveform data representing a drive signal constituted of a sine wave satisfying a frequency f=(m\/n)\u00d7f (m and n are mutually different positive odd numbers), the drive signal applying vibration (m\/2)\u00d7Q times (Q is a natural number other than 0) to an actuator, the f representing a resonant frequency of the actuator, and a drive controller configured to read the waveform data stored in the storage, and output the drive signal corresponding to the read waveform data to the actuator.","The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","In the following, preferred embodiments are described with reference to the accompanying drawings.","First, a description is given of an outline of a first embodiment with reference to .  are diagrams illustrating an outline of the first embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1"],"b":["11","2","1","12","3","2","2","3"]},"The vibration illustrated by the waveform  rapidly dampens in one to several periods. By contrast, the vibration illustrated by the waveform  continues until free vibration by a natural frequency of LRA dampens after the drive signal being supplied have been stopped. In the following illustration, the free vibration by a natural frequency of LRA continues after the drive signals being supplied has been stopped is called residual vibration.","Note that human fingers generally fail to feel or sense vibrations when the acceleration of vibrations reaches 0.02 G or less at the vibration frequency of 200 Hz. The vibration frequency represents the number of vibrations per second. The acceleration of vibration represents a change in the vibration velocity per unit time.  is a diagram illustrating sensitivity of an acceleration sensing organ (or an acceleration sensory receptor) of humans. Note that acceleration sensory receptors of humans correspond to Pacinian corpuscles. Pacinian corpuscles are one of the four major types of mechanoreceptors mainly observed in the skin.","That is, in the waveform , the finger fails to sense the vibrations within 0.01 s because the vibration acceleration reaches 0.02 G or less within 0.01 s. By contrast, in the waveform , 0.1 s is required until the vibration acceleration reaches 0.02 G or less so that the finger continues to sense the vibrations until 0.1 s has elapsed. Accordingly, humans will sense or feel the vibrations illustrated by the waveform  and the vibrations illustrated by the waveform  as completely different tactile senses.","According to this embodiment, the vibrations rapidly damping in one to several periods are generated by controlling the residual vibrations to express a click feeling.","The first embodiment focuses on the fact that the residual vibrations are not generated after the vibrations of the LRA  stop in one to several periods by supplying to LRA  a drive signal that satisfies a specific condition, and supplying the drive signal satisfying such a specific condition to the LRA .","The following describes an outline of a first embodiment with reference to .  is a diagram illustrating an electronic apparatus of the first embodiment.","The electronic apparatus of the first embodiment may be any apparatus insofar as the apparatus includes a touch panel with a display function, and an input function serving as an input unit. Examples of such an electronic apparatus include smartphones, tablet computers, and mobile information terminals.","The electronic apparatus  of the first embodiment includes a housing , a touch panel , a double-sided tape , an LRA , and a substrate .","In the electronic apparatus , the touch panel  is attached to the housing  with the double-sided tape . The LRA  is attached to a housing-side face of the touch panel . The LRA  is composed of a vibration system having a predesigned resonant frequency and an actuator. The LRA  serves as a vibration device configured to produce vibrations by being driven at the resonant frequency, and the vibrating quantity may change according to amplitudes of the drive waveform. The details of the LRA  will be described later. Note that in the first embodiment, the LRA  is an example of a vibrator. However, the vibrator is not limited to the LRA, and may be any vibrator insofar as the vibrator includes a resonator and a vibration actuator.","The substrate  is disposed inside the housing . The substrate  implements a drive control apparatus configured to drive the LRA  and a driver IC configured to output a drive signal to the LRA .","In the electronic apparatus  of the first embodiment, when a user's finger touches the touch panel , the sensed finger's touch causes the drive control apparatus implemented in the substrate  to drive the LRA , and the vibrations of the LRA  are propagated to the touch panel .","Note that the electronic apparatus  may simply include the touch panel  and the input unit, and hence, the electronic apparatus  may be an apparatus that is installed in a specific place such as an ATM (automatic teller machine).","The following describes an outline of a first embodiment with reference to .  are diagrams illustrating an example of the LRA.  is a diagram illustrating an example of the LRA having a voice coil, and  is an example of the LRA having a piezoelectric element.","The LRA  illustrated in  includes a spring , a magnet , and a voice coil .

Further, in the second embodiment, the resonant frequency \u2032 is used to calculate a frequency f of the drive signal F.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0154","num":"0153"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["200","210","220"]},"The CPU A reads the later-described frequency measuring program  from the memory A, and executes the read frequency measuring program  to measure and reset the later-described resonant frequency f\u2032.","The memory A stores the frequency measuring program , and design value data  in addition to the drive control program , the waveform data , and the API .","The frequency measuring program  includes commands to cause the CPU A to execute a measuring process of the resonant frequency f\u2032 of the LRA  in a configuration of the electronic apparatus  that may, for example, incorporate the LRA . The design value data  are predetermined when the electronic apparatus  is designed. The design value data  of the second embodiment may be a resonant frequency f\u2032 unique to the LRA , for example.","In the following, a description is given of the measurement of the resonant frequency \u2032 in the second embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},"In the second embodiment, when commands for measuring the resonant frequency f\u2032 are supplied to the electronic apparatus  (step S), the CPU A reads the frequency measuring program . In the second embodiment, the commands for measuring the resonant frequency f\u2032 may be supplied at a time at which a process of incorporating the LRA  and the touch panel  into the housing  or at the time of shipping in a production process of the electronic apparatus .","The frequency measuring program  causes the CPU A to supply the sine wave of frequencies to the LRA  as the drive signal in a predetermined frequency band (step S). Specifically, the CPU A may, for example, supply the drive signal to the LRA  such as a sine wave having a frequency of 100 Hz, a sine wave having a frequency of 110 Hz, . . . , a sine wave having a frequency of 290 Hz, and a sine wave having a frequency of 300 Hz in a frequency band range of 100 to 300 Hz.","The frequency measuring program  causes the CPU A to store in the memory A the maximum value of the acceleration of the vibration of the touch panel  for each of the drive signals having different frequencies (step S). Specifically, the electronic apparatus  includes a not-illustrated built-in accelerometer, and detects the maximum value of the acceleration of the vibration of the touch panel  every time the drive signal having a different frequency is supplied to the LRA . The memory A is provided with an area storing computational results obtained by the frequency measuring program , and temporarily stores the maximum value of the acceleration for each of the drive signals.","Subsequently, the frequency measuring program  causes the CPU A to select a frequency of the drive signal obtaining the maximum value of the acceleration from those stored in the memory A (step S). Subsequently, the frequency measuring program  causes the CPU A to determine the selected frequency of the drive signal as the resonant frequency f\u2032, and overwrite the design value data  of the memory A with the resonant frequency f\u2032 (step S).","In the second embodiment, this process changes the resonant frequency f to the resonant frequency f\u2032. Accordingly, in the second embodiment, the frequency f of the drive signal for controlling the residual vibration is f=(m\/n)\u00d7f\u2032.","Accordingly, when the vibrations of the touch panel  or the housing  are superimposed on the LRA , the drive signal f may be calculated based on the resonant frequency \u2032 of the touch panel  that is directly touched by the user's fingers. Hence, the present embodiment directly provides the tactile sense of the short-time waveform representing the rapid damping with respect to the user within one to several periods to present the clicking sense.","Note that in this embodiment, the resonant frequency f\u2032 is measured by the frequency measuring program ; however, the resonant frequency f\u2032 may be measured outside the electronic apparatus , and the design value data  of the memory A may be overwritten with the measured resonant frequency f\u2032.","Further, the present embodiment may also be applied to the electronic apparatus A.","The examples and embodiments of the drive control apparatus, the electronic apparatus, the non-transitory recording medium storing the drive control program have been described above in detail; however, it should not be construed that the present invention is limited to those specific examples and embodiments described above.
