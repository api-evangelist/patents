No. 13\/576,819, filed Dec. 12, 2012, which is the U.S. national phase application of International Application No. PCT\/US2011\/023535, filed Feb. 3, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61\/301,441, filed Feb. 4, 2010, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","This invention was made with government support under grant numbers R01 DA022317, R01 MH61887, N01 MH80032, and U19 MH82441, awarded by NIH\/NIDA. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to compounds that modulate 5-HT(2) receptors. More particularly, the present invention relates to highly selective 5-HT(2C) agonists that also may exhibit antagonist activity at the 5-HT(2B) receptor. The compounds are used methods of treating diseases and conditions wherein modulation of 5-HT(2) receptors provide a benefit, such as obesity and psychiatric disorders.","5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) mediates or regulates a wide variety of behaviors including, for example, cognition, emotion, attention, and appetite among others. In addition, substantial data indicates that 5-HT is involved in mediating the effects of psychomotor stimulants, such as cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA or \u201cecstasy\u201d). Evidence shows that serotonergic systems in the brain also regulate dopaminergic reward systems and other factors, including the conditioning effects that environmental factors have in maintaining drug taking behavior.","It is understood that the various physiologic effects of 5-HT are based on its interaction with a number of different 5-HT receptor subtypes which activate different intracellular signaling systems. Seven families of 5-HT receptors have been identified, including the 5-HT2 receptor family in which three subtypes are known (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors). The 5-HT(2) receptor family of serotonin receptors represent key sites of action of serotonin in the brain, and likely comprise the major molecular targets for drugs used in treating a variety of diseases including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, chronic pain conditions, and obesity.","The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)), a prominent central serotonin receptor subtype, is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and is thought to play a role in regulating a wide variety of behavioral processes such as mood, appetite, and sexual behavior (1-4). The 5-HT(2A) receptor mediates the hallucinogenic activity of drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and is a major target for treating schizophrenia, insomnia, and other disorders (5). The 5-HT(2B) receptor mediates the potentially lethal valvulopathic side effects of several compounds used as prescription drugs. (6, 7)","5-HT(2C) agonists have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of depression, obesity, addiction, and psychosis (8-10). Therapeutics that target the 5-HT(2C) receptor offers a promising means for the treatment of CNS related disorders. However, because the 5-HT(2C) receptor is homologous to the two other family members (11), it is important that 5-HT(2C) agonists developed for clinical use show little if any activity at these subtypes (12). To date, several 5-HT(2C) agonists have shown efficacy in preclinical animal models (13-15), and are currently undergoing human trials (13). In particular, one of the most advanced 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist is Lorcaserin, which is an orally active, antiobesity medication presently in two Phase III trials (16).","Drugs may interact with more than one 5-HT(2) receptor sub-type resulting in potentially undesired side effects. For example, in addition to monoamine transporters, fenfluramine exhibits 5-HT(2C) receptor agonism in vivo, and that the anorectic functions of fenfluramine are due primarily to this latter activity, at least in laboratory animals. It is also clear that 5-HT(2B) receptor agonism is likely responsible for the undesirable cardiopulmonary actions of fenfluramine and related drugs.","These findings indicate that there is a need in the art for drugs that interact selectively with 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes, and, in particular, selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists, which exhibit minimal effect on 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptors. Selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists can be useful for treatment obesity and related or associated disorders, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and avoid interaction with several related and unrelated receptors associated with significant morbidity and mortality, e.g., valvular heart disease associated with activation of the 5-HT(2B) receptor subtype and hallucinations associated with activation of the 5-HT(2A) receptor subtype.","Selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists can be useful in the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, schizophrenia, OCD, epilepsy, and migraine, in addition to obesity. 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists are further disclosed in WO 2006\/065600 as useful for treatment of Alzheimer's Disease, in prevention or treatment of senile plaques, and in the treatment of sexual dysfunction in males and females, including the treatment of erectile dysfunction.","A number of synthetic compounds have been reported that show 5-HT(2C) receptor agonistic activity, including in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,962,939; 6,777,407; 7,012,089; 6,953,787; and 7,071,185; U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005\/197380; 2005\/020573; 2006\/154290; 2005\/026925; 2005\/0143452; 2002\/032199; and 2005\/0261347; and published PCT applications WO 2000\/035922; WO 2006\/065600; WO 2006\/077025; and WO 2005\/007614, for example.","An important advance in the art would be the discovery of selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists that are useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions wherein 5-HT(2C) receptor agonism provides a benefit, such as psychiatric disorders, addictive behaviors, cognition disorders, obesity, movement disorders, and compound addiction, for example. A significant need exists in the art for efficacious compounds, compositions, and methods useful in the treatment of such diseases and conditions, alone or in conjunction with other therapies used to treat these diseases and conditions. The present invention is directed to meeting this need.","The present invention relates to 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists, and methods of treating diseases and conditions wherein agonism of 5-HT(2C) receptors provides a benefit, such as psychiatric disorders and obesity, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist to an individual in need thereof.

For example, a compound of structural formula (I) can be administered at a frequency of: four doses delivered as one dose per day at four-day intervals (q4d\u00d74); four doses delivered as one dose per day at three-day intervals (q3d\u00d74); one dose delivered per day at five-day intervals (qd\u00d75); one dose per week for three weeks (qwk3); five daily doses, with two days rest, and another five daily doses (5\/2\/5); or, any dose regimen determined to be appropriate for the circumstance.","The dosage of a composition containing a compound of structural formula (I), or a composition containing the same, can be from about 1 ng\/kg to about 200 mg\/kg, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg, or about 1 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg of body weight. The dosage of a composition may be at any dosage including, but not limited to, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg, 10 \u03bcg\/kg, 25 \u03bcg\/kg, 50 \u03bcg\/kg, 75 \u03bcg\/kg, 100 \u03bcg\/kg, 125 \u03bcg\/kg, 150 \u03bcg\/kg, 175 \u03bcg\/kg, 200 \u03bcg\/kg, 225 \u03bcg\/kg, 250 \u03bcg\/kg, 275 \u03bcg\/kg, 300 \u03bcg\/kg, 325 \u03bcg\/kg, 350 \u03bcg\/kg, 375 \u03bcg\/kg, 400 \u03bcg\/kg, 425 \u03bcg\/kg, 450 \u03bcg\/kg, 475 \u03bcg\/kg, 500 \u03bcg\/kg, 525 \u03bcg\/kg, 550 \u03bcg\/kg, 575 \u03bcg\/kg, 600 \u03bcg\/kg, 625 \u03bcg\/kg, 650 \u03bcg\/kg, 675 \u03bcg\/kg, 700 \u03bcg\/kg, 725 \u03bcg\/kg, 750 \u03bcg\/kg, 775 \u03bcg\/kg, 800 \u03bcg\/kg, 825 \u03bcg\/kg, 850 \u03bcg\/kg, 875 \u03bcg\/kg, 900 \u03bcg\/kg, 925 \u03bcg\/kg, 950 \u03bcg\/kg, 975 \u03bcg\/kg, 1 mg\/kg, 5 mg\/kg, 10 mg\/kg, 15 mg\/kg, 20 mg\/kg, 25 mg\/kg, 30 mg\/kg, 35 mg\/kg, 40 mg\/kg, 45 mg\/kg, 50 mg\/kg, 60 mg\/kg, 70 mg\/kg, 80 mg\/kg, 90 mg\/kg, 100 mg\/kg, 125 mg\/kg, 150 mg\/kg, 175 mg\/kg, or 200 mg\/kg. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case, but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. In practice, the physician determines the actual dosing regimen that is most suitable for an individual patient, which can vary with the age, weight, and response of the particular patient.","A compound of structural formula (I) used in a method of the present invention typically is administered in an amount of about 0.005 to about 500 milligrams per dose, about 0.05 to about 250 milligrams per dose, or about 0.5 to about 100 milligrams per dose. For example, a compound of structural formula (I) can be administered, per dose, in an amount of about 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 milligrams, including all doses between 0.005 and 500 milligrams.","The compounds of the present invention typically are administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of compounds of structural formula (I).","The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, or excipient, with which a compound of structural formula (I) is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The carriers can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents can be used. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is a preferred carrier when a compound of structural formula (I) is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.","These pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured, for example, by conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. When a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) is administered orally, the composition typically is in the form of a tablet, capsule, powder, solution, pill, granule, tincture, emulsion, syrup, or elixir. When administered in tablet form, the composition additionally can contain a solid carrier, such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. The tablet, capsule, and powder contain about 0.01% to about 95%, and preferably from about 1% to about 50%, of a compound of structural formula (I). When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier, such as water, petroleum, or oils of animal or plant origin, can be added. The liquid form of the composition can further contain physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solutions, or glycols. When administered in liquid form, the composition contains about 0.1% to about 90%, and preferably about 1% to about 50%, by weight, of a compound of structural formula (I).","When a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of structural formula (I) is administered by intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection, the composition is in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection typically contains, an isotonic vehicle. A compound of structural formula (I) can be infused with other fluids over a 10-30 minute span or over several hours.","Compounds of structural formula (I) can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding the compound of structural formula (I) to a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added.","A compound of structural formula (I) can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and\/or dispersing agents.","Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of a compound of structural formula (I) can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally, the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.","A compound of structural formula (I) also can be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of structural formula (I) also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds of structural formula (I) can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins.","In particular, the compounds of structural formula (I) can be administered orally, buccally, or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients, such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules, either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents. The compounds of structural formula (I) also can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intracoronarily. For parenteral administration, the compounds of structural formula (I) are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other substances, for example, salts or monosaccharides, such as mannitol or glucose, to make the solution isotonic with blood.","Compounds of structural formula (I) were prepared and assayed for an ability to modulate the activity of the 5-HT(2) family of receptors.

Specifically, the ability of these compounds to normalize disrupted prepulse inhibition (PPI) in PCP treated animals was tested. PPI is a neuropsychiatric animal model in which a weaker prestimulus, the \u2018prepulse\u2019, is able to inhibit the reaction of an animal to a subsequent much stronger, startling stimulus, or \u2018pulse\u2019. Typically, the stimulus that is used in such studies is a sound (units in decibells or dB), but other stimuli such as touch, light, or a puff of air can be used. The reduction in the strength of the startle response is indicative of the ability of the nervous system to temporarily adapt to a strong sensory stimulus when an earlier, weaker signal is given to warn the organism. While the extent to which the organism is able to adjust to the stimulus affects a host of physiological systems, it is generally convenient to measure any changes in the muscular reactions, in order to gauge the effects of a drug on PPI. It is well known that schizophrenics often show a disruption of the PPI response as a consequence of so-called sensory flooding, and thus their inability to filter out unimportant information. (Swerdlow et al., 1994; 51(2):139-154).","The ability of the present 5-HT(2C) ligands to normalize the effects of phencyclidine (PCP, an NMDA receptor antagonist)-induced disruption of PPI in mice was tested. This PCP model is a well accepted model of atypical antipsychotic activity (19, 20) and has been used previously to characterize the antipsychotic activity of 5-HT(2C) agonists (21). The ability of compounds (+)-12 and (+)-18, as well as vabicaserin (3) as the reference compound, to normalize PCP (6 mg\/kg)-disrupted PPI was tested. It was found that both (+)-12 and (+) 18 were able to normalize PCP-disrupted PPI at doses of 10 mg\/kg and are comparable in activity to vabicaserin. At the 5 mg\/kg dose level, (+)-12 and vabicaserin are still effective.","Cytochrome P-450 screening, metabolic stability studies, and hERG assays also were performed on (+)-compound 12. The data are summarized in Tables 3-5. In the recombinant CYP inhibition test, compound (+)-12 showed relatively low inhibition against CYP2C9 (19.55%), CYP2D6 (26.97%), and CYP3A4 (21.68% and 25.13% using midazolam and testosterone as the substrates, respectively) at 10 \u03bcM. Furthermore, compound (+)-12 had an acceptable microsomal stability compared with the control drug, verapamil (Table 4) and showed no activity in the hERG assay at concentrations of 5 and 10 \u03bcM.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0176","num":"0175"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"CYPs Inhibition Profile of Compounds (+)-12"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"% Inhibition"]},{"entry":[{},"CYP","Substrates","Test Inhibitors","at 10 \u03bcM"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"2C9","tolbutamide","sulfaphenazole","94.65"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(+)-12","19.55"]},{"entry":[{},"2D6","dextromethorphan","quinidine","98.66"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(+)-12","26.97"]},{"entry":[{},"3A4","midazolam","ketoconazole","99.76"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(+)-12","21.68"]},{"entry":[{},{},"testosterone","ketoconazole","99.71"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"(+)-12","25.13"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0176"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Drug Metabolism of Compounds (+)\u221212"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Microsomal atability "]},{"entry":[{},{},"(% remaining)"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compd","human","rat"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Verapamil","39.61","\u2014"]},{"entry":[{},"(+)\u221212","90.50","66.03"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00006"},"sup":"a"}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Calcium Flux Assays. Calcium flux assays were performed essentially as described earlier (N. H. Jensen et al., . (2008) 33, 2303-2312.) HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), or 5-HT(2C)receptor were seeded and incubated for 20 h in serum-free DMEM containing 50 U\/mL penicillin and 50 \u03bcg\/mL streptomycin sulfate in tissue culture-treated black clear-bottom 384-well plates (Greiner, Germany); plates were coated with 20 \u03bcL\/well of 50 mg\/L poly-L-lysine (Sigma, P-1524) in PBS. The cells were preincubated for 75 min at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified incubator with 20 \u03bcL of reconstituted fura-4 based calcium dye (Calcium Plus Assay Kit, Molecular Devices) in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen, 14065-056), 50 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM probenecid, 100 mg\/L ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). The plates were allowed to cool to rt over 10 min and were transferred to a FLIPR Tetra fluorescence image plate reader (Molecular Devices). The test compounds in 15 \u03bcL assay buffer were automatically added and fluorescence (excitation: 470-495 nm, emission: 515-575 nm) was measured every second for 3 min. The baseline was averaged from ten data points immediately before the additions and results were exported as the maximal response over baseline during 60 s after addition. Compounds were measured at seven concentrations from 10 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM in triplicate. ECvalues and Evalues were obtained from nonlinear curve fitting against a sigmoidal dose-response model using Prism (Graphpad).","Prepulse Inhibition Animal Study. Pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) testing and analysis was performed as described previously (A. I. Abbas, et al. (2009), 29, 7124-36.) Adult male and female C57BL\/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, Me.) ages 8 to 12 weeks were used in all experiments. Mice were pre-administered vehicle (0.9% Saline; 10 ml\/kg, i.p.) or increasing doses of (+)-12, (+)-18, or vabicaserin (3) and returned to their home cage. 30 minutes later, animals were administered phencyclindine (6 mg\/kg, i.p.) and immediately placement into the PPI apparatus (SR-Lab Startle Response System, San Diego Instruments). After 5 min acclimation to 62-dB white-noise, animals were administered 74 acoustic test trials, beginning and ending with 5 trials each of startle-only stimuli (40 msec 120-dB white-noise burst). The remaining 64 trials were randomized between the following trial types: 8 startle-only trails, 8 trials without any stimuli (null trials), 16 trials with prepulse stimuli (4, 8, 12, and 16 dB above the 62-dB background, 4 of each intensity, 20 msec in length) that were not paired with startle stimuli (prepulse-only trials), and 32 trials of prepulse stimuli (4, 8, 12, and 16 dB above the 62-dB background, 8 at each intensity) paired with the 120 dB startle stimulus given 100 msec following the onset of the prepulse stimulus. Trials were separated by a variable interval (8-15 sec) and total test-time lasted 26-30 min for each animal. The formula used to calculate percentage PPI was: 100-((startle after prepulse\/startle without prepulse)\u00d7100). The data were analyzed with SR LAB programs and are presented as means\u00b1standard error of the mean. A repeated measures ANOVA (using Graphpad Prism 5.0) was used to examine the effects of test compounds on prepulse-dependent PPI, with prepulse intensity (4, 8, 12, and 16 dB) as the within subjects effect, and compound and dose as the between subjects effects (dose nested within compound). Differences between treatment groups were determined with Bonferroni corrected pair-wise comparisons. In all cases, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.","Inhibition of CYP Isozymes. For each of the inhibition assays the following was used: MgCl(20 \u03bcL, 50 mM solution), phosphate buffer (100 \u03bcL, 100 mM solution), water (38 \u03bcL), recombinant enzyme (20 \u03bcL, 200 \u03bcM solution), and 1 \u03bcL of one of the following substrates: tolbutamide (40 mM, for CYP2C9), dextrometorphane (2 mM, for CYP2D6), or midazolam (1 mM, for CYP3A4), and testosterone (10 mM, for CYP3A4). The final concentration of test compound is 10 \u03bcM. The mixture was pre-heated to 37\u00b0 C. for two minutes after which the reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (20 \u03bcL, 10 mM). The reaction was heated at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 (for CYP3A4) or 20 minutes (CYP 2D9 and CYP2D6) and terminated by the addition of MeCN (0.6 mL). Samples were centrifuged (16000 rpm, 10 min) and 200 \u03bcL aliquots were taken for LC-MS-MS analysis. Separation of the sample components was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC C18 (2.1 mm\u00d750 mm) column, using mobile phase mixtures between 0.1% formic acid in MeCN and 0.1% formic acid in water (elution rate 0.5 mL\/min, column temperature 25\u00b0 C.). The following instrument settings were used: Collision temperature 500\u00b0 C., ionspray voltage +5500 V; for CYP2C9 (hydroxytolbutamied determined) Q1 287.2, Q3 188.1, DP 86 V, EP 8 V, CE 18 V, CXP 11 V; for CYP 2D6 (dextrophan determined) Q1 259.2, Q3 158.2, DP 84 V, EP 9 V, CE 52 V, CXP 8 V; for CYP3A4 (1-Hydroxymidazolam determined) Q1 343.2, Q3 325.0, DP 100 V, EP 10 V, CE 29 V, CXP 21 V and (6-\u03b2-Hydroxytestosterone) Q1 305.2, Q3 269.1, DP 70 V, EP 8 V, CE 22 V, CXP 16V.","Stability in Liver Microsomes. For each sample to be investigated, the following was mixed: microsomes (50 \u03bcL, 0.5 mg\/mL), MgClsolution (50 \u03bcL, 50 mM), phosphate buffer (250 \u03bcL, 100 mM), water (95 \u03bcL), test compound (+)-12 (5 \u03bcL, 200 \u03bcM). Verapamil was tested as a positive control. The reaction was performed at 37\u00b0 C. and initiated by the addition of NADPH (50 \u03bcL, 10 mM) or, for the negative control, by the addition of water (50 \u03bcL). Aliquots of 50 \u03bcL were taken form the solution after 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and the reaction stopped by the addition of 150 \u03bcL cold methanol to the aliquot. The samples were centrifuged (16000 rpm, 10 min). 100 \u03bcL supernatant was used for LC-MS-MS investigation. All incubations were performed in duplicate. Separation of the sample components was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC C18 (2.1 mm\u00d750 mm) column, using mobile phase mixtures between 0.1% formic acid in MeCN and 0.1% formic acid in water (elution rate 0.5 mL\/min, column temperature 25\u00b0 C.). The following instrument settings were used: Collision temperature 500\u00b0 C., ionspray voltage +5500 V. The in vitro half-life was calculated as in vitro t=\u2212(0.693\/k) where k is the slope determined by linear regression of the peak-area of the parent drug vs. incubation time curve. The in vitro intrinsic clearance (in vitro CL) was calculated according to: in vitro CL=(0.693\/t)\u00d7(volume of incubation (\u03bcL)\/amount of proteins (mg)).","hERG Assays. Compounds were screened for hERG inhibition at 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM using HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human hERG channel with the FluxOR thallium assay kit (Invitrogen) using a FLIPR Tetra fluorescence image plate reader (Molecular Devices). Cisapride at 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM was used as the reference standard (IC=490 nM). Compounds with >25% inhibition were validated using a PatchXpress 7000A automated parallel planar patch-clamp system at 32 nM-32 \u03bcM. (H. Zeng et al., . (2008), 6, 235-41).","Prior 5-HT(2C) agonists possessed properties that hindered their development as therapeutic agents.
