This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/457,121, filed Mar. 24, 2003, and titled \u201cMethod and System for Downloading and Managing Portable Applications on a Mobile Device,\u201d which is incorporated by reference herein.","This invention relates to communications on mobile devices. More specifically, it relates to a method and system for downloading and managing portable applications on a mobile device.","Mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal digital\/data assistants, (\u201cPDA\u201d), two-way pagers, etc. are relatively inexpensive, have become commonplace, and are available to most consumers. These mobile network devices can be wireless or wired mobile devices.","Such mobile devices are typically limited to small physical size, light weights and corresponding small display screen sizes. These mobile devices have a number of constraints including limited processing power, limited memory, limited battery life, a limited number of buttons on a user interface, etc.","The larger a processor in a mobile device, the larger the size and weight the device will be. The more memory in a device the more expensive it will be. Faster processors, more memory and color displays consume more battery power.","Content and service providers who provide content and services via mobile devices have to balance the physical constraints of such mobile devices along with the ability to provide applications and content that consumers actually want, and are willing to pay for. The content and services have to be provided to mobile devices in a format that is usable on the mobile device and have to be provided quickly since most users of mobile devices pay for content and services by the minute.","There are relatively few applications that have been created to be used on mobile devices that provide content in a format useable on the mobile devices. The applications that do exist include text-based micro-browsers for delivering real-time stock quotes, access to news, sports scores, weather forecasts, text-based electronic commerce applications and other types of text-based applications.","There are a number of problems associated with developing applications for mobile devices. One problem is that virtually every mobile device has a unique hardware platform. An application written for one mobile device hardware platform won't work on another hardware platform for another mobile device.","To help overcome this problem for devices in general, Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif., developed the Java programming language. Java is a high-level programming language that was designed to be platform-neutral (i.e., it can be run on virtually any hardware platform). Java programs are compiled into byte-code and run in a special software environment known as a \u201cvirtual machine.\u201d This and other characteristics of Java make it a useful language for programming a large number of different types of applications for mobile devices. Java is typically used for programming small applications, called Java \u201capplets.\u201d","When Java applets are downloaded onto a device they are executed by a Java virtual machine in a secure \u201csandbox.\u201d A sandbox is Java virtual machine security area for downloaded (i.e., remote or untrusted) applets. The sandbox is an area in which such applets are confined and prevented from accessing certain data and resources (e.g., system resources and data). Confinement to the sandbox prevents downloaded applets from carrying out potentially dangerous or malicious operations on the device. Applets have to \u201cplay\u201d inside the sandbox, and any attempt to \u201cescape\u201d is thwarted by a Java security manager.","However, the full version of the Java programming language was too large to be used on mobile devices with constrained resources. When Sun Microsystems developed the second version of Java, it was split into three editions. The three editions include micro version, Java 2 Micro Edition (\u201cJ2ME\u201d) for small mobile devices, a standard version, Java 2 Standard Edition (\u201cJ2SE\u201d) for desktop or other larger devices, and an enterprise version, Java 2 Enterprise Edition (\u201cJ2EE\u201d) for multi-tier networking applications.","J2ME is cross-platform programming language that can be embedded into small application environments such as mobile phones, PDAs, two-way pagers, etc. The J2ME environment can be implemented specifically for an individual device through a Connected Limited Device Configuration (\u201cCLDC\u201d). This configuration is typically used for mobile devices that are battery operated, memory constrained, processor limited, low bandwidth, and provide high latency, network connectivity. The CLDC defines the basic libraries that must be present in a J2ME implementation so that a Java virtual machine can run the application across different hardware platforms and environments.","The J2ME Mobile Information Device Profile (\u201cMIDP\u201d) is a set of Java Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cAPI\u201d) that provides the runtime environment for J2ME applications using the CLDC. The MIDP manages applications, user interfaces, networking and input\/output for the mobile device.","J2ME applications that conform to the MIDP are called \u201cMIDlets\u201d (instead of an applet). A group of related MIDlets can be grouped together to create a MIDlet Suite that can be used to provide a more complex application to a mobile device.","J2ME MIDlets are being used on mobile devices to provide platform independent applications on mobile devices such as games, audio and video players, site-specific applications (e.g., dynamic stock quote banner, dynamic news banner, etc.) device specific applications (e.g., new ring tones, new fonts, new graphical look-and-feel, etc.) and many other types of applications.","There are a number of problems associated with using MIDlets and MIDlet Suites on a mobile device. One problem is that for security reasons, one MIDlet Suite cannot launch another MIDlet Suite (i.e., act as its handler). Since the CLDC and MIDP does not define or use a Java security manager (i.e., a security manager is typically too big and complex for small devices), the interactions of MIDlets is limited to MIDlets packaged together in the same MIDlet Suite. However, the MIDP specification does not explicitly prohibit one MIDlet Suite from launching another MIDlet Suite.","Another problem is that a MIDlet in a MIDlet Suite cannot accept input data from, or cannot provide output data to, another MIDlet in another MIDlet Suite because a MIDlet Suite is executed in its own sandbox. This limits the type of MIDlet applications that can be created for a mobile device and prevents the ability to allow interaction between MIDlets or MIDlet Suites that have already been created. Another problem is that a MIDlet Suite cannot accept input data from, or provide output data to other applications on the mobile device (i.e., non-MIDlet applications).","Thus, it is desirable to allow a J2ME MIDlet in a MIDlet Suite to accept data from, and provide data to, other MIDlets in other MIDlet Suites on a mobile device. It is also desirable to allow a MIDlet to accept data from, and provide data to, other non-MIDlet applications on a mobile device.","In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, some of the problems associated with using J2ME MIDlets on mobile device are overcome. A method and system for downloading and managing portable applications on a mobile information device is presented.","One aspect of the invention includes using generic content descriptors to download and manage non-Java applications on a mobile information device.","The foregoing and other features and advantages of embodiments of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description. The detailed description proceeds with references to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","16","18","20","10","14","16","18"]},"The mobile information devices  include mobile phones \u2032, personal digital\/data assistants (\u201cPDA\u201d) \u2033, one and two-way pagers \u2032\u2033 and other types of wireless mobile and non-mobile information devices (not illustrated).","The wireless gateways  provides a code division multiple access (\u201cCDMA\u201d), Wideband CDMA (\u201cWCDMA\u201d), Time Division-Synchronous CDMA (\u201cTD-SCDMA\u201d), Advanced Mobile Phone Service (\u201cAMPS\u201d), Digital AMPS (\u201cD-AMPS\u201d), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (\u201cUMTS\u201d), Radio Frequency (\u201cRF\u201d), paging and wireless messaging, Packet Cellular Network (\u201cPCN\u201d), Global System for Mobile Communications, (\u201cGSM\u201d), Generic Packet Radio Services (\u201cGPRS\u201d), Personal Communications Services (\u201cPCS\u201d), Cellular Digital Packet Data (\u201cCDPD\u201d), Wireless Application Protocol (\u201cWAP\u201d), Digital Audio Broadcasting (\u201cDAB\u201d), Bluetooth, 802.11a, 802.11b, or other type of wireless interfaces for the mobile information devices .","Further information on these wireless interfaces may be found in their respective standards documents. CDMA, for example, is described in further detail in Telecommunications Industry Association (\u201cTIA\u201d) standards IS-95A and IS-95B, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

CDMA is further described in the TIA IS-2000 series of standards, which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The IS-2000 series of standards are commonly referred to as CDMA2000.","The WAP includes several protocols and standards designed to provide wireless devices with access to electronic content, and it was developed as an alternative to other markup languages and protocols developed for the World-Wide-Web. One component of the WAP is a Wireless Markup Language (\u201cWML\u201d), which includes markup tags, and provides control over formatting and layout of electronic content. The WML is often more appropriate to use for wireless devices such as wireless phones than other markup languages such as Hyper Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d), etc.","The databases  include electronic content such as text, hypertext, graphical data or references to graphical data images, audio, video and other content. The electronic content may be stored as a Web page or WAP page on a database server . The database server downloads or \u201cserves\u201d electronic content from the database  to the mobile information device.","A hypertext document includes markup codes called \u201ctags.\u201d The structure of hypertext documents is defined by document markup languages such as Hand Held Device Markup Language (\u201cHDML\u201d), HTML, compact HTML (\u201ccHTML\u201d), eXtensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d), WML and voice extensible Markup Language (\u201cVoxML\u201d), and others. Markup languages also allow references to additional electronic content besides text including graphics, animation, audio, video, applets, MIDlets and other electronic data.","Electronic content is typically displayed on a mobile information device  with a software application called a \u201cbrowser.\u201d A browser on a mobile information device  may be a sub-set of a larger browser, or a micro-browser. A micro-browser may not be capable of displaying complete content of a requested electronic content as stored on database server . A micro-browser typically reads electronic content and renders the electronic content into a presentation of text, graphics, animation, audio, video, etc., for display on the mobile information device .","The information network  includes the Internet, the World-Wide-Web, an intranet, or other information network. As is known in the art, the Internet is a world-wide network of interconnected computers. The World-Wide-Web is an information system on the Internet designed for electronic content interchange.","The devices illustrated in  interact with wireless network system  based on standards proposed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d), International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (\u201cITU\u201d), Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d), Wireless Application Protocol Forum (\u201cWAP\u201d) Forum, Java Community, the American National Standard Institute (\u201cANSI\u201d), or other standards.","IEEE standards can be found on the World Wide Web at the Universal Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) \u201cwww.ieee.org.\u201d The ITU, (formerly known as the CCITT) standards can be found at the URL \u201cwww.itu.ch.\u201d IETF standards can be found at the URL \u201cwww.ietf.org.\u201d The WAP Forum standards can be found at the URL \u201cwww.wapforum.org.\u201d The Java Community standards can be found at the URL \u201cjava.sun.com.\u201d ANSI standards can be found at the URL \u201cwww.ansi.org.\u201d","An operating environment for devices and interfaces used for the present invention include a processing system with one or more high speed Central Processing Unit(s) (\u201cCPU\u201d), or other types of processors, and a memory system.

An electrical system represents data bits which cause a resulting transformation or reduction of the electrical signals, and the maintenance of data bits at memory locations in a memory system to thereby reconfigure or otherwise alter the CPU's or processor operation, as well as other processing of signals. The memory locations where data bits are maintained are physical locations that have particular electrical, magnetic, optical, or organic properties corresponding to the data bits.","The data bits may also be maintained on a computer readable medium including magnetic disks, optical disks, organic memory, and any other volatile (e.g., Random Access Memory (\u201cRAM\u201d)) or non-volatile (e.g., Read-Only Memory (\u201cROM\u201d)) mass storage system readable by the CPU or processor. The computer readable medium includes cooperating or interconnected computer readable medium, which exist exclusively on the processing system or be distributed among multiple interconnected processing systems that may be local or remote to the processing system.","Java","As is known in the art, Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif. More information about Java can be found at the URL \u201cjava.sun.com.\u201d Java is based on object-oriented programming techniques. As is known in the art, object-oriented programming is used to design computer software including object-oriented objects that are easy to create, cost effective to modify, and reusable. Object-oriented objects include \u201cobject data\u201d and \u201cobject services.\u201d Object services are provided through \u201cobject methods\u201d (also called \u201cobject operations\u201d or \u201cobject functions\u201d). Object methods typically operate on private data such as \u201cinstance data\u201d or \u201cobject state data\u201d that an object owns. A collection of objects is called an \u201cobject class\u201d which is sometimes called an \u201cobject type.\u201d An object class acts as a template that describes the behavior of sets of objects. An object's implementation is typically encapsulated, and is hidden from public view. Object private instance data can only be accessed by object methods of an object class. Object public instance data is accessed through a public \u201cobject interface.\u201d","Java was designed to be platform-neutral (i.e., it can be run on virtually any hardware platform). Java programs are compiled into byte-code, which is not refined to the point of relying on platform-specific instructions. Java runs on a hardware device in a special software environment known as a \u201cvirtual machine.\u201d","This characteristic of Java makes it a useful language for programming a large number of different types of mobile information device  applications.

More information about J2ME can be found at the URL \u201cjava.sun.com\/j2me.\u201d","J2ME includes two major elements: (1) configurations; and (2) profiles. J2ME configurations provide a set of libraries and a virtual machine for a category of wireless devices. A configuration is a specification that defines the minimum Java libraries and Java virtual machine capabilities for a mobile information device . A configuration is defined for classes of devices with similar memory requirements and processing power. J2ME configurations are defined for both fixed wireless devices and mobile wireless devices.","J2ME profiles are built on top of configurations to provide a run-time environment for a specific device.

It is possible to build a Muglet that runs as a URI scheme and Internet media type handler when invoked as such, and otherwise runs as a conventional MIDlet.","At Step , another MIDlet is invoked from the MIDlet handler using the processed input data. As is the case with standard J2ME MIDP implementation, only one MIDlet or non-MIDlet applications runs at any one time in the mobile information device , and there is no facility to have more than one Muglet URI scheme or Internet media type handler running at the same time.","In one embodiment, when a Muglet is invoked to handle a URI scheme or Internet media type, a MIDlet or non-MIDlet application being executed is suspended for the duration of the Muglet execution. Once the Muglet execution is complete, the invoking MIDlet or non-MIDlet application is resumed. It is possible, however, that the invoked application may itself use the Muglet functionality to exit to another application instead of returning to the original invoking application. This can cause the original invoking application to remain in a perpetually suspended state, thereby causing hanging system resources. Thus, in another embodiment, a MIDlet or non-MIDlet application must exit in order to call a Muglet.","Once invoked, a Muglet URI scheme or Internet media type handler has complete control over the interpretation of the URI scheme, Internet media type or object. Any errors in these items are handled as the Muglet desires.","A Muglet may also receive a referring URI string via the getReferringURI( ) object-oriented method from the Muglet object class . This URI string indicates the application or URL location from which the Muglet was invoked, and may be used by the Muglet as an exit URI when it terminates, so that control can be returned to a previous context.","For example, if a Muglet is invoked from a Web page as an Internet media type handler, it could set the exit URI string to the value of the incoming referring URI string, such that the mobile information device  would be returned to the same Web page being viewed when the Muglet exits. If the Muglet chooses to exit to another URI string or to no URI string, it may discard the referring URI string.","JAM Support for Exchanging Input and Output Data","In one embodiment of the present invention, the JAM  is built around the concept of a registry. The registry maintains information about what MIDlets or non-MIDlet applications are invoked to handle specific media types and URI schemes. The registry may include both MIDlet and non-MIDlet applications.","When a J2ME MIDlet is installed by the JAM , the JAD file  may specify content types that are handled by a MIDlet through one or more instances of a Content-<n>-Handler attribute as described below. A user of a mobile information device  is prompted to confirm the registration of the MIDlet as a scheme or media type handler. If there is already a handler registered for that scheme or media type, the user may be prompted to confirm the replacement or keep the existing handler registration.","The handler type and URI scheme or Internet media type name for an \u201cn-th MIDlet\u201d in a MIDlet Suite is specified as comma-separated strings. A handler type currently includes \u201curi-scheme\u201d or \u201cmedia-type\u201d. However, the present invention is not limited to these handler types and more or other handler types can also be used.

If the JAM  determines that any of the Internet media types and\/or URI schemes that the JAD file  is attempting to register cannot be registered (e.g., because they are protected media types or URI scheme), the JAM  will not download the JAR file , and will post a response with a \u201c906 Invalid Descriptor\u201d error code.

If the Muglet was invoked from a link or content on a browser page, the URL of the page is used as the referring URL. If the Muglet was invoked due to an exit URI from another MIDlet, the JAM  appends a string provided by the exiting MIDlet to the Muglet using the appendReferringURI( ) object oriented method, and the Muglet uses the resulting URI as the referring URI. If a Muglet is invoked due to the user selecting it to handle stored content that the user selects to view, or due to a URI string in a notification, the referring URI string will be null.","A URI scheme allows another MIDlet to be specifically identified by other MIDlet and non-MIDlet applications. The scheme specific portion of the MIDlet URI includes fully qualified class name of a class that extends MIDlet (e.g., Muglet), and may refer to a specific MIDlet within a MIDlet Suite. The URI string may also include a query component that with parameters for a MIDlet by including a question mark (\u201c?\u201d) and a series of URL-encoded parameters after the fully qualified class name.","The entire URI scheme will be passed to the Muglet by the JAM  via the Muglet.getURI( ) object-oriented method. For example, the URI string:","<a href=\u201cmidlet:com.sprintpcs.apps.calendar?date=\u201d20011003\u2033>","would launch a calendar MIDlet from \u201ccom.sprintpcs.apps\u201d with the date set to Oct. 3, 2001, from a Muglet.","The JAM  also supports the ability to \u201claunch\u201d stored non Java content by handling URI string with a scheme of (\u201cams:\u201d) and a scheme-specific part that is a content-ID of the target content. For example, the URI string <a href=\u201cams:sprintpcs.com.example_content\u201d> in a browser page would cause an ams: URI to be passed to the AMS, which would launch an appropriate handler for the stored content with a content-ID associated with \u201cexample_content.\u201d","If the JAM  encounters any URI that does not have a pre-defined handling requirement as described above in Table 10, it will attempt to locate a MIDlet that is registered to handle the scheme type using the registry. If such a MIDlet is located, the JAM  will launch the MIDlet and pass the URI string to the MIDlet through the Muglet.getURI( ) object-oriented method.","When the JAM  receives a content file to process, it will determine the appropriate application to handle that content-type based on the registry entries. There are at least three sources of content that the JAM  may need to handle, including: (1) \u201cams: content\u201d stored content folders; (2) files downloaded by micro-browser ; or (3) content from other native applications.","When a content type handled by a MIDlet is needs to be processed, the application that downloaded or generated the content passes both a content and a MIME or other Internet content-type to the JAM . The JAM  determines an appropriate Muglet (i.e., MIDlet handler) based on the registry, and launches the appropriate MIDlet.","The JAM  will pass the content-type to the Muglet through the Muglet.getContentType( ) object-oriented method, and will pass a locally significant URI string to the Muglet via the Muglet.getURI( )method. When the Muglet passes this URI string to the J2ME Connector.open( ) object-oriented method, the JAM  will return a stream connection to a buffer that is holding the content.","The ability to invoke content, applications, services, downloads, etc. on the device from a push message is also supported. When a messaging client receives a WAP Service Indication (\u201cSI\u201d) or Service Loading (\u201cSL\u201d) message, the message may include a URI field. The handling of these messages is the responsibility of the messaging client, which will invoke the JAM  to handle the embedded URI scheme. Service Loading messages will cause the URI to be invoked without user intervention, and are generated from trusted carrier systems. Service Indication messages present text to the user, who can then elect to invoke the URI. In either case, the URI will be passed to the JAM  for handling.","A \u201cprotected MIDlet\u201d is a J2ME application that is downloaded using Hyper Text Transfer Protocol-Secure (\u201cHTTPS\u201d) from a trusted carrier domain. As is known in the art, HTTPS variation of HTTP that provides for encryption and transmission through a secure port. HTTPS allows HTTP to run over security mechanisms known as Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) or Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d).","For a protected MIDlet, both the JAR  and JAD  files are downloaded via HTTPS from a trusted domain. When a MIDlet is protected, the JAM  enforces the following rules: (1) the MIDlet cannot be upgraded except from the trusted carrier domain; (2) no other application can register to handle any Internet media types or URI schemes that are handled by the protected MIDlet; and (3) only a user can delete a protected MIDlet from the JAM . When a user deletes the protected MIDlet, any Internet media types and URI schemes handled by that MIDlet are released, and can then be handled by other MIDlets or non-MIDlet application.","Generic Content Descriptors","The AMS can use a descriptor file to capture relevant meta-data about content prior to downloading the actual content. The descriptor file may include meta-data, which allows the AMS and the user to better manage downloaded content. As previously described, a JAD file can be used for Java MIDlets and other Java content. A generic content descriptor file (\u201cGCD\u201d) can be used for all non-Java content.","The generic content descriptor file may include a variety of mandatory and optional attributes.

If the mobile information device does not include an application registered to handle the non-Java content, the AMS may present the user an option to download an application that can handle the non-Java content. For example, the AMS may present the user with an option to download an application specified by a content-handler-URI in the generic content descriptor file. In another example, the AMS might make a request to a server to launch the browser and then pass a URL to the browser. A query portion of the URL might be used in searching for a handler for the particular MIME type.","The download domain for content can be specified by the by the content-domain attribute if it is present in the generic content descriptor file.

If there is no content-domain attribute, then the host+path portion of the descriptor URI may be used as the download domain.","In processing the generic content descriptor file, the AMS may determine whether the mobile information device already includes a version of the non-Java content identified by the generic content descriptor. For example, the AMS may first determine whether a version of the non-Java content is installed on the mobile information device, such as by using the Content-Name, Content-Vendor, Content-Version and Content-Domain parameters specified in the generic content descriptor file. If a match is found for the name and vendor attributes with the same download domain, then the AMS may perform a version check to determine whether the non-Java content is an older, newer or same version as the non-Java content identified by the generic content descriptor file.","If the version being downloaded is newer than the version on the device, then the AMS may notify the user that the non-Java content is being upgraded from a previous version. The user may be given options to proceed with the download or to cancel the download. If the version being downloaded is the same as the version already on the mobile information device, then the user may be notified that the non-Java content is already installed on the mobile information device. The user may then be given the options to execute the non-Java content on the mobile information device or to cancel the execution.","If the version being downloaded is older than the version already on the mobile information device, then the user may be informed that the version identified for download is older than the version currently on the mobile information device. The user may be further informed that the user will lose all data associated with the version already stored on the mobile information device, and the user can be given the options to continue with the download of the older version or to cancel the download.","Prior to downloading the non-Java content, the AMS may verify that there is sufficient room in the non-volatile (\u201cNV\u201d) memory of the mobile information device to stored the non-Java content. If there is insufficient memory to store the non-Java content, then the user may be prompted to either delete other applications or non-Java content from the mobile information device or to abort the current download. Once the user is finished deleting applications or non-Java content, then the AMS may continue and download the non-Java content identified by the mobile information device.","After the generic content descriptor file processing has been completed, the AMS may download the content from the content-URL specified in the generic content descriptor file. User intervention is preferably not needed unless exception processing is required (e.g., in the cases of versioning issues, insufficient NV memory, etc. . . . ). All processing that is required from the mobile information device to save the application to NV memory in a usable form is generally accomplished without user intervention at the time the non-Java content is downloaded. If there are any errors encountered during this process, then the AMS may report the error to the install-notify-URL.","Upon successful install of the non-Java content, the mobile information device may post a response to the install-notify-URL indicated in the descriptor file. For example, the mobile information device may post a \u201c900 Success\u201d message, as specified in the Over the Air User Initiated Provisioning Recommended Practice version 1.0, to the install-notify-URL. After posting the response code, the AMS may receive a response with a location header that specifies the location to which the browser should be launched if the user continues to browse.
