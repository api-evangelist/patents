{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","The subject matter disclosed herein relates to determining wireless transmitter almanac information to transmit to a mobile device, and more particularly to basing such determinations on expected contributions of one or more wireless transmitters to a future navigation operation for the mobile device.","2. Information","The position of a mobile device, such as a cellular telephone, may be estimated based on information gathered from various systems. One such system may comprise a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which is one example of a satellite positioning system (SPS). SPS systems such as GNSS may comprise a number of space vehicles (SV) orbiting the earth. Another example of a system that may provide a basis for estimating the position of a mobile device is a cellular communication system comprising a number of terrestrial wireless transmitters\/receivers, often referred to as \u201cbase stations,\u201d to support communications for a number of mobile devices. A further example of a system that may provide a basis for estimating the position of a mobile device is a wireless network compatible with one or more of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 wireless local access network (WEAN) standards, which may also be referred to as a Wi-Fi network. Such a network may include wireless transmitters\/receivers often referred to as \u201caccess points,\u201d for example.","A position estimate, which may also be referred to as a position \u201cfix\u201d, for a mobile device may be obtained based at least in part on distances or ranges measured from the mobile device to one or more wireless transmitters, and also based at least in part on knowledge of the locations of the wireless transmitters. Such transmitters may comprise SVs in the case of an SPS, terrestrial base stations in the case of a cellular communications system, or Wi-Fi\/802.11x access or points or other beacon transmitters, for example.","In an aspect, an expected route of a mobile device may be determined based, at least in part, on information generated by a navigation application hosted by the mobile device. One or more messages comprising a request for identity or position information for a subset of wireless transmitters may be transmitted from a communication interface of the mobile to a network entity, in an aspect. Also, in an aspect, a subset of wireless transmitters may be determined based at least in part on the expected route of the mobile device, and the request for identity or position information may include one or more signals indicative of the expected route of the mobile device.","In a further aspect, an article may comprise a storage medium having stored thereon one or more instructions executable by a processor of a mobile device to determine an expected route of the mobile device based, at least in part, on information generated by a navigation application hosted by the mobile device. The article may have stored thereon further instructions executable by the processor of the mobile device to initiate a transmission from the mobile device to a network entity of one or more messages comprising a request for identity or position information for a subset of wireless transmitters to be determined based at least in part on the expected route of the mobile device, wherein the request for identity or position information includes information indicative of the expected route of the mobile device.","Additionally, in an aspect, a mobile device may comprise a processor to determine an expected route of the mobile device based, at least in part, on information generated by a navigation application hosted by the mobile device, the processor further to initiate transmitting one or more messages from a communication interface of the mobile device to a network entity, wherein the one or more messages comprise a request for identity or position information for a subset of wireless transmitters to be determined based at least in part on the expected route of the mobile device. In a further aspect, the request for identity or position information may include one or more signals indicative of the expected route of the mobile device.","In a further aspect, an apparatus may comprise means for determining an expected route of a mobile device based, at least in part, on information generated by a navigation application hosted by the mobile device. Also, in an aspect, an apparatus may comprise means for transmitting to a network entity one or more messages comprising a request for identity or position information for a subset of wireless transmitters to be determined based at least in part on the expected route of the mobile device. In an aspect, the request for identity or position information may include one or more signals indicative of the expected route of the mobile device.","As discussed above, information in an almanac may be used to perform, at least in part, position estimation operations for mobile devices. A position estimate for a mobile device may be obtained based at least in part on distances or ranges measured from the mobile device to one or more transmitters such as space vehicles (SV), terrestrial base stations, or access points, for example, and also based at least in part on the locations of the one or more transmitters. A range to a transmitter may be measured based on one or more characteristics of one or more signals transmitted by the transmitter and received at the mobile device. Location and coverage area information of the transmitters may be ascertained, in at least some cases, based on the identities of the transmitters, and identities of the transmitters may be ascertained from signals received from the transmitters.","An almanac may be maintained for systems used for position estimation. The almanac may contain various types of information, including, for example, information that may be used in position estimation operations. Such information may include the identities and locations of various wireless transmitters of one or more wireless communications systems, for example. Information may also include coverage area information for various wireless transmitters or uncertainties for one or more parameters related to various wireless transmitters, in an aspect.","For some wireless communications systems, an almanac that stores information related to land-based transmitters may be referred to as a \u201cbase station almanac\u201d (BSA). The terms \u201calmanac\u201d and \u201cbase station almanac\u201d as used herein may be used interchangeably, and are meant to include any organized set of information related to a plurality of base stations or access points of a wireless communications network. A BSA may be stored in a memory of a computing platform, such as a BSA server, for example, or in a memory of mobile device, for another example. In another aspect, a BSA may be transmitted from a BSA server to one or more mobile devices.","In one aspect, a mobile device may use received almanac information to perform position estimation operations, for example by trilateration or multilateration, using information or measurements from a number of transmitters. A mobile device may also use received almanac information, in another aspect, to narrow a code phase search window for acquiring signals transmitted by an SPS in order to perform position estimation operations using, at least in part, measurements from signals received from one or more space vehicles (SV). For example, to narrow a search window, a mobile device may use BSA information to associate an identification of a cellular communication system sector currently serving the mobile device with an almanac entry. The entry may provide a location of the transmitter for the serving sector, from which an approximate location (within a couple of kilometers, for example) of the mobile device may be obtained.","Mobile devices may have a limited capacity for storing information, due at least in part to size and cost considerations. Also, wireless communication channels may have limited capacity. Therefore, it may be advantageous to provide a mobile device with almanac information it is more likely to utilize in position fix operations and to not provide the mobile device with information it is unlikely to utilize. In this manner, the amount of almanac information to be stored at the mobile device may be kept within limits imposed by storage capacity, and the amount of communication channel capacity utilized in transmitting almanac information may be reduced. Furthermore, any reduction in the amount of data sent or received by mobile device may reduce mobile device power consumption and may therefore increase battery life.","In an aspect, to determine appropriate almanac information to download to a mobile device, navigation information may be utilized to identify wireless access points or base stations that may be positioned along a planned or expected route for the mobile device. For example, if a user is planning to travel to a new location, the user may tend to utilize a navigation application executed by the mobile device. For example, a route may be planned between a starting position and a destination. Because this may be a new location for the user, the user's mobile device may not have previously downloaded almanac information for wireless access points located along the planned route to the new location. Information generated by the navigation application may be utilized by the mobile device to identify wireless access points that may be located along the planned or expected route, and appropriate almanac information may be transmitted to the mobile device in anticipation of entering a new area.","In an aspect, a subset of a plurality of wireless access points may be determined based, at least in part, on an expected route of a mobile device. An expected route of a mobile device may be determined based, at least in part, on inferences generated by a navigation application executed by a processor of the mobile device. In an aspect, an expected route may comprise a route between a starting or current position of a mobile device and a destination location that may be planned by a navigation application executed by a processor of the mobile device. In a further aspect, one or more signals indicative of a request for almanac information may be transmitted from a communication interface of the mobile device to a network entity. Also in an aspect, a request for almanac information may comprise information related to an expected route of a mobile device determined by a navigation application executed by a processor of the mobile device or by another network entity. Further, in an aspect, a network entity may determine a subset of wireless access points of a plurality of wireless access points based, at least in part, on information related to the expected route of the mobile device received from the mobile device. The network entity may further provide almanac information associated with the determined subset of wireless access points, in an aspect. An amount of almanac information delivered to a mobile device may further be limited by a specified maximum amount, in an aspect, although the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. In this manner, the mobile device has stored thereon almanac information it is most likely to utilize in performing position fix operations, and the amount of extraneous information delivered to the mobile device and stored thereon may be reduced. Also, the amount of communication channel capacity utilized to deliver the almanac information to the mobile device may be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","120","150","120","150","120","120","132","134","136","150","132","134","136","150","120"]},"As used herein, the terms \u201cwireless transmitter\u201d and \u201cwireless access point\u201d are interchangeable, and are meant to include any wireless communication station or device used to facilitate communication in a wireless communications system, such as, for example, a cellular network, although the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. An example type of wireless transmitter or access point utilized in a cellular network may be referred to as a base station. In another aspect, a wireless transmitter or access point may comprise a femtocell, utilized to extend cellular telephone service into a business or home. In such an implementation, one or more mobile devices may communicate with a femtocell via a code division multiple access (CDMA) cellular communication protocol, for example, and the femtocell may provide the mobile device access to a larger cellular telecommunication network by way of another broadband network such as the Internet. In another aspect, wireless transmitters may be included in any of a range of electronic device types. In an aspect, a wireless transmitter may comprise a wireless local area network (WLAN) access point, for example. Such a WLAN may comprise a network that is compatible with one or more of the IEEE 802.11x standards, in an aspect, although the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. Additionally, the use of the term \u201ctransmitter\u201d in describing a device does not limit that device's function to transmitting only. For example, base stations and access points are typically capable of both transmitting and receiving wireless signals. Also, as used herein, the term \u201cwireless access point\u201d may refer to WLAN access points compatible with one or more of the IEEE 802.11x standards, for example, and may also refer to cellular base stations, in an aspect.","As used herein, the term \u201cmobile device\u201d refers to a device that may from time to time have a position that changes. Such changes in position may comprise changes to direction, distance, orientation, etc., as a few examples. In particular examples, a mobile device may comprise a cellular telephone, wireless communication device, user equipment, laptop computer, other personal communication system (PCS) device, personal digital assistant (PDA), personal audio device (PAD), portable navigational device, or other portable communication devices. A mobile device may also comprise a processor or computing platform adapted to perform functions controlled by machine-readable instructions.","In an aspect, SPS  may comprise a number of SVs, for example SVs , , and . For an example, SPS  may comprise one or more satellite positioning systems, such as GPS, GLONASS and Galileo, although the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. In one or more aspects, mobile device  may receive signals from SVs , , and , and may communicate with one or more of base stations , , and . For example, mobile device  may obtain one or more measurements from one or more signals received from one or more of the SVs or base stations. However, in some circumstances timing signals from an SPS may not be available. In such a circumstance, mobile device  may gather propagation delay information through communication with one or more of base stations , , or . Mobile device  may calculate a position for the mobile device based, at least in part, on timing calibration parameters received through communication with one or more of base stations , , or , and further based, at least in part, on known locations of the base stations. Mobile device  may also make use of an estimated non-line-of-sight propagation delay for signals received from a base station source, a satellite source, or both, to correct range measurements to such sources.","In another aspect, position determination calculations may be performed by a network entity such as, for example, location server  depicted in , rather than at mobile device . Such a calculation may be based, at least in part, on signals acquired by mobile device  from one or more of base stations , , or . In a further aspect, location server  may transmit the calculated position to mobile device .","A mobile switching center (MSC)  for this example may be coupled to base stations , , and , and may further couple to other systems and networks, such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a packet data serving node (PDSN) , and so on. MSC  for this example may provide coordination and control for the base stations coupled to it and may further control routing of messages to\/from the mobile devices served by these base stations. For the example depicted in , PDSN  may couple MSC  to location server  and to a BSA server . Location server  may collect and format base station location information, provide assistance to mobile devices for position estimation, or perform computations to obtain position estimates for the mobile devices. BSA server  may manage a BSA , which for this example may store a hierarchal base station almanac for wireless communications network . An example of a hierarchal base station almanac is presented below in connection with .","In one aspect, BSA server  may provide almanac information to mobile device . Information to be provided to mobile device  may comprise a subset of BSA  selected based, at least in part, upon an expected route for mobile device . In an aspect, an expected route for mobile device  may be determined by a navigation application executed by a processor of mobile device . In an aspect, an expected route may comprise a route between a starting or current position of mobile device  and a destination location specified by a user. An expected route between a starting position and a destination position may be based, at least in part, on a shortest possible route between a starting position and a destination position, for example, or on a shortest transit time, for another example, although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in these respects. In an aspect, an expected route for mobile device  may comprise a route selected by a user, for example. Information related to an expected route for mobile device  may be transmitted by mobile device  to a network entity, such as location server  or BSA server , for example, to determine a subset of wireless access points that the mobile device is likely to acquire as the mobile device travels along the expected route. The term \u201cacquire\u201d as used herein as it relates to wireless signals received at a mobile device refers to a mobile device obtaining sufficient signal attributes or symbols from a wireless signal to enable processing of the received wireless signal to obtain at least some information therein. Example types of information that may be obtained by a mobile device in acquiring a wireless signal may include, but are not limited to, carrier frequency, radio-frequency (RF) phase, code, code-phase, timing, messages, transmitter identifier, or Doppler shift, to list but a few examples. Further, it should be noted that the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited to any particular technique for acquiring a wireless signal.","To determine a subset of wireless access points that mobile device  is likely to acquire as mobile device  travels along an expected route, a network entity, such as location server  or BSA server , may determine relationships between coverage areas for individual wireless access points and an expected route for mobile device . For example, in an aspect, a determination may be made as to whether an estimated or measured coverage area for an individual wireless access point intersects an expected route for mobile device . In another aspect, such a determination may be based, at least in part, on a historical observation frequency of individual wireless access points for mobile devices traveling along an expected route. In a further aspect, such a determination may be based, at least in part, on a proximity of individual wireless access points to the expected route of the mobile device. Additionally, a determination of the subset of wireless access points may be based, at least in part, on one or more authorizations for the mobile device to communicate with one or more networks associated with individual wireless access points, in an aspect. However, claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in these respects.","In another aspect, information to be provided to mobile device  may comprise a subset of BSA  selected based, at least in part, on one or more additional parameters specified by mobile device . Such parameters may include one or more networks, sub-networks, or communications or SPS protocols specified by mobile device , an amount of available storage space for mobile device , indications of particular categories or types of information for individual wireless access points specified by mobile device , or the granularity of the data, to name but a few examples. Of course, claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["322","322","210","220","322","110","120","322","230","240"]},"Fix information stored in fix database  may comprise information gathered in the course of position fix operations. Such position fix information may be stored in wireless transmitter database  of mobile device  in what may be referred to as a \u201cfix database\u201d in which the fix information is organized or indexed according to particular instances of position fixes. Fix information may also be stored in a wireless transmitter database  in which fix information may be organized or indexed according to particular wireless transmitters observed or identified during position fix operations. In a further aspect, mobile device  may comprise one or more sensors that for this example are incorporated into Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)  that may be utilized in dead-reckoning navigation operations, for example. Mobile device  further comprises processor , for this example. Of course, this is merely one example of a configuration of a mobile device, and the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect.","In an aspect, locations of a plurality of wireless access points may be stored in a network entity such as BSA server  in wireless communications network , or may be stored in any of a wide range of other resources in the wireless network. Further, for an example, location information for wireless access points may comprise longitude and latitude components, and may for another example also comprise an altitude component. However, the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects. In another aspect, some wireless access points may broadcast their positions, and the positions of such wireless access points may be stored in one or more databases in a mobile device, such as in wireless transmitter database  of mobile device . Wireless access point positions stored at a mobile device may be shared with other network entities, such as an assistance server or location server such as location server  of , for example.","Further, in an additional aspect, BSA  may have stored therein a subset of a larger BSA database, such as BSA  of , for example. In an aspect, a network entity such as location server  or BSA server  may determine which of a plurality of wireless transmitters associated with information stored in BSA  have locations that are within a specified range of an expected route for mobile device . As mentioned previously, a network entity such as location server  or BSA server  may, in an aspect, base a determination of a subset of wireless access points at least in part on a coverage area as it relates to an expected route for the mobile device for individual wireless access points. In another aspect, a network entity may base a determination of a subset of wireless access points, at least in part, on a historical observation frequency of individual wireless access points for mobile devices traveling along an expected route, or portion thereof. In a further aspect, the determination may be based, at least in part, on a proximity of individual wireless access points to an expected route of mobile device . Additionally, in an aspect, a determination of a subset of wireless access points may be based, at least in part, on whether a mobile device is authorized for two-way communication with individual wireless access points of the plurality of wireless access points. For example, a user may subscribe to one or more particular wireless network providers, and such providers may maintain one or more wireless access points. A mobile device associated with the user may authorized for two-way communication with the wireless access points maintained by the one or more particular wireless network providers subscribed to by the user. Further, in an aspect, a determination of a subset of wireless access points may be based, at least in part, on whether one or more wireless access points maintained by the one or more wireless network providers are positioned along an expected route for a mobile device. However, claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in these respects.","In an aspect, in order for a network entity such as location server  or BSA server  to determine a subset of wireless access points based on an expected route for mobile device , a network entity may receive one or more messages from mobile device . As mentioned above, mobile device  may collect information related to position fix operations in fix database , including identities and positions of wireless access points observed during position fix operations. Information related to specific wireless access points may be stored, for one example implementation, in wireless transmitter database . Information stored in fix database  or wireless transmitter database  may be provided to the network entity, such as to location server  or to BSA server , in an example implementation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["350","320","330","332","334","340","322","332","334","324","334"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","320","320","320","350","260","322","350"]},"In another aspect, BSA server  may obtain a BSA from an external almanac source . For example, a cellular network provider may contract with a third party to develop or provide one or more records including locations or identities of one or more wireless access points to BSA server . At least a subset of the records provided to BSA server  may eventually be transmitted to one or more of mobile devices , in an aspect. In a further aspect, BSA server  may receive BSA information from one or more of mobile devices  as one or more of mobile devices  develop such information at least in part through monitoring signals transmitted from one or more of example transmitters . Additionally, in another aspect, one or more of mobile devices  may select whether externally-provided BSA information should be delivered to the mobile device in response to the mobile device making such request or whether BSA information originally developed at least in part by the mobile devices should be delivered. In a further aspect, one or more of mobile devices  may select a combination of information from external and local sources. In a further aspect, a processor of a mobile device may initiate receiving wireless transmitter almanac information from a network entity. For example, processor  may initiate receiving one or more messages comprising wireless transmitter almanac information from BSA server , although claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in this respect.","Although the example of  depicts two mobile devices, in practice a wide variety of mobile device types exhibiting a wide range of different functionalities or storage capabilities may be utilized to communicate with a large variety of potential network types. Further, the mobile devices may exhibit a wide range of different usage patterns. Therefore, it may be advantageous for BSA server  to provide individualized subsets of BSA information that the individual mobile devices may require or request, and it may be further advantageous to provide such information formatted in a flexible manner according to a specified file size, coverage area, or transmitter type, to name but a few examples of parameters that may be specified. In one aspect, these parameters may be specified by the mobile devices.","In an additional aspect, wireless access points whose information is to be included in the BSA information provided to a requesting mobile device may be determined according to the proximity of individual wireless access points to a current expected route of the requesting mobile device. The idea behind this technique for determining which BSA information to provide to a requesting mobile device is that the requesting mobile device may be more likely to acquire signals in the relatively near future for those wireless access points whose coverage areas intersect the expected route of the mobile device. In an aspect, an expected route for a mobile device may be partitioned into two or more segments, and identity or position information related to wireless access points with coverage areas that intersect one or more expected route segments may be provided to the requesting mobile device. For one example, if an individual coverage area for a wireless access point intersects one or more expected route segments, or if one or more segments are wholly enclosed by the individual coverage area, the given wireless access point may have its identity or position information provided to the requesting mobile device. For yet another example, a determination of whether to include identity or position information for a given group of wireless access points in the information to be provided to a requesting mobile device may be made conditionally, based at least in part on data storage available in the requesting mobile device. For example, identity or position information for individual wireless access points or groups of wireless access points may be included, depending upon space availability, where information is added until a specified available storage space threshold is reached. An available storage space threshold may be specified based, for example, on a maximum size or upon a desired size of available data storage in the requesting mobile device. In cases when storage space may be limited and navigation coverage may be redundant, information to be provided to a mobile device may be based at least in part on a set of priorities specified by a mobile device, by a BSA provider, or by a combination of thereof. For example, if a mobile device is likely to have a clear view of the sky for SPS coverage and excellent wide area network (WAN) coverage, WLAN communications along the route may be less advantageous. In such a situation, WLAN access point almanac information may not be conveyed to a mobile device, or an amount of WLAN access point almanac information to be conveyed to a mobile device may be reduced. Likewise, in dense urban areas where SPS and WAN signals may suffer from poor availability and\/or long multipath, WLAN navigation operations may be more desirable, and therefore WLAN access point almanac information may be more desirable.","In examples described herein, a mobile device such as mobile device  may be described as requesting almanac information from BSA server . In response to receiving the request from mobile device , BSA server  may access position or identity information for a subset of wireless access points and may transmit one or more messages containing the position or identity information to mobile device . However, there may be a number of variations to these examples, in that there may be various techniques to communicate wireless access point identity or position information to mobile device . In some cases, the technique used may depend at least in part on a particular type of air interface. In some air interfaces, a transmitting entity may also be able to store and forward its own almanac information or that of its neighbors. For example, referring to , base station  may store BSA information, and may forward at least a portion of that BSA information to mobile device  upon receiving a request from mobile device . Base station  may compress or encrypt the information in accordance with the examples mentioned above. In another aspect, base station  may authenticate mobile device  before granting the mobile device's request for BSA information. However, these are merely examples regarding almanac information, and the scope of claimed subject matter is not limited in these respects.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["421","422","423","424","425","426","427","428","429","430","431","432","433","421","433","411","412","413","411","413","421","433","401","322","401","322","401","322","322"]},"In an aspect, expected route  may be partitioned into two or more segments. A first segment may comprise a portion of expected route  that passes by access points , , and . A second segment may comprise a portion of expected route  that passes by wireless access points -. Of course, this is merely an example partitioning scheme for an expected route, and claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect. In an aspect, a checkpoint  may be located between the first and second segments of expected route . In a further aspect, a checkpoint may comprise information indicative of a subset of wireless access point almanac information that may be requested by mobile device . For example, if mobile device  travels from the starting location of expected route  and arrives or approaches checkpoint , mobile device  may discern arriving at checkpoint  and may request almanac information associated with a subset of wireless access points whose coverage areas may intersect the second segment of expected route . In this manner, checkpoints may be utilized to signal to mobile device  to request further almanac information so that mobile device  may have almanac information appropriate for wireless access points that may be encountered along the next segment of the expected route. In an aspect, checkpoints may be designated base at least in part on any of a variety of factors, including, for example, such aspects as availability or cost of communication coverage at a checkpoint, distance or expected time between checkpoints, or an amount of almanac information to be stored in a mobile device between almanac information updates.","In an aspect, mobile device  may utilize almanac information associated with wireless access points positioned along expected route  to plan searches for WLAN access points, for example. If the almanac information indicates that no WLAN access points are available for a particular portion of expected route , mobile device  may turn off a searching function for wireless access points, and may instead rely on SPS navigation operations.","Additionally, almanac information associated with wireless access points positioned along expected route  may be utilized by mobile device  to display to a user locations at which WLAN access points may be available. For example, almanac information associated with wireless access points positioned along the second segment of expected route  may be utilized by mobile device  to indicate to the user that a wireless access point may be available at a restaurant associated with wireless access point , as depicted in . A user may plan a stop the restaurant to take advantage of the availability of wireless access point , for example.","In an aspect, for situations in which there is good wireless access point coverage, for example, mobile device  may turn off SPS navigation operations, and may rely on the wireless access points to provide signals for navigation operations. On the other hand, in an aspect, for a situation in which there is insufficient wireless access point coverage to support navigation operations, mobile device  may turn off wireless access point communications and my rely on SPS signals for navigation operations. For example,  depicts the second segment of expected route  passing through a mountainous region, where relatively few wireless access points are located. In such a situation, mobile device  may disable searching for wireless access points to reduce power consumption, and may utilize SPS signals to perform navigation operations.","In a further aspect, for situations in which mobile device  is traveling along a freeway, or along some other known and well-defined roadway, and is traveling in areas with cellular base station or wireless access point coverage sufficient to support navigation operations, it may not be necessary to utilize relatively highly accurate SPS navigation operations, for example. A navigation application executed on a processor of mobile device  access map information stored at mobile device  that may include information indicative of the known, well-defined roadway. Mobile device  may utilize map information related to the known, well-defined roadway along with signals received from one or more relatively lower-accuracy cellular base stations or wireless access points to perform navigation operations with desired accuracy. In such a situation, mobile device  may disable SPS reception in order to reduce power consumption. In an aspect, by providing mobile device  with appropriate almanac information, including wireless access point identities or positions, based on an expected route, mobile device  may take advantage of such almanac information in a variety of ways to improve power consumption or performance.","Additionally, in an aspect, cellular base stations such as base stations  and  located along a freeway , for example as depicted in , may broadcast encrypted signals designated for navigation purposes. Encrypted signals may be acquired and decrypted by mobile device  if mobile device  is authorized to utilize the encrypted signals (e.g., has possession of a decryption key).
