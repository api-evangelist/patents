{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Field of the Invention","Embodiments of the present invention are generally related to the field of location aware computing. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention are related to a method and apparatus for location-based recovery of lost or stolen mobile devices.","Description","Location awareness is becoming increasingly important in computing systems, especially in mobile devices. Location awareness in mobile devices enables users to be directed to specific locations, to find people and resources, and to switch the operating context of the mobile device based on location (e.g., home vs. work). Currently, location awareness is implemented at the operating system or application level.","With the location awareness being implemented at the operating system or application level, if the mobile device is stolen, the thief may replace the encrypted hard drive, thereby causing the location awareness capability to be lost as well.","Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus for enabling a mobile device to have location awareness capabilities that cannot be removed with the removal of the hard drive. What is also needed is a method and apparatus for enabling a mobile device to be located when stolen, lost, misplaced, etc., using location awareness capabilities built into the mobile device.","While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those skilled in the relevant art(s) with access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which embodiments of the present invention would be of significant utility.","Reference in the specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d, \u201can embodiment\u201d or \u201canother embodiment\u201d of the present invention means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d and \u201cin an embodiment\u201d appearing in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a method and apparatus for location-based recovery of stolen, lost, or misplaced mobile devices. This is accomplished by embedding location-aware technology within the platform firmware of the mobile device. The embedded location-aware capabilities may be used to provide the location of the mobile device, and, if necessary, to enable the recovery of the mobile device if it is stolen, lost, or misplaced. Implementing the location-aware technology in the firmware rather than the operating system or application layer prevents the location-based recovery mechanism from being removed if the disk drive is replaced. The location-aware capabilities in the mobile device include a location sensing technology built into the platform firmware by the factory as part of the motherboard and a location reporting module as part of the platform firmware for reporting the location of the mobile device to an Internet node. The location of the mobile device is reported to a central database to enable the mobile device to be recovered if it was stolen, lost, or misplaced or for other purposes, such as, for example, keeping track of inventory.","Embodiments of the present invention may require the firmware and any firmware upgrades to be non-hackable. Therefore, the firmware and any firmware upgrades are signed to prevent the replacement of the firmware with alternate firmware that does not contain the location-based recovery mechanism. Digitally signing the firmware and any firmware upgrades prevents the firmware from being replaced with something that is not digitally signed. This also proves whether a replacement is valid. Digital signatures are well-known in the relevant art(s).","Embodiments of the present invention are shown as being implemented in the platform firmware of a laptop computer. Although the location-aware capabilities are described as being implemented in the platform firmware of a laptop computer, the invention is not limited to laptop computers. The location-aware capabilities may be implemented in the platform firmware of other mobile computing devices, such as, for example, personal digital assistants, notebook computers, tablet computers, cellular telephones, pagers, etc. In fact, embodiments of the invention may also be used to locate computing devices that may not be classified as mobile, yet may be compact enough to be easily stolen, lost, or misplaced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","104","102","106"]},"Although location-aware computing device  is shown as a laptop computer, location-aware computing device  may be any mobile device capable of location-aware computing. Such mobile devices may include, but are not limited to, laptop computers, notebook computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular telephones, pagers, etc. Location-aware computing device  may also be referred to as a mobile device.","Location-aware computing device  includes location hardware implemented within the platform's firmware. Location-aware computing device  may be capable of connecting to Internet  via a wireless and\/or wired connection. Location-aware computing device  will be described further with reference to .","In one embodiment, central database  may be part of a corporate Information Technology (IT) department tasked to maintain, keep track of, and protect all mobile devices owned by the corporation. In another embodiment, central database  may be owned by a service provider company tasked to monitor or track personally owned mobile devices to enable the mobile devices to be recovered if they are stolen, lost, or misplaced. Other types of entities may also provide a central database for tracking location-aware computing devices.","Central database  receives location reports and mobile device identification information on a plurality of mobile devices. Central database  also reports the location of a stolen, lost, or misplaced mobile device to the appropriate parties. The appropriate parties may be, but are not limited to, the corporate IT department, the service provider, the owner of the mobile device, the rightful user of the mobile device, law enforcement officials, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","204","202","202","202","204"]},"Platform firmware layer  comprises, inter alia, a platform resource interface , a platform location service , a location reporting module , a network stack , network hardware , and location hardware . Platform resource interface  may be coupled to platform location service  and network stack . Platform location service  may be coupled to location hardware  and location reporting module . Network stack  may be coupled to location reporting module  and network hardware .","Platform resource interface  is an interface layer that enables operating system  to communicate with the remaining components in platform firmware layer . In one embodiment of the invention, platform resource interface  may be a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable operating system  to communicate with the other components in platform firmware layer . For example, operating system  may use platform resource interface  to send network packets back and forth over a network via network stack  and network hardware . Also, operating system  may use platform resource interface  to request the location of the mobile device via platform location service  and location hardware .","Platform location service  is a firmware module that provides location information to an entity requesting the location of the mobile device. Platform location service  provides the location information in the proper format for the requesting entity. For example, operating system  may request the location of the mobile device and platform location service  will provide the information to operating system  in a format suitable for operating system , such as, for example, in the form of longitude and latitude. Platform location service  may also receive a request for the location of the mobile device from location reporting module .","Platform location service  retrieves the location information from location hardware . Location hardware  may be any hardware capable of determining the location of the mobile device. For example, location hardware  may be a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, which is well known in the relevant art(s). Location hardware may also be a WI-FI (Wireless Fidelity) receiver for determining location based on WI-FI access points, a cellular receiver for determining location based on cell tower proximity, or any other receiver capable of determining the location of the mobile device.","Location reporting module  initiates the transaction that reports the location of the mobile device to the central database. Thus, location reporting module  handles all outside requests for the location of the mobile device. Location reporting module  keeps abreast of when platform firmware layer  connects to the Internet. Location reporting module  sends and receives network packets off of network stack . When platform firmware layer  connects to the Internet, location reporting module  is made aware of the connection from network stack . Location reporting module  sends an initial network packet to central database  to inquire whether central database  wants location information for the mobile device. The network packet includes an identifier to enable central database  to identify the mobile device that sent the network packet. If central database  responds that it does want location information for the mobile device, then location reporting module  will query platform location service  to obtain its location from location hardware . When location reporting module  receives the location information from platform location service , location reporting module  packages the information into a network packet and sends it back out of network stack  via network hardware  to central database .","Network stack , along with network hardware , are standard components that allow other components on platform firmware layer  to send and receive network packets over the Internet, and are well-known in the art(s). Network stack  puts network packets together and controls network hardware . Network stack  may be software, such as, for example, a TCP\/IP stack. Network hardware  may be a network interface card (NIC), such as, for example, a WI-FI card, an Ethernet card, etc. Network hardware  may also be a phone modem or anything that allows platform firmware layer  to connect to the Internet.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304"]},"In block , network stack  reports that a connection to Internet  has been made. Central database  is then accessed to see if the mobile device should report its location to the central database (block ).

The request includes identification for the mobile device. In one embodiment, the identification may be an address unique to the mobile device, such as, for example, a MAC (Media Access Control) address. Other types of unique identifiers may also be used. The process then proceeds to decision block .","In decision block , it is determined whether location data should be reported for the mobile device identified in the request. Central database  may determine, using the unique identifier provided in the network packet, whether the entity in control of central database  is interested in knowing the location of the mobile device. For example, if the mobile device has been reported stolen, lost, or misplaced, or if the entity in control of the central database needs to know the location of the mobile device for inventory purposes, then central database  will determine that the location is needed and the process will proceed to block .","In block , a reply is sent to the mobile device indicating that the location of the mobile device should be sent to central database . In block , the location data for the mobile device is received. The process then proceeds to block , where the appropriate persons are informed of the location of the mobile device for purposes of recovering the mobile device if the mobile device has been stolen, lost, or misplaced or, if the mobile device has not been lost, stolen, or misplaced, for purposes of keeping track of inventory or other purposes.","Returning to decision block , if it is determined that location data for the mobile device identified in the request should not be reported, then the process proceeds to block . In block , the process ends.","Although embodiments of the present invention are described with a mobile reporting its location only when requested by central database , the invention is not limited to this. For example, in an alternative embodiment, an administrator for central database  may set a policy to have a mobile device report its location each time the mobile device connects to the Internet. Other reporting policies may also be implemented by the administrator as well.","Certain aspects of embodiments of the present invention may be implemented using hardware, software, or a combination thereof and may be implemented in one or more computer systems or other processing systems. In fact, in one embodiment, the methods may be implemented in programs executing on programmable machines such as mobile or stationary computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), set top boxes, cellular telephones and pagers, and other electronic devices that each include a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-volatile memory and\/or storage elements), at least one input device, and one or more output devices.
