{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to Chinese Patent Application No. 201110262652.9, filed Sep. 6, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to software, computer systems, and computer implemented methods for providing a generic process modeling framework for business process development and modification.","Business process management is a concept and technology used throughout various industries. Business process management has developed in parallel in two directions, process modeling and technology engineering. In both areas, various tools support both business users and technical users. Normally, business users abstract business logic for a particular business process, and provide that logic to technical developers to turn the logic into technical components and processes. In many situations, this method of building business processes is successful when the business user can provide the technical user with an accurate and specific process diagram, such as a Visio file. The technical user can understand the common nomenclature and illustrations within the diagram to create a specific technical model corresponding to the process within a business process design system.","Issues and problems occur when requirement or process changes are necessary or desired by the business users. Currently, changes require the business users or associated analysts to identify the appropriate changes to be made within a particular model, communicate those changes to the technical user, and subsequently, enable those new or updated features. Due to the frequency of changes, delayed project implementation and increased maintenance costs may occur. Additionally, the business and technical users associated with the original process may be unavailable, leaving one or more unfamiliar users responsible for the updates or modifications.","The present disclosure describes methods, systems, and computer program products for generic process modeling. One method includes identifying a business process for execution, the business process defined by one or more process steps, identifying a process routing table associated with the identified business process, at least a portion of the process routing table including one or more entries defining a set of business process rules for the identified business process, identifying a particular entry in the process routing table associated with a current state of the identified business process; and performing at least one action defined by the identified particular entry in the process routing table. In some instances, at least one entry in the process routing table is associated with one of a plurality of process patterns, with each process pattern comprising a reusable, predefined operation.","While generally described as computer implemented software embodied on tangible media that processes and transforms the respective data, some or all of the aspects may be computer implemented methods or further included in respective systems or other devices for performing this described functionality. The details of these and other aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.","This disclosure generally relates to software, computer systems, and computer implemented methods for providing a generic process modeling framework for business process development and modification. Specifically, tools and methods for allowing business users to easily and consistently create and modify business processes, without involving a technical user, are described. Generally, the generic process modeling framework allows for frequent changes to business processes and immediate feedback on the results of those changes.","Prior solutions for developing or modifying process requirements require business users to design a business process in a modeling environment, provide the modeled business process to a technical user, and then have the technical user develop the necessary services and functionality to perform the functionality. Frequent modifications, communication issues, and other bottleneck points may cause the delay in implementation of the updates and modifications, causing business processes not to perform up to the specifications provided by the business user. In one example, such as in a customer relationship management (CRM) approval process, a marketing director may identify an approval process requirement for a campaign for products of LCD TVs stating that if the amount is less than $5,000, then a sales manager can approve, otherwise, a sales director must approve the campaign. The marketing director (the business user in this scenario) can provide these requirements to a workflow expert to generate the appropriate workflow. The workflow expert may then update a workflow template specific to the current process, and provide the template to a business process developer. The business process developer can then design the appropriate coding to meet the designed workflow for the process. Several issues occur with this solution. First, the time it takes to modify the process is not reasonable, requiring the availability of two or more users or employees to identify, design, and develop the changes. Further, implementation causes many efforts, including multiple checks between the users, to ensure that the correct logic is passed through the design process. Based on the multiple users, it may be easy for mistakes to occur, causing the final result to be different than what the business user had identified and hoped to achieve, such that issues may occur in the actual use of the business process.","Staying with the same example, the marketing director may also want to add a new approval process for camera products. The process may be similar to the LCD TV process, except there may be an additional approval layer when the amount is greater than $10,000. Even though the new camera process is similar to the previously designed LCD TV process, the marketing director may still need to work through both the workflow expert and the business process developer to implement the new conditions and modify the camera process.","The present disclosure provides tools to allow business users to build processes intuitively by providing a configuration via entries into a process routing table. In these solutions, no workflow experts are needed to model processes using a specific workflow technology, instead allowing business users to define one or more rules for a process within the process routing table, and allowing a generic rule engine to perform the logic in determining the proper actions to take when a process is initiated based on the logic defined within the process routing table by the business user. In doing so, development is made simpler, more straightforward, and can remove several layers of users from the development equation. In doing so, the business user can have increased control over the business process, which allows for quicker modifications when a change is identified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","103","145","163","142","100","103","130","115","115","145","163","103","115","100","103","103","142"]},"In general, the generic process modeling workflow system  is any server that stores and executes a generic workflow template framework , which allows for the execution of one or more business processes via business application . For example, each generic process modeling workflow system  may be a Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)-compliant application server that includes Java technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA), Java Messaging Service (JMS), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). In some instances, each generic process modeling workflow system  may store a plurality of various other applications, while in other instances, each generic process modeling workflow system  may be a dedicated server meant to store and execute a particular business application  and its related functionality via the generic workflow template framework . In some instances, the generic process modeling workflow system  may comprise a web server or be communicably coupled with a web server, where the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business applications  represent web-based (or web-accessible) applications accessed and executed through requests and interactions received via one or more clients  or mobile clients , executing one or more client applications  or mobile applications , respectively, operable to interact with the programmed tasks or operations of the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business application .","At a high level, the generic process modeling workflow system  comprises an electronic computing device operable to receive, transmit, process, store, or manage data and information associated with the environment . The generic process modeling workflow system  illustrated in  can be responsible for receiving application requests from one or more clients  and\/or mobile clients  (as well as any other entity or system interacting with the generic process modeling workflow system , including desktop or other client systems), responding to the received requests by processing said requests in the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the associated business application , and sending the appropriate responses from the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business application  back to the requesting client  and\/or mobile client  or other requesting system. Both the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business application  may be able to process and respond to local requests from users locally accessing the generic process modeling workflow system . Accordingly, in addition to requests from the clients  or the mobile clients  illustrated in , requests associated with the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business application  may also be sent from internal users, external or third-party customers, and other associated business applications or business processes, as well as any other appropriate entities, individuals, systems, or computers. In some instances, the business application  and\/or the generic workflow template framework  may be a web-based application executing functionality associated with a networked or cloud-based business process.","As used in the present disclosure, the term \u201ccomputer\u201d is intended to encompass any suitable processing device. For example, although  illustrates a single generic process modeling workflow system , environment  can be implemented using any number of servers, as well as computers other than servers, including a server pool. Indeed, the generic process modeling workflow system  may be any computer or processing device such as, for example, a blade server, general-purpose personal computer (PC), Macintosh, workstation, UNIX-based workstation, or any other suitable device. In other words, the present disclosure contemplates computers other than general purpose computers, as well as computers without conventional operating systems. Further, the illustrated generic process modeling workflow system  may be adapted to execute any operating system, including Linux, UNIX, Windows, Mac OS, or any other suitable operating system.","In the illustrated implementation of , the generic process modeling workflow system  includes an interface , a processor , a memory , the business application , and the generic workflow template framework . In some instances, the generic process modeling workflow system  and its illustrated components may be separated into multiple components executing at different servers and\/or systems. Thus, while illustrated as a single component in the example environment  of , alternative implementations may illustrate the generic process modeling workflow system  as comprising multiple parts or portions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","127","127","124","127","103","142"]},"The interface  is used by the generic process modeling workflow system  to communicate with other systems in a client-server or other distributed environment (including within environment ) connected to the network  (e.g., one of the clients , mobile clients , as well as other systems communicably coupled to the network ). The interface  generally comprises logic encoded in software and\/or hardware in a suitable combination and operable to communicate with the network . More specifically, the interface  may comprise software supporting one or more communication protocols associated with communications such that the network  or the interface's hardware is operable to communicate physical signals within and outside of the illustrated environment .","Generally, the generic process modeling workflow system  may be communicably coupled with a network  that facilitates wireless or wireline communications between the components of the environment  (i.e., between the generic process modeling workflow system  and one or more clients  and mobile clients ), as well as with any other local or remote computer, such as additional clients, servers, or other devices communicably coupled to network , including those not illustrated in . In the illustrated environment, the network  is depicted as a single network, but may be comprised of more than one network without departing from the scope of this disclosure, so long as at least a portion of the network  may facilitate communications between senders and recipients. In some instances, one or more of the components associated with the generic process modeling workflow system  may be included within the network  as one or more cloud-based services or operations.","The network  may be all or a portion of an enterprise or secured network, while in another instance, at least a portion of the network  may represent a connection to the Internet. In the illustrated example, at least a portion of the network  includes a portion of a cellular or mobile data network or other network capable of relaying text and\/or multimedia messages. In some instances, a portion of the network  may be a virtual private network (VPN). Further, all or a portion of the network  can comprise either a wireline or wireless link. Example wireless links may include 802.11a\/b\/g\/n, 802.20, WiMax, and\/or any other appropriate wireless link. In other words, the network  encompasses any internal or external network, networks, sub-network, or combination thereof operable to facilitate communications between various computing components inside and outside the illustrated environment . The network  may communicate, for example, Internet Protocol (IP) packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and other suitable information between network addresses. The network  may also include one or more local area networks (LANs), radio access networks (RANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), all or a portion of the Internet, and\/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations.","As illustrated in , the generic process modeling workflow system  includes a processor . Although illustrated as a single processor  in the generic process modeling workflow system , two or more processors may be used in the generic process modeling workflow system  according to particular needs, desires, or particular embodiments of environment . The processor  may be a central processing unit (CPU), a blade, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or another suitable component. Generally, the processor  executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the generic process modeling workflow system  and, specifically, the functionality associated with the corresponding generic workflow template framework  and the business application . In one implementation, the server's processor  executes the functionality required to receive and respond to requests and instructions from the one or more clients  and\/or mobile clients , as well as the functionality required to perform the operations of the associated generic workflow template framework  and business application .","Regardless of the particular implementation, \u201csoftware\u201d may include computer-readable instructions, firmware, wired or programmed hardware, or any combination thereof on a tangible and non-transitory medium operable when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein. Indeed, each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any appropriate computer language including C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, assembler, Perl, any suitable version of 4GL, as well as others. It will be understood that while portions of the software illustrated in  are shown as individual modules that implement the various features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes, the software may instead include a number of sub-modules, third-party services, components, libraries, and such, as appropriate. Conversely, the features and functionality of various components can be combined into single components, as appropriate. In the illustrated environment , each processor  executes the corresponding generic workflow template framework  and business application  stored on the associated generic process modeling workflow system . In some instances, a particular generic process modeling workflow system  may be associated with the execution of two or more business applications , as well as one or more distributed applications executing across two or more generic process modeling workflow systems .","At a high level, the generic workflow template framework  is any application, program, module, process, or other software that may execute, change, delete, generate, or otherwise manage information associated with a particular generic process modeling workflow system . The generic workflow template framework , through its use of the corresponding rule engine  and the process routing table  (illustrated in memory ) allows for users to easily create configuration-based business process logic to be performed in a business-related activity, in some instances, by the business application . Specifically, the generic workflow template framework  may operate in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from an associated client  and\/or mobile client , as well as any other remote client. Additionally, the generic workflow template framework  may operate in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from a particular business application , including a business application associated with another generic process modeling workflow system  or other system. In some instances, the generic workflow template framework  may represent a web-based application accessed and executed by remote clients, including one or more clients  and\/or mobile clients , via the network  (e.g., through the Internet, or via one or more cloud-based services associated with the generic workflow template ). Further, while illustrated as internal to the generic process modeling workflow system , one or more processes associated with the generic workflow template framework  may be stored, referenced, or executed remotely. For example, a portion of the generic workflow template framework  may be a web service that is remotely called, while another portion of the generic workflow template framework  may be an interface object or agent bundled for processing at a remote system (not illustrated), client , or mobile client . Moreover, any or the entire generic workflow template framework  may be a child or sub-module of another software module or enterprise application (not illustrated) without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Still further, portions of the generic workflow template framework  may be executed or accessed by a user working directly at the generic process modeling workflow system , as well as remotely at a corresponding client , mobile client , or other client.","The generic workflow template framework  is illustrated as including a rule engine , an authorization framework , a process simulator module , and a content search module . The rule engine  is used to coordinate the one or more generically defined processes defined within the set of process definitions  (illustrated in memory ). The primary function of the rule engine  is to decide, under given circumstances or based on a particular state, the proper result of a particular operation within the business process. The rule engine's  key function is to interpret the output of one process step to determine the appropriate next process step within the business process, as defined by the logic within the process routing table . Traditional process diagrams use rigid lines, loops, and forks to define the proper process flow, while the rule engine  uses a condition table (based on the entries of the process routing table ) and a loop back function to provide sufficient controller functions for performing a particular business process. By defining the proper conditions within the process routing table , including the associated process patterns  to be performed based on the particular input, defining conditions and results into the process routing table  at design time provides a straightforward means of defining business processes. When a particular process is executed, the rule engine  examines the current condition and decides the next process step by comparing the output of the current step to the process routing table  entries. The rule engine  thus replaces the rigid process lines and requirements of the traditional business process, and provides great flexibility to business users to define and modify business processes without the assistance of workflow experts and\/or technical users or developers. The generic workflow template framework  may also be associated with specific application programming interfaces (APIs) for business users and developers to use to access its functionality. Additionally, the generic workflow template framework  may be able to present the process routing table  or portions thereof in friendly and interactive user interfaces (UIs) in web pages, Extensible Markup Language (XML) files, Excel or other spreadsheet files or tables, database tables, as well as other suitable alternatives. Users at one of the clients  and\/or the mobile clients  can thus directly modify the process routing table  via the rule engine  and\/or the generic workflow template framework  using a browser or other suitable application at the client  or mobile client . This can eliminate the previous round-trip correspondence between the business user, the workflow expert, and the business process developer. Business users can provide a more precise rule configuration according to the abstract business scenario that they have identified. Business process developers, on the other hand, avoid having to understand the technical implementation of a particular business process and can instead become involved in the development tasks associated with the one or more process patterns  executed by the rule engine  as directed by the process routing table .","The one or more process patterns  execute the various functionality associated with the underlying business processes. Process patterns  are abstractions of business activities. Common patterns are not generally infinite, and can be generated and made available in the set of process patterns . Some common process patterns  may include user interaction patterns, computer background job patterns, error handling patterns, and notification patterns, among others. The process patterns  become concrete activity instances when they are passed parameters at runtime by the rule engine . A process definition  of the actions in a particular business process is created by using business logic and known process patterns  in the proper sequences. Process definitions  may be included within or associated with the process routing table , that, when the particular business process is to be executed, is controlled by the rule engine , which uses the proper parameters defined at design time by the business user to execute the business process. In some instances, individual process definitions  may be associated with a particular instance or separate version of the process routing table , which can be accessed directly to modify or update operations performed for a specific process. Using process patterns , instead of specific instances, reduces repetitive design, implementation, and testing work, and increases stability. In some instances, a unique or new process pattern  may be needed for a particular business process. The new process pattern  can be created by the business process developer, stored with the set of process patterns  in memory , and used by one or more business processes (or process definitions ) to define a particular business task or set of tasks.","Combining the rule engine  and the process patterns  enables process coordination and execution. In an IT project initiation, business users can follow the traditional approach to define abstract business processes. At implementation time, no specific, rigid technical process template may be necessary. The business user and developers can work together to define and create process patterns  by reference of common patterns to be used in an environment and according to business needs. Within the process patterns , common parameters may be defined. Thus, business users are able to focus on the process routing table  to transform an abstract business process into defined rules for performing the business process. The integration of the rule engine  and the process patterns  creates a complete technical process to support the business processes. Using the methodology provided, one or several processes could be implemented with the same process template and technical code base. If any changes or new functions are later required, business users may only need to modify minor parts of the process routing table  to provide those modifications.","Returning to the generic workflow template framework , an authorization framework  is illustrated. The authorization framework  provides security to the generic workflow template framework  by requiring authenticating credentials prior to allowing business processes to be created and\/or modified. For example, some systems may be associated with a role-based authorization system. In these systems, each user may be associated with a particular role. For each role, an authorization object may be associated therewith. In one example, the authorization object may be called \u201cProcessModelingAuthorizationObject.\u201d The authorization object may have several fields, including:\n\n","The values associated with the fields of a particular authorization object can be associated with the roles for which they apply. Different roles may be associated with different authorizations. For example, a marketing director may build a business process with a process type \u201cMarketing Campaign Budget Application\u201d used to control budget approval steps. The marketing director may generally be associated with an authorization object that allows him to update, delete, and view the process as needed. A sales manager underneath the marketing director may have the authorization to view the process, but may not be able to update or delete the process in some instances. To do so, two roles can be created: \u201cMarketing Director\u201d and \u201cSales Manager.\u201d The marketing director can be assigned the \u201cMarketing Director\u201d role, and the sales manager can be assigned the \u201cSales Manager\u201d role. When accessing the generic workflow template framework , or when attempting to access the process routing table , the authorization framework  can match the user credentials to the user's particular role to determine the level of access to be provided. Other suitable types and methods of authorization level checking, authorization, and approval may be used in alternative implementations.","The generic workflow template framework  may also include a process simulator module . The process simulator module  is a tool that can be used to simulate a run of a particular process definition  (based on the process routing table ) according to example input conditions provided by a user, allowing the results of the process to be shown without creating a process instance. The purpose of the tool is to let users input some process context data as conditions, with the process simulator module  showing the user the expected process result. The user can also be presented a portion of the process routing table  illustrating the rows or entries associated with the calculation, allowing the user to see the corresponding rows of the defined process. In one example, a process may be defined within the process routing table  to show that \u201cif the amount>5000, sales manager to approve.\u201d If hundreds or thousands of process definition rows are available within the process routing table , it may not be possible or may be difficult to locate those portions quickly and efficiently. By using the process simulator module , the user could input context data stating the \u201camount=5001\u201d and run the simulation. The process simulator module  can then perform the operations associated with that contextual data (i.e., \u201capprover=sales manager\u201d), as well as the rows or entries in the process routing table  associated with the determination. If the user desires a change to the process, the user can simply modify the fields of the process routing table  to change the logic behind the corresponding business process.","Additionally, the generic workflow template framework  may also include a content search module . The content search module  is a tool that provides business users with another means for locating particular process definition rows or entries within the process routing table . In some instances, business users may only need to provide an interested keyword for executing the search. A search engine or similar functionality may be associated with the process routing table , such that the search engine can locate the rows or entries within the process routing table  corresponding to the keywords or other search terms provided by the business user. For example, if the user wanted to locate the row \u201cif the amount>5000, sales manager to approve,\u201d then keywords that could be used may include \u201camount\u201d and \u201c5000,\u201d among other possibilities. Implementation of the content search module  may be based on any suitable available search technology that can be associated with the contents of the process routing table . The process routing table  and\/or one or more process definitions  may be indexed to allow for better and\/or faster searching.","At a high level, the business application  is any application, program, module, process, or other software that may execute, change, delete, generate, or otherwise manage information according to the present disclosure, particularly in response to and in connection with one or more requests received from the illustrated clients ,  and one or more client applications  and mobile applications . In certain cases, only one business application  may be located at or associated with the generic process modeling workflow system . In others, a plurality of related and\/or unrelated business applications  may be stored there, or located across a plurality of other systems and\/or servers comprising the generic process modeling workflow system  or other portions of the environment , as well. In certain cases, environment  may implement a composite business application. For example, portions of the composite application may be implemented as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) or design-time components, and may have the ability to generate run-time implementations into different platforms, such as J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition), ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming) objects, or Microsoft's .NET, among others. Additionally, the business application  may represent web-based applications accessed and executed by remote clients , , client application , or mobile application  via the network  (e.g., through the Internet). Further, while illustrated as internal to the generic process modeling workflow system , one or more processes associated with a particular business application  may be stored, referenced, or executed remotely. For example, a portion of a particular business application  may be a web service associated with the application that is remotely called, while another portion of the business application  may be an interface object or agent bundled for processing at a remote client ,  (such as client application  or mobile application ). Moreover, any or all of the business applications  may be a child, sub-module, or portion of another software module or enterprise application (not illustrated) without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Still further, portions of the business application  may be executed by a user or operator working directly, or locally, at the generic process modeling workflow system, as well as remotely at clients , . The business application  may be closely integrated with the process routing table  and the generic workflow template framework . In some instances, the business application  may be the application through which the various generically-defined business processes are executed, allowing different business and end users to perform the operations defined in the generic environment through the process routing table . In some instances, the business application  may execute business processes defined generically, as well as those defined in the traditional manner of a non-generic workflow. Further, execution of the business application  may allow users to access the portions of the generic workflow template framework  described herein, as well as the process routing table  and process patterns , among others. In some instances, the generic workflow template framework  may be a component of the business application , as well as part of the business application's inherent functionality.","The generic process modeling workflow system  also includes a memory  for storing data and program instructions. The memory  may include any memory or database module and may take the form of volatile or non-volatile memory including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other suitable local or remote memory component. The memory  may store various objects or data, including classes, frameworks, applications, backup data, business objects, jobs, web pages, web page templates, database tables, spreadsheets, process contexts, repositories storing services local to the generic process modeling workflow system , and any other appropriate information including any parameters, variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, constraints, or references thereto associated with the purposes of the system  and its generic workflow template framework  and\/or its business application . In some implementations, including a cloud-based system, some or all of the memory  may be stored remotely from the generic process modeling workflow system , and communicably coupled to the system  for usage. As illustrated, memory  includes the process routing table , one or more process patterns , and one or more process definitions , each described above.","The illustrated environment of  also includes one or more clients . Each client  may be any computing device operable to connect to or communicate with the generic process modeling workflow system , either directly or via the network  using a wireline or wireless connection. Each client  includes an interface , a processor , a memory , a client application , and a graphical user interface (GUI) . In general, each client  comprises an electronic computer device operable to receive, transmit, process, and store any appropriate data associated with the environment  of . It will be understood that there may be any number of clients  associated with, or external to, environment . For example, while illustrated environment  includes one client , alternative implementations of environment  may include a single client or multiple clients communicably coupled to the generic process modeling workflow system , or any other number of clients suitable to the purposes of the environment . The interface , processor , and memory  may be generally similar to those described with regard to interface , processor , and memory  of the generic process modeling workflow system . Additionally, there may also be one or more additional clients external to the illustrated portion of environment  that are capable of interacting with the environment  via the network . Further, the term \u201cclient\u201d and \u201cuser\u201d may be used interchangeably as appropriate without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, while each client  is described in terms of being used by a single user, this disclosure contemplates that many users may use one computer, or that one user may use multiple computers. In some instances, client  may represent a general user, while in others, client  may represent an administrator or other support entity associated with the generic workflow template framework .","The GUI  associated with client  comprises a graphical user interface operable to, for example, allow the user of client  to interface with at least a portion of the platform for any suitable purpose, such as creating, preparing, requesting, modifying, or analyzing data, as well as viewing and accessing documents and files associated with various business transactions, including viewing, modifying, and executing business processes defined by the process routing table  and the associated process definitions . Generally, the GUI  provides the particular user with an efficient and user-friendly presentation of business data provided by or communicated within the system. The GUI  may comprise a plurality of customizable frames or views having interactive fields, pull-down lists, and buttons operated by the user. For example, GUI  may provide interactive elements that allow a user to enter or select elements of business process instances and business objects associated with the business application  or that allow a user to view and manipulate at least a portion of the process routing table , in GUI . Portions of the generic workflow template framework  and\/or the business application  may be presented and accessible to the user through GUI , such as through a web browser or client application , for example. More generally, GUI  may also provide general interactive elements that allow a user to access and utilize various services and functions of client application . The GUI  is often configurable, supports a combination of tables and graphs (bar, line, pie, status dials, etc.), and is able to build real-time portals, where tabs are delineated by key characteristics (e.g. site or micro-site).

The template  may be understood in terms of a flowchart in some instances. At , a particular process is started. In some instances, the particular process may be associated with a business application (such as business application ), with the particular process defined by a particular set of rules defined within the process routing table  and\/or a particular process definition .","As further illustrated, the initial inputs are determined at , where the process values for the particular process are prepared. In some instances, the end user executing the particular process may define the initial inputs and provide them to business application or other runtime environment. Those inputs are then passed to the rule engine  at , and allow the rule engine  to determine how those inputs are to be processed.","As illustrated, the example workflow template  is associated with several process patterns , a background processing process pattern , an error handling process pattern , a user interaction process pattern , a notification sending process pattern , and other process patterns . These process patterns  are used to provide for the processing of the data or inputs of the rule engine  based on particular data flow and process flow conditions as defined in the process routing table . The illustrated generic workflow template  may generally define a plurality of processes, with the process routing table  maintaining the information differentiating each of the different processes associated with and defined within the generic process modeling workflow system . As input arrives to the rule engine , the rule engine  takes that input and determines the appropriate actions to take. For example, in some instances after an initial value is received, some background processing may be necessary, such that the rule engine  executes the background processing process pattern . Once the process pattern  completes its operations, a determination is made at  as to whether the overall process is complete. In some instances, this determination may also be made by the rule engine , while in others, an indication that the overall process is complete may be present after the execution of the corresponding process pattern . If the overall process is not complete, the process loops back to the rule engine's determination at  to identify the next operations to occur based on the current state of the overall process, as defined by the process routing table . If the overall process is determined to be complete, the process is completed at  and no additional determinations using the rule engine  are made in the current instantiation of the overall process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["303","306","309","312","315","318","303","306","309"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["103","406","403","403","403","415","118","415","430"],"i":["a","b ","n "]},"FIGS. A and B-, B- and B- illustrate examples of process routing tables that can be used in the present disclosure.  includes process routing table  illustrating an example set of decisions to be made on the approval requirements for actions involving both LCD TVs and cameras. Specifically, when the amount of LCD TVs is less than $5000, the sales manager can approve the transaction. However, when the amount is greater than or equal to $5000, then a sales director is required to approve the transaction. These values would be used by the rule engine to determine the proper individual to whom the approval action would be sent, and could be used in various situations to determine, on-the-fly, which individual or entity could approve certain transactions. Still further, as the logic associated with the determination is clear, business users wishing to modify the rules could access the process routing table  and its entries and modify them as necessary or desired. By doing so, the underlying logic of the application can be changed in an almost instantaneous manner, thereby providing the power of modification to business users having the appropriate authorization to modify the process routing table .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIGS. 5B-1","b":["5","2","5","3","515","515","520","525","530","515","520"]},"Similarly, the remaining columns (, , , , and ) define the result of the inbound conditions. Column  (\u201cPROCESSOR_ROLE\u201d) defines the processor of the next process task after the initial inbound conditions are received. Column  (\u201cDELEG_METHOD\u201d) is similar to column , with the difference that in column  a static user role is specified as to the processor of the next process task, while column  provides an indication of a particular program that will be executed at runtime to dynamically provide control or access to the next agent, processor, or user. Column  (SET_REQUEST_STAT) defines a setting for the state of the process for the next operation to be performed. Column  defines the process pattern associated with the current status or state of the process being performed, and column  defines the types of allowable notifications that can be performed. The process routing table  thereby defines one or more particular incoming states of the executing process (based on the combination of columns , , and ) and uses that information, in connection with the rule engine, to define a particular process and its performance steps and boundaries (based on columns , , , , and ). The rule defines the operations performed at a particular process state, as well as defines to what state the process should be placed once the operations for the particular process state are completed for use with the next task to be executed. Further, the rule defines the appropriate process patterns to use for processing the current state. As illustrated, the process routing table  is displayed similar to a spreadsheet. Users accessing the process routing table  and having the appropriate authorization could modify any of the illustrated steps by modifying the entries within the process routing table .

Again, the set of initial input may be manually defined by an end user or may be automatically defined based on information passed from other systems, processes, or business applications. At , a process pattern associated with the initial input is identified or determined. Determining or identifying the appropriate process pattern may be performed by a rule engine using the entries within the process routing table to determine the operations to be performed. Specifically, the initial input to the process instance is provided to the rule engine. The rule engine can read the entries in the process routing table to determine, based on the input, the appropriate process pattern to be performed. At , the identified process pattern is executed. In some instances, the execution of the process pattern may move the process into an updated state with new input, allowing the next process pattern, if necessary, to be identified. In some instances, the entries within the process routing table may define the next state to be provided once the correct entry associated with the input is identified. In some instances, the next process pattern to be executed may also be explicitly defined in the entries.","At , a determination is made as to whether additional operations are to be performed in the particular process. This determination is generally based on entries within the process routing table, identifying when and how the process is to end, or if an additional process pattern is to be performed. In some instances, the determination may be based on attributes associated with the previous entry used, with the entry identifying a particular process pattern step as the final step in the particular process. In other instances, the rule engine may identify the end of the particular process based on entries within the process routing table.

In some instances, the rule engine may dynamically determine the next operation based on the output of the previous operation and the current state of the process, taken under consideration in combination with reference to the process routing table. In some instances, the previous operation may change the state to define that a particular process pattern is to be performed, allowing the rule engine to identify the correct next process pattern without considering the process routing table. The rule engine and the process routing table can define one or more operation transitions by causing actions to be performed by the particular process and modifying the current state of the particular process instance as operations are performed. In some instances, the output of the previous operation may be used to identify the next operation and associated process pattern to be performed.
