{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to communications devices, and particularly, to a modem that connects both to dial-up service and broadband service and the software and firmware for controlling the modem.","Users of the modern day internet must often decide between a higher speed internet option (high speed) such as DSL or cable connections and give-up their dial-up capability, or they must continue to use a dial-up connection and suffer through slow connection speeds.","A user who wishes to have a high speed connection available, such as DSL, encounters numerous sources of frustration. For example, assume a user has contacted a high speed connection provider and expressed a desire to have a home DSL connection. The first step the provider will take is contacting the phone company to have the line physically enabled for a DSL connection. This process can take between 2\u20136 weeks. During this lag time, the provider has the option of sending the user a DSL modem the user is unable to use during the lag time, or they can choose to wait and send it when they receive confirmation from the phone company that the line is enabled. If the user received dial-up service prior to ordering a high speed connection, they will be able to connect with it for the lag time. If the user did not previously have dial-up, they must purchase a modem and dial-up service if they wish to be connected instantly, or they must go without a connection until the DSL service is enabled and modem installed.","Additionally, once the line is enabled for DSL service there can be interruptions in service. This leaves the user without any method for establishing a connection because most likely the user has given up any previous dial-up capability once the DSL connectivity was enabled.","A communications device, method and service are provided that integrate broadband and dial-up internet access in a seamless service package. For the purpose of this application, broadband will refer to any method or system for connecting one device to another operable to send data at a rate greater than 56 kilobytes per second. Thus, broadband includes but is not limited to connections such as Cable, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), Satellite, Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN), T lines (T1, T3, etc.), and wireless systems (Wi-Fi).","In one aspect, a dual-band modem is provided that combines both broadband and dial-up connectivity in a single device. The device may provide two separate chipsets, one for dial-up connectivity and another for a broadband connectivity. Alternatively, one chipset can be provided to provide connectivity for both the broadband and dial-up connections.","In another aspect, firmware and software drivers are provided that control the operations of a dual-band modem. The firmware and software drivers implement an auto-sense procedure for detecting when either of a dial-up or broadband connection is available and when to switch between the two types of connections.","In another aspect, a connectivity utility allows a user to interact with a modem that combines both broadband and dial-up connectivity in a single device. The connectivity utility receives various event notifications from the modem and provides the user with the ability to receive off or on-line help, current modem or connection status, the status of an order for service, control of modem parameters, billing information, and other features.","These and other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description, which makes references to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","102","104","102","100","102","106","108"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIGS. 5 and 6"],"b":["200","202","204","206","208","218","218","220","200","220","208","210","212","210","216","212","214","216","222"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3(","FIG. 2","FIG. 3(","FIG. 3(","FIG. 3("],"i":["a","b","c","d"]},"The dual-functionality of a dual-band modem can be controlled by the use of firmware and drivers. A driver is a term used for software that allows an operating system on a client computer, such as Microsoft Windows, to communicate with a device connected to the computer, such as a modem, graphics card, network adaptor, or other peripheral. Firmware generally refers to software instructions that are permanently or semi-permanently written to a hardware component of one of the devices that are in communication with the drivers installed into an operating system.","In one embodiment, a dual-band modem is controlled by a procedure implemented in firmware and drivers to control a line driver that switches back and forth between a DSL connection and dial-up connection.  shows a flowchart of a possible flowchart for controlling a dual-band modem. In block  a user of a dual-band modem requests a connection to another device. Decision block  determines if a DSL connection is available. If no DSL connection is available, decision  is processed to determine if a dial-up connection is available. If a DSL connection is available, block  is processed to establish and maintain a DSL connection. Decision block  determines if the DSL connection is interrupted. If no interruption exists, block  is processed to re-establish or maintain the DSL connection. If an interruption exists, decision block  is processed to determine if a dial-up connection is available. If no dial-up connection is available, block  is processed to conclude that no connection is available. If a dial-up connection is available, block  is processed to establish and maintain a dial-up connection. Decision block  determines if a DSL connection is now available. If a DSL connection is now available, block  is processed to establish and maintain a DSL connection. If no DSL connection is available, decision block  is processed to determine if the dial-up connection is interrupted. If no interruption exists, block  is processed to re-establish or maintain the dial-up connection. If an interruption exists, block  is processed to conclude that no connection is available.","One of skill in the art will recognize that the procedure shown in  may be modified without altering the purpose of the procedure. For instance, decision block  and  could be processed in reverse order. Additionally, the procedure could be implemented without checking for a connection before establishing the connection. Rather, the procedure could simply attempt to initiate a DSL connection, and upon failing, attempt a dial-up connection.","The procedure can determine when to check for the availability of a connection in a number of ways. For instance in one embodiment, decision block , which checks for a DSL connection while maintaining a dial-up connection, can be processed at regular time intervals. The power to the chipset, or portion of the chipset, responsible for establishing a DSL connection can either be powered off or left on during the intervals when the availability of a DSL connection is not being checked. Alternatively, the chipset, or portion of a chipset, responsible for establishing a DSL connection can be constantly on and constantly checking for availability of a connection.","In other embodiments, an indication can be sent from an outside source, such as the connectivity utility, a user, or a Service Provider server, to indicate that the availability of a connection should be checked or a connection is currently available. For instance, the user could specify when they want to check for a DSL connection when a dial-up connection is being maintained. Alternatively, an indication could be sent from a DSLAM or a Service Provider server when a DSL connection is available.","Also, when the procedure checks for the availability of a connection can be decided upon and specified by the user, or can be dependant on the service being in a pre-activation or post-activation state. In one embodiment, the user can specify whether the availability of a DSL connection is checked for at timed intervals, constantly, or when an indication is received that the DSL connection is available. Alternatively, the availability of a DSL connection can be checked with one method, such as at one day intervals, when the user is in a pre-activation state, i.e. waiting to have their phone line enabled for DSL by a phone company immediately after a service order. Subsequently, the availability of a DSL connection can be checked with second method, such as when an indication is received, when the user is in a post-activation state, i.e. their phone line has already been enabled for DSL by a phone company.","In addition, how the procedure determines if a connection is available can vary. In one embodiment, the availability of a connection can be tested by line sense. In other words, a DSL connection can be detected by checking for a carrier tone and a dial-up connection can be detected by checking for a dial tone. Alternatively, the connections can be checked by sending and receiving a test message or by simply attempting to establish a connection.","Numerous features of a dual-band modem can be exposed by a connectivity utility.  is a block diagram of communication between a dual-band modem  and connectivity utility . This communication can be implemented in a number of different ways. In one embodiment, the dual-band modem  is controlled by firmware, the firmware being in communication with software drivers, the software drivers communicating with an operating system, the operating system being in communication with an application programming interface (API), and the API being in communication with connectivity utility . However, those of skill in the art will appreciate that there are a number of well known methods in the art for establishing such communication.","In one embodiment, the dual-band modem  contains firmware  for controlling the operations of dual band modem . Connectivity utility  sends messages to control certain aspects of dual-band modem  through firmware , and firmware  also notifies connectivity utility  of various events that occur with respect to dual-band modem . For example, various information that might be exchanged between dual-band modem  and connectivity utility  is listed in .","In one embodiment, connection information can be exchanged between the dual-band modem  and connectivity utility  and displayed or recorded for the user by connectivity utility . This information may consist of whether a connection is established, which type of connection is established (i.e. DSL or dial-up), speed of connection, length of time the connection has been established, etc. Parameter control can also be communicated between the dual-band modem  and connectivity utility . Connectivity utility  can display a series of options for controlling dual-band modem  for the user to select in a graphical user interface (GUI) and then notifies dual-band modem  of the selected options. These options can include whether or not to notify the user before switching connection types, whether or not to notify the user before disconnecting a connection, whether to automatically connect when an application prompts for a connection, whether or not to allow the user to select dial-up access numbers or to have them selected automatically, etc.","Additionally, events from the dual-band modem  can be logged by the connectivity utility  for debugging purposes. For instance, the events can be as high level as a time and cause of a disconnection or connection, or lower level events such as a sequence or occurrence of individual modem commands. Once logged, these events can be used by connectivity utility , a user, application, or other entity to aid in fixing bugs in firmware, drivers, etc. For instance, the events can be recorded in a file and transmitted back to the developer of the dual-band modem  and connectivity utility  such that bugs in their operation can be detected and corrected. Alternatively, the events can be recorded by connectivity utility  and made available to a help technician when contacted by the user for assistance in fixing a problem with the operation of dual-band modem .","Error recovery information can also be sent or received between dual-band modem  and connectivity utility . For instance, if a connection is lost while the user is viewing a particular web page or running a particular application, connectivity utility  can save information related to the application or web page such that the connectivity utility  can prompt the user upon reconnection if they desire to reconnect to the web page previously being viewed or restart the application previously being used. If so, connectivity utility  can restart the program or start a browser application to reconnect to the web page.","Likewise, the dual-band modem  can communicate auto-diagnosis information to connectivity utility  for use with an auto-diagnosis feature wherein problems with dual-band modem  can be diagnosed and corrected automatically by connectivity utility  or another application without intervention of the user. For instance, connectivity utility  can alter predefined parameters to fix a fairly common problem with dual-band modem  in response to receiving auto-diagnostic information indicative of the problem. Alternatively, an application can be provided on a server computer to implement the same functionality. In another embodiment, the auto-diagnostic information can be recorded by connectivity utility  and made available to a help technician when contacted by the user for assistance in fixing a problem.","Connectivity utility  also exposes numerous feature of a dual-band modem that utilize a Service Provider server.  is a block diagram of communication between a Service Provider server  and connectivity utility . This communication can be implemented in a number of different ways. In one embodiment, the Service Provider server  is in communication with connectivity utility  through a DSL or dial-up connection as shown in . However, those of skill in the art will appreciate that there are a number of well known methods in the art for establishing such communication.","In one embodiment, the Service Provider server  and connectivity utility  are in communication to exchange various types of information.  lists possible examples of information that might be exchanged between Service Provider server  and connectivity utility .","One possible type of information that can be exchanged between Service Provider server  and connectivity utility  is service status information. For instance, the service status information can comprise when a phone company is scheduled to enable a user's line for a DSL connection, when the DSL connection is scheduled to be available, if a dual-band modem has been dispatched to the user and when it should arrive, conditions of service such as how many hours of connection time the user has available, when DSL service will be available after an interruption in service, a hyperlink to a Uniform Address Locator (URL) where information about the Service Provider is given, etc.","Billing information may also be exchanged between Service Provider server  and connectivity utility . For example, billing information can comprise how much the user is being charged for service, what the user currently owes, a hyperlink to a URL where instructions can be found on how to make payment, a hyperlink to a URL where payment can be made electronically, if a payment has been received, etc.","Connectivity utility  can be responsible for displaying both the service status information and billing information to the user or store it for subsequent use. Additionally, connectivity utility  can either display the information itself, or call upon another application to do so. For instance, the billing information can be viewed from within the connectivity utility , or the connectivity utility  can direct another application, such as Microsoft\u00ae Money, to edit or display the billing information.","The connectivity utility  can also allow the user to send and receive help desk information. In one embodiment, the user can use a GUI provided by connectivity utility  to send an indication that the user is having difficulty with their service or dual-band modem to the Service Provider server. In response, the user can be contacted by the Service Provider via telephone, email, text messaging, etc. in an attempt to solve the problem. Additionally, the user could use the GUI provided by the connectivity utility  to send an email or text message to the Service Provider describing the problems encountered. Connectivity utility  can also provide the user with information for attempting to solve the problem without contacting the Service Provider. Such information might include Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), a searchable database, a hyperlink to a URL with help desk information, etc.","The Service Provider server  can also communicate with connectivity utility  to remotely adjust parameters pertaining to a dual-band modem or service. These parameters can be adjusted in order to set up a newly installed dual-band modem for service, to increase performance, to solve problems encountered by the user or to simply alter functionality such as whether the user needs to approve a change in connection type, whether the user must select access parameters (such as COM ports, baud rate, access numbers, etc.), or whether they should be set by connectivity utility  or the Service Provider.","Connectivity utility  can also communicate with a Service Provider server  to assist in the auto-diagnosis and debugging features described in reference to . Connectivity utility  can transmit the auto-diagnosis or debugging information provided by the dual-band modem to a Service Provider server such that the Service Provider, or an application provided by the Service Provider, can send instructions back to connectivity utility  to display to the user for solving a problem, or the instructions can direct connectivity utility  to alter parameters pertaining to the dual-band modem to solve the problem. In another embodiment, the auto-diagnostic or debugging information transmitted is made available to a help technician for assistance in fixing a problem with the operation of a dual-band modem or service. Connectivity utility  can also provide the Service Provider server with pertinent information, such as when a service is unavailable, how many hours the user spends online, if the activation of a line is later than an expected date or time, statistics related to the activity of the user on the internet, etc.","The features of a dual-band modem allow a Service Provider to offer a customer who desires a high-speed internet connection immediate access to the internet. It also allows the Service Provider to immediately send out a dual-band modem to be installed and used as soon as the user receives it. For instance,  is a flow chart showing one embodiment of a business method for providing DSL service to a customer.","At block , a customer contacts a Service Provider and requests DSL service for their home or business. At this point, the Service Provider can immediately send out a dual-band modem and connectivity utility in a single package as shown in block  and instruct a phone company to begin the necessary steps to enable a DSL line for the customer in block . Alternatively, the modem can be packaged separately and the customer can be instructed to download a connectivity utility once a connection is established. Once the customer receives a dual-band modem, block  shows that the customer can utilize the dial-up functionality of the dual-band modem until the phone company enables the line for DSL. The connectivity utility keeps the customer apprised of their order status and when they can expect DSL service to be available. Once the line is enabled for DSL as shown in block , the customer can then begin using the DSL functionality of the dual-band modem.","Thus, a dual-band modem and service eliminates the need for the Service Provider to either send a modem to a customer and the customer having to wait until the line is enabled for DSL to connect to the internet, or the Service Provider having to delay sending the modem until the line is enabled for DSL. Instead, the Service Provider can immediately send a dual-band modem when the customer requests service and the customer can make use of the modem immediately upon receiving it. Additionally, a connectivity utility can be sent concurrently, or downloaded, with the modem to keep the customer apprised of the status of their order and when they can expect DSL service to be enabled.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["820","821","822","823","821","824","825","826","820","824","820","827","828","829","830","831","827","828","830","825","832","833","834","820"]},"A number of program modules may be stored in the drives and RAM , including an operating system , one or more application programs , other program modules , and program data . A user may enter commands and information into the personal computer  through a keyboard  and pointing device, such as a mouse . Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a serial port interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).
