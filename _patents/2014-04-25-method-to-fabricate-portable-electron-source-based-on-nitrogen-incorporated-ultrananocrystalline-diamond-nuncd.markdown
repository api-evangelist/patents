title: Method to fabricate portable electron source based on nitrogen incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD)
abstract: A source cold cathode field emission array (FEA) source based on ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (UNCD) field emitters. This system was constructed as an alternative for detection of obscured objects and material. Depending on the geometry of the given situation a flat-panel source can be used in tomography, radiography, or tomosynthesis. Furthermore, the unit can be used as a portable electron or X-ray scanner or an integral part of an existing detection system. UNCD field emitters show great field emission output and can be deposited over large areas as the case with carbon nanotube “forest” (CNT) cathodes. Furthermore, UNCDs have better mechanical and thermal properties as compared to CNT tips which further extend the lifetime of UNCD based FEA.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The United States Government claims certain rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 between the U.S. Department of Energy and UChicago Argonne, LLC as operator of Argonne National Laboratories and also pursuant to Grant No. N6601-12-1-4237 from DARPA.","X-ray tube technologies have not changed drastically since 1895, with two general common design features: thermionic electron emission and a single focal spot design. These characteristics make heat dissipation in the X-ray target on important operational problem. In addition, X-rays generated from a single focal point yield a widely diverging X-ray coaxially shaped beam, leading to geometric distortion of the medical anatomy or internal 3D structures of imaged objects due to magnification.","An improved X-ray source design provides a method and article of manufacture, which was developed that uses multiple electron sources, and is distributed in a 2D array instead of just a single focal spot. Also, the method and article of manufacture replaces thermionic electron emission with electron field emission. The use of field emission has not gained much attention in terms of X-ray tube technology in the recent past. The biggest hurdle has been the fabrication of a stable field emission source of electrons, and the microfabrication techniques required did not exist until the last several decades. The benefits of field emission are appealing when compared to thermionic emission such as lower power consumption and higher brightness. Additionally, there are several different designs and materials used in cold cathodes, ranging from the original Spindt type emitters with molybdenum pyramidal tips to gated tips. Furthermore, cold cathodes made from carbon based materials like carbon nanotubes (\u201cCNT\u201d) and diamond have been heavily researched. However, field emission properties from ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (\u201cUNCD\u201d) are very good even with planar geometry without the need for coating them onto high aspect ratio tips, which simplifies the microfabrication process. These and other features of the invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the figures described below.","In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a fabrication procedure is described for providing an article of manufacture of a 3\u00d73 flat nitrogen-incorporated ultra-nanocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) field emitter array (\u201cFEA\u201d). In the first part a preferred method of preparation is shown in  for a cathode-extraction grid . As will be discussed hereinafter, the cathode was developed using a microfabrication process that allows for individually addressable N-UNCD arrays. Electron field emission was demonstrated by applying a bias between a cathode and the monolithically integrated electron extraction grid, and these electron emission characterization results and device structure are detailed hereinafter. The X-ray system shown in  further includes a collimator , an X-ray target , a focusing electrode , a spacer , a lead shield  and with further components detailed hereinafter.","The FEA component was most preferably carried out by monolithical fabrication using microfabrication techniques; and the process flow schematic is shown in . In the first steps of a preferred fabrication process shown in , p-type (100) Si wafers  were coated with a low stress 1 micrometer SiNlayer  preferably deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). This SiNlayer  serves as an electrical insulation layer between the base wafer  and the electron emitters. Next, a thin tungsten layer  (about 250 nm thick) is sputtered onto the SiNlayer  for electrical connection to an N-UNCD emitters  (see ). Tungsten for the layer  was selected for its ability to withstand the high temperatures (850\u00b0 C.) required for the N-UNCD growth process; and it also serves as a good seed layer for the N-UNCD growth. Other like performing refractory metals can also be used. The metal deposition was preferably done using a magnetron sputtering system (such as a system from AJA International Inc.) or by using a Lesker PVD-250 electron-beam evaporator. The N-UNCD growth was done in a microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) system (such as, a 915 MHz large-area MPCVD system\u2014Lambda Technologies Inc.). To obtain a hard mask for pattern transfer in N-UNCD, a 50 nm titanium layer  was deposited by e-beam evaporation after UV lithography. For patterning, a 2.7-\u03bcm-thick S1827 for example, (Shipley) photoresist layer  was spin coated at 3000 rpm, baked at 115\u00b0 C. for 1 min and exposed using a Karl Suss MA-6 mask aligner. The pattern was developed in 351 Microposit developer diluted 1:3 in deionized water (DIW) for 20 s. Lift-off of the Ti layer  was done at 100\u00b0 C. in standard 1165 remover for 3 hours, following a 90 second ultrasonic bath. The N-UNCD layer  was etched by a conventional ICP-RIE PlasmaLab 100, using oxygen 50 sccm, a chamber pressure 10 mTorr, at 1200 W ICP power and 10 W RF power (etching rate\u201450 nm min). After etching the N-UNCD layer , a solution of HF and HO, with a ratio of 1:9 was used to remove the Ti hard mask layer .","The next steps shown in  were to create the tungsten electrical wiring circuit suitable for individually addressable pixels. This step was completed by UV optical lithography, using a maN-415 (Microchem) negative photoresist. This photoresist layer  was spin-coated at 3000 rpm and baked at 100\u00b0 C. for 90 s, a 1.5-\u03bcm thick layer  was obtained. The tungsten layer  was etched by SFRIE (CS 1700 March) at 20 sccm, 150 mTorr chamber pressure, 250 W RF power, and with an etching rate of about 80 nm min. After etching, the photoresist was removed with acetone. A sample of the tungsten wiring circuit  is shown in . Once the tungsten wiring scheme was finished, the base cathode fabrication was completed.","The next step was to make the electron extraction grid as shown by . In order to integrate the electron extraction grid, a standoff and electrically insulating layer was needed; due to its high dielectric strength a SiOlayer  was selected for this step. For a thickness greater than 1 \u03bcm, the SiOlayer  was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at a low temperature of 100\u00b0 C. (ICP CVD Oxford). During fabrication, a 5 \u03bcm limit was established due to a phenomenon in which deposited SiOon the chamber walls of the deposition system started to flake off and contaminate the wafer surface.","A copper layer was chosen as a preferred form of an electron extraction grid  material due to its electrical and thermal properties. However, in a most preferred embodiment, in order to improve the copper adhesion characteristics, the thin 50 nm tungsten layer  (see ) was first sputtered onto the SiOsurface layer . To control the location of the copper electroplating process, a third UV optical lithography was required. In this step, a S-1818 positive photoresist (not shown) was used, allowing for a 1.8-\u03bcm thick form of the copper grid  with small electron extraction openings  as shown in . The copper electroplating was performed using a copper sulfate plating process from Lea Ronal, Inc. An acetone bath was used to strip the photoresist from the surface. The left-over tungsten base plate layer  where the grid holes were left from the removal of the photoresist was removed by SFRIE. Finally, the SiO, layer (not shown) under the copper grid  was etched to expose the N-UNCD emitters. A buffered oxide etchant (BOE) was used to etch the SiOlayer and complete the fabrication process of the N-UNCD field emission arrays  shown in .","The electron emission characteristics of the micro fabricated field emitter arrays  (FEA) were evaluated by measuring their current-voltage behavior. For the experiments, the sample consisting of four 3\u00d73 FEA  was placed on an electrically insulated Teflon table , as shown in . The N-UNCD pixels and extraction grid contacts  were connected to AWG 20 (0.032 in) Oxygen-free (OFHC) copper wires  using silver epoxy  as shown, see . Before the I-V measurements were performed, the electrical contacts of the FEA  were tested, and some pixels were found to be short-circuited. This short-circuit problem is related to copper delamination issues and subsequent harsh undercut to the SiOwhere the copper layer is missing, leaving the underlying material exposed. After the electrical connections were made to the working pixels, a turbo pump was used to evacuate the vacuum chamber. The field emission experiments were conducted at a pressure below 4\u00d710 Torr.","For the current-voltage measurements the grid  was electrically grounded; and the voltage fed to the N-UNCD cathode was varied from 0 V to \u2212140 V. The emission currents, I, at the grid  was recorded as the cathode voltage was varied. In this experiment two grids were tested and compared: (1) the electroplated copper grid  (EP Grid) shown in , which was monolithically fabricated according to the procedure presented hereinbefore, and (2) a 1000 mesh TEM copper grid (TEM Grid) which was attached to the copper electroplated layer using silver epoxy. The distance between the N-UNCDs and the EP grid is 5 \u03bcm, while the distance between the N-UNCDs and the TEM Grid is 7 \u03bcm. These values of the cathode-grid gaps were used to estimate the externally applied electric field (E) in Eq. 1. The difference in the gap sizes between the cathode and the grid configurations (1) and (2) is due to the fact that the TEM grid was attached on top of the 2 micrometer copper electroplated layer, while the EP grid is part of the copper electroplated layer itself.","The measured I-V behavior of the two cathode-grid configurations tested is presented in . As shown, the emission current per pixel measured at the grid  was approximately of the order of 2 \u03bcA. Based on the I-V measurements, the N-UNCDs field emission characteristics were evaluated according to the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) equation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"-","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mrow":{"mi":"AFN","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["\u03b2","E"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"A"},{"mi":["\u03d5","N","UNCD"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mtext":"-"}]}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"exp","mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mo":"-","mi":"\u03b2"},{"mi":"FNv","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"y"}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mi":"\u03d5","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mn":["3","2"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"\/"}},{"mi":["N","UNCD"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"-"}}]}},{"mi":["\u03b2","E"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"In Eq. 1, I is the emission current (\u03bcA), E is the electric field applied between the cathode and extraction grid (V\/\u03bcm), \u03b2 is the geometrical field enhancement factor of the emitting surface, \u00d8N-UNCD is the work function of the emitting material (eV), Ais equal to 1.5415 (\u03bcA eV V), Bis equal to 6.830\u00d710(eVV \u03bcm) and A (\u03bcm) is the emitting area.
