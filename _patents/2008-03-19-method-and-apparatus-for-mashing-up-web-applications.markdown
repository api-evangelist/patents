{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is based upon and claims priority from a prior Chinese Patent Application No. 200710088391.7, filed on Mar. 19, 2007, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to the field of information technology, and more particularly, to web-based application aggregation technology.","With the vigorous growth of World Wide Web, more and more services are provided to users via web applications. The mashing up among different web applications in a simple and efficient way in order to form new web applications is becoming an increasingly pressing need.","Currently, the major approach of mashing up web applications is performed by means of application programming interfaces (API). Specifically, the owner of a web application needs to expose the relevant API in order to let the web application be mashed up by other users.","For example, with the API of Google map, a user can integrate customized data, e.g. weather forecast, on top of Google map.","However, owners of many web applications do not explicitly define and expose relevant APIs for reasons, such as costs, difficulty in transforming an existing application system and the like.","Therefore, the aforesaid solution of mashing up web applications using the APIs of web applications has limitation. That is, if the owner of a web application does not expose the relevant API, then users cannot use the web application for mashing up.","To sum up, there is a need to propose a solution of mashing up web applications without depending on the APIs of web applications, so as to increase the flexibility and the applicability of mashing up web applications.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for mashing up web applications, which can mash up at least two web applications without depending on the API of any one of the web applications.","To this end, the present invention proposes a method for mashing up web applications, comprising the steps of: obtaining at least two document object models (DOM) corresponding to at least two web applications respectively; merging nodes of said at least two document object models to obtain a new document object model; connecting, on said new document object model, the nodes belonging respectively to said at least two document object models; and obtaining a new web application from said new document object model after connection.","The present invention further proposes an apparatus for mashing up web applications, comprising: a parser for obtaining at least two document object models (DOM) corresponding to at least two web applications respectively; a merger for merging nodes of said at least two document object models to obtain a new document object model; a connector for connecting, on said new document object model, the nodes belonging respectively to said at least two document object models; and a creator for obtaining a new web application from said new document object model after connection.","The present invention still further proposes a computer program product containing program instructions for implementing the method described above.","Compared with the existing solutions for mashing up web applications, the present invention uses DOMs of web applications to mash up, other than invoking APIs of web applications directly. In other words, mashing up web applications can be implemented without the support of APIs in the present invention. As a result, the flexibility and adaptability of mashing up is improved dramatically, as DOMs of web applications can be easily obtained.","Like reference numerals designate the same, similar, or corresponding features or functions throughout the drawings.","The fundamental idea of the present invention is to use document object models (DOM) of at least two selected web applications to mash up these web applications, so as to obtain a new web application conveniently. According to an embodiment of the present invention, DOMs of at least two selected web applications are obtained first. Nodes of DOMs of these web applications are then merged together to obtain a new DOM. Next, nodes belonging respectively to DOMs of these web applications are connected on the new DOM. A new web application is obtained from the new DOM after connection.","Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in conjunction with a concrete embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","110","120","130","140","150","110","120","130","140","110","150","112","120","150","122","130","150","132","140","150","142","112","122","132","142","150","150","150"]},"Of course, those skilled in the art should understand that other clients and\/or servers may be connected on network . Moreover, in order to differentiate one another, clients and servers may have identifiers capable of identifying them uniquely, such as IP addresses and universal resource locators (URL).","In this embodiment of the present invention, a web application for applying for a job is running on server . When the web application for applying for a job on server  is accessed using a browser, such as IE, Firefox and the like, on server\/client  or client , a page as depicted in  will be displayed on the browser. As depicted in , a user can apply for a job on this page, for example, input name, address and other information into the input box about name and address, make selection in the checkbox about job skills, and fill in the input box about self description. The user can submit his\/her inputs\/selection to server  by clicking a button (not depicted).","A web application for search (similar to Google search application) is running on server . When the web application for search on server  is accessed using a browser, such as IE, Firebox and the like, on server\/client  or client , a page that can result in the page as depicted in  will be displayed on the browser. As depicted in , after a user inputs desired search content \u201cfoo\u201d into the input box and then clicks a button to submit the content for searching, \u201cNone\u201d result is obtained. The user can submit his\/her desired search content to server  by clicking a button ( schematically depicts a button shown as \u201csearch the web for \u201cfoo\u201d\u201d).","As described below, server\/client  serves as a client in some cases and serves as a server in other cases.","In this embodiment of the present invention, selected web applications are mashed up in server\/client . When mashing up web applications, server\/client  serves as a client.","Moreover, a new web application obtained from mashing up is running on server\/client , at which point server\/client  serves as a server.","In this embodiment of the present invention, it is intended to obtain such a web application: when client  accesses the web application obtained from mashing up on server\/client  using a browser, such as IE, Firefox and the like, a page that can result in a page as depicted in  will be displayed on a browser.","As depicted in , when a user inputs name, address and other information (Eric) into the input box about name and address on the left, results from searching the input information (Eric) will be displayed on the right. That is to say, the web application obtained from mashing up combines and connects the web application on server  and the web application on server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},"First, the web application for applying for a job on server  and the web application for search on server  are accessed via their respective URLs, so as to obtain two corresponding web pages (step ).","Then, the two obtained web pages are parsed into DOMs (step ).","For example, the web pages may be parsed by means of the following JavaScript codes, so as to obtain corresponding DOMs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"var widget = document.createElement(\u201cdiv\u201d);"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"dojo.io.bind({"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"url: URL,"]},{"entry":[{},"mimetype: \u201ctext\/plain\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"load: function(type, text, e) {"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"widget.innerHTML = text;"]},{"entry":[{},"var parser = new dojo.xml.Parse( );"]},{"entry":[{},"var dom= parser.parseElement(widget, null, true);"]},{"entry":[{},"}\/\/load"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"});\/\/bind"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"For another example, the DOM of a web page may be obtained using the DOM Inspector tool in the Firebox browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 2B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4B"]},"Returning to , desired nodes are found by searching the DOMs depicted in  in step .","In this embodiment of the present invention, all input nodes of the DOMs can be found by means of such a JavaScript function as document.getElementsByTags(\u201cinput\u201d).","In step , a new DOM is formed by merging desired nodes of respective DOMS, which are obtained from searching.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIGS. 4A","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":"4"},"Those skilled in the art should understand that nodes of respective DOMs may be merged in various ways to form a new DOM.

In other words, a new DOM may be formed by merging all nodes of the DOMs depicted in  without performing a search.","In step , corresponding nodes that belong to different DOMs (e.g. the two DOMs depicted in ) are connected on the new DOM. Through connection, new function can be realized on the basis of respective source web applications.","A conventional connection approach is an intrusive approach, i.e. modifying codes of original web applications, adding new codes to some triggering points and thereby achieving the connection between different web applications.","Different from the conventional connection approach, connection is achieved by a non-intrusive monitoring mechanism in this embodiment of the present invention.","Under this mechanism, a global monitor is initialized first. This monitor can monitor not only conventional user events, such as a click of a node (e.g. button node) of the DOM and movement of the mouse, but also triggering of any function.
