The Government may have certain rights in the invention under Office of Naval Research Grant No. N000140410489 and NSF IGERT Program Grant No. DGE-0221664.","The present invention is generally related to the field of nanotechnology. The present invention is also related to the field of semiconductor fabrication processes, in particular the fabrication of electrodes and devices integrating nanoscale electrodes. The present invention also pertains to processes for preparing nanometer scale device features. The present invention also pertains to a variety of electronic, photonic, semiconductor and quantum effect devices.","The last few decades have witnessed myriad breakthroughs in studies on single molecules, nanometer-scale structures and quantum phenomena in general. Exciting results continue to emerge at a rapid rate and proposed applications for them are quick to follow. In order to realize these applications and pursue research at similar and even smaller scales, reliable methods are needed to electronically connect atoms, molecules, nanostructures and other components at the nanoscale. In this regard, two or more electrical contacts separated by a nanometer scale distance constitute a \u201cnanogap\u201d.","Charge transport measurements using nanogaps have yielded much of what is currently known about the electrical properties of objects small enough to have their properties dominated by quantum mechanics. Scanning probes have also been used to study electric properties of single crystals, but their ability to probe the lateral charge dynamics between several neighboring nano-structures is seriously limited and their potential for integration into any scalable production is unlikely.","Functional nano-electronic devices based on nanogaps have been demonstrated. For instance, transistors have been made from a single nanocrystal, a single strand of DNA, a single Cmolecule, a single Co ion, and other single molecules containing spin impurities. However, all of the currently available techniques used to fabricate nanogaps require a lengthy and complicated fabrication process, suffer from low yield and poor control of the gap size, as well as its location on a substrate. Most of them require the skill and finesse that a limited number of people possess and many demand uncommon facilities. In most cases, the fabrication of each gap requires arduous tuning of the instrumentation parameters while simultaneously measuring the progress of the gap formation. As a consequence, automated and scalable production is not likely to be achieved with these methods. Furthermore, the structural details and content of nanogaps produced by these techniques are either difficult or impossible to determine directly.","Efforts towards developing a reliable nanogap fabrication technique have been active for over a decade. The first reported method for achieving small gaps employed angled evaporation to fabricate two closely spaced electrodes on SiO(Klein, D. L.; McEuen, P. L.; Katari, J. E. B.; Roth, R.; Alivisatos, A. P. 1996, 68, 2574). Dekker and Bezryadin were able to fabricate gaps under 5 nm by sputtering metal onto carbon electrodes, which had been deposited near each other with an electron beam (Bezryadin, A; Dekker, C. J. 1997, 15(4), 793). An analogous method developed by Marcus et al. involved first fabricating nearby electrodes and then electroplating additional metal to reduce the gap size (Morpurgo, A. F.; Marcus, C. M.; Robinson, D. B. App. Phys. Lett. 1999, 74, 2084). Tour et al. demonstrated a mechanical \u201cbreakjunction\u201d technique based on first fabricating a thin continuous metal wire and forcing it to break open by introducing mechanical strain (Reed, M. A.; Zhou, C.; Muller, C. J.; Burgin, T. P.; Tour, J. M. 1997, 278, 252). The mechanical breakjunction technique was modified by Park et al. by triggering the gap formation with a sudden voltage application across the wire (Park, H.; Lim, A. K. L.; Alivisatos, A. P.; Park, J.; McEuen, P. L. 1999, 75, 301). Both of these breakjunction methods require liquid helium temperatures (4 K). Gaps fabricated using such methods are usually accompanied by randomly deposited small metallic particle debris that can distort measured signals. Park's \u201celectromigration\u201d technique was improved by developing a method for gradual gap formation with a sequence of slow voltage ramps, which allows the fabrication to be done at room temperature (Strachen, D. R.; Smith, D. E.; Johnston, D. E.; Park, T.-H; Therien, M. J.; Bonnell, D. A.; Johnson, A. T. 2005, 86, 043109). Many other methods for achieving nanogaps exist, though they are of similar or even greater complexity (see, for example, Chen, J.; Reed, M. A.; Rawlett, A. M.; Tour, J. M. 1999, 286, 1550; Krahne, R.; Yacoby, A.; Shtrikman, H.; Bar-Joseph, I; Dadosh, T.; Sperling, J. 2002, 81(4), 730; and Sun, L. F.; Chin, S. N.; Msarx, E.; Curtis, K. S.; Greenham, N. C.; Ford, C. J. B. 2005, 16, 631). Researchers have demonstrated a simpler technique of directly writing small gaps with EBL onto a SiOsubstrate by underexposing and overdeveloping the resist while carefully monitoring the temperature and development time (Liu, K.; Avouris, Ph.; Bucchignano, J.; Martel, R.; Sun, S. 2002, 80, 865). The final gap geometry is highly sensitive to these parameter values. In that case, a second writing process, requiring alignment of the incomplete device, is necessary to connect the electrode gaps to a full circuit.","In addition to the complications involved with the methods mentioned above, nanogaps that are produced are typically inspected with Scanning Electron Microscopy (\u201cSEM\u201d). SEM has a resolution limit roughly between 1 and 10 nm, depending on the microscope, sample properties and imaging conditions. A serious consequence of this is the potential for measuring single electron effects due to an impurity in the gap and mistaking the impurity for the sample being probed. Specifically, \u201cCoulomb Blockade\u201d, a phenomenon attributed to the successful detection of a single nano-scale sample, was recently reported to be frequently detected in electromigrated gaps containing no sample\u2014only debris produced during the gap formation (Sordan, R. Balasubramanian, K.; Burghard, M.; Kern, K. 2005, 87, 013106). Accordingly, rapid and reliable methods for making nanogaps and other structures on the nanometer-scale are presently needed.","Transmission Electron Microscopy (\u201cTEM\u201d) offers the highest resolution imaging available (less than 1 Angstrom or 0.1 nanometer). Two methods for fabricating nanogaps on TEM-compatible thin films have been reported previously, however neither solve the problem in a practical manner. The first demonstrated example uses shadow evaporation, although this method suffers from an extremely low yield (Philipp, G.; Weimann, T.; Hinze, P.; Burghard, M.; Weis, 1999, 46, 157). A second method breaks a thin wire on a SiNsupport membrane by exposing it to a 300 kV electron beam (Zandbergen, H. W.; van Duuren, R. J. H. A.; Alkemade, P. F. A.; Lientschnig, G.; Vasquez, Dekker C.; Tichelaar, F. D. 2005, 5, 549). The high energy beam drives thermal diffusion of atoms away from the targeted region until a gap suddenly opens. Although high quality TEM images are obtained, the initial gap size is difficult to control and the gaps continued to grow over time. Because this is a breakjunction technique, it is necessary to remove the substrate from underneath the gap region to avoid contamination from metallic debris. Furthermore, this technique requires deft use of a dual beam Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), which is an extremely rare system. A technique called \u201cOn-Wire Lithography\u201d (OWL) makes use of standard nanowire growth technology by momentarily stopping the growth of a gold nanowire, growing a thin section of another material and then resuming the growth of the gold nanowire Qin, L.; Park, S.; Huang, L.; Mirkin, C. A. 2005, 309, 113. The continuous wire is then exposed to a wet etch that removes the non-gold material and consequently defines a gap. A large number of the final structures are then deposited on a substrate containing many pre-patterned electrodes and the experimenter is forced to hope for one of the gapped-wires to randomly span two of the electrodes. The low yield of successful integration of the gaps into a full circuit imposes a severe limitation to OWL as a viable approach to useful nanogap device production. Accordingly, there is also a present need for rapid production of nanogaps and other structures on the nanometer scale that can easily be inspected using TEM. There is also an urgent need to prepare electronic, photonic and quantum-effect devices that include such nanogaps and other nanoscale structures.","In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods for fabricating a nanogap, comprising imaging an imageable layer surmounting a support membrane;

Suitable support membranes include any of a variety of thin film materials that are typically used in the field of semiconductor and photonic devices. Preferred thin film materials include silicon nitride, low-stress silicon nitride, silicon oxide, and gallium arsenide. Window grids for use in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be suitably used as support membranes, such as those commercially available from SPI Supplies, Inc., West Chester, Pa. (http:\/\/www.2spi.comicatalog\/instruments\/silicon-nitride.shtml). A suitable method of forming a variety of support membranes is generally described in -. Support membranes can be provided using CVD or any suitable thin film deposition processes known in the art.

Res. Soc. Publisher: Mater. Res. Soc, Pittsburgh, Pa., USA. In one embodiment, suitable acrylic polymer photoresists comprise a polymer having a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 500 g\/mol to about 50,000 g\/mol.","The imageable layer can be surmounted to the support membrane using a suitable coating step to coat the imageable layer to one or both sides of the support membrane. Suitable coating processes include spin coating, dip coating, ink jet coating, doctor blade coating, microgravure coating, vapor deposition, drop casting, and the like, or any combination thereof. Among these, the preferred coating steps include spin coating, vapor deposition, or any combination thereof. The support membrane can be surmounted by the imageable layer on one or both sides of the support membrane. Typically, the support membrane is unsupported on one side and the imageable layer is surmounted on the unsupported side of the support membrane. After the imageable layer is coated and dried, the deposited imageable layer typically has a thickness in the range of from about 10 nm to about 10,000 nm. Further details about coating and processing photoresists can be found in the references as described herein and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, for example, http:\/\/mail.mems-exchange. org\/pipermail\/mems-talk\/1997-September\/001056.html.","Photoresists are typically imageable layers that are formulated using volatile solvents to control viscosity profile, and hence film thickness. Accordingly, one or more volatile components are typically removed from the imageable layer prior to imaging. In addition to the solvent, photoresists can also contain a variety of small, volatile molecules that are desirably removed prior to imaging. Typical volatile components include solvents, diluents, oligomers, polymer fragments, or any combination thereof.","The imageable layer is imaged using a suitable imaging source to give rise to one or more desired nanoscale features composed of a portion of the imageable layer surmounting one or both sides of the support membrane. In several embodiments, the step of imaging includes exposing the imageable layer to particles (typically under vacuum) or photons of a sufficient energy to break or form bonds in the imageable layers. Preferably, the step of imaging exposes at least a portion of the imageable layer to electrons with energies sufficient to break covalent bonds in the imageable layer. The imaged portions are typically removed in a subsequent step, such as by washing or developing. Further details about imaging photoresists can be found in \u201cMaterials and processes at the leading edge of photolithography\u201d by G. N.

Other imaging sources includes an atom sources (atom beam lithography) as well as ion sources (focused ion beam lithography). Suitable imaging sources are capable of imaging the imageable layer with a resolution in the range of from about 10 nm to about 100 nm. For example, Focused Ion Beam (FIB) uses a narrow stream of high energy charged atoms. The energies of the ions in the beam can be made sufficient to image the imageable layer and can therefore be used, at least in principle, instead of an electron beam. Further details about atom lithography can be found on the internet at http:\/\/physicsweb.org\/articles\/news\/6\/10\/2\/1, for example by exposing a silicon substrate to a beam of \u201cmetastable\u201d argon atoms. Without being bound by a particular theory of operation, it is believed that metastable atoms exist in a naturally excited state and release their energy when they strike the substrate. A layer of hydrocarbons that resides on the substrate functions as the resist by adhering more strongly to the substrate when energized. To create a pattern in the atom beam, a mask made of laser light can be used. Argon atoms resonant with the light are excited into an even higher state, and fall back down to the ground state almost instantaneously, depriving the resist of energy at the points below the mask. The mask can be made in a variety of ways, with or without light beams.

The exposed imageable layer is readily removed by washing away at least a portion of the exposed imageable layer. The resulting imageable layer that remains on the support membrane after the exposed regions have been removed comprises one or more nanoscale features that are characterized as having a dimension in the range of from about 1 nm to about 100 nm, with various embodiments having dimensions up to about 50 nm, or up to about 40 nm, or up to about 30 nm, or up to about 20 nm, or up to about 15 nm, or up to about 12 nm, or up to about 10 nm, or up to about 8 um or up to about 6 nm, or up to about 4 nm, or up to about 3 nm, or even up to about 2 nm. Typically, this dimension is measured in a direction parallel to the surface of the support membrane, for example, wherein the dimension is the width of the nanoscale feature. Further details concerning imaging and removal of photoresists can be found in G. N. Taylor 1988, cited above., Z. Cui 2003, cited above, and other references cited above.","An optional adhesive layer can be formed on at least one side of the support membrane comprising the nanoscale features. This layer helps to facilitate the bonding of the further material to the support membrane. Adhesive materials include: chromium, titanium, aluminum, platinum, niobium. Adhesive materials are usually: chromium, titanium, and preferably nickel. In some embodiments the thickness of the optional adhesive layer need only be about 1 nm but in other embodiments adhesive layer thicknesses of up to about 100 nm can be used, depending on the ultimate thickness of the feature being fabricated.","One or more layers of one or more further materials surmounted on at least a portion of the nanoscale features, the support membrane, the optional adhesive layer, or any combination thereof, is then formed. Suitable further materials include any type of compositions of matter that are suitably processed using any of a variety of vapor-based and liquid-based chemical processes. Preferred compositions of matter that are suitably used as further materials for surmounting on at least a portion of the nanoscale features can be lifted off the imageable layer in a washing step, and which remain adhered to the support membrane or adhesive layer. Suitable further materials include, in some embodiments, conductive metals, such as gold, silver, platinum, copper, chromium, titanium, aluminum, niobium, or any combination thereof. The further materials, especially metals, can be applied using CVD, MBE, sputtering, or any combination thereof. CVD is preferred. Suitable thicknesses of the further materials for deposition range from a single atomic or molecular layer (using MBE) to arbitrarily thick layers. The further materials are preferably between one and ten nanometers thick. Further details about these methods can be generally found in the references as cited herein.","Any of a variety of semiconductor materials can also be applied on at least a portion of the nanoscale features and the support membrane for providing nanogaps residing between semiconductor structures. For example, suitable semiconductor materials include epitaxially grown II-VI and BIN semiconductor layers. Other suitable semiconductor materials are further described hereinabove. Insulator materials can be deposited on the nanoscale features and support membrane. For example, suitable insulators include silicon nitride, silicon oxide, as well as any of the materials described hereinabove that are suitable for forming support membranes.","At least a portion of the one or more layers of one or more further materials surmounted on at least a portion of the nanoscale features is removed to give rise to one or more nanogaps residing proximate to one or more layers of one or more further materials surmounted on the support membrane, the optional adhesive layer, or any combination thereof. The portion of the further materials that are removed typically adheres to the surface of the remaining imageable layer. Accordingly, the further materials are typically removed by washing away the remaining imageable layer using a suitable solvent. For example, removing the nanoscale features from the support membrane together with the further material adhering to the nanofeature to give rise to the nanogap (i.e. \u201clift off\u201d) can be achieved by dissolving\/removing the imageable layer on top of which the unwanted deposited material (i.e., further material) rests. This can be accomplished by putting the device (which at this point has the further material on it) into a suitable solvent (e.g., acetone) for dissolving the imageable layer and then waiting for the imageable layer to dissolve (e.g., ca. 30 minutes). Consequently, the unwanted further material is removed. Suitable conditions include soaking in a suitable solvent for some time, for example, less than about one hour, less than out four hours, less than about eight hours, less than about 12 hours, or even for 12 or more hours (i.e., overnight). Combinations of two or more solvents, such as methylene chloride and acetone, can also be used. Typical ratios are between 1:1 and 9:1 (methylene chloride:acetone). The temperature of the solvent can be room temperature or above room temperature. It may be more rapid to heat the solvent to a temperature as high as its boiling point. Instead of or in addition to heating, the dissolving liquid can be stirred (e.g., with a stir bar). Sonication can be used, but the membrane may break. However, because it is possible to deposit material onto the back of the membrane (after depositing material onto the lithography side, but before doing the lift off) the membrane may be made to withstand sonication with support from this additional material. In preferred embodiments, the imageable material that gives rise to the formation of the nanogap is typically removed at the same time as the remaining unwanted material is removed. After the main lift off is accomplished, it may be useful to flow additional dissolving liquid, or some other substance such as a high pressure gas, or both, across the surface of the membrane to remove additional unwanted material. After lift off, the resulting nanogap device can be cleaned with a suitable cleaning solvent, such as an alcohol (e.g., isopropyl alcohol), deionized water, or any combination thereof. The resulting nanogap device can also be exposed to oxygen plasma to eliminate residual organic matter from the surface of the device.","At least a portion of the further materials that are removed forms the nanogap, which resides adjacent to further material that adheres directly to, or via an optional adhesive layer, the support membrane. A suitable nanogap is characterized as having a dimension in the range of from about 1 nm to about 100 nm, with various embodiments having dimensions up to about 50 nm, or up to about 40 nm, or up to about 30 nm, or up to about 20 nm, or up to about 15 nm, or up to about 12 nm, or up to about 10 nm, or up to about 8 nm or up to about 6 nm, or up to about 4 nm, or up to about 3 nm, or even up to about 2 nm. Typically, this dimension is measured in a direction parallel to the surface of the support membrane, for example, wherein the dimension is the width of the nanoscale feature.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the methods described hereinabove for fabricating nanogaps can further comprise one or more additional device fabrication steps. The additional device fabrication steps can be performed before, during, or after the one or more nanogaps are formed. These additional steps can be performed on a side of the support membrane comprising the one or more nanogaps, or on a side of the support membrane opposed to the side of the support membrane comprising the one or more nanogaps, or both. Additional types of device fabrication steps can generally be found in Madou, M. J., \u201cFundamentals of Microfabrication: The Science of Miniaturization\u201d (Second Edition), CRC Press, 2002. The principles described in this reference can be suitably practiced by one of ordinary skill in the art, in combination with this disclosure, to make semiconductor devices that include one of more nanogaps.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the methods described hereinabove for fabricating nanogaps can further comprise the step of providing one or more nanostructures within at least a portion of the one or more nanogaps, or within each of the one or more nanogaps. In these embodiments, at least a portion of the one or more nanostructures are deposited into the nanogaps. This can be advantageously used, for example, for depositing semiconducting nanocrystals in the nanogaps for making nanogap field effect devices. In other embodiments, at least a portion of the one or more nanostructures are synthesized within the nanogaps. For example, a carbon nanotube catalytic growth site can be deposited in the nanogap and then a single wall carbon nanotube can be grown from the nanogap. In these embodiments, the one or more nanostructures are electronically or photonically coupled to the support membrane, the optional adhesive layer, the further material, or any combination thereof. This is useful in preparing electronic and photonic devices.","In other embodiments of the present invention, there are also provided methods for creating small nanofeatures in support membranes. These methods include providing a support membrane surmounted by an imageable layer on one or both sides of the support membrane; imaging the imageable layer to give rise to one or more desired nanoscale features composed of a portion of the imageable layer surmounted on one or both sides of the support membrane; and etching a portion of the support membrane residing proximate to the one or more desired nanoscale features to give rise to a support membrane nanofeature composed of a portion of the support membrane. In additional related embodiments, these methods can further include the step of removing the one or more desired nanoscale features composed of a portion of the imageable layer. Useful devices can be made according these methods, such as masks for producing nanogaps as described further herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1012","1002","1004","1014","1006","1008","1014","1010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2008","2010","2006","2002","2004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["3010","3006","3008","3014","3012","3002","3004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["4006","4008","4010","4010","4002","4004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["5006","5004","5002","5008","5010","5012","5014"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["6004","6006","6002","6008","6010","6012"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["7008","7006","7004","7002","7010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["8012","8006","8004","8002","8008","8010"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["9008","9012","9010","9014","9020","9006","9016","9018","9002","9004","9018","9002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 9"],"b":["10012","10022","10012","10018","10016","10004","10014","10016","10004","10002","10012","10006","10012","10010","10008","10020","10016","10018"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["11018","11002","11006","11008","11012","11014","11016","11016","11010","11004"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["12008","12010","12004","12002","12014","12006","12016","12014","12010","12004","12006","12012","12010","12004","12006","12004","12010","12006"]},"One or more nanostructures can be suitably placed in a nanogap using any of a variety of processes known in the art.

In the field of patterning complicated nanoscale structures onto surfaces, a high resolution imaging process, such as electron-beam lithography (\u201cEBL\u201d) is used to achieve high resolution. For example, nanoscale resolutions of 20-50 nm features on typical EBL machines. EBL is a several step process that typically uses a doped silicon substrate coated with a several hundred nanometer thick oxide layer. An additional layer of an imageable layer, such as a photoresist, is formed on the insulating layer by a suitable coating process, for example, spin-coating. Other coating processes can be suitably used. The wafer is then placed in a high vacuum environment where it is exposed to a focused electron beam in targeted areas. The resist is exposed to electrons with energies sufficient to break the covalent polymer bonds in the targeted areas. The molecular weight of the polymers (e.g., PMMA) is therefore reduced and their solubility is increased significantly. Upon being removed from the vacuum writing chamber, the wafer is rinsed with a suitable solvent, (e.g., a combination of MIBK and IPA solution, 1:3 volume ratio) which dissolves the resist. The remaining resist acts as a stencil of the lithographically defined pattern. The surface can either be etched in this pattern (e.g., with SF) to form trenches or holes, or a material can be deposited to form the desired nanoscale features. To make electronic devices, metal can be evaporated onto the surface to form wires. This is commonly referred to as \u201cmetallization\u201d. The metal that is evaporated onto the wafer will make contact with the substrate in the areas where resist has been removed and the insulating layer is exposed. Elsewhere, the metallic atoms make contact with the resist and are removed when the resist is washed away with acetone in a subsequent step. An EBL defined pattern of the evaporated metal is all that remains on the substrate after this so called \u201clift-off\u201d step is completed.","A primary factor that limits the feature resolution of EEL is circumvented in the synthesis of nanogaps as described herein. The diameter of an electron beam can be focused down to less than one nanometer however, the smallest features that can be written into the resist is an order of magnitude larger than the beam diameter when EBL is performed on the standard insulator on doped silicon wafer (Broers, A. N., 1988, 32, 4). Without being limited by any theory of operation, shows a schematic of the trajectories of electrons moving through different materials. As indicated in the figure, the incident electron beam actually passes through the PMMA resist and the insulating layer (in this example, SiO) without affecting most of the resist polymers' bonds. It is when these \u201cforward-scattered\u201d electrons reach the doped silicon layer that a large number of electrons in the silicon get ionized and are emitted from the surface with energies up to 20 eV. Electrons with energies 5 eV and higher are sufficient to break the PMMA polymer bonds. The size of this burst of \u201cback-scattered\u201d electrons therefore largely determines the size of the feature written. In general, areas which can be intended to remain unexposed can actually be exposed to a large dose of energetic electrons. This phenomenon is known as the \u201cProximity Effect\u201d Chang, T. H. P., 1975, 12, 1271. If the distributions of electron scattering are assumed to be Gaussian with \u201ccharacteristic widths\u201d, \u03c3and \u03c3, for the forward-scattered and back-scattered electrons, respectively, then the distribution of total resist exposure is given approximately by the Energy Deposition Function (EDF) Parikh, M.; Kyser, D. 1979, 50, 1104,\n\n()=[exp\u2212()+\u03b7(\u03c3\/\u03c3)exp\u2212()].\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nIn this expression, r is the radial distance from the exposure center, \u03b7 is the ratio between the energy dissipation of backscattered electrons and the incident electrons along the beam axis and k is a constant used to normalize the function to 1 at r=0. Kyser and Parikh reported values of \u03b7=0.51, \u03c3=0.06 \u03bcm and \u03c3=2.6 \u03bcm for a 500 nm-thick resist layer on a silicon substrate with a 25 keV electron beam Parikh, M.; Kyser, D. J. 1979, 50, 1104. In general, the value of \u03c3decreases with increasing accelerating voltage while \u03c3, increases and both are dependent on the electron beam energy and resist thickness. \u03c3, also depends on the substrate material because of the sensitivity of the electron scattering cross-section to the atomic weight of the scatterer. In contrast, n is nearly independent of these values. According to Eq. (1), exposure is \u02dc0.5 at r=0.36 \u03bcm for the stated parameters in the limit of an infinitely narrow incident beam. The finite width of the incident electron beam can also be described by a Gaussian with characteristic width, \u03b2, and is easily incorporated into the EDF by replacing \u03c3and \u03c3with (\u03c3)and (\u03c3+\u03b2), respectively.\n","The procedure demonstrated for the production of nanogaps and other small structures in these examples is based on minimizing \u03c3and allowing the feature size to be limited instead by the much smaller value \u03c3. This is achieved by selectively removing complete sections of the doped silicon beneath specific regions of the insulating layer. shows a schematic of a suitable support membrane-supported substrate used in an embodiment of the present invention. A supported SiNsupport membrane is provided that spans an opening in a layer of (positively) doped silicon. For EBL performed on the thin support membrane region, electron back-scattering is negligible (i.e., \u03c3\u02dc0) and the proximity effect is therefore reduced dramatically. Without being bound by any particular theory of operation, Eq. (1) implies that for EBL performed on insulating support membrane substrates\n\nF(r)\u02dcexp[\u2212(r\/\u03c3)].\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nHowever, the distribution of forward-scattered electrons actually decreases with increasing r even faster than a Gaussian and therefore the distribution of forward-scattered electrons is better approximated by a more detailed consideration of the multiple small angle scattering events of the incident electrons in the resist (for further details, see Scott, W. T., 1963, 35, 231).\n","Because of the extremely narrow distribution of the incident electrons, it is possible to pattern two features down to \u02dc1 nm apart, as is indicated by the closely spaced \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d write steps in . If backscattering were present, the two neighboring features would overlap and result in one continuous feature.","Without being bound by any particular theory of operation, in the limit of no scattering of any kind and an infinitely narrow electron beam, the distribution of exposed PMMA is determined purely by its interaction with the electromagnetic fields produced by the incident electrons. Using first-order time-dependent perturbation theory Lutwyche, M. I. 1992, 17, 17, the probability of exposing a PMMA molecule a distance r from a 1-dimensional electron beam can be calculated as\n\n()=(constant)*exp{\u2212(\/2)\/(4)]}.\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nHere, T is the kinetic energy of an incident electron, m is its mass, h is Plank's constant, c is the speed of light and \u0394E is the energy required to expose a PMMA molecule it is initially in its ground state. The probability for exposure therefore approaches zero exponentially as electron energy increases. Since forward-scattering also decreases as the beam energy increases, the distribution of exposed resist can, in principle, approach the exact diameter of the electron beam for sufficiently high energies. Electron beams several angstroms in diameter have been achieved previously (Broers, A. N., 1988, 32, 4).\n","Thin resist films can also be used to reduce the spreading of the beam due to forward scattering as it passes through. For example, for a 50 kV electron beam, \u03c3is reduced from 0.07 \u03bcm to 0.013 gm when working with a 60 nm layer of resist instead of a 1 \u03bcm thick layer (Id.). Numerous measurements have indicated that feature size is independent of the molecular weight of the resist. The choice of PMMA molecular weight does, however, control the minimum thickness attainable by spin-casting and it is difficult to get below 100 nm thickness. Contamination resists can be used instead of PMMA (Broers, A. N.; Molzen, W. W.; Cuomo, J. J.; Wittels, N. D. 1976, 29, 596), but they are not required as high-quality nanogaps can be achieved even with a \u02dc1 \u03bcm thick layer of PMMA.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0125","num":"0124"},"figref":"FIG. 24","b":["01002","01004","01006","01008","01010","01012","01014","01016","01018","01020","01022"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0126","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 25","b":["02008","02004","02006","02002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0127","num":"0126"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["03006","03008","03004","03002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0127"},"figref":"FIG. 27","b":["04004","04006","04002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 28","b":["05004","05008","05006","05002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"figref":["FIGS. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29","FIG. 29"],"i":["a","f ","a","b","c","d","e","f","f "],"b":["07004","07002","07006","07008","07006","07010","07012","07006","07014","07004","07002","07016","07004","07004"]},"In these examples, lithography was performed on thin SiN(silicon nitride) support membrane substrates with a thermal-emission JEOL 6400 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) operating at its maximum accelerating voltage of 30 kV. The electron beam was controlled with a Raith writing program. The smallest attainable beam diameter on this instrument was \u02dc30 nm. Production of wafers with well defined square regions of free-standing insulator-only material is straightforward to achieve and easy to make in large numbers (Grant, A. W.; Hu, Q.-H; Kasemo, B., 2004, 15, 1175). They are also available commercially from Structure Probe, Inc. (SPI), West Chester, Pa., http:\/\/www.2spi.com\/.","Support membrane substrates were fabricated using a procedure in which doped silicon (Si) wafers with highly polished, 100 nm-thick low-stress silicon nitride (SiN) layers grown on both sides are first coated with photoresist. Photolithography was then used to remove a square region of the resist, thereby revealing the SiNunderneath. This side of the wafer was then exposed to a SFplasma etch, which removes a square of SiN, revealing the Si underneath. Finally, the wafer was exposed to a KOH wet etch. The KOH etches anisotropically through the Si along lattices planes until the SiNon the other side of the wafer is revealed. A free standing support membrane window (in one example, \u02dc50\u00d750 \u03bcm) of 100 nm thick SiNis therefore defined. These low-stress SiNsupport membranes are robust and no special care is required when handling the processed wafers.","The thickness of the SiNsupport membrane can be reduced with SFreactive ion etching using the procedure described by Reyes-Betanzo, C; Moshkayov, S. A.; Ramos, A. C. S.; Swart, J. W. 2004, 22, 1513. In order to calibrate the etching rate, EBL was used to pattern squares into a resist layer on a collection of SiNsupport membranes and then exposed each wafer to the SFetch for a different amount of time. After removing any remaining resist, the wafers' surfaces were imaged with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM height contours were used to determine the etch depth and surface roughness. Surfaces exposed to SFplasma at 50 Watts etched evenly at a rate of (1.00+\/\u22120.01) nm\/sec. AFM topographical imaging revealed that the etched surfaces were smooth, having an average \u0394z\/\u03bcmof \u02dc0.1 nm. Support membranes were successfully etched down to at least \u02dc10 nm without any damage or irregularities, as indicated by the AFM height contours. TEM imaging is improved as the thickness of the support membrane is decreased and nanostructure self-assembly can be facilitated by the smooth surface. It is easy to evaporate a gate layer onto the back side of the window and fabricate a full FET geometry with a tailored insulating layer thickness. 3.5 nm thick SiNsupport membranes grown from a Jet Vapor Deposition (JVD) technique have a dielectric constant of \u02dc7 and a breakdown voltage of 10V\/cm (from source to gate) Ma, T. P. IEEE Trans. Electron Devices 1998, 45, 680, which makes them superior to SiOfor use as an insulating layer. SiNsupport membranes are therefore excellent materials for the purpose of making ultra small FETs and other nano-devices.","A 1 \u03bcm thick layer of PMMA (950 molecular weight in 4% chlorobenzene) was spin-casted onto the SiNwindows. Nanogaps were written using a 10 pA electron beam in a chamber with pressure below 10Torr. The resist was exposed to beam doses ranging from 100 \u03bcC\/cmto 400 \u03bcC\/cmand then developed in MIBK:IPA (3:1) for 60 seconds. For metallization, several nanometers of chromium were evaporated first to act as an adhesion layer between the gold and the substrate. Finally, between 10 and 50 nm of gold were evaporated, though the electrode's thickness is not limited to these values. The wafers were put into acetone at room temperature in order to achieve lift-off.
