The present invention also relates to a method for employing strain gages to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on slender beams using strain gage based methods with application to portable Army bridges.","A mobile dynamometer is a vehicle that can measure the force needed to tow large vehicles such as tanks. A load cell with a capacity of about, for example, 100,000 pounds is connected to a sway bar underneath the dynamometer. However, a method and structure is needed to prevent the load cell from being overloaded should the force suddenly exceed the 100,000 pound capacity. Overloading the load cell can lead to damage.","The present invention is directed to a deflection plate for protecting a load cell of a mobile dynamometer, comprising a generally elongated member having a front surface, a back surface, a top surface, a bottom surface and two side surfaces; the front surface being at least partially tapered such that the front surface adjacent the top surface is thicker than the front surface adjacent the bottom surface; the front surface having at least one bore adjacent the top surface; and the front surface having at least one bore adjacent the bottom surface.","In a preferred embodiment, the front surface of the deflection plate tapers for a substantial portion from adjacent the top surface to adjacent the bottom surface with decreasing thicknesses. The front surface can taper with at least four decreasing thicknesses.","The deflection plate can be formed of five segments wherein said first segment includes the top surface and the fifth segment includes the bottom surface and wherein the second segment, the third segment and the fourth segment are disposed in increasing segment number order between the first segment and the fifth segment.","In another preferred embodiment, the first segment and the fifth segment can have respective constant thicknesses and wherein the thickness of the first segment is greater than the thickness of the fifth segment.

Preferably the elongated member is generally rectangular.","Yet in another preferred embodiment, the back surface, the top surface, the bottom surface and the two side surfaces are generally flat. Also the bottom surface and the sides are joined by flat angled surfaces.","In a preferred embodiment, the front surface of the deflection plate is dimensioned and configured such that the safety factor along substantially most of the length of the deflection plate is at least 1.1. Also preferably the safety factor along substantially most of the length of said deflection plate is less than about 1.2.","The present invention is also directed to a linkage system for a mobile dynamometer for testing power drawbar effect and resistance to towing characteristics of tracked and wheeled vehicles, and wherein the mobile dynamometer has an undercarriage. The linkage system includes a deflection plate, a load cell coupled at one end to the deflection plate; a load beam coupled at one end to the other end of the load cell; and a tow mechanism coupled to the other end of the load beam.","The linkage system further includes at least stopper plate mounted on the load beam and at least one stop member mounted on the undercarriage of the mobile dynamometer. The stopper plate and the at least one stop member are disposed relative to one another such that the load beam can travel a predetermined distance before the stopper plate and the at least one stop member abut one another. The predetermined distance in one preferred embodiment is about 0.25 inches.","The present invention is in addition directed to a method for testing power drawbar effect and resistance to towing characteristics of tracked and wheeled vehicles coupled to a mobile dynamometer, and wherein the mobile dynamometer has an undercarriage, comprising providing a deflection plate; providing a load cell coupled at one end to said deflection plate; providing a load beam coupled at one end to the other end of said load cell; and providing a tow mechanism coupled to the other end of said load beam for connecting a vehicle to be towed.","In one preferred embodiment of the method, the taper of the front surface of the deflection plate is dimensioned and configured such that the safety factor along substantially most of the length of the deflection plate is at least 1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the taper of the front surface of the deflection plate is dimensioned and configured such that the safety factor along substantially most of the length of the deflection plate is at least about 1.1 and less than about 1.2. Preferably in the method, the elongated member is formed of five segments wherein the first segment includes the top surface and the fifth segment includes the bottom surface and wherein the second segment, the third segment and the fourth segment are disposed in increasing segment number order between the first segment and the fifth segment. Also in this method, the first segment and the fifth segment have respective constant thicknesses and the thickness of the first segment is greater than the thickness of the fifth segment, and wherein the second segment, the third segment and the fourth segment each have decreasing thicknesses such that the junction of the second segment and the third segment is greater than the thickness of the junction of the third segment and the fourth segment.","The present invention also is directed to a method for employing strain gages to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on slender beams using strain gage based methods with application to portable Army bridges.","In the description herein with respect to the drawings, any reference to direction is purely informative and is employed for ease of reference. It is not intended as limiting the scope of the claims herein.","The deflection plate or anchor arm plate of the present invention is for use in the M16 Heavy Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle (manufactured by Barnes and Reinecke in the late 1970's) and the M18 Medium Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle (manufactured also by Barnes and Reinecke, in the late 1980's). These vehicles are designed for testing power drawbar effect and resistance to towing characteristics of tracked and wheeled vehicles.","Referring to , there is shown one preferred embodiment of a high strength deflection plate  according to the present invention. The deflection plate , as shown generally in ,  and , is a 100,000 pound (referred to here as 100 kip) embodiment which has a generally rectangular configuration having a flat back surface  and a front surface  as shown in  which is not flat along its entire length from top to bottom. The top surface  and the bottom surface  of the deflection place  are also preferably flat. Generally the front surface  is tapered such that the front surface  adjacent the top surface  is thicker than the front surface  adjacent the bottom surface .","The deflection plate  as shown in  and also in  is formed of preferably five segments of varying thickness and shape. As shown in , these are segments , , ,  and . Segments  and  have flat front surfaces  and , respectively. Segments ,  and  have tapered front surfaces ,  and , respectively. Generally each of these tapered segments has decreasing cross-sectional thicknesses toward the bottom segment  which has the smallest cross-sectional thickness. Hence segment  has the largest thickness and segment  has the smallest thickness. The deflection plate  has a right side wall  and a left side wall  which are preferably flat. Segment  has bottom inwardly tapered flat wall portions  and  as shown in ,  and .","Segment  has four similar bores  as shown in ,  and  to receive suitably dimensioned and configured similar bolts  as shown, for example, in . Segment  has a single bore  to receive a single suitably dimensioned and configured bolt  that is preferably larger in cross-section than bolts .","Referring now to ,  and , there is shown an alternative preferred embodiment of a deflection plate  also according to the present invention. The deflection plate  is a 75 kip (75,000 pound) embodiment which has generally like configuration as does deflection plate . However the 75 kip embodiment 100 has different tapered segments and different sizes and dimensions than those of the 100 kip embodiment 10.","A comparison of these tapered segments and dimensions for the deletion plates  and  are shown in . For example, in deflection plate  segment  has a thickness of about 3.85 inches. Segment  of deflection plate  has a thickness of about 3.34 inches. In general, deflection plate  has smaller dimensions than deflection plate . But both have the same height of about 17.5 inches and a width of about 6.00 inches so that they can each be bolted in place to the same surrounding structural components of the undercarriage of the Mobile Dynamometer Vehicle as shown in . More detailed dimensions of a preferred embodiment for deflection plate  are shown in , A and B and for deflection plate  are shown in , A and B.","The deflection plate  also has a generally rectangular configuration having a flat back surface  and a front surface  as shown in  which is not flat along its entire length from top to bottom. The top surface  and the bottom surface  of the deflection place  are preferably flat. As was the case with deflection plate , deflection plate  similarly has a front surface  that is tapered such that the front surface  adjacent the top surface  is thicker than the front surface  adjacent the bottom surface .","The deflection plate  as shown in  and also in  is formed of preferably five segments of varying thickness and shape. As shown in , these are segments , , ,  and . Segments  and  have flat front surfaces  and , respectively. Segments ,  and  have tapered front surfaces ,  and , respectively. Generally each of these tapered segments has decreasing cross-sections thicknesses toward the bottom segment  which has the smallest cross-sectional thickness. Hence segment  has the largest thickness and segment  has the smallest thickness. The deflection plate  has a right side wall  and a left side wall  which are preferably flat. Segment  has bottom inwardly tapered flat wall portions  and  as shown in ,  and .","Segment  has four similar bores  as shown in ,  and  to receive suitably dimensioned and configured similar bolts (not shown) which are comparable to bolts  shown, for example, in . Segment  has a single bore  to receive a single suitably dimensioned and configured bolt (not shown) that is preferably larger in cross-section than the bolts for bores  and is comparable to bolt  also shown in .","Referring now to the embodiment shown in , the deflection plate  is mounted to a lower support plate  that includes an L shaped member having a horizontal portion  and a vertical portion . As shown in , the deflection plate  is positioned between a front bushing or restraining plate  and a rear bushing or restraining plate  which is sandwiched between back surface  and the front surface of the vertical portion  of the L shaped member of lower support plate . An upper support plate  is positioned against the back surface of the vertical portion . These components are fastened together with the bolts  that extend through comparably sized and aligned holes (not shown) in each of these components and also bores  of deflection plate . The ends  of the bolts  extend past the back surface of the upper support plate . The holes of at least upper support plate  can have grooves to receive the grooves on the bolts  so as to fasten these components together with the deflection plate .","The upper support plate  can preferably be attached to a horizontal plate  and a transverse plate  as shown in . These plates collectively form a nut fixture to received and secure the bolts . A semi-ring  can be affixed to the upper surface of horizontal plate .","As shown in , a load cell  is mounted to the deflection plate  through a front clevis  into which is positioned a front eye bolt  extending from the front of the load cell . A front mounting bolt  couples the front eye bolt  to the front clevis . The front mounting bolt  is kept in place by two cross pins  and corresponding catch rings  on opposite ends of the front mounting bolt  as shown in . The bolt  is secured to the clevis  which has a bore (not shown) to receive the bolt . A bushing  is positioned between bolt  and the front surface  of deflection plate .","The load cell  also has a rear eye bolt or ball joint rod end  extending from the front of the load cell  as shown in . Threaded adapters  positioned on each side of the load cell  are used in coupling the load cell  to the clevis  and the rear eye bolt . The rear eye bolt  is configured to receive a rear mounting bolt . In this manner, the load cell  can be coupled to a sway bar or load beam  as shown in . The sway bar or load beam  has a clevis  which allows for coupling the rear eye bolt  by the rear mounting bolt . The cross pins  and corresponding catch rings  help to maintain the rear mounting bolt in place. A rocker arm  is coupled to the clevis  with a retaining bolt . The load beam  is coupled at it rearward portion to a towbar cross-member  which is part of the tow mechanism  shown in . These latter drawings demonstrate a US Army mobile Dynamometer  hooked up to and towing a Stryker vehicle .","Referring now to , the sway bar or load beam  includes a stopper plate  which is positioned between a front stop member  and a rear stop member . Both the front stop member  and rear stop member  are coupled or mounted on support members  and , respectively as shown in , and which are mounted to the undercarriage  of mobile Dynamometer . As shown in , the stopper plate  during the towing and testing operation can be spaced from the front stop member  and the rear stop member .","The high strength deflection plates  and  are designed such that they will not yield under the design force but can deflect, preferably 0.25 inches at the 100,000 pound capacity of the load cell . At this point the sway bar or load beam  can hit a mechanical stopper  directly attached to the frame or undercarriage  of the mobile dynamometer . In this manner, the load cell  is allowed to measure the towing force up to but not exceeding about 100,000 pounds. As noted above, the deflection plates  and  are tapered such that the stress remains approximately constant throughout most of the entire plate. This allows the maximum deflection possible since there is no unnecessary material. In one preferred embodiment, the material for high strength and low modulus of elasticity can be Aluminum 7075-T651.","As shown in , the deflection plates are designed to generally have a safety factor (S.F.) between 1.1 and 1.2 in at least the upper four segments , ,  and  of deflection plate  and the upper four segments , ,  and  of deflection plate . The safety factor is the yield strength (shown as sigma in psi in ) divided by the design stress. In , the topmost horizontal broken line shows a S.F. of 1.0. The next lower horizontal broken line represents a S.F. of 1.1 while the next lower horizontal broken line represents a S.F. of 1.2 as also indicated in the legend boxes in . The larger the safety factor, the less likely the part will fail. The yield strength of aluminum 7075 is about 73,000 psi. For example a safety factor of 2 would be a design stress of 73,000\/2=36,500 psi. In this case, the S.F.=1.1 corresponds to a design stress of 66,364 psi and the S.F.=1.2 corresponds to a design stress of 60,833 psi.","The design criteria which determine the thickness of the material and points of slope change of preferred embodiments of deflection plates  and  was for the stress generally throughout the part to be between a S.F. of 1.2 and 1.1 and all times. If the safety factor dropped below 1.1 the part would be in danger of failing and if the safety factor was greater than 1.2, there is more material than needed.","In , the thicknesses of deflection plates  and  are shown in relative relation to the safety factors determined along the various segments of the deflection plates  and . However, the full vertical heights or lengths of the deflection plates are not shown. Basically, as can be seen from , the x axis in  starts at the single main bolt hole  and  at the left. For deflection plate , from x=0 to x=1.25\u2033, the thickness is 1.4\u2033. At x=1.25\u2033, the slope changes and at x=2\u2033, the thickness is 1.78\u2033. At x=4.1.\u2033, the thickness is 2.55\u2033. At x=9.31\u2033, the thickness is 3.85\u2033. Finally at 9.81\u2033 the thickness remains 3.85\u2033 and the graphs in  end. That is the point where the front bushing or restraining plate  begins as shown in .","Although a load cell can be employed as described above in a Mobile Dynamometer, load cells are not always available and they are not cost effective to directly measure the vehicle weights on a bridge by using load cells. However, strain gages can be employed to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on slender beams using strain gage based methods with application to portable Army bridges.","According to this aspect of the present invention, unique strain gage based methods were developed to identify magnitudes and locations of loads on a non-continuous, non-homogenous, slender beam with variable cross sections, welded and bolted joints, and pinned, firm rest, soft rest, pinned-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions. Four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam created a force transducer capable of identifying the magnitude and location of a load inside the weight area. By combining individually scaled strain gage outputs, the bending moment diagram was constructed. For the case of multiple loads separated by two or more strain gage locations, uniaxial strain gages forming multiple force transducers can still identify the magnitudes and locations of all the loads. A calibration method was developed to account for the discrepancies between the theoretical and actual scaling factors arising from stress concentrations and unpredictable stress patterns in the beams due to the presence of the joints. The strain gage based force transducer methodology was experimentally validated on prismatic beams with firm rest, soft rest, firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions; an aluminum beam with a bolted joint; and a half aluminum and half steel beam with two different cross sections and a bolted joint. It was also experimentally validated on a continuous aluminum beam with a linearly varying cross section and rest boundary conditions, a tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints, and a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The force transducer methodology is independent of the boundary conditions of the beam and the error from strain gage drift due to uniform thermal expansion on a prismatic beam can cancel out.","When there are multiple loads separated by only one strain gage location, the problem is posed for the force transducer methodology. Another method has been developed using two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam, one on each side of a load, to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages, with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load, can be used to identify the location of the load. The strain gage based methods were experimentally validated on a prismatic beam with rest boundary conditions.","In the discussion which follows, the list of variables includes:\n\n","Load identification on large scale bridges has many applications in both the public and military sectors. The Bridge Crossing Simulator (BCS), which is operated by the US Army Aberdeen Test Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, USA (), tests portable army bridges for fatigue failure by simulating thousands of vehicle crossings. The current methodology involves setting up a bridge on dirt abutments and measuring strains from the bridge that are collected from vehicles with various crossing speeds (). Next, the bridge is set up on the BCS with wood abutments and straps, and hydraulic cylinders are used to apply loads to the bridge through multiple load application devices, referred to as \u201cWhiffles\u201d. The strain time history is used in a control system feedback loop for each corresponding cylinder in order to simulate various crossing speeds of vehicles on the bridge. This method can be subject to uncertainties since the actual vehicle loads are not known from the field data. A new load identification methodology can be used to identify cylinder loads that need to be applied, from measured strains from live crossings of vehicles.","1.2 Previous Work","A load identification methodology can also be used to determine the life span of a commercial bridge given the strain gage data of vehicles that cross it [1] (Numbers within brackets refer to the References listed beginning at page 96). The frequency and the weights of vehicles that cross a bridge are often an estimated quantity by structural designers. Load cells are not always available and it is not cost effective to directly measure the vehicle weights using load cells [2]. By developing a measurement technique using strain gages, one can identify specific axle loads of a vehicle without using a scale [3]. Previous methods transform a bridge into a dynamic scale when multiple vehicles were crossing it [1-9]. This is primarily an inverse problem since the loads are unknown, but the response is known [10].","By measuring strain at one location, the system \u201cAXWAY\u201d in Ref. [4] develops an influence line by summing the individual strain curves from known vehicle axle weights and performing a best fit analysis. The influence line is dependent on vehicle speed, axle spacing, axle weights, and gross vehicle weight [4]. A limitation of this method is that a bridge can only have one vehicle on it at a time. Deflection measurements can also be used, where the dynamic beam response is calculated [11]. According to the previous studies, the load identification method using deflection data is more prone to error than that using bending moment data [5]. Another approach involves modeling a vehicle\/bridge system and using acceleration measurements to calculate the dynamic response of the system [6]. However, when comparing the strain model to the acceleration model, lower error was obtained from the strain model [12]. A limitation of deflection based methods and acceleration based methods is that the boundary conditions must be accurately known.","A Reaction Force Detection (RFD) system to detect lameness in cows was developed by measuring four reaction forces on a plate using load cells [13]. Calibration is performed along with statistical methods to determine when forces are reduced in a limb of a lame cow. When a single limb is on a plate, the RFD calculates the magnitude and position of the force. A limitation of the method is that when multiple limbs are on the plate, the RFD calculates the magnitude and position of the resultant force, and cannot decipher individual forces.","A transducer converts one form of energy to another [14]. The interest here is to convert mechanical energy to an electrical signal that represents the load applied. Components of a force transducer include an applied load, the spring response, strain gages, and a Wheatstone bridge circuit, as shown in  (illustration courtesy of Vishay Measurements) [15, 17]. Strain gages are useful when stress measurements are desired, since stress cannot be directly measured, but strain can be measured [16]. Strain is defined as the change in length over original length, and does not Shave units [16]. A strain gage consists of a continuous wire that is bonded to a material for measurement through a rigorous application procedure, with a uniaxial strain gage that measures strain in one direction shown in  (illustration courtesy of Vishay Measurements) [17]. When the material deforms, each leg of the wire also deforms. The wire changes its cross section and, more importantly, electrical resistance. When the strain gage is connected to a Wheatstone bridge, the voltage amplifies the resistance change, which can be converted to a strain measurement. Typical strain measurements are very small and reported in microstrain (\u03bc\u03b5). One \u03bc\u03b5 is defined as one unit of deformation per 1,000,000 units of original length [14]. Even though strain is unitless, the precision of the measurement is high, since for a strain gage with an active strain gage length of 6.35 millimeters, one \u03bc\u03b5 is a deformation of 6.35 nanometers. Strain gages are a useful measurement technique for most metal structures such as aluminum and steel. Because of the porous nature of concrete, it is difficult to correctly bond a strain gage. However, it is possible to measure strains on large scale concrete bridges by mounting aluminum members to concrete and applying strain gages to the aluminum members [10].","A general challenge of an inverse problem, is that it is often ill-posed [8]. Given measurement quantities can often lead to multiple solutions for input loads [18]. Hence a final design of a force transducer should be robust enough to pinpoint a unique solution. It has been shown multiple times that a structure itself can be turned into a force transducer using strain measurements [4,5,10]. A general formulation is given by Masroor and Zachary [19]:\n\n[\u03b5]=[\u2003\u2003(1.1)\n\nwhere [\u03b5] is a u\u00d71 matrix that represents measured strains at candidate locations, [P] is a v\u00d71 matrix that represents independent input forces, and [A] is a u\u00d7v coefficient matrix that depends on the geometric and material properties. The coefficient matrix is determined experimentally through known inputs P and outputs \u03b5. The inverse problem associated with Eq. (1.1) can be solved:\n\n[[\u03b5]\u2003\u2003(1.2)\n\nwhere [A]is the generalized inverse of [A]. The challenge of properly setting up this method is to first determine appropriate strain and load locations so that Eq. (1.2) is well-posed, since not all locations can provide independent information.\n\n1.3 New Methods\n","Novel strain gage based methods are developed to identify the magnitudes and locations of loads on beams. Chapter 2 introduces a new force transducer methodology that will calculate the magnitude and location of a single load on a beam using four uniaxial strain gages mounted on the bottom surface of the beam. Section 2.1 discusses a cantilever beam force transducer developed by Vishay using two strain gages [20]. Section 2.2.1 introduces a new force transducer methodology to determine the magnitude of a load on a beam. The load can be a concentrated load, distributed load, or any combination of concentrated and distributed loads. The concept of firm and soft rest boundary conditions is discussed along with pinned, pinned-fixed and fixed boundary conditions, where the methodology is independent of boundary conditions. Section 2.2.2 utilizes the force transducer methodology to determine the location of a load. Section 2.2.3 discusses causes of error in strain gage based transducers and how the methodology developed here mitigates the errors. A novel calibration procedure is developed to systematically determine the scaling factors of strain gages on a beam. Section 2.3 applies the force transducer methodology to four different experiments. Section 2.3.1 shows the force transducer methodology applied to a prismatic steel beam with rest boundary conditions to accurately determine the magnitude and location of a load. Section 2.3.2 shows the results for various boundary conditions for a prismatic aluminum beam. Section 2.3.3 shows a distributed load on a prismatic aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions. Section 2.3.4 shows the force transducer methodology applied to a continuously tapered aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions.","Chapter 3 expands the force transducer methodology to multiple loads separated by two strain gage locations (Sec. 3.2.1), and introduces a new strain gage based method using shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of a beam and the uniaxial strain gages (Sec. 3.2.2). The corresponding experimental results for a prismatic aluminum box beam with rest boundary conditions are shown for the force transducer methodology (Sec. 3.3.1) and strain gage methodology using shear gages and uniaxial strain gages (Sec. 3.3.2).","Chapter 4 applies the force transducer methodology to beams with welded and bolted joints with application to a portable army bridge. Section 4.2.1 discusses the effect of welded or bolted joints on strain gages in close proximity to joints. The previously developed calibration method accounts for stress concentrations due to joints (Sec. 4.2.2). Section 4.3.1 shows the experimental results for a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints. Section 4.3.2 shows the experimental results for an aluminum beam with a bolted joint in the middle. Section 4.3.3 shows the experimental results for a beam that is half aluminum and half steel. Section 4.3.4 shows the application of the force transducer methodology to a portable army bridge on the BCS.","Chapter 5 reviews the force transducer methodology and the strain gage based methodology using shear gages and uniaxial strain gages developed and provides future research directions. Section 5.1 summarizes the experimental results for Chapters 2 through 4. Section 5.2 describes the contributions, advantages, and limitations of the methods. Section 5.3 discusses future work for the methods developed here.","Chapter 2: Identifying the Magnitude and Location of a Load on a Slender Beam Using a Strain Gage Based Force Transducer","Abstract","A unique strain gage based method is developed to identify the magnitude and location of a load on a slender beam with non-homogeneous material, variable cross sections, and pinned, firm rest, soft rest, pinned-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions.

While a strain gage based force transducer for the cantilever beam has only two strain gages, that for a beam with reaction forces at two boundaries has four strain gages, with two strain gages on each side of a load to calculate the slopes of the bending moment curves on the two sides of the load. The free body diagram shown in  has a force Flocated inside a designated weight area between strain gages  and , where Rand Rare the reaction forces at the two boundaries; in this work, the index n for a force Fdenotes the force is located to the right of strain gage \u03b5, where n=1, 2, 3, 4 is the strain gage number. The standard sign conventions for the shear force and bending moment diagrams are used [21]. The left shear force curve in  has a constant value R, and the right shear force curve has a constant value \u2212R. Since a bending moment curve is the integral of a shear force curve, the slope of the left bending moment curve is R, and that of the right bending moment curve is \u2212R, as shown in .

The shear force diagram in  shows that the slope of the shear force curve over the length dis equal to the distributed force w. The drop in the shear force curves across the distributed force is equal to the resultant force F=wd, which is the same as that for the case of a concentrated force F, as shown in . The comparison of the bending moment diagrams for the concentrated force and the distributed force, whose centroid is located at the same position as the concentrated force, is shown in . It can be seen from  that the intersection of the left and right bending moment curves is the position of the concentrated force F, and it is also the position of the centroid of the distributed force w, as shown in . This concept can be extended to a distributed load of any shape. A distributed load outside the force transducer can be treated as the case in , and a distributed load between strain gages  and  or between strain gages  and  can be treated as the case in . A distributed load that crosses a strain gage boundary is in effect a multiple load problem, which is beyond the scope of the current chapter and will be discussed in Chapter 3. Finally, a combination of concentrated and distributed loads follows the same methodology as that for a single load case as long as they do not cross a strain gage boundary.","Let dand dbe the distances between the force F and the left and right boundaries, respectively, as shown in . There are two types of a rest boundary condition: a firm rest boundary condition, where the reaction force acts at the edge of a firm abutment, and a soft rest boundary condition () [24], where the reaction force is distributed over a soft abutment, which can be represented by a concentrated reaction force at the edge of the abutment and a reaction moment (). The distances between the left and right reaction forces Rand R, and the edges of the soft abutments, are dand d, respectively, and the lengths of the beam sitting on the left and right soft abutments are Dand D, respectively (). In this study, a firm rest boundary is similar to a pinned boundary, and a soft rest boundary is similar to a fixed boundary, except that the direction of the reaction moment for the soft rest boundary is opposite to that of the fixed boundary, and the slope of a fixed boundary is zero while that of a soft rest boundary may not be zero.

In fact, this is typically the main cause for error when dealing with strain gages [26]. For an outdoor setup, the ambient temperature can change over 10\u00b0 C. throughout the course of the day. Depending on the material, this can cause a change of 1\u00b0 C. or more for the actual material temperature through convection. Aluminum 6061-T6 has a coefficient of thermal expansion of 23.6 \u03bc\u03b5\/\u00b0 C. Hence a 1\u00b0 C. shift in temperature of the material can introduce a 23.6 \u03bc\u03b5 drift in all the strain gages simultaneously. If this happens, the force transducer will still respond correctly. When combining four strain gages in a typical strain gage based transducer in a Wheatstone bridge or mathematically, the temperature effects can cancel out when uniform strain gage drift occurs [27]. For the force transducer in Eq. (2.11), when \u03b3=\u03b3and \u03b3=\u03b3, the same shift in all four strain gages cancels out. Non-uniform thermal expansion often occurs when the sun causes a part of a structure to expand more than some other part due to radiation. For non-uniform thermal expansion or when \u03b3=\u03b3and \u03b3=\u03b3are not satisfied, such as the case of a non-homogeneous and\/or non-prismatic beam, error can be eliminated by zeroing strain gages before readings are taken.","One of the inherent features of the force transducer methodology is that it possesses an absolute error instead of a relative error for the strain gages, which is due to the accuracy of the equipment and the sensitivity of measurements. For example, each strain gage is accurate to within 2 to 3 \u03bc\u03b5 regardless of whether it is reading 5 or 500 \u03bc\u03b5. It is recommended to use optimal strain readings between 1,000 and 1,500 \u03bc\u03b5 when designing a force transducer to increase the signal to noise ratio [15]. A method to increase the output signal is to introduce local notching near a strain gage [28].","As with any transducer design, calibration is expected and plays a vital role in developing a methodology [29]. The geometric and material properties can deviate from theoretical values. In the case of extreme temperatures, the Young's Modulus can change by 1 to 3% [14]. An accepted calibration method for an over-determined problem is to minimize the least squares error between the experimental and calculated magnitudes of loads [8]. Another accepted method is to reduce the maximum error.","The calibration procedure is set up so that a single known nonzero force F, where n=2, 3, . . . , N+1, is placed between strain gages \u03b5and \u03b5, which is inside the weight area of the force transducer FTthat consists of strain gages \u03b5through \u03b5, and all the other forces on the beam are zero; all the strains are recorded ().

It should be noted that the blocks on the end abutments are only a guide for the beam and does not create fixed boundary conditions, as shown in . The weight was applied via dumbbells, supported by a thin string to accurately apply a force at a given position, as shown in . The nominal weight of the dumbbells was used, whose weights were within 1.2% of their nominal values. The weight was moved to different positions inside the weight area. A Vishay P3 strain indicator and a Vishay SB-10 switch unit were used to display the strain gage outputs. Since strain is directly proportional to the Young's modulus, and steel is three times stiffer than aluminum, the strain readings will be one-third the values from a comparable aluminum beam. The theoretical Young's modulus for aluminum is 69 GPa and that for steel is 200 GPa. Unlike the design range of an aluminum beam force transducer, which is between 1,000 to 1,500 \u03bc\u03b5, that of a steel beam force transducer is between 300 to 500 \u03bc\u03b5, which can reduce the signal to noise ratio.

The accuracy of the experimental firm rest boundary conditions can be quantitatively determined from the equations of the calculated left and right bending moment curves. The equations for the curves are determined by adding trend lines to the calculated bending moments using Microsoft Excel, with a reported coefficient of determination R, where R=1 indicates a perfect correlation to a line. The equation of the left bending moment curve is M=Rx+M, where M=0 for a firm rest boundary, and that of the right bending moment curve is M=\u2212Rx+b, where b=RL for a firm rest boundary. The equations of the two bending moment curves can be used to calculate the reaction moments Mand Min , which can show whether a rest boundary was a firm rest boundary or a soft rest boundary. The left reaction moment is determined by setting x=0 for the left trend line equation, and the right reaction moment is determined by setting x=L for the right trend line equation. The calculated left and right reaction moments are \u22120.009 Nm and \u22120.006 Nm, respectively, which are within 0.4% of the largest bending moment value. The calculated dfrom  is \u22120.6 mm; consequently d\/D=\u22120.8%. The calculated dis \u22120.8 mm; consequently d\/D=1.0%. The discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated bending moments near a boundary indicate that either the boundary was not an ideal boundary or there was a measurement error. Given that the calculated dand dwere negative, the latter was most likely the case. Since the absolute values of d\/Dand d\/Dwere within 1%, the rest boundaries were indeed firm rest boundaries, which can also be seen from , where the beam contacted the aluminum supports at their edges. Similarly, the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the soft rest boundary conditions are shown in , where evenly distributed reaction forces were assumed for the theoretical bending moment diagram, with d\/D=d\/D=50%. The calculated left reaction moment is 0.537 Nm compared with the theoretical value of 0.569 Nm from Table 2.1. The calculated right reaction moment is 0.278 Nm compared with the theoretical value of 0.319 Nm from Table 2.1. The calculated d\/D, and d\/Dare 46% and 44%, respectively, which are close to the theoretical values of 50%. A triangular distributed, reaction force with a maximum value at the edge of an abutment would give d\/D=d\/D=33.3%; the experimental boundary conditions were closer to evenly distributed reaction forces.","The experimental setup for the firm rest-fixed boundary conditions are shown in . Comparisons of the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions are shown in , respectively. The bolted clamps for the fixed boundaries were designed to be much larger than the test beam (); negative strains were observed near the fixed boundaries, as expected. The calculated left reaction moment for the firm rest-fixed beam in  is \u22120.04 Nm, which is 0.9% of the largest bending moment value, and the calculated right reaction moment is \u22121.89 Nm, which is 9.1% lower in magnitude than the reaction moment of the fixed boundary (\u22122.08 Nm from Table 2.1). The calculated left reaction moment for the fixed beam in  is \u22122.70 Nm compared to \u22122.97 Nm for the left fixed boundary from Table 2.1, and the calculated right reaction moment is \u22121.43 Nm compared to \u22121.49 Nm for the right fixed boundary from Table 2.1. The discrepancies between the theoretical and calculated reaction moments in  indicate that the bolted clamps did not completely apply the theoretical reaction moments. While the errors between the theoretical and calculated bending moments are not directly related to those between the theoretical and calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces, they would affect the accuracy in determining the reaction moments at the boundaries.","The scaling factors for firm rest, soft rest, firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions were determined by applying a known force Fat position 4.5, and used to calculate the unknown force Fat position 2.5. While the scaling factors for the four types of boundary conditions were determined separately for each type of boundary conditions, they were within a tight range of 88.4 to 90.7% of the theoretical \u03b3, showing that the geometric and material properties are independent of the boundary conditions. The calculated magnitudes and positions of the unknown forces are shown in Table 2.5. The errors for the magnitudes of the forces were within 2.3% when the force was inside the weight area of the force transducer FT. When the force was outside the force transducer FT, the force transducer output should read zero, and the zero errors were within 2.5%. The position errors were within 2.3%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0241","num":"0314"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2.5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Calculated magnitudes and positions of forces on an"},{"entry":"aluminum beam with four types of boundary conditions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Boun-","Experi-","Experi-",{},{},{},{},"Calcu-",{}]},{"entry":["dary ","mental","mental",{},{},{},{},"lated","Posi-"]},{"entry":["Con-","Force ","Posi-","FT","FT","FT","FT","Posi-","tion"]},{"entry":["dition","(N)","tion","(N)","Error","(N)","Error","tion","Error"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Firm ","8.9","2.50","8.7","2.3%","0.1","0.6%","2.55","0.8%"]},{"entry":["Rest","13.3","2.50","13.2","1.3%","\u22120.1","0.8%","2.53","0.4%"]},{"entry":[{},"17.8","2.50","17.5","1.4%","0.0","0.0%","2.49","0.2%"]},{"entry":[{},"22.2","2.50","22.4","0.6%","0.0","0.0%","2.52","0.3%"]},{"entry":["Soft ","8.9","2.50","8.7","1.7%","0.0","0.0%","2.46","0.6%"]},{"entry":["Rest","13.3","2.50","13.2","1.2%","0.1","0.4%","2.44","1.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"17.8","2.50","17.6","1.4%","0.1","0.3%","2.50","0.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"22.2","2.50","22.4","0.6%","0.1","0.5%","2.45","0.9%"]},{"entry":["Firm","13.3","2.50","13.2","0.8%","\u22120.1","0.4%","2.64","2.3%"]},{"entry":["Rest-","17.8","2.50","17.8","0.0%","\u22120.2","1.2%","2.53","0.5%"]},{"entry":["Fixed","22.2","2.50","22.7","2.2%","\u22120.2","0.7%","2.44","1.0%"]},{"entry":[{},"31.1","2.50","31.9","2.3%","\u22120.8","2.5%","2.53","0.5%"]},{"entry":["Fixed","31.1","2.50","31.2","0.1%","0.1","0.2%","2.51","0.1%"]},{"entry":[{},"35.6","2.50","35.9","0.8%","\u22120.1","0.3%","2.47","0.4%"]},{"entry":[{},"40.0","2.50","40.0","0.0%","0.1","0.3%","2.49","0.1%"]},{"entry":[{},"44.5","2.50","43.9","1.2%","0.0","0.0%","2.53","0.5%"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":{}},"A continuously tapered aluminum 6061-T6 beam with rest boundary conditions, is shown in .

After unloading the beam, it sometimes did not return to zero strain. Another possible source of error is the low signal to noise ratio, since the maximum strain gage reading of 626 \u03bc\u03b5 was below the recommended range of 1,000 to 1,500 \u03bc\u03b5. A third source of error was that the vertical cross sections used for the theoretical scaling factors are not perpendicular to the neutral axes, which is in violation of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory [21]. The reason that this shape was chosen was to more accurately represent the shapes of army bridges. A fourth source of error was due to horizontal reaction forces at the boundaries that were not considered in the analysis. While the above sources of error arise before calibration, a fifth possible source of error for a continuously tapered beam was that there were many scaling factors; the prismatic beams in Secs. 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 had only one scaling factor.

When the load is outside the weight area, but inside the force transducer, the magnitude of the load can be calculated if its location is known and vice versa. The force transducer methodology can be applied to a distributed load and a combination of concentrated and distributed loads that do not cross a strain gage boundary. While the boundary conditions at the two ends can affect the strain measurements, they do not affect the calculated magnitude and location of a load. The experimental results can be used to determine whether a fixed boundary is an ideal fixed boundary, and whether a rest boundary is a firm rest boundary or a soft rest boundary. A calibration procedure has been developed to globally and individually adjust the scaling factors of the strain gages in calculating the magnitude of a load for prismatic and non-prismatic beams, respectively. Calibration can be performed for the location of a load on a non-homogenous and\/or non-prismatic beam, but not on a homogeneous, prismatic beam.","Experiments on a prismatic steel beam with rest boundary conditions, a prismatic aluminum beam with firm rest, soft rest, firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions, and a continuously tapered aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions validated the force transducer methodology.

Four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam create a force transducer capable of identifying the magnitude and location of a load inside the weight area. For the case of multiple loads separated by two or more strain gage locations, uniaxial strain gages forming multiple force transducers can still identify the magnitudes and locations of all the loads. However, this creates an ill-posed problem for loads separated by only one strain gage location. A new method has been developed using two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam, one on each side of a load, to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages, with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load, can be used to identify the location of the load. The strain gage based methods are experimentally validated on a prismatic beam with rest boundary conditions.","3.1 Introduction","The load identification problem is very important to bridge designers since the weights of vehicles that cross a bridge are not always known [2]. Using a structure itself to measure magnitudes and locations of loads is an inverse problem, where the response is measured and the magnitudes and locations of the loads are identified [10]. Many different approaches, such as measurements from accelerations, deflections, and strains, have been used [1-12, 18, 19, 27-31]. Bending moment data from strain gages are less prone to error than deflection data according to a previous study [5]. Likewise, the strain model has been proven better than the acceleration model [12]. For the case of a vehicle crossing a bridge, strain readings from the bridge provide the information to identify the magnitude of the load [3, 4, 9].","It has been previously shown in Chapter 2 that four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of a slender beam can form a force transducer, which can accurately identify the magnitude and location of a single load on the beam [31]. An inverse problem is often ill-posed, where the measurements do not lead to a unique solution [7, 18]. The force transducer methodology is robust enough to pinpoint a desired solution when the load is located inside the weight area, which is defined as a location between the two middle strain gage locations [31]. When the load is a distributed load or a combination of distributed and concentrated loads, the force transducer can identify the magnitude and location of the resultant load. The methodology has been demonstrated for firm rest, soft rest, firm rest-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions as well as on a continuously tapered beam.","The force transducer methodology causes many types of error to cancel out. In the design of a strain gage based transducer, temperature drift usually causes the largest error [26]. Since four uniaxial strain gages are combined to form a force transducer, the temperature drift is negated for the case of a prismatic beam [31]. Another source of error in load identification is inaccurate modeling of the boundary conditions, which is also negated with the methodology [31].","This work extends the single load problem in Ref. [31] to a multiple load problem, since a vehicle always consists of more than one load on the bridge due to multiple axles of the vehicle. Section 3.2.1 examines the theory for the case where there are two or more strain gage locations between two adjacent loads, with the corresponding experimental data shown in Sec. 3.3.1. Section 3.2.2 examines the theory for the case where there is only one strain gage location between two adjacent loads, with the corresponding experimental data shown in Sec. 3.3.2. When there is no strain gage location between two adjacent loads, the magnitude and location of the resultant load can be identified, as indicated in Ref.

The errors between the experimental and calculated magnitudes of the forces inside the weight areas of the force transducers are referred to as the force errors, and the errors for the force transducers with the forces outside the force transducers, are referred to as the zero errors.

strain gage based force transducer methodology in Chapter 2 has been extended to the case of multiple loads on a slender beam. When the loads are separated by two or more strain gage locations, multiple force transducers, each consisting of four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam, can identify the magnitudes and locations of the loads. Each force transducer can also identify a zero load when the loads on the beam are located outside the force transducer. When the loads are separated by one strain gage location, the problem is ill-posed since many solutions exist for the calculated bending moment diagram. However, with two shear gages, one on each side of a load, the magnitude of the load can be identified. When the uniaxial strain gages at the corresponding locations are also used, the position of the load can be identified. When multiple loads are located inside the weight area of a force transducer, the magnitude and location of the resultant load can be identified. The strain gage based methods are independent of the boundary conditions of the beam.","Experiments were performed on a prismatic aluminum beam with rest boundary conditions. For the case of two loads separated by two or more strain gage locations, the force errors were within 4.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 6.3%, and the errors for the relative locations of the loads were within 1.1%. For the case of two loads separated by one strain gage location, the force errors were within 6.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 5.0%, and the errors for the relative locations of the loads were within 1.0%.","Chapter 4: Identifying Magnitudes and Locations of Loads on Slender Beams with Welded and Bolted Joints Using a Strain Gage Based Force Transducer with Application to a Portable Army Bridge","Abstract","A strain gage based force transducer has been developed to identify magnitudes and locations of loads on non-continuous slender beams with welded and bolted joints. The slopes of the bending moment curves on the two sides of a load are calculated from measured strains on a beam. Four uniaxial strain gages are mounted to the bottom surface of the beam, with two strain gages on each side of the load. A calibration method developed earlier can be used to account for the discrepancies between the theoretical and actual scaling factors arising from stress concentrations and unpredictable stress patterns in the beams due to the presence of the joints. The force transducer methodology is experimentally validated on a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints, an aluminum beam with a constant cross section and a bolted joint, a half aluminum and half steel beam with two different cross sections and a bolted joint, and a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center.","4.1 Introduction","Knowing the gross weight of a vehicle that cross a bridge is important in calculating its fatigue life when designing commercial or military bridges [3]. It is often impractical to obtain this information from directly instrumented vehicles [2]. Hence it is better practice to instrument a bridge via strain gages and calculate the input loads from the inverse problem [1-4, 7-9]. The fatigue design load, which is the vehicle weight multiplied by an impact factor, is an important value when designing portable army bridges [24]. A load identification method should not only determine the static weight of a vehicle, but also the dynamic interaction between the vehicle and the bridge.","A methodology to determine the magnitudes and locations of single and multiple loads on slender beams has been developed by the authors using strain gage based methods [31, 33]. It has been experimentally demonstrated on continuous beams with constant cross sections and a continuously tapered beam. It has also been demonstrated on beams with different boundary conditions [31]. While the theory has been proven robust for single and multiple loads for various continuous beams with different boundary conditions, a commercial or military bridge is rarely made from a constant extrusion, and it would have many welded and bolted joints [34].","This paper examines the applications of the strain gage based force transducer methodology in Ref. [31] to various laboratory beams with welded and bolted joints as well as a full scale portable army bridge. Section 4.2.1 describes how the strain gage based force transducer methodology is applied to a non-continuous slender beam, and Sec. 4.2.2 describes the calibration procedure. The experimental results for a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints are shown in Sec. 4.3.1. The experimental results for an aluminum beam, and a half aluminum and half steel beam, with bolted joints at the centers of the beams, are shown in Secs. 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, respectively. Section 4.3.4 shows the application of the strain gage based force transducer methodology to a full scale portable army bridge at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center.","4.2 Theory","4.2.1 Identification of the Magnitude and Location of a Load on a Non-Continuous Slender Beam","Consider a non-continuous slender beam with pinned boundaries, where the reaction forces are denoted by Rand R, non-homogeneous material, variable cross sections, and a force Fon the beam, as shown in . There can be one or more welded and\/or bolted joints in the beam, and it is assumed that the beam behaves linearly in its response. A strain gage based force transducer, consisting of four uniaxial strain gages, with two strain gages on each side of the force F, is used to accurately identify the magnitude and position of the force when the force is located inside the weight area of the force transducer, which is a location between the two middle strain gages [31]. The force Fcan be a concentrated force, a distributed force of any shape, or a combination of concentrated and distributed forces with the resultant force being F.

The welded joints have an irregular pattern; the position of a strain gage can correspond to a cross section of the beam that may or may not contain a welded joint. In either case, the theoretical scaling factors were for the I-shaped beam cross sections. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on the beam in  with pinned-roller boundary conditions, where a roller boundary condition allows the beam to move freely in the horizontal direction, and an 801 N force at position 4.5, using Pro-Engineer Mechanica to demonstrate the stress concentrations due to the presence of the welded joints (). The welded joints were modeled as a bonded interface (), and the top flange was modeled as a contact interface to the web (). Comparisons of the theoretical strains for firm rest and soft rest boundary conditions, the measured strains, and the predicted strains from FEA for firm rest and soft rest boundary conditions are shown in , where the resultant reaction forces were assumed to be 85 and 80 mm away from the edges of the left and right abutments, respectively, for the soft rest boundary conditions [31]. While the theoretical strains for soft rest boundary conditions were within 20.3% of the measured strains, the predicted strains from FEA with soft rest boundary conditions were within 3.8% of the measured strains.","Calibration was performed using the method in Sec. 2.2 with C=0.7 in Eq. (4.14); comparisons of the theoretical, FEA, and adjusted \u03b3, along with the average force and zero errors, are shown in Table 4.1, where soft rest boundary conditions were used in FEA; the theoretical \u03b3were for the firm rest boundary conditions and used as the starting point for calibration. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 34 to 83% of their theoretical values. Known forces of 578 N were used for calibration and unknown forces of 801 N were calculated using the same adjusted scaling factors. The average force error before calibration was 18.9%, and it was reduced to 2.8% after calibration. The average zero error before calibration was 25.6%, and it was reduced to 7.1% after calibration. The theoretical bending moment diagram for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moment diagrams, both before and after calibration, for an 801 N force at position 4.5, are shown in . Errors in the bending moment calculations are not reflected in those in load identification [31]. The errors for the calculated magnitudes and positions of the forces for various loading scenarios are shown in Table 4.2. The force errors were within 4.5% after calibration, the zero errors were within 9.9%, and the position errors were within 2.3%. A source of error was the low signal to noise ratio, since the maximum strain gage reading of 268 \u03bc\u03b5 was below the recommended range of 1,000 to 1,500 \u03bc\u03b5 for a strain gage reading [15]. While the two neutral axes for the continuously tapered beam are not collinear, which is needed for the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory [21], and the vertical cross sections used for the theoretical scaling factors are not perpendicular to the neutral axes, they can be accounted for to some extent through calibration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0311","num":"0384"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"350pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4.1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Theoretical, FEA, and adjusted scaling factors for the beam in "},{"entry":"FIG. 90, with the corresponding average force and zero errors"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"15"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"10","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"11","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"12","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"13","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"14","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"15","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"Average","Average"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},"Force","Zero"]},{"entry":["Strain Gage","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","Error","Error"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"15","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Theoretical","0.63","0.95","1.30","1.65","2.01","2.39","2.39","2.01","1.65","1.30","0.95","0.63","18.9%","25.6%"]},{"entry":["Scaling ",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Factor",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["FEA","0.49","0.82","1.35","1.64","1.90","2.45","2.40","2.04","1.68","1.33","1.00","0.48","18.6%","21.9%"]},{"entry":["Scaling ",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Factor",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["Adjusted","0.21","0.52","0.97","1.24","1.56","1.97","1.97","1.60","1.22","0.92","0.57","0.28","\u20022.8%","\u20027.1%"]},{"entry":["Scaling ",{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":"Factor"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"15","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0312","num":"0385"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4.2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Errors for calculated magnitudes and positions of "},{"entry":"forces on the beam in FIG. 90;

The cross section of the beam is a 44.5 mm square box with a 3.2 mm wall thickness (), and its side view with strain gage locations is shown in .","FEA was performed on the beam in  with pinned-roller boundary conditions, zero preloads in the bolts, and a 445 N force at position 4.5, using Abaqus to demonstrate the stress flow in the beam and the stress concentrations due to the presence of a bolted joint (). The finite element model also had an updated Young's modulus, which is 94% of the theoretical value, a coefficient of friction of 1.05 between an aluminum joint plate and the aluminum beam, a coefficient of friction of 0.60 between a steel bolt or nut and an aluminum plate or beam, and soft rest boundary conditions, where the resultant reaction forces were assumed to be 30 mm away from the edges of the abutments [31]. The stress flow in a similar prismatic beam, under a 445 N force at position 4.5, is shown in . It can be seen that the normal flow of stress in  is interrupted by the bolted joint, which affects the strains in the neighborhood of the bolted joint. A comparison of the deflections for the beam with the bolted joint and a similar prismatic beam are shown in , respectively. The predicted deflection for the beam with the bolted joint is 17.6 mm and that for the similar prismatic beam is 3.9 mm. The higher deflection for the beam with the bolted joint is due to the lower stiffness of the joint plates that have a lower moment of inertia then the beam. The linearity of the beam response can be verified from . The Microsoft Excel trend lines display the equations of the lines for the force-strain relationships in  as well as the coefficients of determination R, where R=1 indicates a perfect correlation to a line. FEA was also performed on the beam with a force of 445 N at position 4.5 and bolt tension values of 1.7, 8.5, and 17.0 kN, which would correspond to bolt torque values of 1.36, 6.78, and 13.56 Nm, respectively, according to Eq. (4.3), where a lubricated bolt was assumed to have K=0.1 and \u03a6=8 mm. Comparisons of raw strains due to the preloads in the bolts and the applied load, strains due to the preloads in the bolts, referred to as preload strains, and strains due to the applied load, referred to as zeroed strains, which are obtained by subtracting the preload strains from the raw strains, for different bolt tension values are shown in . While the bolt torque creates higher preload strains near the bolted joint, the preload strains elsewhere on the beam are almost zero. Hence k\u22451 in Eq. (4.5) away from the bolted joint, and the corresponding \u03b3are close to their theoretical values for a continuous beam. While a higher torque value produces a higher preload strain at strain gage , which is closest to the bolted joint, the zeroed strains are almost the same.","The bolt torque was varied experimentally to validate the linear response of the beam in . The responses of strain gages , , and  are shown in  for five different magnitudes of the force at position 6.5 and three different bolt torque values (1.36, 6.78, and 13.56 Nm); the strain gages were zeroed after a preload was applied and before readings were taken. All the lines in  had R>0.9992, which validated that the beam response is linear. For strain gages , , and , the differences among the slopes of the lines for the force-strain relationships were within 3.9%, 1.9%, and 1.6%, respectively, for the three bolt torque values. It was observed that when the bolt torque was changed from 1.36 to 6.78 Nm, strain gages  and  increased by about 190 \u03bc\u03b5, while the other strain gages that were away from the bolted joint stayed within 2 \u03bc\u03b5, which is consistent with the FEA result. Similarly, when the bolt torque was changed from 6.78 to 13.56 Nm, strain gages  and  increased by about 150 \u03bc\u03b5, while the other strain gages stayed within 2 \u03bc\u03b5. Comparisons of the theoretical and calculated bending moment diagrams for the three torque values, for a 445 N force at position 4.5, are shown in . Comparisons of the theoretical strains for firm rest boundary conditions, the measured strains for the bolt torque of 13.56 Nm, and the corresponding zeroed strains from FEA are shown in . There were drops in the measured strains at strain gages  and  and the corresponding zeroed strains from FEA because the bolted joint stiffens the beam in its neighborhood.","The theoretical bending moments for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moments from a global scaling factor, which is 93% of its theoretical value, for a 445 N force at position 9.5, have noticeable discrepancies at strain gages  and  due to the stiffening effect of the bolted joint ().

force transducer methodology was used to measure the magnitude and location of a load on a portable army bridge on the Bridge Crossing Simulator (BCS), which is operated by the US Army Aberdeen Test Center at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, USA (). The BCS tests portable army bridges for fatigue failure by simulating thousands of vehicle crossings. The BCS consists of ten pairs of hydraulic cylinders; the two cylinders in each pair are connected by a Whiffle, which applies a load to the bridge via eight pads, as shown in . First, a bridge is set up on dirt abutments and measured strains from the bridge are collected from vehicles with various crossing speeds. Next, the bridge is set up on the BCS with wood abutments and straps, which create boundary conditions that are between rest and fixed boundary conditions, and loads from multiple Whiffles are applied to the bridge to simulate various crossing speeds of vehicles. A load identification methodology can be used to identify cylinder loads that need to be applied, from measured strains from live crossings of vehicles.","The portable army bridge shown in  has a span of 46 meters, a height of 1.2 meters, a width of 4.3 meters, and a cross section that consists of four I-shaped beams and a deck, as shown in . Twenty uniaxial strain gages were bonded along the bottom flange of the bridge () at the hydraulic cylinder locations. The bridge consists of eight modules, as shown in , which are connected by bolted joints, and each module has many welded and bolted joints. The BCS was used to apply two known 89 kN forces at the roadside and curbside matching cylinders in , at various locations along the bridge. The resultant force from each cylinder consists of four distributed forces at the pads, as shown in . Since the force applied on each side is at a strain gage location, a force transducer used to identify the force was formed by two strain gages to the left of the force and two to the right. The zero errors were calculated by force transducers that do not contain the strain gage at the force position. For instance, to identify the magnitude and position of a force at position 3.0, the force transducer FTwas used; the zero errors were calculated by force transducers FT, FT, and FT. Calibration was performed independently for each side of the bridge using the method in Sec. 4.2.2; the theoretical scaling factors that were calculated from the cross section in  were used as the starting point, and C=1 in Eq. (4.14). The adjusted scaling factors are shown in Table 4.7. Since the bridge has many welded and bolted joints and the end modules have variable cross sections, the scaling factors of the strain gages at various locations along the bridge differed significantly, with the maximum to minimum scaling factor ratio being 147%. However, since the bridge is almost symmetric from the roadside to the curbside, the roadside to curbside scaling factor ratio is between 90 to 107%. The adjusted scaling factors ranged from 75 to 110% of their theoretical values. Two unknown forces of 67 kN were applied at the roadside and curbside matching cylinders in four weight areas of the roadside and curbside force transducers, with the results shown in Tables 4.8 and 4.9. The roadside force errors were within 5.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 13.7%, and the position errors were within 5.3%. The curbside force errors were within 3.8% after calibration, the zero errors were within 13.2%, and the position errors were within 5.1%. The theoretical bending moment diagram for firm rest boundary conditions and the calculated bending moment diagram for two 67 kN forces at position 5.0 are shown in . The reaction moments at the boundaries were calculated to be negative due to the straps at the abutments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0325","num":"0398"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00017","num":"00017"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of a slender beam with welded and bolted joints, the magnitude and location of a load on the beam can be accurately identified. Each force transducer can also identify a zero load when the load on the beam is located outside the force transducer. The force transducer methodology will work for any slender non-continuous, non-homogenous beam with variable cross sections and different types of boundary conditions, as long as the response of the beam is linear. The theoretical scaling factors are calculated from geometric and material properties of the beam, and adjusted during a calibration procedure to account for the joint and other effects.","Experiments were performed on slender beams with welded and bolted joints and rest boundary conditions. For the continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints in Sec. 4.3.1, the force errors were within 4.5% after calibration, the zero errors were within 9.9%, and the position errors were within 2.3%. The adjusted scaling factors differed significantly from the theoretical scaling factors and the calibration procedure reduced the average force error from 18.9% to 2.8%. For the aluminum beam with a bolted joint in Sec. 4.3.2, the force errors were within 5.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 9.6%, and the position errors were within 1.7%. The adjusted scaling factors were within 7% of the theoretical scaling factors. FEA for zero preloads in the bolts and experiments for different bolt torque values confirmed that the response of the beam was linear. For a half aluminum and half steel beam with a bolted joint in Sec. 4.3.3, the force errors were within 4.7% after calibration, the zero errors were within 4.6%, and the position errors were within 1.0%. The adjusted scaling factors were within 6% of the theoretical scaling factors. The force transducer methodology was validated on a non-continuous and non-homogenous beam with two different cross sections in this case. For the portable army bridge on the BCS in Sec. 4.3.4, the force errors were within 5.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 13.7%, and the position errors were within 5.3%. While the scaling factors differed significantly along the bridge, the roadside and curbside scaling factors were within 7% of each other. The theoretical scaling factors were a good starting point for calibration in all cases.","Chapter 5: Conclusion","5.1 Summary","A unique strain gage based method has been developed that can identify the magnitude and location of a load within a weight area of a force transducer. When the load is outside the force transducer, a zero load is accurately identified without influence from other loads on the beam. The load can be a concentrated load, distributed load or a combination of each. The goal of the force transducer methodology was to have force errors within 5%, zero errors within 10%, and position errors within 5%. For the experimental results of Chapter 2, the force errors were within 3.7% after calibration for the prismatic beams and within 4.0% for the continuously tapered beam. The zero errors were within 5.1% for the prismatic beams and within 5.7% for the continuously tapered beam. The location of the load was accurately calculated with an error within 0.1% for the steel beam with a precise string loading. The locations of the loads for the other cases were within an error of 2.3%.","The force transducer methodology was also applied to multiple loads on a beam that are separated by two strain gage locations. For the experimental results of Chapter 3, the force errors were within 4.3%, the zero errors were within 6.3%, and the position errors were within 1.1%. A new strain gage based method was developed using shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of a beam along with the uniaxial strain gages mounted on the bottom surface of the beam. For the case of two loads separated by one strain gage location, the force errors were within 6.3% after calibration, the zero errors were within 5.0%, and the position errors were within 1.0%.","The force transducer methodology was applied to beams with welded and bolted joints in Chapter 4, with stress concentration factors due to the joints being accounted for through the calibration procedure developed here. Experiments were performed on three laboratory beams as well as a portable army bridge on the BCS. For a continuously tapered aluminum beam with a series of welded joints, the force errors were within 4.5%, the zero errors were within 9.9%, and the position errors were within 2.3%. For an aluminum beam with a bolted joint, the force errors were within 5.3%, the zero errors were within 9.6%, and the position errors were within 1.7%. For a half aluminum and half steel beam with a bolted joint, the force errors were within 4.7%, the zero errors were within 4.6%, and the position errors were within 1.0%. For the portable army bridge on the BCS, the force errors were within 5.3%, the zero errors were within 13.7%, and the position errors were within 5.3%.","5.2 Contributions, Advantages, and Limitations","The force transducer methodology developed here successfully identifies the magnitudes and locations of loads on non-continuous, non-homogenous, slender beams with variable cross sections, welded and bolted joints, and pinned, firm rest, soft rest, pinned-fixed, and fixed boundary conditions, by using four uniaxial strain gages mounted to the bottom surface of the beam, when adjacent loads are separated by two strain gage locations. It is also used to determine the boundary conditions by calculating the bending moment diagram. When there are multiple loads separated by only one strain gage location, another method developed here uses two shear gages mounted on the neutral axis of the beam, one on each side of a load, to identify the magnitude of the load in this case. A combination of two uniaxial strain gages and two shear gages, with one uniaxial strain gage and one shear gage at the same location on each side of a load, is used to identify the location of the load. These methods have not been developed before and are innovative to the field of load identification. The calibration method and corresponding calibration matrix developed here is innovative and useful for strain gage based force transducers. By systematically applying known nonzero loads along the beam in various weight areas, both the nonzero load and nonzero loads are accounted for through calibration. The Microsoft Excel Solver is used to optimize the individual scaling factors of strain gages, while reducing the maximum force and zero errors.","The assumptions of the strain gage based methods are:\n\n","A limitation of the theory at this point is that the beam should be a slender beam governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. Another limitation of the force transducer methodology is when two forces are separated by one uniaxial strain gage, the problem is ill-posed. However, the additional strain gage based method developed here using shear gages creates a unique solution for that case.","5.3 Future Work","Future research will be conducting static experiments on the portable army bridge on the BCS using shear gages to determine loads separated by one strain gage location. Additional research will be the application of the strain gage based methods to determine the magnitude and location of dynamic loads on a bridge. As long as the sampling rate of the strain data is sufficiently high, the methods would work for static and dynamic loads. Specifically, the dynamic loading can be used to identify the cylinder forces for the BCS at Aberdeen Test Center. A computer algorithm can be developed to identify the magnitudes and locations of dynamic loads on a bridge by filtering zero loads below a threshold (i.e. 10% of the load), and calculating the vehicle speed. Another type of bridge that can be tested on the BCS is a truss bridge based off of the Bailey Bridge design as shown in . The load identification methods developed here can be extended for a truss bridge with periodically changing cross sections. The methods developed here can also be extended to a bridge with multiple supports.","The existing methodology can be tested on commercial bridges as well as army bridges. There are additional challenges of commercial bridges that do not exist for the portable army bridge used here: there can be additional supports under the bridge, there can be a nonlinear response such as for a concrete bridge, there can be small strain readings which can yield a low signal to noise ratio, and vehicles can cross at high speeds giving a large dynamic effect. It is also possible that a vehicle that is accelerating can produce large longitudinal loads that were not accounted for in this methodology.","Other future research can be developing a more robust method to determine the accuracy of experimental boundary conditions, by recreating the bending moment curve and calculating the reaction moments at the end abutments. The distinction between firm rest and soft rest can be determined using strain data, and can be applied also to military bridges resting on dirt end abutments. The accuracy of a simulated fixed boundary created from a clamp can be determined by calculating the reaction moments.","Lastly, future research can focus on non-slender beams that are governed by the Timoshenko beam theory instead of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. It is possible that the strain gage based methods developed here can be extended to such non-slender beams if the beam response is linear at the strain gage locations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0340","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["[1] Zhu, X.
