{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to modeling environments for dynamic systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to interfacing with models regardless of model type.","Many organizations are embracing the paradigm of Model Based Development in their production processes. \u201cModel Based Development\u201d refers to the practice of specifying, analyzing, and implementing systems using a common \u201cmodel\u201d containing a set of block diagrams and associated objects. System implementation typically involves automatically generating code for portions of the model, particularly portions corresponding to the system's control algorithm.","Graphical modeling environments are an example of software applications that may enable a user to model dynamic systems i.e., systems whose outputs change over time, using a graphical model, such as a block diagram. Some graphical modeling environments also enable simulation and analysis of models. Simulating a dynamic system in a graphical modeling environment is typically a two-step process. First, a user creates a graphical model, such as a block diagram, of the system to be simulated. A graphical model may be created using a graphical user interface, such as a graphical model editor. The graphical model depicts time-based relationships between the systems inputs, states, parameters and outputs. After creation of the graphical model, the behavior of the dynamic system over a specified time period is simulated using the information entered into the graphical model. In this step, the graphical model is used to compute and trace the temporal evolution of the dynamic systems' outputs (\u201cexecute the graphical model\u201d), and automatically produce either deployable software systems or descriptions of hardware systems that mimic the behavior of either the entire model or portions of the model (code generation).","Dynamic systems may also be modeled textually. In this methodology, dynamic systems are described in an application specific language or code. Using this textual description, the dynamic system may be simulated and analyzed. Simulating a dynamic system in a textual modeling environment is typically a two-step process. First, a user creates a textual model, such as an M-file or LTI model, of the system to be simulated. A textual model may be created using a textual user interface, such as a textual model editor. The textual model depicts time-based relationships between the systems inputs, states, parameters and outputs. After creation of the textual model, the behavior of the dynamic system over a specified time period is simulated using the information entered into the textual model. In this step, the textual model is used to compute and trace the temporal evolution of the dynamic systems' outputs (\u201cexecute the graphical model\u201d), and automatically produce either deployable software systems or descriptions of hardware systems that mimic the behavior of either the entire model or portions of the model (code generation).","There are many different techniques for modeling systems using different modeling environments. One problem with this is that a model created in one modeling environment may not be compatible with another modeling environment. As such, toolboxes possessing tools and functions of interest for use with a model may not be compatible with the modeling environment the model was created in. Thus what is need is a simple convenient way of interfacing a model regardless of model type.","The present invention provides a method and system for interfacing with a model, regardless of model type.","In accordance with a first aspect, a method is provided for use in a modeling environment. The method involves providing an abstract interface for interfacing a model. The abstract interface is compatible with a plurality of model types. Then a call is made to a dynamic model via a method specified in a concrete implementation of the abstract interface. Data is then received from the dynamic model in response to the call.","In accordance with another aspect, a medium is proved for use with a computing device. The medium holds instructions executable by the computing device for performing a method. The method involves providing an abstract interface for interfacing a model, wherein the abstract interface is compatible with a plurality of model types; making a call to a dynamic model via a method specified in the abstract interface; and receiving data from the dynamic model in response to the call.","In accordance with another aspect, a system is provided for executing a modeling application. The system involves user-operable input means for inputting data to the physical modeling application; a display device for displaying a physical model; and a computing device including memory for storing computer program instructions and data, and at least one processor for executing the stored computer program instructions. The computer program instructions include instructions for providing an abstract interface for interfacing a model, the abstract interface being compatible with a plurality of model types; making a call to a dynamic model via a method specified in the abstract interface; and receiving data from the dynamic model in response to the call.","In accordance with another aspect, a system is provided for executing a modeling application. The system includes a distribution server for providing to a client device, an abstract interface for interfacing a model, the abstract interface being compatible with a plurality of model types; and a client device in communication with the distribution server. The client device can make a call to the dynamic model in the distribution server via a method specified in the abstract interface and receive data from the dynamic model in response to the call.","In accordance with another aspect, a method is proved for network having a server, executing a physical modeling environment, and a client device in communication with the server. The method involves the steps of: providing, at the server, a dynamic model of a system; providing an abstract interface for interfacing a model, the abstract interface being compatible with a plurality of model types; receiving, at the server from the client device, a call to a dynamic model via a method specified in the abstract interface; and receiving data from the dynamic model in response to the call.","An illustrative embodiment of the present invention is directed to creating a universal object class representation of a model which can be interfaced by a number of modeling environments. The present invention will be described relative to illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a number of different applications and embodiments and is not specifically limited in its application to the particular embodiments depicted herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","4","7"]},"Typically, the interaction of a human user with the computing device  occurs through an input\/output (I\/O) device , such as a graphical user interface (GUI). The I\/O device  may include a display device (such as a monitor) and an input device (such as a mouse and a keyboard and other suitable conventional I\/O peripherals.","For example, the memory  holds a modeling application  capable of creating and simulating digital versions of system models, such as block diagrams, state diagrams, signal diagrams, flow chart diagrams, sequence diagrams, UML diagrams, dataflow diagrams, circuit diagrams, ladder logic diagrams, kinematic element diagrams, or other models, which may be displayed to a user  via the display device . In the illustrative embodiment, the modeling application  comprises a MATLAB modeling environment, such as Simulink\u00ae or another suitable modeling environment. As used herein, the terms \u201cmodeling environment\u201d and \u201cphysical modeling environment\u201d refer to an application where a model, such as a model of a physical system, is created and translated into executable instructions. Examples of suitable modeling applications include, but are not limited to MATLAB, including Simulink, SimMechanics, and SimDriveline from the MathWorks, Inc.; LabVIEW, DasyLab and DiaDem from National Instruments Corporation, VEE from Agilent, SoftWIRE from Measurement Computing, VisSim from Visual Solutions, SystemVIEW from Elanix, WiT from Coreco, Vision Program Manager from PPT Vision, Khoros from Khoral Research, and numerous others. The memory  may comprise any suitable installation medium, e.g., a CD-ROM, floppy disks, or tape device; a computer system memory or random access memory such as DRAM, SRAM, EDO RAM, Rambus RAM, etc.; or a non-volatile memory such as a magnetic media, e.g., a hard drive, or optical storage. The memory may comprise other types of memory as well, or combinations thereof.","In an alternate embodiment, the computing device  is also interfaced with a network, such as the Internet. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the diagrams used by the diagramming application  may be stored either locally on the computing device  or at a remote location  interfaced with the computing device over a network. Similarly, the diagramming application  may be stored on a networked server or a remote peer.","The modeling application  of an illustrative embodiment of the invention includes a number of generic components. Although the discussion contained herein focuses on MATLAB from The MathWorks, Inc. of, Natick Mass., those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is applicable to other software applications. The generic components of the illustrative diagramming program  include a model editor for specifying models of dynamic systems. The model editor allows users to perform such actions as construct, edit, display, annotate, save, and print out a model that represents a physical system. The illustrative diagramming application  also includes elements libraries that contain elements that may be combined to model systems. There may also be a graphical aspect that allows graphical modeling. An execution engine , also implemented in the application, is used to process a model to produce simulation results or to convert the model to executable code. The execution engine translates a model to executable entities. The executable entities are compiled and executed on a computational device, such as a computer, to implement the functionality specified by the model. Typically, the code generation preserves a model hierarchy in a call graph of the generated code. For instance, each subsystem of a model in a physical modeling environment can map to a user specified function and the generated code. Real-Time Workshop from the MathWorks, Inc. of Natick, Massachusetts is an example of a suitable execution engine for generating code.","In the illustrative embodiment, the modeling program  is implemented as a companion program to a technical computing program, such as MATLAB, also available from the MathWorks, Inc.","The model editor is the component that allows a user to create and modify a model representing a physical system. The model editor also allows a user to create and store data relating to model element . A textual interface with a set of commands allows interaction with the model editor. Using this textual interface, users may write special scripts that perform automatic editing operations on the model. A user generally interacts with a set of windows that act as canvases for the model. There is generally more than one window for a model because models may be partitioned into multiple hierarchical levels through the use of subsystems.","Once a model has been constructed using the editor , the execution engine simulates the model by solving equations defined by the model to trace the system outputs as a function of time. The solution of the model, which may be referred to as model execution, is carried out over a user-specified time span for a set of user-specified inputs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"maths":[{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mover":[{"mi":"x","mo":"."},{"mo":["=","."]}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"d","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}}}]}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"b","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}]}}},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}]}},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"b","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}]}}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"}]},{"mtd":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}]}},{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"b","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"k","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"b","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mi":"b","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"2"}]}}}]}]}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"x"},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"m","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}}]}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","="],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.4em","height":"1.4ex"}}}]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001-2","num":"00001.2"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"y","mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"}]}]}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"x"},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"0"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"F"}],"mo":"+"}}}}],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["The default parameter values are m=[1,2]kg, k=[100,200]N\/m, and b=[10, 20]Ns\/m.","These model equations can be implemented in an M-file to be solved.

As such, toolboxes possessing tools and functions of interest may be compatible with one model but not another. For example, Simulink Parameter Estimation (SPE), Simulink Response Optimization (SRO), and Simulation Control Design (SCD) toolboxes can only be used with Simulink models. Likewise the Control System Toolbox (CST) can only be used with LTI models.

An API is a set of definitions of the ways one piece of computer software communicates with another. The API provides a set of routines, protocols, and tools for allowing communication between the software applications, for example the model and toolbox. Using these routines, protocols and tools the toolbox or modeling environment can interface with the model.","In one embodiment, the abstract interface is implemented using a model object class.
