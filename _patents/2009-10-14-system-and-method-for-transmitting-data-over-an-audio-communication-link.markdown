Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to the transmission of data between devices having a limited short-range audio communication link and, particularly, to a system and method for transmitting data over an audio communication link using audio tones.","2. Description of the Related Art","Modern mobile phones offer advanced capabilities, often with PC-like functionality. Such mobile devices often include powerful processors, abundant memory, large screens and complex operating systems. In many cases, these mobile devices include various applications and store considerable user data. Users often find themselves needing to transfer information to and from these mobile devices to other nearby devices, such as laptops, personal computers, other mobile devices, etc.","Many mobile devices employ Bluetooth technology to communicate with nearby devices. Bluetooth is a wireless telecommunications technology that provides an open standard for short-range wireless transmission of digital voice and data between mobile devices, such as laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), phones, desktop devices, etc. Each Bluetooth-enabled device includes a radio transceiver and operates in a globally-available frequency band. Furthermore, use of the Bluetooth technology can be limited by the mobile device provider to specific categories of use called profiles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},"In , mobile device  communicates with a Bluetooth enabled ear piece  over an audio link . In order to use Bluetooth technology, a device must be compatible with certain Bluetooth profiles, which define the possible applications for the technology. For example, different Bluetooth profiles exist for wireless communication between a mobile phone and a hands-free headset, wireless communication with PC input and output devices (e.g., mouse and keyboard), wireless communication for data transfer, etc. Accordingly, in , audio link  between mobile device  and wireless ear piece  uses a Bluetooth profile for wireless communication between a mobile phone and a hands-free headset. This Bluetooth profile is limited to the transmission of audio tones. In addition, the mobile device  may be further limited to the uses set forth by a service provider associated with the mobile device or manufacturer of the mobile device.","In , mobile device  communicates with a Bluetooth enabled laptop  over a file transfer link . In this example, file transfer link , between mobile device  and laptop , uses the Bluetooth profile for wireless file transfer. This profile provides for digital data transfer, but not for transferring audio streams.","While Bluetooth has certain advantages over cellular networks with respect to short-range communication, many cellular service providers limit the use of their Bluetooth enabled devices to specific profiles or limited specific uses within profiles. This forces subscribers to pay for wireless data plans or pay for data transfer on a per MB basis. For example, the current iPhone\u2122, manufactured by Apple\u2122, may have Bluetooth technology limited to audio-only communications. Accordingly, users may be unable to transfer data using the Bluetooth communication link except via a cellular network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1C","FIG. 1C"],"b":["10","35","10","50","55","55","60","70","35"]},"Consequently, there is a need for a method and system that would allow a user to transfer data to and from a mobile device using a Bluetooth technology, in cases where the Bluetooth technology is restricted or otherwise limited to audio tone transmissions.","The present invention provides a system and method that allows a given user to transfer data to and from a mobile device to another device using a short-range audio communication link. For example, the mobile device may communicate with another device using Bluetooth communication technology in cases where the Bluetooth technology is restricted or otherwise limited to audio or audio tone transmissions.","An example embodiment of the present invention may include a method for transmitting digital data over an audio communication link. The method may include establishing an audio communication link, converting a digital data set to an audio tone sequence, converting the audio tone sequence to a digitized audio signal, transmitting the digitized audio signal from a first communication device to a second communication device over the audio communication link, converting the digitized audio signal to the audio tone sequence, and converting the audio tone sequence to the digital data set.","Another example embodiment of the present invention may include a system for transmitting data over an audio communication link, including a first communication device and a second communication device. The first communication device may include a first data storage medium, a first transceiver, and a first digital-audio data converter. The second communication device may include a second data storage medium, a second transceiver, and a second digital-audio data converter.","The audio communication link may be a wireless, short-range communication link established using the transceivers at both communication devices. These transceivers may be, for example, Bluetooth, infrared, or similar devices capable of communication across a medium. Furthermore, the devices may be limited to the transmission of audio communication across any established communication link. For example, the wireless, short range communication link may be limited or restricted to the transmission of audio data only.","The transceivers may convert audio tone sequences to digitized audio signals and transmit the digitized audio signals from the first communication device to the second communication device over the audio communication link. The transceivers may also convert a received digitized audio signal to an audio tone sequence.","The audio-data converters at each device may convert digital data sets to audio tone sequences, and vice versa. The data sets may be stored and retrieved from storage media in each communication device.","The audio tone sequences may be analog tone sequences. Alternatively, the audio tone sequences may be audio tones that are represented in a digital format. The audio-digital data converters may be bi-directional data converters, capable of converting audio tones to digital data, and vice versa. Furthermore, the communication of data between the first communication device and the second communication device may be bi-directional, allowing data transfer in both directions across the audio link.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous details are set forth, such as flowcharts, system configurations, and processing architectures in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However, it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.","The present invention provides a system and method for transmitting data over an audio communication link using audio tones. The present invention may be embodied in various forms, including business processes, computer implemented methods, computer program products, computer systems and networks, user interfaces, application programming interfaces, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","110","130","110","130","20","20","20","100","20","20","20","130"]},"While  illustrates a communication system , including mobile device  and laptop , one of ordinary skill will appreciate that the invention is not limited thereto. For example, the present invention may apply to communications between any two or more devices capable of establishing a digital audio link.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["200","110","130"]},"Mobile device  may include a data storage medium , a DAC , a transmission manager , an audio system , a transceiver , and an antenna . Mobile device  may operate in either audio mode, when transmitting audio over audio link , or data-over-audio mode, when transmitting digital data over audio link . The transmission manager may be a process, processor, or any other mechanism that can monitor and manage the outgoing transmission.","Transmission manager  may monitor whether mobile device  is operating in audio mode or data-over-audio mode. Alternatively, transmission manager  may determine whether mobile device  is operating in audio mode or data-over-audio mode.","Audio system  may include the common audio components found in a cellular telephone or similar device, including but not limited to, a microphone for capturing audio and a speaker for the playback of received audio transmissions. In one embodiment, audio system  may provide an analog audio signal in response to user audio input, such as sound received through a microphone. Alternatively, audio system  may employ an audio codec or similar to produce digital audio signals in response to audio input.","When the mobile device  is operating in audio mode, the transmission manager  passively allows the mobile device  to transmit the audio signal from audio system  to laptop . The analog signal output from audio system  may pass through transmission manager  to transceiver .","Transceiver  and antenna  may be any combination of transceiver and antenna capable of transmitting digitized audio. For example, transceiver  may be a Bluetooth communication device, infrared device, or similar. Transceiver  may generate a digitized audio signal from audio received from the transmission manager . The digitized audio signal may be transmitted over audio link . In converting and transmitting the received audio to the digitized audio signal, transceiver  may employ a specific protocol for formatting the digitized audio signal, prior to transmission of the digitized audio signal. For example, transceiver  may employ an audio codec when converting analog audio to the digitized audio signal.","When the mobile device  is switched to operate in data-over-audio mode, either in response to user input or another trigger (e.g., a program needs to transmit data), digital data from data storage medium  may be converted to a data-over-audio tone sequence using a DAC . The data-over-audio tone sequence may, for example, be an analog audio tone sequence. Alternatively, the data-over-audio tone sequence may be a formatted digital audio tone sequence.","In data-over-audio mode, the transmission manager  becomes active and manages the transmission of data-over-audio tone sequences from DAC . When managing the transmission of the data-over-audio tone sequences, the transmission manager  may modify or add to the data-over-audio tone sequence by preceding and\/or appending a notification or termination tone sequence to the transmission. These notification or termination tone sequences provide information regarding the tone sequence transmission and may be used by laptop  to properly receive and process the data-over-audio tone sequence transmission. The data-over-audio tone sequence may be input to transceiver  for conversion into a digitized audio signal and transmission to laptop , along with any preceding or appended tone sequences.","Transceiver  may be limited to the transmission of digitized audio over audio link , being restricted from transmitting non-audio digital data via a hardware or software restrictive means. For example, the input to transceiver  may be limited to analog or audio input. Therefore, by converting the digital data to an audio tone sequence, at DAC , and by providing the resulting tone sequence as input to transceiver , the example embodiment circumvents the limitations on transmitting digital data by transmitting the digital data in the form of a digitized audio signal using transceiver .","In an alternative embodiment, transceiver  may be limited to the input of audio data having a pre-defined format or formats (e.g., wave format, mp3, a proprietary format, etc.). In this alternative embodiment, the audio output of audio system  and DAC  may be in the form of digital audio having the pre-defined digital format. Alternatively, the transmission manager  may convert the output of audio system  or DAC  into the pre-defined format. Transceiver  may then convert the input audio data from the transmission manager  into a digitized form that is appropriate for transmission over audio link . This alternative embodiment similarly circumvents the limitations on transmitting digital data by transmitting the digital data in the form of a digitized audio signal using transceiver .","Laptop  may include a data storage medium , a DAC , a transmission manager , a transceiver , and antenna . Laptop  may operate in either audio mode, when receiving audio over audio link , or data-over-audio mode, when receiving digital data over audio link . The transmission manager may be a process, processor, or any other mechanism that can monitor and determine if the incoming transmission is audio or data-over-audio, and manage the transmission as necessary.","In laptop , the digitized audio signal, transmitted over audio link  from mobile device , may be received by antenna  and input into transceiver . Transceiver  may be a Bluetooth communication device, infrared device, or similar. In this case, antenna  may receive the digitized signal which is converted to audio tone sequences by transceiver . Transceiver  may then output the audio tone sequence or comparable analog signal to transmission manager . Furthermore or alternatively, transceiver  may be limited to the output of audio tones in the form of only an analog or audio output.","Transceiver  may provide the analog data-over-audio tone sequence to transmission manager . Transmission manager  may monitor incoming transmissions to determine if a given incoming transmission contains a data-over-audio tone sequence. For example, transmission manager  may monitor the incoming audio for a notification sequence, which may be followed by a data-over-audio tone sequence, or a termination sequence, which may indicate the end of a data-over-audio tone sequence. Based on the monitored incoming transmission, transmission manager  may operate in audio mode, wherein audio data is not routed to DAC , or in data-over-audio mode, wherein the incoming audio tone sequence is routed to DAC ; DAC  may convert the data-over-audio tone sequence back into digital data. This digital data may then be stored in data storage medium .","In another embodiment, transceiver  may be limited to the output of audio data in a pre-defined format or formats (e.g., wave audio format, mp3 format, etc.). In this embodiment, transceiver  may convert and output the received digitized audio signal as digital audio data having the pre-defined format or formats, DAC  may then convert the audio data to the original digital data from storage medium .","One of ordinary skill will appreciate that the data transfer process employed to transfer data from mobile device  to laptop  may be unidirectional\u2014operating in one direction (e.g., transferring data either to mobile device  from laptop  or from mobile device  to laptop )\u2014or bidirectional (e.g., transferring data to mobile device  from laptop  and from mobile device  to laptop ). Similarly, DAC  and DAC  may be bidirectional data converters, capable of converting a digital data set to audio tones and audio tones to a digital data set, or unidirectional data converters capable of exclusively converting a digital data set to audio tones or audio tones to a digital data set. In the case where the data converters are unidirectional, bidirectional data transmission may still be accomplished by having two unidirectional data converters, four total, at each end of audio link .","One of ordinary skill will appreciate that the data transfer process employed to transfer data from mobile device  to laptop  may be implemented using various approaches. For example, data may be streamed from DAC  through transceiver  onto audio link , or transceiver  may wait until the entire data set has been converted to a data-over-audio tone sequence before converting the entire data-over-audio tone sequence to a digitized audio signal and transmitting the digitized audio signal over audio link . Similarly, the data-over-audio tone sequence may be converted and streamed from transceiver  in real-time to DAC  as it is received, or transceiver  may wait until the entire digitized audio signal is received, prior to converting the digitized audio signal and outputting the data-over-audio tone sequence to DAC .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","110","300","110","300","300","20"]},"The transmission process begins at step , during which mobile device  may be set to audio mode.","At step , mobile device  may establish a wireless, short-range, audio link  with another device, such as laptop .

The mode of operation may be managed by transmission manager , or another component of mobile device .","At step , in response to or after the switch into data-over-audio mode, mobile device  may transmit a notification sequence over audio link  to laptop . The notification sequence may be a tone sequence notifying laptop  that the upcoming tone sequence is a data-over-audio mode transmission.","At step , mobile device  may transmit a data-over-audio tone sequence representing a data set over audio link  to laptop . The data-over-audio tone sequence may be generated by DAC , in response to the data set from data storage medium .","At step , after the successful transmission of the data-over-audio tone sequence, the mobile device  may transmit a termination sequence. The termination sequence may be a tone sequence indicating that mobile device  has completed the data-over-audio transmission.
