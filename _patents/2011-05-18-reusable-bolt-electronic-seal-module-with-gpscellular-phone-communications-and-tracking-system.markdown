title: Reusable bolt electronic seal module with GPS/cellular phone communications and tracking system
abstract: An electronics circuit first portion is entirely within an electronics module housing, sensing and transmitting a tamper condition of a normally locked bolt. The bolt comprises a second portion of the electronics circuit. The seal electronics circuit first portion comprises a seal monitoring, tracking and communications system. The bolt passes through the module housing and is secured with a locking device external the module such that the module is reusable when the bolt is severed. The bolt and module housing include a cooperative contamination sealing arrangement for sealing the bolt to the housing. The electronics circuit first portion includes RFID tamper detection circuitry, GPS, Wi Fi and cell phone communication and tracking technologies. The cell phone technology tracks the seal using cell phone towers and Wi Fi access points and communicates the seal tracked position and seal status data to a cell phone communications center.

The seals include electronics for sensing the locked state of the bolt and for transmitting the locked and tampered states. The seals employ GPS locating and cellular telephone communications & tracking systems for tracking the seal utilizing RFID seal tampering technology.","U.S. Pat.

R. Arguin published Mar. 19, 2009 claiming priority on U.S. provisional application No. 60\/993,599 filed Sep. 13, 2007, all incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","The Lin publication discloses a system for monitoring containers with seals and includes a seal, an electronics monitoring device and a communications center. The monitoring device is connected to the seal which locks the doors. The device detects the seal status and also detects the seal's position using a GPS locating system communicating the data via cell phone technology. The related seal data is sent to a communications center which determines the position of the related container and whether the doors have been tampered with and opened. The seal contains RFID data identifying the seal. A plug is inserted into a socket and detained by a detaining device in the socket. The seal plug is first inserted through a buckle of a door engaged with a buckle of another door, through the seal shell containing the electronics and then into the socket. The monitoring system communicates with a communications center, preferably a mobile phone such as a GPS cell phone through one or more stations and communicates with the communication center through GSM stations.","A detection unit detects the presence of the plug using a micro-switch, a spring-biased switch, or a reed switch. When the plug is torn or cut, the switch detects this and changes the electrical status. In the alternative, a photo-breaker may be used to optically detect the presence of the plug. When the plug is removed by cutting or tearing, the optical path is no longer broken to the optical detector and the seal's tampered state is indicated.","When a reed switch is used, a magnet is also required. The seal plug may be designed to be reused and inserted and pulled from the socket many times. Therefore, in this mode the plug is not permanently locked to the socket.","The Arguin publication discloses a pin (bolt) style cargo seal with a removable tracking module. A pin is inserted into a barrel portion, which is removeably secured to a tracking module wherein the structure coupling the tracking module electronically and mechanically to the barrel and pin is not shown or described. The pin is fixed to the barrel and must be cut with bolt cutters or the like to remove the pin from the barrel. The tracking module includes an optional RFID component which deactivates upon tampering or cutting the bolt. The electronics in the tracking module includes an RFID circuit, which may be active, passive or semi-passive. The electronics includes GPS and cellular technology. The cellular technology is typically Global System for Mobil Communications (GSM) or can be Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or other technologies including General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The GSM system uses TDMA for communication between a mobile phone and a base station, wherein several callers may share the same channel. GPRS can be used for Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) access, short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and internet communication services such as email and World Wide Web. The tracking module includes software with scanning of RFID to verify the seal is valid and not tampered with. However, no electronics structure is shown electrically connecting the tracking module to the pin (bolt) for detecting the state of the pin (bolt) or how the tamper state of the bolt is detected.","Containers are widely employed in the cargo industry. The containers have doors which are locked shut with hasps and secured with locking seals, particularly employing bolts. The bolts typically are steel having a head and shank which is locked to a locking device comprising a body having a shank locking mechanism. Such a device and mechanism are shown for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,700. When the shank is inserted into the body, a locking collet or other structural arrangement permanently locks the shank to the body. Further examples of such seals and locking devices are included in the above referenced US patents.","Cargo containers are shipped via land, sea and air transportation. Hundreds of containers may be on a single ship. When the containers are unloaded they may be subject to tampering and vandalism. It is important that such tampering be immediately noted to preclude theft of valuable cargo. To assist in such theft and tampering prevention, prior art seals are assigned serial numbers. These seals are then assigned and locked to the assigned container. The serial number, container number, the carrier, and the location of the cargo are entered into a local computer. The entry then is manually made to show that the container is being shipped out of that location. Should a seal be tampered with, this most likely will occur at a different time and different location.","An electronic tagging device is commercially available that is programmable and which transmits information that is programmed, such as tagging identification serial numbers and other information as desired. This is referred to as radio frequency identification (RFID) which is well known in the art. Generally, an RFID tag will have a radio frequency (RF) transmitter, an RF receiver, an RF modulator, and a memory. The memory retains the digital code manifesting the identification number. The RF modulator extracts the digital code representing the identification number as a modulated signal, which is applied to the RF transmitter. The RF receiver receives interrogation and control signals which manifest a request for the identification number.","Such systems provide security tagging for high value merchandise as it is transferred from the manufacturer to the consumer. Other applications include tagging of animals, humans and vehicles such as trucks and their cargo containers. Other applications include automatic toll collection systems.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["214","216","218","216","220","218","222","224","218","220","226","228","230","218","232","234","230","224","232","222","232","218"]},"The RFID tag \u2032 has an antenna \u2032 and a receiver \u2032 to receive the interrogation command signal \u2032 from the interrogator \u2032. The receiver \u2032 transfers the received command signal to a controller \u2032. The controller \u2032 interprets the command and extracts the corresponding identification number (ID) from memory \u2032. The extracted identification number is then transferred by the controller \u2032 to transmitter \u2032 which transmits the ID to antenna \u2032 which broadcasts the signal \u2032.","In active RFID tags, power \u2032 is provided by a battery system. In passive systems, the power is induced from the received signal. The signal \u2032 transmitted by the RFID tag \u2032 is modulated back scatter of the original signal transmitted by the interrogator \u2032.","The controller \u2032 may have an interface, not shown, to receive data from external transponders such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, global positioning sensing and other telemetric measurement data.","Commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,265,973 discloses an electronic security seal which is used with a steel bolt having an insulating coating thereon and a metallic coating on the insulating coating. The metallic coating is in ohmic contact with the bolt head to form a continuous conductor with the bolt shank. A pair of electrical contacts engage the shank and metallic coating to form a circuit path between the contacts. The contacts are coupled to the circuit for sensing a break in the path manifesting a tampered condition wherein the bolt may have been severed opening the path.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,238 discloses an electronic security seal using a stranded cable shackle having an internal conductor whose resistance manifests the tampered state of the device and which resistance is monitored by the circuit. This exhibits a similar problem as the '973 patent discussed above. When the shackle is destroyed to open the seal, the entire assembly needs to be discarded. This too is costly.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,666 discloses an electrical connector for a cylindrical member such as a steel bolt. Disclosed are a pair of spaced apart rings or similar shaped contacts that make contact with the bolt for completing the circuit between the bolt and sensing circuit. The circuit is for generating a signal manifesting a tampered state of the bolt when the bolt is severed breaking the circuit. The bolt in this device if severed to open the seal results also in the entire assembly being discarded, a costly system.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,042,354 (which includes a family of U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,778,083, 6,791,465, and US publications 2006\/0170560 and 2006\/0109111) discloses a tamper resistant electronic security seal. The seal comprises a bolt shank, a head which houses the seal circuitry and a bolt locking device which mates with a groove in the bolt shank similar to prior art locking devices. Such a device is shown for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,802,700 and 5,005,883. To open the seal sealed with such a bolt, the bolt needs to be severed and the entire assembly is discarded as the locking device is permanently attached to the bolt via a groove in the bolt. This presents the same problem of cost in using this seal as the seals described above.","U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,558 ('558) to Thorne describes an electronic bolt type security seal using two adjacent magnetic fields as bolt sensors. The fields are generated by two corresponding coils located in corresponding two adjacent arms extending from an electronic seal module housing the rest of the circuitry. The bolt passes through the arms and coils. A locking device is attached to the bolt to secure the bolt to a hasp. When the bolt is severed, the seal module and arms may be reused. However, this design is different than the commercially available modules of the prior art seals discussed above, which seals require that the electronic modules be discarded when the bolts are opened and also discarded. This patent does not solve the problem with those other prior art electronic bolt seals, because it uses a different circuitry than the prior art circuitry commonly used.","The present inventors recognize a need for use of an electronic module that employs prior art circuitry wherein the bolt forms a secondary portion of the circuitry to form a low cost seal and a communication system that is versatile and can communicate continuously as well as track the seal during its travels in the locked state. The use of a low cost seal system represents a problem not addressed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,747,558. The relatively small coil portion of the circuitry (not used in conventional seal tamper evident circuits) is housed in arms separate from the electronics circuitry housing for the majority of the involved circuits etc. That is, the detection circuitry is not entirely within a single housing and makes the system more costly than a single module system.","Further, the bolt is not part of the circuit, but is used only to transmit magnet fields somewhat in a similar manner to a switch. When the bolt is present the magnetic field of one coil is transmitted to a second coil of the detection circuit, which coil normally can not detect the field without the bolt being present. The detection circuit detects the magnetic field in this second coil. The two coils are in separate housings that are attached to an arm. The arm is attached to the main circuit module housing. When the bolt is inserted through the two coils it is also inserted into the hasp for locking the hasp. The two coils form a part of the detection circuit, but are in costly separate housings. This is more costly than a single housing as desired by the present inventors.","The Lin publication does not use a bolt that completes the detection circuit and does not form a part of the detection circuit, but rather includes switches and optical devices, which mechanically open and close the circuit in response to the presence of a bolt. No circuit is employed in the disclosed bolts, which are only used to physically activate a switch when present. When the bolt is absent, the switches have one on\/off state manifesting the tampered unlocked state and when the bolt is present, the switches switch to their other state manifesting the normal locked condition.","The U.S. Pat. No. '558 also describes seals with reusable housings and disposable bolts. These seals are not described as being electronic. In this description, an end of the bolt is locked inside the seal housing not otherwise described. To open the seal the bolt is cut with a bolt cutter. The end of the bolt inside the housing can then be removed by sliding the remaining bolt portion out of the housing in the same direction as the insertion direction. This seems to require the housing to be opened to access the bolt fragment to remove it from the housing. No drawing or reference document is cited by the '558 patent showing the particular device being described therein. While this device may solve the problem of providing a reusable housing, it does not seem to be directed to electronic seals.","The cited circuit housing described by '558 appears to be needed to be opened to remove the remnant of the cut bolt from inside the housing. In electronic seals, opening the housing is not desirable as the electronic circuitry inside the housing may become contaminated and unusable. The present inventors recognize a need for a low cost electronic seal module that is both reusable and which need not be opened to reuse the module and thus avoid contaminating the interior circuit. A need is also recognized for a reusable electronic seal module for use with conventional tamper evident circuits and conventional bolt locking devices and indicative security seals which are not as robust as a bolt seal, are lower cost and provided mainly to show tamper evidence. Such tamper evidence further reduces the cost of the system as recognized by the present inventors.","The latter seals are of the strap, padlock and similar arrangements typically made of thermoplastic and are low cost. They are used to indicate tampering with various hasps such as used on electric or gas meters, mini bars as used in hotels and airlines, and a host of other applications where tamper evidence is desired rather than a robust secure locking device as provided by bolt seals in particular.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,650 discloses an electrically conductive synthetic resin bolt.","German document DE 010322648 discloses plastic fixing screws for door lock cylinders with embedded conductive strips to operate an alarm if the bolt is deformed by tampering.","Int'l application WO 2006\/074518 discloses a transponder bolt seal and a housing for a transponder. An actuator is actuated upon engagement of the sealing mechanism to render the transponder operable. Insertion of a locking member into a receptacle causes the actuator to actuate. The device has a curved shape with a convex side facing away from the sealing mechanism and a concave side facing the sealing mechanism. A cover is used and if the bolt is removed, the cover is damaged, and thus this seal is not reusable if the bolt is removed to open the seal. This application does not address the need for a less costly seal system employing a reusable electronic seal module for use with conventional bolts and locking devices.","The present inventors also recognize a need for a low cost electronic seal that uses GPS and cell phone communication and tracking technology to enhance seal tracking and also to enhance efficient and real time reporting of tampered seals and their locations.","In one embodiment, an electronic security bolt seal with a reusable electronics module for locking a hasp comprises an electronics circuit having first and second portions; an electronic module comprising a housing having a cavity, the first portion of the electronics circuit being entirely in the cavity for monitoring the tamper status of the seal; a bolt

completing the electronics circuit and for engaging the hasp to be locked; a bolt locking device engaged with and locked to the bolt external the module to secure the module to the bolt in the locked state and to lock the bolt to the hasp, the electronics circuit for sensing the integrity of the engaged locked bolt manifesting the seal tamper state, the locked bolt having an exposed region

bolt for subsequent reuse of the module; and a tracking and communications system employing the electronics circuit first portion attached to the module for communicating the seal monitored status and the seal's position to a communications center.","In a further embodiment, the tracking and communications system comprises a GPS system comprising a GPS receiving unit coupled to the electronics circuit first portion for receiving and processing seal positioning signals from GPS satellites.","In a further embodiment, the tracking and communications system comprises a cellular phone communications unit coupled to the electronics circuit first portion and which unit communicates with a communications center via cellular towers.","In a further embodiment, the tracking and communications system detects and tracks the geographic position of the seal via a cellular phone tracking system coupled to the circuit first portion, the tracking and communications system comprising a cellular phone communications unit which sends seal status data from the circuit first portion and seal tracking data from the tracking system to a communications center via the communication unit and cellular towers.","In a further embodiment, the seal tracking and communications system comprises a GPS tracking system and a cellular phone tracking system coupled to the electronics circuit first portion and a controller for selecting one of the GPS and cellular phone tracking systems to track the position of the seal.","In a further embodiment, the communications system includes a cellular phone communications unit for communicating to a communications center via cellular towers.","In a further embodiment, the seal tracking and communications system comprises a cellular phone tracking system coupled to the electronics circuit first portion, the cellular phone tracking system comprising an electronic arrangement for inputting cellular tower location data identifying the location of each of a plurality of towers adjacent to the seal for computing the location of the seal by triangulation computation of the inputted plurality of tower location data.","In a further embodiment, the tracking and communications system comprises a GPS system comprising a GPS receiving unit coupled to the electronics circuit first portion for receiving seal positioning signals from GPS satellites, the electronics circuit first portion for processing the received GPS positioning signals to track the position of the seal.","In a further embodiment, the seal tracking and communications system comprises a cellular phone tracking system coupled to the electronics circuit first portion, the cellular phone tracking system comprising an electronic arrangement for inputting Wi Fi access points location data identifying the location of each of a plurality of Wi Fi access points adjacent to the seal for computing the location of the seal by triangulation computation of the inputted plurality of access points location data.","In a further embodiment, the seal tracking and communications system comprises a cellular phone tracking system coupled to the electronics circuit first portion, the cellular phone tracking system comprising an electronic arrangement for inputting Wi Fi access points and cellular tower locations data identifying the location of each of a plurality of towers and Wi Fi access points adjacent to the seal for computing the location of the seal by triangulation computation of the inputted plurality of tower locations and Wi Fi access points data.","In a further embodiment, the bolt includes first and second electrically conductive members in electrical isolation from each other forming the second circuit portion and ohmically engaging the electronics circuit first portion to form a circuit path to the electronics circuit first portion.","In a further embodiment, the bolt passes completely through the module, the bolt and module including a contamination sealing arrangement for cooperatively sealing the module cavity from ambient region contamination external the cavity.","In a further embodiment, the bolt is dimensioned to pass through the housing and includes a tip portion protruding from the housing, the tip portion and the locking device being arranged to lock the locking device to the tip portion, further including a contamination sealing arrangement for sealing the module cavity from contamination from the external ambient region in cooperation with the bolt.","In a further embodiment, the bolt is dimensioned to pass through the housing in a compartment in the cavity from an ingress first aperture and egress the housing at a second aperture, the bolt including a tip portion protruding from the housing through the second aperture, the tip portion and the locking device being arranged to lock the locking device to the tip portion, further including a contamination sealing arrangement comprising a grommet on the housing at the second aperture and a sealing element attached to the bolt for sealing the first aperture when the bolt is in a position for being locked, the grommet and sealing element for sealing the module compartment from ambient external contamination.","In a further embodiment, the bolt has a tip region, and includes a first sealing element intermediate the bolt head and the tip region, the housing has a second sealing element for engaging the bolt at the tip region.","In a further embodiment, the bolt has a tip region, and includes a first tapered sealing element surrounding the bolt at a location intermediate the bolt head and the tip region, the housing having a second sealing element for engaging the bolt at the tip region, the module being secured in a region that is generally between the first and second sealing elements.","In , electronic bolt type security seal  according to one embodiment of the present invention includes an electronic seal module , a bolt  and a locking device  (and , without outer shell  of ). The bolt is locked to a hasp  comprising staples , \u2032, and to the module  by the locking device . The module  comprises a housing  having a cavity and internal components in the cavity to be described below. The bolt seal  locks the hasp staples , \u2032 and releasably secures the module  to the staples as well. The staples , \u2032 may be part of a cargo container door  and door jamb \u2032, for example, for locking the container door  shut.","In , the bolt  has a head  and a shank , which is circular cylindrical, but may be other shapes. The shank  has a tip portion  which protrudes through the housing of the module . The bolt has a tip portion  that protrudes from the module  and is locked to the locking device  via an annular groove  in the outer circumferential surface of the bolt tip portion .","In , the locking device  (without the shell ) is shown in more detail. The locking device has a steel body  with a cavity . Inside the cavity , there is a locking mechanism  which comprises a partial spring steel ring . The ring  is received in internal annular stepped groove  in the locking body  cavity , a longitudinal bore. The groove  has an enlarged tapered section and a smaller diameter cylindrical portion in the cavity . The ring  in the groove  expands in the tapered section as the bolt tip portion  is inserted. The ring  then becomes aligned with the groove  when the bolt shank portion  is inserted into the cavity . The ring expands in response to the shank insertion into the cavity  and then returns to its quiescent diameter by its compressing partially into the shank groove .","When the bolt  is attempted to be unlocked by retracting it out of the cavity , direction  opposite the insertion direction, the ring  is compressed further into the groove  of the bolt by a smaller diameter step \u2032 in the body groove . The step \u2032 in the body groove  and the bolt groove  cooperate to lock the ring and bolt to the body  to preclude further withdrawal of the bolt from the body bore . The locking mechanism  permanently locks the bolt  tip portion  to the body  requiring the bolt to be severed to open it.","The locking device , ,  and , has an outer thermoplastic molded shell  encasing the inner steel body .","The only way to open the seal  is to cut the bolt  with a bolt cutter or similar device. For this purpose, the shank , , is shown for illustration with an exposed region  between the module  and the hasp  and an exposed region  between the locking device  and the module . In practice, the only exposed regions for receiving a bolt cutter is region . While the region  and a further exposed region of the bolt is shown in  between the hasp  and head , this is only for illustration.","The thermoplastic shell  of the locking device  has a thermoplastic collar  one piece with and extending from the shell. The bolt shank  region  is substantially covered by the collar. In practice, the shank region  between the module  and the hasp  and the shank region between the hasp  and the head  is non-existent with a close clearance with the bolt at these regions. Thus a bolt cutter will not have access to the shank  in these other regions. In this case, the only access to cut the shank is in the region . The locking device collar  being plastic is easily severed.","The collar  secures the module  tightly against the bolt and also in a further embodiment against the hasp , \u2032 (not shown). This action seals the module  interior from the external ambient atmosphere as will be explained. Also this action keeps the module from moving along the bolt shank or vibrating in use in the locked state. This action tends to minimize wear of the contacts to be described below. The shell   has an overhang portion  which overlies a portion of the collar . The shell  has opposing planar side walls  including the overhang portion  for receiving indicia such as a unique bar code and\/or the manufacturer name and so on.","Once the bolt is cut at the exposed region  (or some other region) it can readily be removed from the module  and the hasps , \u2032. This is because there is no locking device internal the module  as in some of the prior art electronic security seals. Thus the module  is reusable with a new bolt. This reuse is made possible without undesirable opening of the module housing  as occurs in some prior art electronic seal systems discussed in the introductory portion.","The bolts  are relatively low cost and disposable. The module  being relatively costly because it houses the electronics, is saved for reuse and is readily reused after each use. This arrangement provides for users who have high volumes of needs for this type of seal.","To reuse the module , a new bolt is inserted through the housing  and locked with another relatively low cost locking device, which is also disposable. The electronics, according to a particular implementation employed as known in the prior art, may need to be reprogrammed for each new use in a known way as shown for example below and in certain of the patents noted in the introductory portion. The reprogramming may employ an interrogation unit or other programming arrangement as disclosed in some of the cited patents in the introductory portion. Such programming includes entering the seal unique identification, date and time stamps, location, cargo data, and any other desired data. For example, see several of the patents cited in the introductory portion, which disclose such electronics in more detail such as the '238, 973, 558 and 354 patents among others, and incorporated by reference herein.","In , the bolt , in one embodiment, comprises a steel bolt shank  and steel head , which are electrically conductive. An electrically insulating coating , which may be plastic, a composite material, or other insulating material, is applied in a conventional manner such as by molding, dipping, vapor deposition, and so on. The coating  is applied over an annular shank portion  (bounded by dashed lines ) of the shank  adjacent to the bolt head . The head  and shank  may also be one piece or multiple piece metal structures and together form an electrically conductive single conductor. The head for example may be press fit onto the shank in a known manner.","In , the bolt , in one embodiment, comprises a steel bolt shank  and steel head , which are electrically conductive.

The head  and shank  may also be one piece or multiple piece metal structures and together form an electrically conductive single conductor. The head for example may be press fit onto the shank in a known manner.","The bolt outer rubber or plastic layer  has a tapered conical region  which narrows in diameter in a direction toward the tip portion . The module  housing , , has a cylindrical circular aperture  for receiving the tapered outer surface region  of the bolt shank  therein. The bolt region  is larger in diameter than the diameter of the aperture in the housing  into which the bolt is inserted. This smaller diameter of the aperture  as compared to the larger diameter of the region  in a direction toward the head  prevents the bolt shank  from passing further into the aperture beyond the region  between the region  and the head . Thus, only a predetermined tip portion  of the shank  can enter into and protrude beyond the module  cavity. This predetermined tip portion  of the shank  length protruding beyond the module  is determined by the position of the region  on the shank relative to the tip portion .","This region  with its varying diameter along the bolt length relative to the aperture  diameter positions the shank  tip portion  with its metal outer surface and the shank electrical coating  in a desired predetermined aligned position in the module interior. This positioning of the bolt coating  aligns electrical contacts , ,  and  (to be described below) of the module , with the respective coating  and metal tip portion . This alignment ensures the contacts ,  make the required ohmic electrical engagement with the spaced electrically isolated and electrically conductive contact portions of the bolt. These portions form an electrical path along the shank  axial length as seen from , wherein part of the path is provided by the electrically conductive bolt shank and the electrically conductive layer  juxtaposed with a portion of the shank .","These conductive shank conductive portions include the shank  which has an outer exposed metal surface electrically conductive portion  at the tip portion  and the electrically conductive layer  aligned with the contacts , . The insulating coating  has an annular region  at the shank outer peripheral surface. This region  electrically isolates the tip  conductive portion  of the shank  outer surface from the electrically conductive layer  along an axial extent of the shank .","Thus, when the tapered region  is axially displaced toward the module  and tightly fitted into the aperture  of the module housing , the ring contacts ,  of the module  become aligned with the respective electrically conductive portions of the bolt . Also, the tapered region being formed of rubber or plastic forms a contamination seal for sealing the aperture  from the external ambient atmosphere. This is important to ensure the electronics does not prematurely corrode or otherwise fail due to ambient contamination. This sealing action of aperture  prevents moisture and other contaminants from entering into the module  interior of its housing  protecting the internal electronic components. The prior art seals do not recognize this problem or offer a solution.","In , the module  includes a printed circuit board assembly  comprising a circuit board  mounted inside of the module housing . The circuit board  has the necessary electronic and mechanical components (not shown) of the seal tamper sensing and RFID operating circuit mounted thereto. The electrically conductive conductors and contacts (not shown) of the board  are formed on the board  in a known manner.","The circuit includes a pair of spaced apart ring contacts  and  mounted spaced from the board , but electrically connected thereto as will be shown below. These contacts ,  are electrically conductively connected to the specified contact pads (not shown) of the board .  is more schematic than , which is more representative of the construction of the module  than , which is for illustration. The contacts ,  are in the interior  of the module, .","In , a rubber or other material sealing grommet  is secured in an opening  in a wall of the module housing  opposite to and aligned with the aperture . The opening  provides egress for the shank tip portion  into the housing  interior compartment . The grommet  is closely dimensioned relative to the outer diameter of the shank  tip portion  to resiliently compress somewhat and seal the shank tip portion  inserted into the grommet bore  () into compartment  of the housing .

A signal is applied to and passes through the bolt conductor of any of the disclosed embodiments to and from the circuit \u2032. This circuit is programmed to sense the presence of this signal to show the tamper state of the seal which when powered on initially will not indicate a tamper condition but a \u201cgood\u201d condition which may be manifested by a green light (not shown) for example. The circuit, once powered on, is armed and will transmit the programmed seal identification and related data to a local interrogator\/receiver (not shown) upon interrogation.","Assume the bolt shank is severed in order to open the seal , , or the tamper indicating seal of some of the embodiments or the module  is removed as in others of the embodiments such that the bolt can be removed from the seal module . The severed bolt conductor or the disconnection of the contacts ,  with the bolt of the various embodiments indicates an unlocked condition. The severing of the conductor or unlocked condition interrupts the signal supplied to and from the circuit \u2032, . The circuit program senses this interruption and is programmed to change the programming to note the tampered condition which may also be indicated by a red light (not shown) on the module. This condition is transmitted by transmitting the word \u201ctamper\u201d and\/or a change in serial number and\/or an alarm condition.

The network comprises a cellular phone communications unit , an optional cellular phone tracking system , cellular towers  and a cellular phone communications center . In the alternative to the cellular tracking system, the tracking system may employ GPS technology. In this system, GPS satellites  communicate to an optional GPS receiving unit . The GPS receiving unit  transmits the GPS seal location data to the microprocessor and memory of controller \u2032, circuit portion \u2032, . Memory (not shown) in the circuit \u2032 stores the data generated by the various systems. This stored data is retrieved by the controller \u2032.","Power supply  powers the controller \u2032 (), the GPS receiving unit  and the cellular phone communications unit . The communications unit  communicates with the communications center  through cellular towers  and transmits either the tracking data generated by cellular technology from system  or GPS technology from unit .

This determination may be programmed into the circuit \u2032 memory (not shown) or made by specific instructions communicated to the circuit \u2032, for example, via the communications center  or by other communication arrangements as may be established or desired.","When the mobile communication system comprises a GSM mobile communication system, the communications unit  is a GSM communication module to permit the communication unit  to communicate pertinent data to the communications center  via telephone cellular technology. The communications center  may not always be able to receive the data if turned off or interfered with, but can receive the data from nearby towers  when the center  is turned on or the interference removed and so on. The communications unit  may be a GSM communications module used in mobile phone systems such as GR47\/48 provided by Sony-Ericsson Company.","In a GPS mode, the controller \u2032, , receives and processes signals from the GPS receiving unit , , and also actuates the communications unit  to transmit seal status-related data to the communications center  via the towers . The status related data includes the position and the tampered\/normal status of the seal  at a given time.","As an option, the monitoring, tracking and communications system  can monitor the environment around the seal such as temperature, humidity and so on and also communicate this data. The data can also be recorded if desired by a recording system (not shown). If the seal is tampered with, the monitoring circuit portion \u2032 detects this status via periodic monitoring of the seal, e.g., every few seconds or minutes, or any desired time interval according to a given need, and communicates this information to the communications center . When not communicating the data, the system is in a sleep standby mode to conserve electrical energy.","The circuit portion \u2032, , also may receive interrogation requests and transmit status data upon receipt of such a request, either through a conventional RFID interrogator as shown in  or by cell phone communication. Periodic status monitoring may be programmed into the circuit portion \u2032 or instructed by a given set of instructions communicated to the circuit portion \u2032 to any desired time interval according to a given set of circumstances of a particular seal. The monitoring, tracking and communications system , , can also monitor the power level of the supply  to take action when the power level gets sufficiently low to warrant corrective action, which action may comprise replacement of the power supply and be taken by personnel in charge of the container\/seal upon communicated instructions. In the alternative, other systems may be used for communications such as those discussed in the introductory portion regarding the Arguin publication and other related or similar known GPS and cellular phone communication systems.","The cellular phone tracking system  may be employed optionally instead of the GPs system unit  as a seal  tracking system. The cell phone tracking system  may be a commercially available system provided by a wireless positioning system. This system is described in the Navizon web site at www.navizon.com. This system uses Wi-Fi access points, such as points , , for example, that may comprise wireless routers, or other systems, that provide wireless access to the internet, and cell phone tower signals from cellular towers , , to determine the exact location of the Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. These access points and cell towers are mapped by users with GPS enabled devices such as mobile phones having GPS capabilities referred to as \u201csmart\u201d phones such as the Apple iPhone and others.","The cell phone location data is collected by such users as they pass near the towers or access points, entered into the Navizon data base by them and thus may later be shared by other Navizon users. As a user's cell phone passes in the vicinity of a cell phone tower or Wi Fi access point, the tower's or the Wi Fi's location is determined by the user's GPS enabled phone and the data is entered into the Navizon data base for use by all Navizon users. The system  normally tracks the location of a mobile phone. In , this cell phone tracking technology is used to track the position of the seal incorporating this technology into its circuitry.","The location of a mobile phone and thus the seal is determined by well known triangulation techniques. The system does not require GPS to be enabled on a mobile device, but simulates virtual GPS on the device providing real time location information, which is stored in the circuit \u2032 memory portion of the controller \u2032, . This information is then communicated from the controller \u2032 to the communications center  monitoring the seal  status. The seal  status is also communicated to the communications center  as well as the seal's location.","The tracking system  requires that the cell towers associated with the seal location are within the system's data base of mapped towers. Thus selected ones of the users of the system with GPS activated mobile phones participate in mapping the cell towers, and other cell phones, without GPS, and in the instant case, the seal, utilizes the Navizon tracking system for determining its locations from the system .","ATT also has an application program that is downloadable to mobile phones. This program displays a map on a mobile phone's display indicating the location of that cell phone without using GPS, but rather cellular towers. Such a system may also be utilized to track the seal if desired, for example.","It will occur to one of ordinary skill that various modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments given by way of example and not limitation. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the appended claims. The various tracking systems are given by way of example as other systems may be utilized, now known, or later developed.
