{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","COPYRIGHT NOTICE\/PERMISSION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["The disclosure relates to synchronization of two or more content providers for image displays.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the graphical user interfaces as described below and in the referenced drawings: Copyright \u00a9 2003, Microsoft Corporation.","Various types of systems have been employed as signal sources for displays used in different types of audio-visual display settings. For example, movies are typically presented using a film projector by advancing a strip of film through the projector, illuminating a portion of the film and conditioning light transmitted through the film for projection on a screen. In some other types of systems, a pre-recorded video tape recorder or player magnetic tape system is employed as a signal source. In such systems, the term \u201cdisplay\u201d means providing a capability for both audio and video signals. In systems that employ a continuous physical medium as a content storage and\/or playback medium, it is difficult to synchronize multiple signal sources to provide a coordinated display of multiple images, some of which may be identical, or multiple different portions or \u201ctiles\u201d of a single image.","Additionally, such systems do not facilitate modification of the presentation \u201con the fly\u201d and thus can make rehearsals, which frequently require modification of the score (e.g., rewinding for a revision of a given segment), cumbersome. In other words, if need to replay a portion of the presentation presents itself during the presentation or rehearsal, the medium must be physically rewound, a specific portion corresponding to the portion to be replayed must be located, and the display process re-initiated. Similarly, when it is determined that a portion of a pre-recorded display should be skipped, there is need to fast forward the medium, locate a desired portion and restart the display process. Such results in interruption of the presentation, which detracts from the audience appreciation of the content that is being presented.","Additionally, the types of machinery used in such systems, such as video tape recorders and film projectors, tend to be quite expensive. One approach to ensuring uninterrupted operation of an electronic system is to run a primary system in tandem with a backup system that is switched to the role of the primary system when problems develop in the primary system. However, when there is need to provide multiple images for a particular event, the costs associated with providing multiple backup systems become inconvenient. This is especially true when the event is a one-time event, such as an annual meeting, symposium or the like.","When multiple audio-visual displays are employed to try to provide a large audience with access to a particular presentation, such as a speaker addressing a large audience, there is need to maintain synchronization between the images and more particularly between the images and any related sound tracks. When the sound tracks are not synchronized with each other, or when the sound track is not synchronized with the image, the perceptual discordance of the presentation tends to undesirably detract from intelligibility and audience appreciation of the content being presented.","As an example, studies and experiments have yielded a generally-accepted standard of a range of a relative delay of a negative eight milliseconds and a positive twenty to thirty milliseconds of synchronization between sound and visual display to avoid viewer\/listener perception of the relative delay and thus to avoid distraction from the content.","Further, large amounts of media having video and audio-visual content have been recorded since the inception of such systems. As such systems developed and realized increasing sophistication, a variety of standards were deployed in order that such recorded media could be distributed over wide geographic areas and used to provide relatively constant quality and intelligibility. For example, a number of such standards have been put forth by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers and these are generally referred to as SMPTE standards. When a presentation relies on an ensemble of disparately-recorded video streams, it is necessary to be able to process data recorded using these various different standards, which, in turn, complicates synchronization of multiple displays.","Accordingly, there are needs for improved techniques, systems and apparatus for providing more robust synchronization of multiple video and\/or audio-visual displays or data streams together with improved ability to arbitrarily shift from one point to another in such data streams in synchrony.","An architecture and methodology for improved synchronization and display of video and\/or audio-visual media is described. In one aspect, a media synch player includes a time control module, a digital data storage and retrieval device coupled to and responsive to the time control module and an audiovisual data signal output configured to supply audiovisual data to a display by playing a media file from the digital data storage and retrieval device in response to commands from a system controller. The time control module is configured to request a system time from an external time server, reset the time control module in accordance with the system time, lock to a master clock contained in the external time server and resynchronize the first time control module in response to predetermined criteria being met.","The following disclosure describes methods and apparatus for providing synchronized displays from two or more digital data sources. The displays typically include both audio and video content.","Exemplary Display Environment","Prior to describing how an improved display technology synchronizes two or more displays and\/or media streams, the following section addresses an environment in which such technology finds utility. The discussion of the environment provides a framework within which various pieces of the improved display synchronization technology can be developed.","Platform Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","105","1","105","105","110","112","115","110","120","125"]},"It will be appreciated that while the system elements are shown as being coupled together via a bus , other types of interconnections are also possible, including fiber optic communications, LANs, WANs or the Internet or any other data network, and that different portions of the interconnections represented by the bus  may comprise one or more of such data exchange media. It will be appreciated that the bus  may comprise interconnection via internet protocol networks such as IEEE 802.11, 10Base-T and home phone network alliance or HPNA, among others.","In one embodiment, the control console  includes a timecode card (not shown) that is slaved to the time server . Timecodes from the timecode card transmit a timing signal that may be used to control external devices such as light control boards for controlling ambient lighting in the area(s) where the displays  are deployed, backup devices intended to substitute for other system elements in the event of malfunction and the like. In one embodiment, timecodes in accordance with SMPTE standards are employed. In one embodiment, the timecodes are not necessarily Network Time Protocol (NTP) time but the timecodes are synchronized to one another and may be offset from another time demarcation system.","It will be appreciated that additional types of perceptual stimulation devices besides conventional audio-visual displays may be synchronized in the environment or system . Such additional types of devices can include other types of audio-visual signal sources, including legacy signal sources, and may also include varied elements, such as special-effects devices (e.g., data ports, flash-bang, smoke devices, mist devices, water fountains or jets with or without modulation capabilities, ambient light modulation capabilities, olfactory stimulation devices and any other type of device capable of modulating a perception or sense, directly or indirectly, or of producing a perceptual result or stimulation).","Computer systems, such as the media synch players , or the live playback system control console , typically include at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.","Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other media which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by the computer system. Communication media typically embodies computer readable instructions, data structures, program logic or program modules or other data embodied in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media.","The term \u201cmodulated data signal\u201d means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Any of the above or combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","Exemplary Applications","In operation, the media synch players  each generate a content stream such as video or audiovisual data in synchrony at the behest of the live playback system control console . Synchronism is derived from the time server , facilitating orchestration of the content provided by the media synch players . The system control console  and the media synch players  are slaved to the time server . As such, the system control console  can transmit a start time t+d for the media synch players  to start providing content from media files  (), and the media synch players  are synchronized with respect to this start time.","One exemplary application might be a large meeting where the attendees are so spread out in a common arena that they are not readily able to directly see or hear a speaker who is addressing the meeting. In such a setting, a number of displays  might be employed. If, for example, five large, high resolution displays  (e.g., 1024\u00d7768 pixels) were employed, display(), display() and display() might, at one point in time, show a text presentation common to these three displays , while display() and display() might show the speaker who is addressing the meeting and provide the corresponding audio.","In such a case, all five of the displays  might feature an audio track providing speech from the speaker, or a subset (such as display() and display()) might include such audio capabilities. At another stage during the meeting, all five displays  might feature the same content. In many such cases, maintaining synchronism between the displays  and any audio track is highly desirable in order to present the content in a way that is intelligible and that promotes comprehensibility of the desired content.","Another example of an application is one where one or more of the displays  are in different locations, providing content to different audiences at geographically diverse locations. In such an example, the displays  may all be providing the same content or some displays  may be providing different content than others of the displays , but the content is being providing synchronously by the displays .","Yet another example of an application for the system  might employ plasma panels or other video displays for the displays , and the displays  may be \u201ctiled\u201d together to provide a single larger effective display area coupled with high resolution. Such might comprise displays  tiled together to form a display analogous to an IMAX\u00ae movie screen, for example. Such might comprise a group of displays  tiled in a horizontal or vertical row or column or both. Displays  may be composed or placed in other manners of grouping to provide a desired effect. In such a composite or \u201ctiled\u201d display , synchronism between images associated with such displays  as well as any soundtrack or other presentation devices contributes to presentation of content without distraction or loss of intelligibility.","Exemplary Media Synch Player",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110"]},"The exemplary media synch player  may be realized in a variety of different manners to display video and\/or audio content (and\/or other content). In one implementation, the exemplary media synch player  is implemented using a collection of \u201cfilters\u201d referred to as a filter graph, and a filter graph manager. The filter graph manager controls the data structure of the filter graph and the way data moves through the filter graph. How the content is to be displayed can be controlled and changed by interacting with and properly configuring the filters of the filter graph. The filter graph manager provides a set of software objects for communication between a filter graph and one or more applications. According to one implementation, individual filters of a filter graph architecture are implemented as component object model (COM) objects of an operating system executing on a computer, each implementing one or more interfaces which contain a predefined set of functions, called methods. Methods are called by an application program or other component objects in order to communicate with the object exposing the interface. The application program can also call methods or interfaces exposed by the filter graph manager object.","In a particular exemplary implementation, the exemplary media synch player  is implemented using filters in accordance with the DirectShow\u00ae application programming interface and architecture. Additional information regarding the DirectShow\u00ae application programming interface and architecture is available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","The exemplary media synch player  includes media files , which may be represented by one or more digital data streams representing video and\/or audio content stored on a hard drive, for example. In one embodiment, the media files  are Windows Media\u00ae player files, that is, digital files representing video and\/or audiovisual content in a format that is consistent with the media files being readable by the Windows Media\u00ae player series of computer software products developed and distributed by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. MP3 files, WMA (Windows Media Audio) and WMV (Windows Media Video) files are examples of such types of files. In one embodiment, the media files are stored at a shared media storage location, e.g., a media storage location shared by two or more media synch players .","The exemplary media synch player  also includes a clock module or clocking system  having a capability for being slaved to another clocking system. In one embodiment, the clock module  comprises a Network Time Protocol module . An interface  couples the media synch player  to the bus  and facilitates control of the media synch player  by a system operator using the live playback system control console  of .","Optionally, time synchrony may be provided via a GPS interface  equipped to derive a time signal from the global positioning satellite system. For example, interfaces such as the PC-471 and ES-110 products can provide such time signals and are available from ESE, 142 Sierra Street, El Segundo, Calif. Such can facilitate time coordination between media synch players  having relatively wide physical separation between them, however, GPS is but one way to provide a common time standard between media synch players  and other system elements such as the time server  and the live playback control console .","In one embodiment, the media synch player  is configured to provide first content and is coupled via a link  to a nominally identical backup media synch player \u2032 that is configured to \u201cshadow\u201d the media synch player  until such time as the media synch player  malfunctions. When the media synch player  malfunctions, the backup media synch player \u2032 provides a continuation of the first content via an alternate signal path \u2032.","The continuation of the first content provided by the alternate signal path \u2032 is consistent with what the media synch player  would have provided but for the malfunction, and is synchronized with the system  analogously to the first content from the media synch player . In order to be able to provide this backup function, the backup media synch player \u2032 needs to have access to the media files  associated with the media synch player , or copies thereof, and also is similarly operating in synchrony with the system . The backup media synch player \u2032 may include a separate data files analogous to those contained in media files . In one embodiment, the media synch player and associated backup media synch player \u2032 are addressed as an entity or group by the control console .","Time Synchronization",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","110","300","220","212","330","217"]},"As a general premise, IP networks do not guarantee the timely delivery of any information. A best effort packet delivery is what can be expected. In other words, a packet of data will arrive at a destination when it arrives, if it arrives. This uncertainty of IP networks is attributable to delays, latency, jitters and other inherent network characteristics. The present disclosure describes solutions enabling A\/V streams to be coordinated in a synchronized manner despite the characteristics of typical IP networks. In particular, the present disclosure relates to \u2018tight time\u2019 synchronization for the coordination of multiple sources of A\/V content.","A\/V coordination is achieved by establishing a time synchronization between multiple devices (e.g., media synch players  as well as the time server  and the control console ). Time synchronization is attained by employing the time server  as a time master for the system . All of the elements synchronize their internal clocks to the time server. In operation, a time stamp \u201ct\u201d is obtained by each device from the controller , which is synchronized with the time server . Also included with the time stamp t is a delay indication \u201cd\u201d. In combination, these time related components instruct the media synch players  on when to render content available from the media files . Essentially, each media synch player  will wait to render content until a particular time t+d, derived from the time stamp from the controller . As such, content from all of the media synch players  will be synchronized to the same moment in time\u2014t+d\u2014regardless of when the time synchronization was initiated.","Time information is also present in the individual clocks of the media synch players . This time information may be transmitted in a non-isosynchronous manner back to the time server  and combined with time information derived from the time server to speed up or slow down rendering of the clocks  in the individual media synch players . A more detailed description of the use of common time to convert a non-isosynchronous network to an isosynchronous network can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/863,834, filed on Apr. 17, 2001 (Published Application No. 20020150053 A1, published on Oct. 17, 2002), entitled \u201cMethods And Systems For Distributing Multimedia Data Over Heterogeneous Networks\u201d, listing Donald M. Gray et al. as inventor(s), which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The process  begins in a block . In the block , the clock module  in each of the media synch players  transmits a signal to request a time from the time server . In one embodiment, the clock modules  comprise NTP modules .","In a block , the time server  provides common time signals to the media synch players  and the associated clock modules  to cause a reset to a predetermined time, such as 12:00.","In a block , the clock modules  acquire lock with a clock contained in the time server . In one embodiment, the clock modules  acquire phase lock with the clock contained in the time server . In one embodiment, the clock modules  acquire frequency lock with the clock contained in the time server .","In a query task , a determination is made that one or more predetermined criteria for resynchronization have been met. In one embodiment, resynchronization takes place at small intervals, such as every few minutes. In one embodiment, such is performed in accordance with the network time protocol.","When the query task  does not determine that the predetermined criteria have been met, the process  may wait a predetermined time, as indicated by block . Control then passes back to the query task .","When the query task  determines that the predetermined criteria have been met, the clock modules  are resynchronized with the time server  in a block . Control then passes back to the block . The process  continues until such time as system operation is terminated.","Media Synch Player Operation Control",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["400","110","125","220","115","400","405"]},"In the block , the control console  assembles a list of commands from a playlist or eventlist or responds to operator commands to deviate therefrom. The playlist provides instructions for coordination of each of the media synch players  in providing content (e.g., windows media files, images, patterns, colors, or animations) in a predetermined sequence.","In the block , control signals from the control console  are received by the interface . In one embodiment, the control signals may comprise, for example, one of: play, pause, stop, seek to time, get file and show images.","For example, the seek to time command may cause one or more of the media synch players  to discontinuously switch to another portion of the media files . The seek to time command is capable of providing a stopping and restarting function analogous to a rewind or fast forward function but without engendering the delay associated with movement of conventional physical recording media, and is also capable of locating corresponding portions of two or more media files  with greater precision than is typical of conventional media or systems. In other words, synchronized restarting begins at a first point in the first digital media file corresponding to a second point in the second digital media file, and vice versa.","In a block , the media synch players  respond to the control signals and provide appropriate output signals via the signal paths  to the displays . Such may comprise start of synchronized operation of the media synch players  and associated displays , switching from one media file  to another (e.g., get file followed by start), cease operation (e.g., stop), which may include initiation of a predetermined state such as a blank or black display , and the like.","In a query task , the process  determines when a total run time has elapsed. When the query task  determines that the total run time of a media file  or playlist of multiple media files  has elapsed, control passes to a block . When the query task  determines that the total run time has not yet elapsed, control passes back to block .","In the block , the media synch players  cause the displays  to revert to a predetermined default state at a conclusion of the media file  or playlist, or in response to user input via control console . Such a default state may be a black or blank display , or may be a display of a chosen image or video loop. The process  then ends.","As a result of the processes  and , the media synch players  and associated displays  provide coordinated and synchronized sequences of images or video and\/or audio in frame-by-frame synchronization. The synchronization may be maintained during display of content from specific media files  and may be maintained when such media files  or a selection of a portion thereof is changed, facilitating rehearsal of specific portions of a presentation and also enabling graceful deviation from a predetermined playlist in response to circumstances.","Exemplary Graphical User Interface",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIGS. 6-9","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","125","500"]},"The exemplary graphical user interface  includes a live playback system toolbar  that includes identification information together with conventional execution management function buttons.

Clear is not persistent, e.g., when a Player  is Cleared and then a Seek operation is performed on the Event such that the Player  that was previously cleared will display the configured content at the new EventTime.","Zero or more Events may be in progress at any given time. In one embodiment, when an Event is started, all the EventPlayers  participating in that Event are first Stopped and then the selected Event is played. Event playback commences after the Head Offset specified by the operator (). Head Offset is common to all EventPlayers  and is used to ensure sync between EventPlayers .","EventLists can be activated at any time with use of a file browse window or a Favorites List. Only one EventList is active at any given time.","In one embodiment, Players  may be selectively or collectively Paused, Stopped, Muted or un-Muted.","A Seek operation may be performed on any currently cued or playing Event. Seek may be Relative to current EventTime or Absolute to a specified EventTime. To Seek an Event that is not currently cued or playing, the operator must first Cue or Play the Event, followed by a Seek operation. It is imperative to note that Seek operations are performed on the Event timeline and apply to all EventPlayers  in the selected Event. In one embodiment, EventPlayers  cannot be independently Seeked.","By now it will be appreciated that methods and apparatus for provision of synchronized image display have been described that result in certain advantages relative to prior art display technologies.","Additionally, such avoids investment in large amounts of hardware to try to increase the reliability of conventional media systems via provision of redundant elements of very expensive hardware for backup capability. The disclosed media content provision processes also sidestep waiting periods while physical data or media storage media are advanced or rewound in order to deviate from the script or playlist corresponding to the content of the media.","Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described. Rather, the specific features and acts are disclosed as exemplary forms of implementing the claimed invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENTS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 1 and 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 5"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
