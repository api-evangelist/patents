{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation-in-part patent application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,247, filed Aug. 5, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,348,847 dated Jan. 8, 2013, and titled \u201cSystem and Method for Managing a Patient;\u201d which claims the benefit under U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/086,254, filed Aug. 5, 2008 and titled \u201cSystem, Apparatus and Method to Guide Clinical Hemodynamic Management of Patients Requiring Anesthetic Care, Perioperative Care and Critical Care Using Ultrasound.\u201d The present application also claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/140,767, filed Dec. 24, 2008 and titled \u201cPeripheral Ultrasound System for Automated and Uninterrupted Data Acquisition\u201d and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/224,621, filed Jul. 10, 2009 and titled \u201cSystem (Apparatus and Method) to Guide Clinical Hemodynamic Management of Patients Requiring Anesthetic Care, Perioperative Care and Critical Care Using Cardiac Ultrasound.\u201d The contents of each of the above mentioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.","The present disclosure relates to acquiring circulatory system information from a patient. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to acquiring cardiac data points reflecting the function of the heart. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a device and a method for automatically and uninterruptedly acquiring cardiac ultrasound-generated data points allowing a health care provider to optimize the hemodynamic and fluid management of patients.","Proper circulatory function is essential to sustain and prolong life. From a more practical standpoint, circulatory function can be a factor affecting health care costs resulting from length of stay in the hospital, complications, hospital readmissions, and mortality. According to some professionals, ensuring the adequacy of circulatory function is one of the most important clinical goals of healthcare providers for anesthetic, perioperative, or critical care procedures. Currently, the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) endorses the use of the EKG monitor, systemic blood pressure (BP), pulse oximeter, and urine output (UO), known as the conventional parameters, as the basic standard of care for assessing circulatory function. However, these conventional parameters may not always provide suitable information for managing circulatory function.","Using conventional parameters may be clinically acceptable for patients with normal cardiovascular function. However, conventional parameters often provide incomplete information for patients with cardiovascular risk factors and\/or comorbidities. For example, in surgical and critical care settings, managing the circulatory function of a congestive heart failure (CHF) patient with conventional parameters can lead a practitioner to deliver inappropriate amounts of intravenous (IV) fluid and\/or maintain an inappropriate level of blood pressure leading to volume overload of the circulatory system of the patient. As a result of the incomplete information, many patients currently undergoing surgical procedures and\/or requiring critical care medicine may not receive optimal hemodynamic management. This can lead to cardiovascular complications like acute episodes of CHF, atrial arrhythmias, length of stay in the hospital, hospital readmission after discharge, and even mortality. This result is both detrimental to the health of the patient and costly to the health care system.","This weakness in the standard of care is exacerbated by the fact that CHF, with normal (diastolic dysfunction) or reduced (systolic dysfunction) contractile function, is the leading admission diagnosis for medicine and cardiology services in the United States. Further adding to the problem is that diastolic dysfunction, often the underlying cause of CHF, is common among the baby boomer population. For individuals over 65, 53.8% suffer from some degree of diastolic dysfunction. (40.7% mild and 13.1% moderate or severe). The number of individuals over 65 has been projected to increase by 50% from 2000 to 2020 and as a result, the baby boomer population is recognized as a driving force for healthcare services.","Conventional circulatory function parameters may provide incomplete information for patients with cardiovascular risk factors and\/or comorbidities. CHF is an example of one of those conditions and is also a common condition among the baby boomer population and the population as a whole. The health related and economic costs associated with complications, readmissions, and mortality rates need to be addressed. Accordingly, there is a need for a more capable system for managing the hemodynamics of patients.","In one embodiment, a device for acquiring ultrasound-generated data from a patient can include a securing system and a probe configured for connection to the securing system. The probe can include a base having an interfacing surface. The probe can also include an imaging mechanism adjustable relative to the base and configured to send and receive ultrasound signals along an imaging direction. The probe can also include an adjustment mechanism configured to adjust the imaging mechanism relative to the base thereby adjusting the imaging direction. The adjustment mechanism can include a first adjustment mechanism configured to adjust the imaging mechanism about a first axis generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface, the first adjustment mechanism comprising an annular ring oriented parallel to and offset from the interfacing surface and having a an orientation actuator operably coupled thereto for pivoting the imaging mechanism about the first axis. The adjustment mechanism can also include a second adjustment mechanism configured to adjust the imaging mechanism about a second axis generally parallel to the interfacing surface, the second adjustment mechanism comprising a gear extending from the imaging mechanism and being positioned generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface and having a direction actuator operably coupled thereto for pivoting the imaging mechanism about the second axis.","In another embodiment, a probe for acquiring ultrasound-generated data can include a housing having an interfacing surface with an opening and an imaging mechanism positioned in the opening. The imaging mechanism can be rotatable in a plane generally parallel to the interfacing surface and pivotal about an axis generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface. The probe can also include an adjustment mechanism positioned within the housing and associated with the imaging mechanism to cause the imaging mechanism to rotate in the plane or pivot about the axis, the adjustment mechanism comprising an orientation adjuster and a direction adjuster each having an orientation actuator and a direction actuator respectively.","In another embodiment, a securing system for securing a probe to a patient can include an anchoring member, an adhesive feature positioned on the anchoring member, and a retention member connected to the anchoring member and configured to secure a probe thereto. In some embodiments, the securing system can include a probe recognition module arranged on a portion of the anchoring member or the retention member and can include a bar code or an electronic circuit. In other embodiments, the probe recognition module can include a chip embedded in the anchoring member and configured to perform a calibration protocol.","The present disclosure relates to devices and methods for acquiring ultra-generated data points from a patient. In particular, the present disclosure includes discussion of a device including an ultrasound probe and a securing system. In contrast to handheld devices, the securing system can allow for securely positioning a probe on a patient allowing for hands-free capture of ultrasound images. The ultrasound image captured can be manually or automatically adjusted by manual or automatic manipulation of a transducer of the probe such that uninterrupted data acquisition can be performed. The device can be used to acquire cardiac ultrasound-generated data, particularly relating to blood flow inside and in structures connected to the heart.","The device can be used, for example, with the System for Managing a Patient described in patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,247 referenced above. In some embodiments, the device can be used with a computer, such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and the like. In either case, one device can be used or multiple devices can be used to facilitate efficient acquisition of ultrasound-generated data by placing the devices at multiple vantage points on a patient.","Referring to , a patient is shown with five devices -in position on the generally anterior surface of the body. In the embodiment shown, for example, the devices -can be placed in cardiac viewing windows such as the transthoracic parasternal window, the transthoracic apical window, the sub-costal window, and the suprasternal notch window. Additional devices  can be used to image more superficial and\/or non-cardiac structures.","Referring now to , a close-up view of one of the devices  of  is shown. As shown, the device can include a securing system  and a probe . The securing system  can be positioned on the patient and can be adapted to adhere or otherwise anchor itself to the surface of the patient. The securing system  can further be configured to receive the probe  and connect to the probe  thereby securing the probe  to the location on the patient at which the securing system  is secured. It is noted that in some embodiments, a securing system  may not be provided and the probe  may be directly positioned on the patient.","Each of the securing system  and the probe  will now be described in detail. The probe  can be initially described with reference to  and the securing system  can be described with respect to . However, it is to be understood that concepts are presented that are generic to some or all of the embodiments described in the specification and as such are not limited to the embodiments in the particular figures referenced.","Beginning first with the probe , the probe  can be adapted for connecting to the securing system  and can be configured to send and receive ultrasound signals to capture ultrasound-generated data from a patient. The probe  can further be configured for adjustability to allow the signals to be sent and received in a suitable orientation and direction relative to the probe  position on the patient. Accordingly, the probe  can include a base structure for connecting to the securing system , an imaging mechanism for sending and receiving ultrasound signals, and an adjustment mechanism for adjusting the orientation and\/or direction of the imaging mechanism. In some embodiments, the probe  may also include a control module in the form of hardware, software, or a combination thereof for controlling all or a portion of the imaging and\/or adjustment mechanism.","The base structure of the probe  can include a broad range of items. The base can be configured to connect to the securing system  and further support the imaging mechanism. To this end, the base structure can include a housing, a frame, a platform, a cage, a plate, a plurality of legs, or some combination of these elements, for example. Other base structures can be used. The base structure can be configured to interact with the securing system  through interactive features such as, for example, physical connections, electrical communications, data communications, or other interactive features. The base can thus include surfaces, ports, connection elements, electrical and\/or communicative contacts, or communicative surface images or textures. Other interactive features can be provided.","Referring now to , in the embodiment shown, the base structure is in the form of a housing . The housing  can be any shape including rectangular, square, round, elliptical or any shape. In the embodiment shown, the housing  has a generally rectangular cross-section with radiused corners. At the distal end of the housing , the lateral sides of the rectangular cross-section follow an arcuate path and intersect with one another to form an arcuate distal end wall. At the proximal end of the housing , the lateral sides taper inward to narrow the cross-section of the housing . The proximal end of the housing  can be adapted for connection to a lead .","The housing  can be configured to support an imaging mechanism and as such can be a generally hollow structure. The housing  can include shoulders, ledges, cavities, tabs, plates, or other internal features adapted for connection of internal components or parts. As shown, the housing  can include an interactive feature in the form of an interfacing surface . The interfacing surface  can be adapted for placement against the securing system  and\/or directed toward the patient. The interfacing surface  of the probe  can include an opening  for exposing the imaging mechanism. The opening  can be any shape. In the embodiment shown, the opening  is a round opening and is thus adapted to accommodate rotational adjustment of the orientation of the imaging mechanism positioned therein.","Turning now to the imaging mechanism, this element of the probe  can be configured to send and receive ultrasound signals. Accordingly, the imaging mechanism can be in the form of an ultrasound transducer . Other imaging mechanisms can be included for other purposes such as X-ray, CT scan, MRI, or other image generating mechanisms.","The ultrasound transducer  can be adapted for obtaining information suitable for two-dimensional imaging, three-dimensional imaging, B-mode, M-mode, color Doppler, and spectral Doppler output. The transducer  can be built with piezo-electric crystals adapted to emit ultrasonic signals. The transducer  can include a suitable crystal array. For example, the transducer  can be constructed with a phased array of crystals, a matrix of a phased array of crystals, or a convex linear array. The phased array of crystals may provide for a two dimensional pie-shaped cross-sectional image. The matrix may provide for a three dimensional image. The probe adapted to image more superficial elements can include transducers  constructed with a linear array of crystals allowing for higher frequency imaging and may provide for a rectangular image. The arrays can contain a small number of elements (in the hundreds) up to a large number of elements (in the thousands). The elements may be configured to generate one or more two-dimensional images at the same time, three-dimensional images or real-time three-dimensional images also called four-dimensional images. The configuration of elements may be a matrix or a mesh-like design of elements allowing volume rendering of the imaged structures. Other arrangements of crystals such as, for example, a circular array can be used and are within the scope of the disclosure. Moreover, mechanical transducers could be used in lieu of or in addition to the piezo-electric crystal type transducers described.","The transducer  can have a signal emitting surface  adapted for interaction with the patient. As such, the signal emitting surface  can be generally flat or contoured to suitably engage the surface of a patient. The signal emitting surface  can be rectangular, square, or round. Other shapes can be provided.","The transducer  can be mounted within the housing  such that it can rotate about an axis generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface  of the housing . Additionally or alternatively, the transducer  can be mounted within the housing  such that it can pivot about an axis generally parallel to the interfacing surface . It is noted here that the transducer  can be mounted directly to the housing  where the mounting allows for the rotation and\/or pivoting described. In this embodiment, the adjustment mechanism described below can act on the transducer  to adjust its orientation and\/or direction. Alternatively, the transducer  can be mounted to the housing  by way of the adjustment mechanism. The transducer  can be positioned relative to the housing  in a position to interact with the surface of a patient. In some embodiments this may include projecting beyond the interfacing surface  an amount approximately equal to the thickness of the securing system . As will be described and shown with respect to , the securing system  may include an opening  through which the ultrasonic signals are directed and as such, the transducer  may project into this opening  when connected thereto. In other embodiments, the transducer  may be mounted more flush with the interfacing surface  or even recessed relative thereto.","Referring particularly to , in the embodiment shown, the imaging mechanism is in the form of a transducer  constructed with a phased array of crystals as depicted by the pie shaped cross-section image  emanating from the signal emitting surface . The signal emitting surface  is shown as a generally flat rectangular surface and the transducer  is shown to project slightly beyond the interfacing surface  of the housing . In the present embodiment, the transducer  is shown mounted to the housing  by way of the adjustment mechanism to be described next.","Turning now to the adjustment mechanism, this element of the probe  can be configured to adjust the orientation and\/or direction of the imaging mechanism. For purposes of discussion, it should be understood that the orientation relates to the rotational orientation of the imaging mechanism in a plane parallel to the interfacing surface  of the housing  and the direction relates to a centerline of the profile of the cross-sectional image . As such, for a pie-shaped cross-section, for example, the direction of the imaging mechanism, can be defined by a line bisecting the pie-shaped profile and in the plane of the pie-shaped profile. The adjustment mechanism may be configured to rotate the imaging mechanism about a line extending generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface . As such, the adjustment mechanism can include an orientation adjusting mechanism. Alternatively or additionally, the adjustment mechanism may be configured to pivot the imaging mechanism about an axis extending generally parallel to the interfacing surface . As such, the adjustment mechanism may further include a direction adjusting mechanism.","The adjustment mechanism can include one or more actuation mechanisms for inducing the adjustment of the imaging mechanism. The actuation mechanisms can range between manual and automatic mechanisms and combinations thereof can also be provided. In the case of manual mechanisms, theses may include thumb screws, lever arms, graspable rotating or sliding knobs, or accessible pivot or translational shafts. Other manual adjustment mechanisms can be provided. In the case of automatic adjustment mechanisms, these may include piston type actuators, screw gear type actuators, rotating gear type actuators, or compressed air systems. Other automatic mechanisms can be provided. Regarding combinations of manual and automatic mechanisms, in some embodiments, the mechanisms listed above as automatic mechanisms may be manually adjusted via input received into a controller of the automatic mechanism.","These manual and automatic mechanisms may allow for adjustment of the orientation and\/or direction of the image mechanism to more suitably capture the ultrasonic data. In some embodiments, the manual adjustment may be used to position the image mechanism in the approximate orientation and direction and the automatic mechanism may then refine the adjustment. It is noted that, while the term manual has been described as adjustments that are made by hand and automatic has been described as adjustments made with mechanical or electromechanical devices, the term manual can also include relying on a user interface to manually enter a orientation and\/or direction causing the actuating device to adjust the image mechanism accordingly.","As mentioned above, this adjustment of the imaging mechanism may include manipulating the imaging mechanism about its supports on the base structure or the imaging mechanism may be supported by the adjustment mechanism and the adjusting may occur through adjustment of a portion of the adjustment mechanism. In the case of an adjustment mechanism isolated from the support of the imaging mechanism, the adjustment mechanism can include one or more actuators configured to cause the imaging mechanism to move about its support to the housing. For example, where the imaging mechanism is supported by the base via a pivot pin, the adjustment mechanism can include a longitudinally telescoping actuator that presses or pulls on a side of the imaging mechanism offset from the pivot axis thereby causing the imaging mechanism to pivot about the pivot pin. In the case of an adjustment mechanism integral with the support of the imaging mechanism, the adjustment mechanism can include one or more actuators configured to cause a portion of the adjustment mechanism to move and carry the imaging mechanism therewith. For example, where the imaging mechanism is supported on a rotating portion of the adjustment mechanism, an actuator may cause the rotating portion to rotate causing the imaging mechanism to rotate also. In other embodiments portions of the actuation mechanism can move with the imaging mechanism, while other portions remain stationary relative to the base structure.","Referring now to , in the embodiment shown, the adjustment mechanism is configured to rotate the transducer  about an axis extending generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface  and is further configured to pivot the transducer  about an axis extending generally parallel to the interfacing surface . In this embodiment, the orientation adjusting mechanism can include an orientation guide  and an orientation actuator . The direction adjusting mechanism can include a direction guide  and a direction actuator .","The orientation guide  can be in the form of an annular ring positioned in the housing  to rotate about an axis extending generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface . In this embodiment, the housing  may include a generally annularly extending channel. The channel can extend around an inside surface defined by the shape of the opening  in the housing  and the annular ring can be slidably positioned therein. The annular ring can include a plurality of gear teeth on an outer periphery thereof forming a rack engageable by the orientation actuator .","The orientation actuator , in this embodiment, can include a stationary screw driven by a rotating motor. The stationary screw can be positioned in a cavity within the housing  such that it can slidably rotate in the cavity without translating. Alternatively or additionally, the stationary screw can be supported by a shaft extending from the motor. The motor can be mounted within the housing  in a cavity or via brackets, mounting locations, or other techniques. The annularly extending channel containing the annular ring can include an opening allowing access to the annular ring by the orientation actuator . The stationary screw can be positioned tangentially along the periphery of the annular ring such that threads of the stationary screw extend through the opening in the channel and engage the teeth on the outer periphery of the annular ring. As such, actuation of the rotating motor can rotate the stationary screw causing the annular ring to rotate relative to the housing . The device shown can allow for a full 360\u00b0 rotation of the annular ring.","In this embodiment, the stationary screw shown is positioned generally longitudinally with respect to the housing . However, it will be appreciated that the screw can be reoriented with respect to the housing  and can function similarly at any tangential orientation to the annular ring.","As best shown in , the transducer  of this embodiment can be pivotally supported within the annular ring by, for example, a pivot pin  extending across the annular ring. Due to the connection to the annular ring, the actuation of the rotating motor of the orientation actuator  can, thus, cause rotation of the transducer .","The direction guide  can be in the form of a gear. In the embodiment shown, the gear is a semicircular gear and is positioned to extend from the transducer  in a plane generally orthogonal to the interfacing surface  and further generally orthogonal to the pivot pin  supporting the transducer . The semicircular gear can be positioned on the transducer  such that the center point of the gear is located at the pivot axis or pivot pin  of the transducer . The semicircular gear can include teeth extending along the periphery of the semicircular shape forming a rack.","The direction actuator , in this embodiment, can also include a stationary screw driven by a rotating motor. The stationary screw can be the same as that described with respect to the orientation actuator  and can be supported in the same or similar fashion. The stationary screw of the direction actuator can be positioned tangentially along the periphery of the semicircular gear such that the threads of the screw engage the teeth on the gear causing the periphery of the gear to translate along the arc defined by the radius of the gear. The connection of the gear to the transducer  and the corresponding center point of the gear with the pivot point of the transducer  can allow the transducer  to pivot thereby adjusting the direction of the transducer . The direction of the transducer  can thus be adjusted from approximately \u221260\u00b0 to approximately +60\u00b0 as shown in . The range of direction of the transducer  can be larger or smaller depending on the arc length of the semicircular gear and any adjustment range can be provided. It is noted that the nature of ultrasound transducers  causes them to function best when the signals do not travel through materials with changing densities. As such, in some embodiments, the adjustment range of the transducer  may be limited to angles allowing the signal emitting surface  to maintain contact with the body surface, the securing system , or an ultrasonic gel.","Additionally, in this embodiment, the stationary screw is shown positioned generally longitudinally with respect to the housing . However, it will be appreciated that the screw can be reoriented with respect to the housing  and can function similarly at any tangential orientation to the gear. It is further noted that the gear, while shown to extend rearward from the transducer  can extend from the sides of the transducer  or a gear encompassing a larger included angle can be provided such that the gear extends along the rearward face and sides of the transducer .","In the embodiment shown, it can be appreciated that orientation adjustments of the imaging mechanism can cause the gear to rotate out of alignment with the screw of the direction actuator . Accordingly, in this embodiment, the threads on the screw and the gear teeth on the gear may include a degree of play allowing the change in orientation of the gear without a loss of function.","In another embodiment, as shown in , a gear can be provided that allows for the change in orientation between the gear and the direction actuating screw. As shown, the gear can be a ball gear  and the gear teeth can be positioned on the sphere and can pass around the sphere and maintain a radial distance from an axis extending generally perpendicular to the interfacing surface and centered on the annular ring. As such, when the orientation of the imaging mechanism is adjusted, the curved gear teeth on the ball gear will maintain alignment with the screw as the imaging mechanism rotates.","In still another embodiment, as shown in , the direction actuator  can be affixed to the orientation guide  such that the direction actuator  rotates together with the gear  and maintains alignment therewith. As shown in , in one embodiment, the annular ring can include a support  in the form of a strut, cage, semispherical surface or other structure extending therefrom for mounting of the direction actuator  thereto. As shown, the support can allow for the suspending the direction actuator  from the annular ring allowing for pivoting motion of the imaging mechanism relative thereto. In one embodiment, as shown in , the direction actuator can be rearranged such that the motor portion is adjacent to the screw portion rather than in longitudinal connection. A support  similar to that shown in  can be provided to support the motor from the annular ring and geared, belted, or other system  can be provided to transfer rotational motion from the motor to the screw adjacent the motor.","Turning now to the control module , and referring still to , this element of the probe  can include hardware, software, or a combination thereof for controlling certain aspects of probe  and\/or system functionality. As such the control module  can include some or all of an image mechanism component , a adjustment mechanism component , and an analysis component . Each of these modules or components thereof, can include software or a portion thereof, hardware or a portion thereof, or a combination of software and hardware adapted to perform a process. Each module or component thereof can be combined or overlapped with or combined with modules or components performing other tasks in the process. In some embodiments, this overlap or combination may include tasks or steps adjacent to one another in a process, but in other embodiments, the tasks and steps may not be adjacent one another. Moreover, any module or component thereof may or may not be included in the system depending on the nature of the system desired. Additionally, the control module  or any module or component thereof can each include an input and output module adapted to receive or send information from or to, respectively, other devices, modules, or components. As such, these input and output modules can include physical ports or connection to a bus where the input or output module is of the hardware type. Other types of input and output hardware can be used. In the case of software based input and output modules, these can include lines of code causing a processor to step or jump from one location to another or an application programming interface, for example. Other types of software based input and output can also be used.","The image mechanism component  can be configured to control, for example, the transducer . As such, the image mechanism component  can be configured to generate, transmit, and receive ultrasound signals. The generation of ultrasound signals can include beam forming and\/or array beam forming. Transmitting and receiving ultrasound signals can include one or more processing functions for emitting ultrasonic signals and capturing the results from the reflected signal. The image mechanism component  may include task specific hardware or software and can be in electrical communication with the transducer  via lead  as shown.","The adjustment mechanism component  can be configured to control the adjustment mechanism. As such, the adjustment mechanism component  can include hardware and or software that is adapted to activate and deactivate one or more actuators associated with the adjustment mechanism and further control the direction of motion. For example the adjustment mechanism component  can be configured to activate the rotating motors of  to turn the stationary screws. The adjustment mechanism component can further be adapted to control the direction of the motors such that the stationary screws can turn in a particular direction and suitably adjust the orientation and\/or direction of the image mechanism. The adjustment mechanism component can be in electrical communication with the motors as shown, via leads and as shown.","This component  can be in communication with an analysis system such as that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,247 that is capable of analyzing ultrasonic images. As such, the analysis system may trigger the adjustment mechanism component  to adjust the orientation or direction of the image mechanism in one direction or another based on the quality of the image being captured. In some embodiments, the initial image may be adjusted by the user via a manual adjustment on the probe  or via an input adjustment into the analysis system. As such, the initial calibration of the images may include user interaction or the analysis system may do so by comparing the captured images to standards or desired quality images.","In some embodiments, the adjustment mechanism component  may include a gating component  configured to adjust the orientation and\/or position of the image mechanism to accommodate movement of the patient due to breathing. In some embodiments, this gating component  can be in communication with motion sensors adapted to sense the motion of a patient. Based on this motion, the gating component  can further provide additional information to the adjustment mechanism component  of the control module  to cyclically adjust the adjustment mechanism thereby maintaining the scanning plane in a consistent position relative to the structures being viewed by the image mechanism. In another embodiment, the gating component  can be adapted to monitor the image appearance and disappearance as the patient breathes thereby being able to develop frequency and period information particular to a given patient's current breathing pattern. The magnitude of adjustment of the adjustment mechanism can be related to the amplitude of the breathing of the patient. As such, the gating component, having determined the frequency of breathing, can gradually increase the magnitude of the adjustment until the scanning plane maintains a substantially constant view of the structure being viewed throughout the breathing cycle. This gating component  can thus allow for uninterrupted acquisition of ultrasound-generated data due to the consistency of the image plane relative to the targeted structures as the image mechanism moves together with the patient.","The analysis component  can include software and\/or hardware adapted to perform any and\/or all of the methods and processes described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,247 referenced above. For example, the analysis component  may include software or hardware configured to analyze the received ultrasound-generated data points and assist a user in managing the hemodynamic status of a patient.","The control module  can be provided with one of several different levels of control capability. In some embodiments, the control module  can include relatively little control capability. In this embodiment, the control module may include the image mechanism component . In another embodiment, the control module  may further include the adjustment mechanism component  and in still another embodiment, the probe  may further include the analysis component . Where the control module  is provided with less than all of the control related components, these components can be provided by another system in communication with the probe .","The control module  can be located within the probe  as shown, for example in . In this embodiment, a lead  may extend proximally from the probe  to a system interface  adapted to communicate with a system , as shown in . In this embodiment, the probe  may have a relatively large profile  (e.g., greater than 5 cm) as shown in . In another embodiment, as shown in , the control module  can be located relatively remote from the probe . In some embodiments, this remote distance can range from a few centimeters to a foot. Positioning the control module  remote from the probe  may allow the probe  to have a reduced profile  (e.g., less than 5 cm). It is noted that the size of the probe  can also be dependent on the size and orientation of the image mechanism and the adjustment mechanism, where the image mechanism size is further dependent on the type of piezoelectric crystal arrangement being used.","The probe  can thus be used with varying levels of support systems depending on the capability of the control module . At one end of the spectrum, the probe  can be interfaced with a system  similar to that described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/536,247. In this embodiment, the probe  can have a control module  having the image mechanism component  and control of the actuation mechanism and analysis can be performed by the attached system . Alternatively, the control module  can further include a adjustment mechanism component  leaving the system to control the analysis. At the other end of the spectrum, where the control module  includes each of the image mechanism component , the adjustment mechanism component , and the analysis component , the probe  may be capable of use by interfacing the probe  with a user interface. In this example, the probe  may, for example, be connected to a USB port of a computer and a specialized ultrasound machine may or may not be provided.","Having described one embodiment of the probe  in great detail, a securing system  will now be described. The securing system  can be positioned on the patient and can be adapted to adhere or otherwise anchor itself to the surface of the patient. The securing system  can further be configured to receive the probe  and connect to the probe  thereby securing the probe  to the location on the patient at which the securing system  is secured. As such, the securing system  can include an anchoring member with an adhesive feature, a probe connecting system, and a recognition module.","Regarding the anchoring member, this element may be configured to adhere to the patient. The anchoring member can be a generally planar member so as to provide a pad like location for placement of the probe . Alternatively, the anchor member can be a tubular or port type member to provide for insertion of the probe  therein. Other shapes and types of anchoring members can be provided for receiving and connecting to the probe . The anchoring member can include a patient interface  adapted for placement against the skin of a patient. The patient interface can include a relatively flat or slightly contoured surface. The anchoring member can further include an adhesive feature. The adhesive feature can be in the form of a biocompatible adhesive membrane positioned on the patient interface  or the adhesive feature can be a tape like feature having a size at least slightly larger than the anchoring member. The tape-like feature can be adapted to cover the anchoring member and secure the member to the patient. The tape-like feature can include perforations to accommodate the probe  or the tape-like feature may cover both the probe  and the anchoring member.

While the pivot axis of the tilt mechanism  may be near the top of the housing , as indicated in and , in other embodiments, the pivot axis of the tilt mechanism  may be in other locations, such as, for example, the near the bottom of the housing , as depicted in ","Referring now to , yet another embodiment of a device  is shown. As shown the device  may include a securing system  in the form of a patch assembly and may also include a probe  attached to the securing system . The patch assembly may have a flexible lower adhesive layer  for affixing the device to the patient's skin surface and an upper base layer .

The device  may include a securing system  in the form of a patch assembly similar to those discussed above. The device  may also include a probe  having an adjustment mechanism in the form of a pair of parallel rails , , a traveling rail , and a housing . The opposite ends of the traveling rail  may be configured to displace along the parallel rails , as indicated by arrows A.

The housing  may be grasped manually to position it as desired; alternatively, the mechanism may be powered for automated displacement and positioning of the housing .","Referring now to , yet another embodiment of a device  is shown. The device  may include a securing mechanism  in the form of a patch assembly and may further include a probe  with a housing , a transducer  and cable  similar to those discussed above. However, instead of being pivotally coupled to the patch assembly, the housing  may be coupled to the patch assembly via an adjustment mechanism in the form of multiple deformable arms . These arms  may be formed of a flexible material that retains a shape the arms  are deformed into until physically caused to assume a new shape. Thus, the housing  may be displaced to cause the arms  to deform or deflect into a new shape that facilitates the transducer  being positioned as desired, the arms  maintaining the housing  in the desired position until acted upon. As can be understood from , the arms  may be bent on a side as indicated by arrow R, the arms  on the other side (indicated by arrow T) being in a non-bent configuration. As a result, the housing  is tipped relative to the patch assembly, thereby allowing the transducer  to be oriented as desired.","Referring now to , still another embodiment of a device  is shown. The device  may be configured to operate in a manner similar to that depicted in , except the adjustment mechanism shown in  as deformable arms  are replaced with an according or gusset style body  between the housing  and the patch. The accordion or gusset style body  may be formed of a flexible material that, in combination with its gusset shape, retains a deflection deformed into until physically caused to assume a new deflection. Thus, the housing  may be displaced to cause the gusset body  to deflect into a new shape that facilitates the transducer  being positioned as desired, the gusset body  maintaining the housing  in the desired position until acted upon. As can be understood from , the gusset body  may be compressed on a side as indicated by arrow R, the gusset body  on the other side (indicated by arrow T) being in a non-compressed or even extended configuration. As a result, the housing  is tipped relative to the patch assembly, thereby allowing the transducer  to be oriented as desired.","Referring now to , still another embodiment of a device  is shown. The device  may be configured to operate in a manner similar to that depicted in , except the adjustment mechanism is in the form of a gusset body  of  is replaced with a segmented body  formed of multiple semi-hemispherical bodies , , interlocked and received within each other in a manner similar to that found with a lamp having a flexible neck extending between the lamp's base and head. As indicated by the dashed lines in , the bodies , , may be tipped within each other to allow the segmented body  to assume a shape and thereby position the housing  until the segmented body  is acted on to assume another deflected condition. Thus, the housing  may be displaced to cause the segmented body  to deflect into a new shape that facilitates the transducer  being positioned as desired, the segmented body  maintaining the housing  is the desired position until acted upon. As can be understood from , the segmented body  may be tipped on a side so the bodies , , are received in each other to a greater extent as indicated by arrow R, the bodies , , on the other side (indicated by arrow T) being in a less received state relative to each other. As a result, the housing  is tipped relative to the patch assembly, thereby allowing the transducer  to be oriented as desired.","Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to various embodiments, persons skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
