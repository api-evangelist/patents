More specifically, the present invention relates to medicinal applications of compounds binding to mSin3B that specifically binds to NRSF.","Formation of normal cells, tissues and organs in the body is achieved through expression of genes at appropriate times, in appropriate places and in appropriate quantities. As a result, normal function is exerted. For example, neural genes must be expressed properly in neuronal cells but not in non-neural cells. NRSE\/RE1 (neural restrictive silencer element\/repressor element 1) is a silencer consisting of 21 base pairs and present in the vicinity of neuron specific genes. This silencer plays a central role in neuron-specific transcriptional regulation of more than 30 genes for such substances as neurotransmitter synthetases, ion channels, neuronal growth-associated proteins, and so forth. It is said that approximately 1000 genes (mainly neuron specific genes) have this silencer. This silencer does not work in neuronal cells but suppresses expression of neuron specific genes in non-neuronal cells, to thereby assure expression of neuron specific genes in neuronal cells. It is also believed that this silencer is not only involved in the expression control of neuron specific genes but also involved in terminal differentiation of neuronal cells. It is NRSF\/REST (neural restrictive silencer factor) that has been identified as a transcriptional repression factor which binds to the above-described NRSE\/RE1 and represses expression of neuron specific genes in non-neuronal cells.","It is reported that abnormal expression of NRSF\/REST and genes targeted by NRSF\/REST is involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, and medulloblastoma.","Down's syndrome is a disease caused by chromosome 21 trisomy mutation. Examination of difference in genes between neural tissues of fetuses dying from Down's syndrome and those of normal fetuses revealed that expression of SCG10 (a neuron-specific growth-associated protein) gene and other genes targeted by NRSF\/REST such as decreased greatly in the former. On the other hand, those proteins regulated by transcription factors other than NRSF\/REST were expressed normally (Non-Patent Document No. 1).","Alzheimer's disease is a disease caused by accumulation of \u03b2 amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle and neuronal death. Expression of SCG10 was altered in Alzheimer's disease brains (Non-Patent Document No. 2).","Medulloblastoma is the most malignant brain tumor in children. Expression levels of NRSF\/REST in medulloblastoma cells are very high. A recombinant protein REST-VP16 that antagonizes NRSF\/REST and activates genes there targeted thereby promotes expression of neuronal genes and also activates the caspase cascade to thereby induce apoptosis. REST-VP16 is a potential therapeutic (Non-Patent Document No. 3).","Huntington's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease manifesting choreic movement, dementia and personality change as major symptoms. It is believed that abnormal huntingtin molecules with a repeat structure of glutamine residues form aggregates to thereby induce neurodegeneration. Wild-type huntingtin binds to NRSF\/REST in the cytoplasm to regulate the binding of NRSF\/REST to NRSE\/RE1. On the other hand, this control is lost in Huntington's disease; thus, neuronal genes are not expressed sufficiently (Non-Patent Document No. 4).","Chronic pain caused by neuronal disorders (neuropathic pain) presents complicated pain symptoms in which positive symptoms (pain hypersensitivity and allodynia (a strong pain induced by a tactile stimulus)) and negative symptoms (hypoesthesia) are mixed. Since this abnormal pain shows resistance to anti-inflammatory drugs and morphine, it is regarded as intractable pain.","Recently, Uchida et al. revealed that expression of the silencer factor NRSF\/REST is enhanced in primary sensory neurons after neuropathy to silence a group of pain-associated genes (Na1.8, MOP, TRPM8, TRPA1 and K4.3) through epigenetic modification (lowering of histone acetylation) and induce C-fiber hypoesthesia and morphine resistance which are characteristic of neuropathic pain (Non-Patent Documents Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10).","Further, Naruse et al. revealed that the N-terminal transcriptional repressor domain of NRSF\/REST recruits HDAC through co-repressor mSin3 and that the C-terminal transcriptional repressor domain recruits HDAC through CoREST, and suggested that NRSF\/REST represses transcription by deactivation of the chromatin structure (Non-Patent Document No. 5).","The present inventors have already analyzed the structure of a complex composed of the N-terminal transcription repressor domain of NRSF (associated with Huntington's disease, medulloblastoma and neuropathic pain) and the PAH1 domain of co-repressor mSin3B which specifically binds to that domain (Patent Document No. 1 and Non-Patent Document No. 6).","However, no compounds have been reported so far which bind to mSin3B that specifically binds to neural restrictive silencer factor NRSF.","It is an object of the present invention to identify compounds which bind to the PAH1 domain of mSin3B that specifically binds to neural restrictive silence factor NRSF that is associated with Huntington's disease, medulloblastoma and neuropathic pain. Such compounds may be used as lead compounds for therapeutics for Huntington's disease, medulloblastoma and neuropathic pain.","The present inventors identified by NMR those compounds which bind to the PAH1 domain of mSin3B that specifically binds to neural restrictive silence factor NRSF. Further, the present inventors subjected the above-identified compounds to MTT assay using human medulloblastoma cell strains and found compounds which cause cell death and compounds which inhibit cell growth. Further, hypoesthesia is observed in electrical stimulation-induced paw withdrawal (EPW) test which evaluates pain threshold in response to C-fiber specific electrical stimulation (5 Hz) at the time of neuropathic pain, and disappearance of morphine analgesia is observed in thermal paw withdrawal test which evaluates pain threshold against thermal stimulation. The present inventors found that some of the above-identified compounds that cause recovery from such modulations. The present invention has been achieved based on these findings.","A summary of the present invention is as described below.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"27.77mm","wi":"55.12mm","file":"US09206125-20151208-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein n represents 0 or 1;

For example, such a pharmaceutical preparation may be administered orally at a daily dose of approximately 0.1-1000 mg\/kg (body weight), preferably at a daily dose of approximately 1-500 mg\/kg (body weight), as converted to the amount of the active ingredient. This dose may be administered once or may be divided into several times. However, the dose and the number of times of administration may be appropriately altered depending on the symptoms and age of the patient, the method of administration route, and so forth.

Immediately before administration, the compound was diluted with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (DMSO final concentration: 0.5%) and administered into the spinal subarachnoid space (i.t.) at 0.5 nmol\/5 \u03bcl. For control group, DMSO (0.5%) diluted with artificial cerebrospinal fluid was administered as a vehicle. In an experiment involving systemic administration of mSin3B compounds, the compound was diluted with physiological saline (DMSO final concentration: 10%) immediately before administration and administered at 5 mg\/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.). For the control group in this experiment, DMSO (10%) diluted with physiological saline was administered as a vehicle. On the other hand, morphine was dissolved in physiological saline and administered intraplantarly (i.pl.) at 30 nmol\/20 \u03bcl. ACU values from 10 to 60 minutes after morphine administration were calculated to evaluate of the analgesic effect of morphine. For behavioral analysis concerning pain, (1) \u201celectrical stimulation-induced paw withdrawal (EPW) test\u201d (Matsumoto et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 318:735-740, 2006; Ueda, Mol Pain, 4:11, 2008, REVIEW) to evaluate a pain threshold in response to C-fiber specific electrical stimulation (5 Hz) and (2) \u201cthermal paw withdrawal test\u201d (Inoue et al., Nature Medicine, 10: 712-718, 2004) to evaluate a pain threshold in response to thermal stimulation were used. For expression analysis of a group of pain-associated genes (Na1.8 and MOP), the cell soma of primary sensory neuron (dorsal root ganglia) after nerve injury was used; evaluation was made by quantitative real time PCR.","mSin3B compounds: 3,5-dimethylpiperidyl 3-methyl-4-nitrophenyl ketone (compound 155), 1-[4-(difluoromethoxy)phenyl]-2-(3,5-dimethylpiperidyl)ethan-1-one (compound A28), N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-N\u2032-(3-methylbutyl)butane-1,4-diamide (compound 106)","Three days after nerve injury, mSin3B compound (A28) was administered once, followed by analysis of mRNA levels of a group of pain-associated genes (Na1.8 and MOP) in dorsal root ganglia at 3, 6 and 12 hours after the administration (n=3 for each analysis). As a result, a tendency was observed that the lowering of expression of Na1.8 and MOP after nerve injury is recovered by about 10-15% by treatment with A28 (0.5 nmol i.t.) (). It was suggested that about 3-6 hours are needed for the effect to appear.","Subsequently, the efficacies of mSin3B compounds (A28, 155, 106 (NC)) on hypoesthesia after nerve injury were evaluated by EPW test. Three days after nerve injury, increase of pain threshold in response to C-fiber stimulation (i.e., hypoesthesia) was observed in injury groups (injury-veh group: n=5; injury-A28 group: n=6; injury-155 group: n=6; injury-106 group: n=6) compared to control group (sham-veh group: n=6). Further, mSin3B compounds (A28, 155, 106 (NC)) or vehicle was administered once per day after behavioral analysis. As a result, a tendency of recovery from hypoesthesia was observed starting 4 days after nerve injury (1 day after the start of administration) in injury-A28 group and injury-155 group; this tendency became more marked 5 days after nerve injury (2 days after the start of administration) (). As a result of statistical analysis, a significant difference was recognized between pain threshold values at 3 days after nerve injury and 5 days after nerve injury in injury-A28 group and injury-155 group. On the other hand, no effect on pain threshold was recognized in injury-106 group.","Subsequently, in consideration of clinical indications, mSin3B compound (A28 or 155) was administered systemically (intraperitoneally) (5 mg\/kg) and consecutively for 3, 4 and 5 days after nerve injury, followed by evaluation of the effect on pain threshold. Pain tests were performed prior to administration of the compound. As a result, time-dependent recovery from hypoesthesia was observed in both A28- and 155-administered groups (n=3 for each group) relative to the hypoesthesia at 3 days after nerve injury (control group) ().","Further, efficacies of mSinB3 compounds (A28, 155, 106 (NC)) on morphine resistance after nerve injury were evaluated using thermal paw withdrawal test. Administration of mSin3B compounds was started 3 days after nerve injury, and after 5 days after nerve injury 2 days after the start of administration, peripheral morphine (30 nmol i.pl.) analgesia was analyzed (sham-veh group: n=6; injury-veh group: n=5; injury-A28 group: n=6; injury-155 group: n=6; injury-106 group: n=3). The results revealed that, compared to sham-veh group, effect of morphine analgesia disappeared in injury-veh group, but morphine analgesia almost equivalent to that in sham-veh group was obtained in injury-A28 group. In injury-155 group, significant recovery of morphine analgesia was recognized. On the other hand, morphine analgesia was hardly recognized in injury-106 group. These results are shown in .","mRNA levels of Na1.8 in dorsal root ganglia after administration of mSin3B compound (A28 or 155) (0.5 nmol i.t.) were evaluated by a quantitative real time method, revealing that compound 155 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory effect on the lowering of expression of Na1.8 due to nerve injury; however, A28 did not exhibit a significant change (sham-veh group: n=3; injury-veh group: n=3; injury-A28 group: n=3; injury-155 group: n=2) ().","All the publications, patents and patent applications cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","A substance capable of binding to the PAH1 domain of mSin3B (e.g., a compound represented by formula (I), pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, or pharmacologically acceptable ester thereof) may be used as a medicine, especially as a prophylactic and\/or a therapeutic for diseases associated with abnormal expression of neural restrictive silencer factor NRSF\/REST or abnormal expression of genes targeted by NRSF\/REST.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0009","list-style":"none"},"li":"Patent Document No. 1: WO2006\/030722 International Publication"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0010","list-style":"none"},"li":["Non-Patent Document No. 1: Bahn S et al.: 359, 310-315 (2002)","Non-Patent Document No. 2: Okazaki T et al.: 16, 883-894 (1995)","Non-Patent Document No. 3: Lawinger P et al.: 7, 826-831 (2000)","Non-Patent Document No. 4: Zuccato C et al.: 35, 76-83 (2003)","Non-Patent Document No. 5: Naruse Y et al.: 96, 13691-13696 (1999)","Non-Patent Document No. 6354, 903-915 (2005)","Non-Patent Document No. 7: Uchida et al., 166, 1-4, 2010","Non-Patent Document No. 8: Uchida et al., 30, 4806-4814, 2010","Non-Patent Document No. 9: Ueda, 4:11, 2008, Review","Non-Patent Document No. 10: Ueda, 109:57-77, 2006, Review"]}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 14","sub":"v"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 18","sub":"v"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
