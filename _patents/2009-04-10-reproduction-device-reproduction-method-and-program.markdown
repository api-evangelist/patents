This is performed in case of an unexpected event of a sudden cutoff of power supply to an apparatus. As with conventional measures against power outages, this processing is considered essential for stable operations of the apparatus. On the other hand, status restoring is a technique to resume the operation which was being executed before the power cutoff, after the power supply to the apparatus is restarted, based on the data written onto the nonvolatile storage medium. In playback apparatuses which execute AV playback of DVD-Video, the status saving and the status restoring are performed as follows: before AV playback stops, a physical or a logical playback position is written onto the nonvolatile storage medium; and the next playback is resumed from the playback position written onto the nonvolatile storage medium.\n\n","There are two types of contents for AV playback: DVD-Video contents and BD-ROM contents. Instruction sets used in the DVD-Video contents are commands that are interpreted by a so-called command interpreter. In this case, merely saving a value of a program counter that indicates which instruction was being executed, retention values of registers, and the like enables status restoring.","On the other hand, for the BD-ROM contents, AV playback and Java applications operate in conjunction with each other. Operations of Java applications require multiple threads, a huge number of variables, various screen rendering parameters, and the like. Accordingly, before power supply to the apparatus is cut off, all of these multiple threads, variables, various screen rendering parameters need to be written onto the nonvolatile storage medium to resume the operation which was being executed prior to the power cutoff. In addition, it is necessary to write memory information used for operations of the Java applications, management information held by the operating system (OS), and the like onto the nonvolatile storage medium, and to cause the apparatus to execute processing called suspend or hibernation.","However, in general, the capacity of a nonvolatile storage area and hardware resources of consumer electronics (CE) apparatuses such as BD-ROM playback apparatuses are often smaller compared to those of personal computers. Accordingly, part of the information required for resuming an operation may not be written onto the nonvolatile storage medium for status saving. When this occurs, proper performance of the resumed operation cannot be ensured. Assume that an attempt is made to resume the operation with part of the information to be status-saved missing, the playback apparatus may suffer from a hung-up or a blackout. Since CE apparatuses require to ensure a much higher quality than personal computers, status saving and status restoring with a risk of operation failures such as the above are unacceptable for practical use.","The object of the present invention is to provide a playback apparatus that is able to stably resume an operation of an application after a power cutoff even in a case where the size of a nonvolatile storage medium used for status saving is limited.","In order to solve the above-mentioned aim, one aspect of the present invention is a playback apparatus for realizing saving and restoring of statuses of a plurality of processes, one of the processes being playback of an AV stream, and another of the processes being processing of an application in conjunction with the playback of the AV stream, the playback apparatus comprising: a read unit operable to read the application and the AV stream from a recording medium; a platform unit that allows the application to run; a playback unit operable to play back the AV stream; and a first storage medium that has a volatile storage area in which playback status parameters have been written, the playback status parameters showing in what state the playback of the AV stream is performed, wherein the application has written, into the volatile storage area, one or more parameters selected from among a plurality of parameters used in the platform unit as application resume parameters required for resuming an operation of the application after the restoring of the statuses, the saving of the statuses is performed by writing the application resume parameters and the playback status parameters into a nonvolatile storage area of a second storage medium, and the restoring of the statuses is performed by writing the application resume parameters and the playback status parameters back into the volatile storage area, and loading the application to the platform unit based on the playback status parameters written back into the volatile storage area.","The playback apparatus with the above-described solution performs status restoring by re-loading the application based on the playback status resume parameters. Because the application is loaded again for the status restoring, it is not necessary to write multiple threads, variables, various screen rendering parameters, memory information, and OS management information into the nonvolatile storage medium. Without a need to write these information, the size of the nonvolatile storage medium can be reduced to the minimum necessary.","Additionally, because the application resume parameters are written into the storage area of the volatile storage medium, the operation of the application can be resumed only by loading the application again.","The application can realize a counter measure for power-outage only by selecting, from among parameters used for the operation, parameters necessary for resuming the operation after the status restoring and writing the selected parameters into the storage area of the volatile storage medium. Accordingly, overhead for status saving and status restoring for the application can be reduced compared with when the application directly writes operation parameters into a nonvolatile memory. Furthermore, because a counter measure for power failure can be executed while also minimizing the overhead, the performance of the apparatus will not decline.","Thus, if the playback apparatus executes, for example, a game in which AV playback and an operation of the application proceed in conjunction with each other, it is possible to resume the game somewhere in the middle with parameters of the characters such as scores maintained.","It should be noted that resuming an operation in the above-described playback apparatus requires active involvement of the application. If parameters required for resuming the operation are not selected from among the parameters used in the heap area, the resuming cannot be executed, and consequently, an inconsistency may occur between the operation of the application and the operation of the playback apparatus. Such a problem can be solved by configuring the above-described playback apparatus as follows.","That is, the playback apparatus is configured such that the recording medium further has resume information recorded thereon, the resume information indicating whether or not the playback unit and the application use the playback status parameters and the application resume parameters written back into the volatile storage area, after the restoring of the statuses, and if the resume information indicates affirmatively, the playback unit resumes the playback based on the playback status parameters written back into the volatile storage area, and the application resumes the operation using the application resume parameters written back into the volatile storage area, and if the resume information indicates negatively, the playback unit does not resume the playback of the AV stream, and the application does not resume the operation.","In the playback apparatus with the addition of the above-described inventive particular matter, when the application supports selecting the parameters required for resuming the operation as the application resume parameters, resuming can be allowed by setting the resume information accordingly. On the other hand, if the application does not support selecting the parameters required for resuming the operation as the application resume parameters, resuming can be prohibited by setting the resume information accordingly. As is apparent from the above, whether resume playback is allowed or not can be controlled based on the judgement of a content creator. Accordingly, playback in accordance with the content creator's intention can be achieved.","When the content creator prefers that a content including video, audio, and Java\u2122 applications not be resumed, resuming can be restricted depending on how the resume information is set. As a result, an unexpected operation by the user will not trigger operations unintended by the content creator.","In general, power supply to a playback apparatus is shut down based on an operation of the user who uses the apparatus, and when the user shuts down the power cannot be foreseen.","Accordingly, if power is shut down by a user operation before the application saves the parameters into the nonvolatile memory for the status saving, information stored on the volatile storage medium gets all cleared, failing to be saved onto the nonvolatile storage medium. In this case, even if the power is turned ON again, the operation of the Java\u2122 application cannot be resumed from the status prior to the power shutdown, because the information has not been saved on the nonvolatile storage medium. Even if resumed, the operation becomes unstable.","As described above, if an unforeseen operation by the user triggers an operation unintended by the content creator, the content creator may prefer that the content including video, audio, and the Java\u2122 applications not be resumed. Meanwhile, conventional resume apparatuses are unable to reflect the intention of the content creator because the playback apparatus can perform resuming only with its own functions.","This problem can be resolved by configuring the above-described playback apparatus as follows.","That is, the above-described playback apparatus further holds resume support information that indicates whether or not a content of the volatile storage area is able to be saved into the nonvolatile storage area, wherein upon activation of the application, the resume support information is transferred to the application, and the application resume parameters are written into the nonvolatile storage only if the resume support information received by the application indicates affirmatively.","In a playback apparatus that has no power backup for a volatile memory and thus loses the content of the volatile memory due to a sudden power OFF by a user operation, it is likely that the parameters for the status restoring are not properly saved. In this case, the resume support information set to \u201csaving not possible\u201d can inform the application properly that the parameters cannot be saved. As a result, the application does not expect the playback apparatus to perform resuming, and accordingly, performing resuming of an operation based on unstable parameters can be avoided.","In a playback apparatus that has a power backup for a volatile memory and thus is able to save the content of the volatile memory even at an occurrence of a sudden power OFF, the parameters for the status restoring are properly saved. In such a playback apparatus, the resume support information set to \u201csaving possible\u201d can inform the application properly that the parameters can be saved. As a result, the application can expects the playback apparatus to perform resuming.","Because whether resuming is supported or not in the playback apparatus is notified to the application, and the application, executes necessary operations required for resuming based on this information, the playback apparatus and the application can interact with each other more closely.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.","The following describes an embodiment of a playback apparatus.

That is, the playback apparatus operates in the HDMV mode or in the BD-J mode before power-off and after power-on. The mode management resume is performed by the mode management module which executes mode management. Among the parameters to be saved onto the nonvolatile storage medium, those parameters required for the mode management are referred to as \u201cmode management resume parameters\u201d. In the mode management resume, Index.bdmv, and operation mode objects (BD-J objects or movie objects) that correspond with the current title are the mode management parameters. Because these are stored in the dynamic scenario memory , writing the contents of the dynamic scenario memory  onto the nonvolatile memory  enables the status saving.","The second type of resuming is \u201cplayback status resume\u201d. This is resuming for the operation to be commonly executed in the HDMV mode and the BD-J mode, that is, resuming for maintaining the same playback control of a playlist. Parameters used for the playback status resume are called playback status resume parameters. In the playback status resume, values stored in the player status registers are the playback status resume parameters. Here, the current title number is necessary for the mode management resume. However, because it is stored in the player status registers, the current title number is processed as one of the playback status resume parameters. The current playlist information and the current clip information stored in the static scenario memory  are not included in the playback status resume parameters in the present embodiment. This is because these are indicated by the player status registers; they can be obtained by reading the BD-ROM again based on the storage values of the player status registers.","The third type of resuming is \u201capplication resume\u201d. This is to maintain the same operation of the application before power-off and after power-on. Among the parameters to be saved onto the nonvolatile storage medium, those parameters to be used for the application resume are referred to as \u201capplication resume parameters\u201d. The above-described three resumes are required for resuming of the BD-ROM contents. The overall control of these resumes is performed by the mode management module .","BD-ROM contents require playback of moving images and execution of an application to be performed in conjunction with each other. One typical example is game contents which require playback of moving images while proceeding the game in accordance with user operations. Another typical example is online shopping contents which require playback of moving images while executing online shopping on a Web page in accordance with user operations.

For example, when the user turns on a power supply switch (not depicted) of the playback apparatus of the BD-ROM, power is supplied to the register set , enabling information written into the register set  to be stored therein. When the power supply switch (not depicted) of the playback apparatus of the BD-ROM is turned off, power supply to the register set  stops, which clears the information stored in the register set .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0125"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["24","24"]},"The player setting registers store therein configurations of the playback apparatus. The configurations of the playback apparatus include such as audio language setting, subtitle language setting, TV display setting, and age setting of the playback apparatus. Storage contents of the registers need to be stored even after the power supply is turned-OFF. Accordingly, the storage contents are backed up onto the nonvolatile memory .","The player status registers (PSR) are registers having numbered storage places each for storing a value. For example, in a storage place numbered with a certain figure, the identifier of the playlist currently being played back is stored; in another storage place with another number, the identifier of the audio currently being used is stored. The playback position of the AV stream currently being played back can be identified based on the values stored in these storage positions. The AV playback engine , the HDMV module , or the BD-J module  stores values into the numbered storage positions of the player status registers. The contents acquire\/store a value corresponding to the specified number from\/to the player status registers or the general purpose registers, via the AV playback engine , the HDMV module , or the BD-J module .","Major PSR are described below.","PSR specifies one of multiple audio streams playable in the current play item. When the set value of the PSR  changes, the playback apparatus plays back the audio stream specified by the changed set value. The PSR  is set to 0xFF as an initial value, and can be set to a value ranging from 1 to 32 by the playback apparatus. 0xFF is an undefined value, and indicates that no audio stream exists, or no audio stream is selected. The set value ranging from 1 to 32 is interpreted as the audio stream number.","PSR  is set to a value ranging from 1 to 100 to indicate a title to which the current playback position belongs.","PSR  is set to a value ranging from 1 to 999 to indicate a chapter number to which the current playback posit ion belongs, and is set to a value 0xFFFF to indicate that chapter numbers are invalid in the playback apparatus.","PSR  is set to a value ranging from 0 to 999 to indicate the number of the current playlist to which the current playback position belongs.","PSR  is set to a value ranging from 0 to 255 to indicate the number of the current play item to which the current playback position belongs.","PSR is set to a value ranging from 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF to indicate the current playback position (current PTM) with a time accuracy of 45 KHz. The above is a description on the PSR.","In the following, exemplary processing is described. In the exemplary processing, a BD-ROM content is played back, and a BD-J application constituting a title included in the BD-ROM content saves information necessary for resume playback when the playback of the title stops.","In the general-purpose registers, among the application parameters used in the heap memory  by the BD-J application, application parameters required for resuming the operation next have been written by the BD-J application. The parameters shown in the figure, i.e., the data file name corresponding to the indicator (indicator image.PNG), the display coordinate of the indicator (X, Y), the vertical height and the horizontal width (height, width), the stage number (STAGE: 5), the life value (LIFE: 3), the item used in the game (ITEM: G,N), and the score (SCORE: 10,500) are parameters judged by the BD-J application to be required for rendering the screen of  again.","<Processing Performed when Playback Stops>","When instructed to stop the title playback by receiving a notification of an occurrence of power supply turned-OFF, power interruption, or the like, the BD-J application performs the following: the BD-J application selects parameters required for resuming the operation from among various parameters existing in the heap memory, i.e., values of variables used in the operation, display coordinates, time information of the current point in time and the like, and writes them into the general-purpose registers as parameters (application resume parameters) to be saved into the nonvolatile memory. In addition to these parameters, the BD-J application further acquires, as application resume parameters, information to be saved, from the player setting registers and the player status registers. Furthermore, the BD-J application stores the application resume parameters in the general-purpose registers (hereinafter, referred to as saving of application resume parameters). Upon completion of the saving of the application resume parameters, the BD-J application notifies the BD-J module  of the completion. Note that the application resume parameters are the same as Java resume parameters in the description of the basic application.","Upon receiving a completion notification from a BD-J application, the BD-J module  stops the BD-J application. Having stopped the BD-J application, the BD-J module  notifies the mode management module  that the title has stopped.","Upon receiving a notification that the playback of the title has stopped, the mode management module  saves the playback status resume parameters in the register set  to the nonvolatile memory . These playback status resume parameters include parameters such as a title number, which are required for the mode management performed by the mode management module .","<Processing Performed when Playback Resumes>","The following describes operations for resuming the title playback upon the power supply being turned-ON again after the playback of the content stops.","The mode management module  judges whether the content to be played back corresponds to the contents of the register set  saved in advance.","One method for judging the above correspondence is to check whether the recording medium has been ejected. If the recording medium has not been ejected, it is obvious that the content corresponds to the contents of the register set  saved for the mode management resume. Another exemplary method for realizing the judgement is to compare the content identification information of the content corresponding to the contents of the register set  saved for the mode management resume, and the content identification information of the content to be played back.","Here, if the content to be played back is judged not to correspond to the contents of the register set  saved for the mode management resume, restoring processing described below is not executed, and instead, normal playback processing determined by the BD-ROM is performed. The description hereinafter is under the assumption that the content to be played back corresponds with the contents of the register set .","When the playback of the content starts, prior to the start of a title playback, the contents of the register set  saved in advance are restored. When a title is to be played back, the mode management module  instructs the BD-J module  to play back the title. The BD-J module  activates the BD-J application associated with the title.","When activated, the BD-J application can acquire the information saved for the application resume and restores the previous operation status.","It is judged whether the BD-J application has failed to acquire the application resume parameters and whether the acquired contents are different from the expected values. If it is judged that the BD-J application has failed to acquire the application resume parameters, or the acquired contents are different from the expected values, the acquired information is not used, and playback is started from the beginning. If the acquired application resume parameters match the expected values, the BD-J application restores the previous playback status based on the acquired application resume parameters. AV playback can be resumed from the playback position where the AV playback has stopped, using, for example, the ID of the playlist acquired from the number 0 and the time indicating how far the playback has advanced acquired from the number 1.","In a case of having saved a title number for the mode management resume, the mode management module  realizes resume playback in which where the resume playback starts is specified by the title number, as follows: when playback of the same content is resumed, the mode management module  starts playback from the saved title number, instead of performing playback in a normal playback order.","With these processing, the playback apparatus  is able to perform resume playback of a title.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0149"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"In the figures, the register set  and the heap memory  in the internal structure shown in  are extracted and illustrated.

In , playback status resume parameters and application resume parameters corresponding to a time t are stored for the title identifier \u201c\u201d; and playback status resume parameters and application resume parameters corresponding to a time t are stored for the title identifier \u201c\u201d.","The playback status resume parameters corresponding to the time t are playback status resume parameters for when the content having the title identifier \u201c\u201d was played back; and the playback status resume parameters corresponding to the time t are playback status resume parameters for when the content having the title identifier \u201c\u201d was played back.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0226","num":"0228"},"figref":"FIG. 20B","b":["0001","1","0001","1","0001"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0227","num":"0229"},"figref":"FIG. 20C","b":["0002","2","0002","2","0002"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0228","num":"0230"},"figref":"FIG. 20D","b":["0001","0002","0001","1","1"]},"In this state, if the playback of the content having the title identifier \u201c\u201d starts, the mode management module  can perform resume playback using the playback status resume parameters corresponding to t. If the playback of the content having the title identifier \u201c\u201d starts, the mode management module  performs resume playback using the playback status resume parameters corresponding to t.","<Duplexing Saving Destination)","Saving for the mode management resume may fail due to a power failure during the saving or an occurrence of some kind of failure. Such a problem can be dealed with by duplexing the destination of the saving for the mode management resume, that is, preparing more than two saving destinations and use them sequentially.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0231","num":"0233"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["26","1","2"]},"As shown in , the mode management module  saves application resume parameters and playback status resume parameters into the storage area , which is the first saving destination, at, the first timing of performing saving for the mode management resume. If the saving is successfully performed, the mode management module  records information indicating that the first storage  has saved a content in a normal state. At the next timing of performing saving for the mode management resume, as shown in , parameters are saved into the storage area , which is the second saving destination. If this saving is successfully performed, the mode management module  records information indicating that the storage area  has stored a content in a normal state. With this processing, the saving destination which was last used for saving and which is recorded to have stored a content in a normal state can be used to avoid the above-mentioned problem.","Consequently, the BD-J application itself does not need to record information whether each saving destination has a content saved in a normal state or not.","When it is desired to judge whether each saving destination has a content saved in a normal state or not, it can be judged by reading information indicating that the saving destination has stored a content in a normal state, from among information pieces included in each saving destination. If there are two or more contents that have been saved in a normal state, the most recently saved content is provided for restoring and using.","Note that each of the first saving destination and the second saving destination may include information indicating that the content saved into the saving destination has been saved in a normal state.","(Supplementary Notes)","The present invention has been explained above based on the best mode for carrying out the invention at the time of the application. However, following technical features can be further improved or modified. It should be noted that whether to implement the present invention as shown in the embodiments above or improve\/modify the present invention as follows depends on the person who carries out the invention.","Note that the explanations above are merely examples, and the person who carries out the invention can apply the present invention in various manners.","<Programming Language Application Range>","In the above-described embodiments, Java\u2122 is used as the programming language of the virtual machine. However, the programming language does not always need to be Java\u2122, and may be B-Shell, Perl Script, ECMAScript, etc. that are used in UNIX\u2122 OS.","<Content Unboundary Resume>","The resume information may include information indicating whether cross-content resume playback is expected or not. Assume that a content is switched to another content after the mode management resume parameters are saved. With use of the above-mentioned information, the playback apparatus can operate without using the saved mode management resume parameters.","<Directory Structure>","The file and directory structure of the embodiments are only an example, and other structures are applicable in the present invention.","<Multi-Drive>","The BD-ROM drive  may read\/write from\/to readable\/writable BD-REs and use various recording media such as an DVD, a CD, and the like, in addition to supporting BD-ROMs.","<Variation of Function Structure>","The function structure shown in the embodiments is an example of a BD-ROM playback apparatus, and the present invention is practicable with other function structures as long as the operations described above can be realized.","<Information Required for Resume>","The ED-J application does not need to acquire information from all of the player status registers, and only needs to acquire information necessary for resume of the BD-J application.","<Format for Saving Register Contents>","When saving for the mode management resume includes saving of contents of the register set , the data format of the contents of the register set  does not need to be kept as it is. The data format can be changed for saving as long as the contents of the register set  can be restored. For example, the contents of the register set  can be compressed using a known compression technique, and the compressed contents can be saved when performing saving for the mode management resume.","<Processing after Successful Acquisition of Application Resume Parameters>","It is not always necessary to restore the previous playback status even if the application resume parameters are successfully acquired.","<Differential Data and Changed Data in Mode Management Resume>","Not all the contents of the register set  need to be saved when performing saving for the mode management resume. Only sufficient information for restoring needs to be included. For example, it is possible to specify an initial value, and save only a portion which differs from the initial value, or only a portion which has been changed in some way.","<Contents Included in Saving for Mode Management Resume>","Saving for the mode management resume can include other information in addition to contents of the register set . For example, the title number of the title which was last played back, information on the HDMV title, a reason for stop, and the like can be included. Content identification information for identifying contents can be included as well. The information for identifying contents may be such as information of the above-described BCA or a value expected to practically realize unique identification, the value being obtained by calculation with respect to a file existing on the recording medium (e.g. a hash value of a file).","<Transfer Method>","Furthermore, the BD-J application may directly or indirectly transfer the application resume parameters to the mode management module  without storing the application resume parameters into the register set . In this case, when resume playback is performed, the mode management module  does not restore the application resume parameters to the register set , and instead, directly or indirectly transfers them to the BD-J application.","<Variation of Nonvolatile Memory >","A recording medium writable by the removable media drive , the build-in media drive , and the BD drive  can be applied as the nonvolatile memory . A medium accessible via the network I\/F  can be also used as the nonvolatile memory  if the medium can retain the recorded contents independent of the power supply state of the playback apparatus.","<Secondary Power Supply>","Note that it is desirable to provide a sufficient secondary power supply for performing saving for the mode management resume in case the power supply is abruptly cut off.","It should be noted that the present invention is practicable even if no measures are taken against a case where the power supply is cut off while saving for the mode management resume is performed or saving for the mode management resume fails due to an occurrence of some abnormality.","<Practicability>","The present invention is practicable even if no measures are taken against a case where the power supply is cut off while saving of the application resume parameters is performed or saving of the application resume parameters fails due to an occurrence of some abnormality.","<Embodiment of Programs>","The program shown in each embodiment for performing saving\/restoring of the application resume parameters and the playback status resume parameters can be produced in the following manner. First, a software developer creates source programs which realize the above flowcharts and functional construction elements using a programming language. When doing so, the software developer creates such source programs that realize the above flowcharts and functional construction elements, using class structures, variables, array variables, and calls for external functions according to a syntax of the programming language.","The created source programs are supplied to a compiler as files. The compiler translates these source programs to generate object programs.","The translation by the compiler is made up of processes such as syntax analysis, optimization, resource assignment, and code generation. In the syntax analysis, lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis of the source programs are performed to convert the source programs to intermediate programs. In the optimization, operations such as basic blocking, control flow analysis, and data flow analysis are performed on the intermediate programs. In the resource assignment, variables in the intermediate programs are assigned to registers or memories in a target processor, in order to adapt to an instruction set of the target processor. In the code generation, each intermediate instruction in the intermediate programs is converted to program code to thereby obtain the object programs.","The object programs generated in this way are made up of one or more pieces of program code for causing a computer to execute the individual steps of the flowcharts or functional construction elements in the above embodiments. There are various types of program code such as a processor's native code or JAVA (registered trademark) byte code. Also, there are various methods for realizing the individual steps by program code. If each step can be realized using an external function, a call statement for calling the external function serves as program code. Also, there is a case where program code for realizing one step belongs to separate object programs. For an RISC processor which has a limited set of instructions, each step of the above flowcharts may be realized by combining an arithmetic instruction, a logic instruction, a branch instruction, and the like.","Having generated the object programs, a programmer activates a linker for the object programs. The linker assigns the object programs and relevant library programs to memory areas and links them together to generate a load module. Such a generated load module is assumed to be read by a computer, and causes the computer to execute the procedures of the flowcharts and the procedures of the functional construction elements in the above embodiments. The program can be recorded on to a computer-readable recording medium and provided to a user.","<System LSI>","It is desirable that parts of the hardware of the playback apparatus  that are mainly composed of logical elements, excluding mechanical structural elements (the BD drive, the removable media drive, and the built-in media drive) and the structural elements (the video plane and the graphics plane) that are implemented on a high-capacity memory, are realized as one system LSI. This is because the parts mainly composed of logical elements can be integrated with high density.","The system LSI is obtained by implementing a bear chip on a high-density substrate and packaging them. The system LSI is also obtained by implementing a plurality of bear chips on a high-density substrate and packaging them, so that the plurality of bear chips have an outer appearance of one LSI (such a system LSI is called a multi-chip module).","The system LSI has a QFP (Quad Flat Package) type and a PGA (Pin Grid Array) type. In the QFP-type system LSI, pins are attached to the four sides of the package. In the PGA-type system LSI, a lot of pins are attached to the entire bottom.","These pins function as an interface with other circuits. The system LSI, which is connected with other circuits through such pins as an interface, plays a role as the core of the playback apparatus .","Such a system LSI can be embedded into various types of devices that can play back images, such as a television, game machine, personal computer, one-segment mobile phone, as well as into the playback apparatus . The system LSI thus greatly broadens the use of the present invention.","When an elementary buffer, video decoder, audio decoder, and graphics decoder are integrated into a system LSI, it is desirable that the system LSI conforms to the Uniphier architecture.","The system LSI in compliance with the Uniphier architecture is composed of the following circuit blocks.","Data Parallel Processor DPP","A DPP is a SIMD processor in which a plurality of processing elements perform identical operations in parallel. A plurality of arithmetic units each included in a processing element execute one instruction in parallel, so that a plurality of pixels are decoded in parallel.","Instruction Parallel Processor IPP","An IPP is composed of: a \u201cLocal Memory Controller\u201d that includes an instruction RAM, an instruction cache, a data RAM, and a data cache; a \u201cProcessing Unit\u201d that includes an instruction fetcher, a decoder, an execution unit, and a register file; and a \u201cVirtual Multi Processor Unit\u201d that causes the processing unit to execute a plurality of applications in parallel.","MPU Block","An MPU block is composed of: peripheral circuits such as an ARM core, an external bus interface (Bus Control Unit: BCU), a DMA controller, a timer, and a vectored interrupt controller; and peripheral interfaces such as UART, GPIO (General Purpose Input Output), and a synchronous serial interface.","Stream I\/O Block","A stream I\/O block communicates, via a USB interface and an ATA Packet interface, input\/output data to\/from a drive device, a hard disk drive device, an SD memory card drive device connected with the external bus.","AV I\/O Block","An AV I\/O block is composed of an audio I\/O, a video I\/O, and an OSD controller and communicates input\/output data to\/from a TV set and an AV amplifier.","Memory Control Block","The memory control block realizes the reading\/writing of data to\/from the SD-RAM connected via the external bus. The memory control block is composed of: an internal bus connection unit that controls the internal connection between the blocks; an access control unit that transfers data to\/from the SD-RAM connected externally to the system LSI; and an access scheduling unit that arbitrates an access to the SD-RAM among the plurality of blocks.","The following describes a detailed production procedure. First, a circuit diagram of a part to be the system LSI is drawn, based on the drawings that show structures of the embodiments. And then the constituent elements of the target structure are realized using circuit elements, ICs, or LSIs.","As the constituent elements are realized, buses connecting between the circuit elements, ICs, or LSIs, peripheral circuits, interfaces with external entities and the like are defined. Further, the connection lines, power lines, ground lines, clock signals and the like are defined. For these definitions, the operation timings of the constituent elements are adjusted by taking into consideration the LSI specifications, and band widths necessary for the constituent elements are secured. With other necessary adjustments, the circuit diagram is completed.","After the circuit diagram is completed, the implementation design is performed. The implementation design is a work for creating a board layout by determining how to arrange the parts (circuit elements, ICs, LSIs) of the circuit and the connection lines onto the board.","After the implementation design is performed and the board layout is created, the results of the implementation design are converted into CAM data, and the CAM data is output to equipment such as an NC (Numerical Control) machine tool. The NC machine tool performs the SoC implementation or the SiP implementation. The SoC (System on Chip) implementation is a technology for printing a plurality of circuits onto a chip. The SiP (System in Package) implementation is a technology for packaging a plurality of circuits by resin or the like. Through these processes, a system LSI of the present invention can be produced based on the internal structure of the playback device  described in each embodiment above.","It should be noted here that the integrated circuit generated as described above may be called IC, LSI, ultra LSI, super LSI or the like, depending on the level of the integration.","It is also possible to achieve the system LSI by using the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). In this case, a lot of logic elements are to be arranged lattice-like, and vertical and horizontal wires are connected based on the input\/output combinations described in LUT (Look-Up Table), so that the hardware structure described in each embodiment can be realized. The LUT is stored in the SRAM. Since the contents of the SRAM are erased when the power is off, when the FPGA is used, it is necessary to define the Config information so as to write, onto the SRAM, the LUT for realizing the hardware structure described in each embodiment.","The resume playback apparatus constituting the present invention can be utilized in manufacturing industries, movie industries related to production of video contents, commercial device industries, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0284","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0286"},"b":"101"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0002","num":"0287"},"b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0003","num":"0288"},"b":"103"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0004","num":"0289"},"b":"104"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0005","num":"0290"},"b":"105"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0006","num":"0291"},"b":"201"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0007","num":"0292"},"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0008","num":"0293"},"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0009","num":"0294"},"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0010","num":"0295"},"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0011","num":"0296"},"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0012","num":"0297"},"b":"7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0013","num":"0298"},"b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0014","num":"0299"},"b":"13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0015","num":"0300"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0016","num":"0301"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0017","num":"0302"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0018","num":"0303"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0019","num":"0304"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0020","num":"0305"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0021","num":"0306"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0022","num":"0307"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0023","num":"0308"},"b":"41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0024","num":"0309"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0025","num":"0310"},"b":"43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0026","num":"0311"},"b":"44"}]}}}}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 16","b":"103"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":["26","1","2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
