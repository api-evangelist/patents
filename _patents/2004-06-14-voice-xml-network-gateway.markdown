{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention pertains to telecommunications systems and methods of operation and, more particularly, to a VoiceXML network gateway residing independently from switching circuitry.","Call centers are under increasing pressure to provide high-quality service while controlling costs. Call center systems must be highly reliable since availability of the customer support service is critical. As call centers handle increasing volumes of incoming calls, the call routing solution must be scalable so it can expand to include additional locations, as well as capable of rapidly integrating new technologies.","A growing trend in carrier-grade telecommunications systems has been the evolution away from centralized call control applications to more distributed architectures. This has been described as moving the intelligence \u201cto the edge of the network,\u201d in that the call features that historically have been programmed into a hardware switch are now well separated from the switch that handles the call. This trend has been enabled by the availability of architectures such as the NORTEL\u00ae Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN) and similar architectures, which separate feature creation and processing activities from the normal call-processing activities of a switch and move these activities to a central location shared by many switches.","In such an environment, there is the need for increased automation in call centers in the United States.","Moreover, there is a need for a method and system that economically and effectively integrates the telephone company operator and call center services.","There is a further need for a suite of independent systems integrated into an open software-based solution for user contact automation that combines advanced network call control, speech recognition and agent-backed integration.","Preferred embodiments of this invention are described herein, including the best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Variations of those preferred embodiments may become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventors expect skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the above-described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context.","The XML network gateway is an open, purpose-built solution that lets the user easily introduce new services without having to replace the existing network infrastructure. In addition, the XML network gateway \u201cfuture-proofs\u201d the applications from network evolution) to ensure their operation within the existing infrastructure. The present invention provides, as a software-based solution, a VoiceXML network gateway that is an open, scalable framework. The XML network gateway provides extensive interface capabilities to connect with legacy and next-generation networks, as well as an open and extensible applications development environment based on industry-leading Internet applications standards. The present invention provides the ability to seamlessly pass call context information from either internal or external sources to the caller through agent handling or automated techniques. Moreover, the present invention presents to the user a plurality of multi-level security agents that control how and when network resources are made available to applications. The XML network gateway also provides administrative services with real-time service management capability and multi-applications support","The XML network gateway architecture is based on the open standards of the World Wide Internet application Consortium (W3C) providing carriers with an application\u2014independent approach to network integration. As a result, network resources are under the control of the application developer using standards that are common in Internet application development. This means independence from proprietary systems that can restrict the user and the user's information, as well as independence from proprietary call control interfaces. So the user can pave the way for lucrative advances in information delivery and speech recognition technology.","Moreover, the present invention allows the user to access a variety of legacy and new databases that exist both internally and externally to the public network. These databases may include directory assistance databases, personal directory listings, self-help and other knowledge-based databases, enhanced services databases, line information repositories, calling card and credit card verification, real time ratings, number portability databases, operator reference databases, caller preference databases, and customer records. The present invention makes these databases accessible through XML communications that allow applications to use the same design and retrieval methods regardless of the information to be accessed.","Just as a user's PC uses an Internet browser to access a variety of Internet applications services, the present invention provides a call control \u201cbrowser\u201d to access a variety of call center applications. The browser uses industry-standard Internet application development tools and techniques to allow independent and ubiquitous access to a host of new services. Web-based applications integrated into the call center with the present invention may also include support for multi-party conferencing, plus more advanced conference and audio control, as well as the ability to give each active call leg its own dedicated and personalized automation dialog. The present invention, furthermore, provides for multiple-call handling and control, including the ability to place outgoing calls, and the ability to receive events and messages from external databases and systems.","The present invention, furthermore, allows system integrators to tie various network elements into one, cohesive system. By moving service logic and network control out to the application endpoints, the user may easily introduce new services without having to replacing an existing network infrastructure. The present invention permits the building of applications through industry-standard markup languages\u2014the same ones millions of Internet application developers use every day. As a result, the user can introduce new services or make changes easily using common web-based techniques. With the present invention, call control is managed by the application for even greater network and agent efficiency. Information captured from the caller is maintained throughout the call, even when calls are handed from an automated speech recognition system to a live agent.","The present invention, furthermore, aids both inbound and outbound call centers to put a wide variety of information databases in operation cooperatively. These may include knowledge-based databases, customer relationship databases, product and warranty databases, and demographic profile databases. Using standard Web-based tools, the voice XML network gateway of the present invention, offers enterprise customers the ability to provide next-generation applications without the difficulties of traditional network integration complexities.","The present invention also provides a framework to develop advanced voice applications that transform the telephone into a powerful tool to access Web-based information. As the industry moves towards voice over IP standards using protocols such as SIP, the XML network gateway of the present invention can separate the business application from the voice infrastructure, allowing off-the-shelf components and standards-based technology to be used to quickly develop new services.","In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a voice XML network gateway as an open, purpose-built solution that allows users to introduce new services without having to replace existing network infrastructure. The present invention links web-based automation and information delivery technology to the advanced protocols in telecommunications networks, to provide a system for remotely controlling telecommunications calls from a telecommunications switch associated with a telecommunications network.","The XML network gateway, furthermore, includes a telecommunications network server with a voice interpreter module and a call center server module. This next section sounds like it's a h\/w device (circuitry, signals, etc) The voice interpreter module receives a plurality of voice telecommunications signals from the associated telecommunications switch. The call center server module is associated with the telecommunications network server to receive a plurality of call center telecommunications data signals from the associated telecommunications switch. Interpreting circuitry interprets the voice telecommunications signals using the voice interpreter module in association with at least one speech recognition application. The call center server module provides at least one call center service in response to the call center telecommunications data signals. Control circuitry associated with the telecommunications network server controls the interpreting circuitry and the call center providing means in response to the flow of telecommunications calls from the telecommunications switch. This control is achieved according to the capabilities of the at least one speech recognition application and the at least one call center application program.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","10","12","14","14","16","18"]},"Voice XML network server  includes voice XML interpreter  which associates with media middleware  and media gateway .

For example, just as personal computers use an Internet browser to access a variety of Internet applications services, voice XML network server  provides a call control \u201cbrowser\u201d to access a variety of call center applications.

Voice XML network server  permits the integration support required for all call control applications to work together, regardless of the database program, operating system or platform in which they reside. These applications may be built by the enterprise or call center services clients directly or through third-party application partners.","With systems maintenance and support services, users are able to attain value from a number of technical advantages. First of all, the present invention provides a high-quality support structure, including user problem reports, mechanized tools for diagnostics and maintenance, consistent on-site coverage, and 24\u00d77 technical support. Moreover, the user has the ability to operate at peak efficiency and quality of service the end users demand, as well as reduce operational expenses associated with recruiting, training, and retaining skilled maintenance personnel.","Voice XML network server  takes advantage of these new possibilities to separate the intelligence of the features and applications from the network infrastructure. This framework allows new features and applications to be easily introduced without modification to existing network infrastructure, and provides applications in the framework with seamless access to stored information relevant to the call. An important difference between the voice XML network gateway and other feature servers is the level of support for complex applications and the additional functionalities provided to applications running in the framework.","Voice XML network server  provides a three-part modular architecture designed around current open standards. The three components in this framework separately manage network-specific tasks, resources available to applications running in the framework, and a remotely-accessible bundle of information relevant to the current call, or session. The inter-working of these three components, and the support and functionality they expose to applications represents the core of the voice XML network gateway. Applications or features in this framework are differentiated purely on a basis of complexity. Any application or feature may be visualized as existing outside the framework and interacting with it through the exchange of voice XML documents  and CCXML documents .","Voice XML network server  provides a network management subsystem for managing the network-specific aspects of a call in the framework. This involves handling call setup and tear-down tasks, as well as providing an interface to call control applications which is independent of the network switching environment. By isolating call control applications from the specifics of the network, they become immediately portable across switching environments.","The network management subsystem supports an array of network switching protocols: Nortel\/OSSAIN switch, SS7\/ISUP, PRI, SIP and H.323. The call control interface is exposed to applications using the Internet applications standard CCXML documents . The use of a Internet application programming model provides several advantages over more tightly integrated architectures, most notably simplified scaling and increased flexibility for call control applications.","Since a call control application running in the framework controls the call by providing XML documents as a response to an HTTP request, the server that provides the CCXML document  may be located anywhere on the IP network, and may be distributed across several servers. This drastically simplifies the provisioning of new applications into the framework, and allows this component to be scaled by the simple addition of more applications servers. The specification of a specific call control application in this framework is also reduced to the specification of an \u201cinitial page\u201d URL. Since the Internet application programming model places no restrictions on call control applications architecturally or in terms of programming language, applications running in the framework may be static XML documents, or dynamically generated documents created by a distributed set of active Internet application pages.","In operation of voice XML network server , a CCXML document  may request voice XML interpreter  to start a voice XML interpreter session on a specific call leg, and control may be returned to the invoking CCXML document  in a method roughly analogous to the return from a subroutine call (or a sub-dialog call in voice XML).","Information collected from the caller (or from other sources) may be returned at this stage, and used by the calling CCXML application to determine call behavior. Using the CCXML document offers call control functionality that does not exist in voice XML, such as acceptance\/rejection of an incoming call, initiation of new outbound call legs, and conference creation and management. Voice XML network server  interfaces with the switching environment through the use of a media gateway  and switching gateway , which insulates voice XML network server  from certain network specifics.","The voice applications  provide a modular framework for applications accessing resources such as speech recognition  and other TTS resources, applications servers, media servers and network resources (such as outbound call circuits). Specific resources are allocated by the resource management subsystem upon request on the basis of existing traffic and resource availability. The resource management subsystem maintains a database of information regarding availability and usage of all resources currently provisioned in the framework, and may raise system alarms in the event of resource unavailability.","The resource management subsystem may also perform call re-distribution in high call-volume situations. The centralization of this \u201ctraffic control\u201d functionality allows a consistent response to resource outages at the level of the framework.","The actions of the resource management subsystem are largely transparent to a call control application. When a new call is presented to the framework, the network management subsystem acquires the initial resources to handle the call from the resource management subsystem. At this point, the access control role of the resource management subsystem is executed out in concert with the primary control application, which is the first resource allocated for a new call. Upon its initial invocation for a call, the primary control application acquires a unique session key from the session management subsystem, which is described herein below. Persistent information is then loaded into the session and used to determine the required behavior for the call.","At this point, the behavior of the call may be determined on a tenant-by-tenant basis before the presentation of the initial voice dialog. A tenant object represents customer specific data elements that represent the specific application level characteristics (call control only, not dialogue control) that are applied to a call for this particular customer. For example, a telecommunications company may desire to sell an automation directory service to two customers, each of which having different prompts and call flows. The parameters that specify the call control aspects of this are represented in the tenant object and its various methods. The required resources for the call are then determined and allocated via the resource management subsystem, and the appropriate secondary control application (CCXML or voice XML application) is then started and acquires control of the call.","From this point on, the primary control application interacts with any of the secondary control applications, allowing any new CCXML or voice XML application to be added to the framework without any modification. New applications may control network resources, handle the call, and return control to the master control application at any time. Control over access to resources is performed by the resource management subsystem at request time, including resources requested by the primary control application. In this way, the primary control application is not substantially different from any other call control application running in the framework. It is merely the first application to handle the call. However, the primary controller may use platform extensions supported by the present invention to perform the initial query to the session management subsystem. This allows a more complete centralization of the resource management subsystem functionality.","As described above, call control applications are insulated from the specifics of the switching environment by the network management subsystem. The network management subsystem is itself insulated from a large fraction of the switching environment by the call normalization layer. This layer translates incoming calls on the PSTN into SIP calls by the combination of a media gateway and a signaling gateway. The signaling gateway translates incoming signaling information into SIP messages, as well as translating SIP messages from the network management subsystem into protocol-specific call control messages.","Call context information present when a call is presented to the system is also placed into the initial SIP invite message. This normalization process allows the incorporation of PSTN-based call legs and VoIP call legs in the same system, at the same time shielding the network management subsystem from knowledge of the circuit-networking protocols. This behavior is similar to the functionality supplied by a software based switching mechanism, which are known in the art.","In this translation process, the audio data is converted into an RTP stream by media gateway (at which the incoming trunks terminate) . The network management subsystem communicates with the media gateway as required by the application executing in the framework, in order to provide access to the audio streams. For call control applications, the network management subsystem also communicates with a media controller in cases where the application requests manipulation of the audio stream (e.g. creation of a conference). This media controller is a component that directly handles multiple-call-leg media operations (mixing of audio streams) as well as single-call-leg operations (such as muting a specific audio stream). The present invention may also support other related operations.","The distributed nature of the voice XML network gateway allows the capacity of most components in the system to be increased by adding more instances of the component that is limiting the capacity. For example, more network management subsystem resources may be added to the system by configuring and adding a new network management subsystem node to the system. The new network management subsystem node receives call origination information from the signaling gateway and communicates with the media gateway and resource manager as needed. The extent to which the framework may be scaled this way is limited by processes which perform coordination between components. Such coordinating processes essentially break the distributed nature of the architecture, since the amount of work done by a coordinating process will increase as more coordinated components are added to the system.","Coordination of call control and media packets between the network management subsystem , media gateway  and signaling gateway  is not a problem for scalability, however, since the coordination is performed by the network management subsystem (provided that the capacity remains below the limits of the signaling gateway). The addition of a new network management subsystem introduces a new coordinating process, thus handling the additional load with a new component. For this reason, the addition of media gateways to the system will in general require the addition of new network management subsystem modules. The resource management and session management subsystems, however, perform coordinating activities across all systems in the framework. The ability of these components to respond to handle requests imposes the real limitation on scalability of the system. If so, the present invention accommodates the creation of a set of resource management and session management systems working under a coordinator chosen by election.","For example, the addition of new applications servers and more complex applications may increase the load in the network management subsystem as the amount of signaling-related traffic increases. As a result, the limits of call handling for a given configuration will depend on the complexity of the applications running in the framework. For this reason, the monitoring capabilities of the resource management subsystem, which allow the load on the various components to be monitored during such configuration changes, provide vital information during provisioning of new applications and expansion of existing applications\/features. In smaller deployments, various servers in the architecture may actually be collocated, to the extent that the system retains sufficient redundancy to protect against single system failures. Excessive co-location of resources will increase the fragility of the system in the event of a resource failure.","Reliability in the voice XML network gateway  is defined in terms of system availability for a new call attempt. In the event of a resource failure, individual calls may be lost, i.e., prematurely terminated. However, the system  should remain available to handle a new call, even in the event of a resource failure. It is assumed that the frequency with which resource failures occurs is low, so that the expected percentage of calls lost is minimal.","High reliability is achieved in a hardware switch by a high level of built-in redundancy of components in DMS switch . High reliability in the voice XML network gateway  is a result of the distributed nature of the framework. A distributed environment offers an \u201ceconomy of scale\u201d by nature of the number of independent, functionally identical components in the system. The loss of a single hardware component out of a group will not reduce system availability if the system is provisioned with a sufficient number of such hardware components. As with system scalability above, the exception to this rule is components which perform coordination between systems, as such components by definition exist in small number.","The need for a redundant backup system is highest for media gateway , as an unrecoverable failure of one module keeps all new call attempts from succeeding for trunks which are terminated at the failed media gateway. Calls which enter the system as SIP calls, of course, are not subject to this restriction. Media controller  may also include various types of redundancy to assure continued operation.","Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention herein described are merely illustrative of the application of the principles of the invention. Reference herein to details of the illustrated embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, which themselves recite those features regarded as essential to the invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the XML network gateway and advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following description which is to be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numbers indicate like features and further wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
