title: Method for aligning two or more independent printing systems with a single control unit and intelligent print controllers
abstract: A method and system receives a print job from a host device, parses the print job into individual print data for at least two separate printing devices, generates a random set of marks for identification of the print job, embeds the identification marks into the individual print data for a first printing device; and sends the individual print data and the marks to each printing device. Simultaneously, each printing device in the system receives its individual dataset for printing and the set of identification marks from the control unit and starts its print engine at a high speed. The first printing device prints its dataset and the identification marks on at least a first page of the printed dataset. The remaining printing devices then scan the roll of print media until they recognize the matching identification marks and begin printing their individual dataset on the roll of print media.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to the field of printer systems, and more particularly relates to a method for aligning two or more independent printing systems.","2. Description of Related Art","A high-speed printing system is used by businesses to print a large volume of information such as bills and account statements. The printing system prints on a continuous, fan-fold type of media that is threaded through the machine. However, it is very difficult for the printing system to print duplex (both sides of the paper). Also, the printing system can only operate from one source, as it is critical that the variable data to be printed remains together.","Printing duplex when running continuous fan-fold forms at high speed requires either large and expensive printing devices, or the use of more than one printing device that can only print on one side. When running more than one independent printing device (which includes a print engine) that are separated by several meters, it becomes critical that the print data that is to match the second side be placed in conjunction with the data printed on the first side by the first print engine. Whether two, three, four or more print engines are used, the data that is printed on the paper by each of the engines must be the matching data for the page.","In non-automated methods, an operator is required to align the print engines by visually inspecting the print and manually indicating to the control unit that the print alignment is correct. This introduces the possibility of potential operator error, which wastes paper and costs valuable time.","Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as discussed above, and particularly for a method of aligning two or more printing systems.","According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method and system receives a print job from a host device, parses the print job into individual print data for at least two separate printing devices, generates a random set of marks for identification of the print job, embeds the identification marks into the individual print data for a first printing device; and sends the individual print data and information about the marks to each printing device. Simultaneously, each printing device in the system receives its individual dataset for printing and the information for the identification marks from the control unit and starts its print engine at a high speed. The first printing device prints its dataset and the identification marks on at least the first page of the printed dataset. The remaining printing devices then scan the roll of print media until they recognize the matching identification marks and begin printing their individual dataset on the roll of print media. None of the printing devices are required to pause, slow down, or stop prior to printing their individual datasets.","The present invention, according to a preferred embodiment, overcomes problems with the prior art by allowing two or more independent printing devices to be aligned such that print data that is placed on the paper matches in both registration and content without involvement from a machine operator; and does so in a manner that causes motion of paper media in all separated printing devices to be in unison without pauses or reduction in speed. All separate print engines are aligned under direction of a single control unit, and the single control unit prints sheets that match correctly without regard to the distance between the separate print units. This method takes advantage of a single control unit used to control multiple print engines, and intelligent print controllers located inside each print engine that are able to control optical mark sensors and control the flow of print data to the print engine. This method takes advantage of the single control unit to maintain simultaneous motion through all printing devices, protecting the integrity of the paper media path between the print engines; and takes advantage of the intelligent print controllers located inside each print engine to relieve the single control unit of the responsibility to maintain or be cognizant of the distance between each print engine.","A preferred embodiment uses sensors previously used to verify that the print on each engine was correct to now automatically set proper alignment prior to printing the print data. Once the alignment has been completed, the sensors are returned to normal operation, which verifies every sheet printed subsequent to the automatic alignment. This is done without stopping or slowing down the paper media and without operator involvement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","106","116","104","104","106","104","106","110","112","110","112","102","110","112","118","120","114"]},"Each host system  may include, inter alia, one or more computers. The control unit  may include one or more computers and at least one computer readable medium . The computers preferably include means for reading and\/or writing to the computer readable medium . The computer readable medium  allows a computer system to read data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium  may include non-volatile memory, such as floppy, ROM, FLASH\u00ae memory, disk drive memory, CD-ROM, and other permanent storage that are useful for transporting information, such as data and computer instructions, between computer systems. Furthermore, the computer readable medium  may comprise computer readable information in a transitory state medium such as a network link and\/or a network interface, including a wired network or a wireless network, that a computer can read.","The control unit , according to the present example, includes a controller\/processor unit  (shown in ), which processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information through the control unit . Additionally, the controller\/processor  is communicatively coupled with program memory . Included within program memory  are an automatic printer alignment application  (which will be discussed in later in greater detail), an operating system platform , and glue software . The operating system platform  manages resources, such as the data stored in data memory , the scheduling of tasks, and processes the operation of the automatic printer alignment application  in the program memory . The operating system platform  also manages a graphical display interface (not shown), a user input interface (not shown) that receives inputs from the keyboard  and the mouse , and communication interfaces  for communicating with the network link  and individual printing devices ,. Additionally, the operating system platform  also manages many other basic tasks of the control unit  in a manner well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Glue software  may include drivers, stacks, and low level application programming interfaces (API's) and provides basic functional components for use by the operating system platform  and by compatible applications that run on the operating system platform  for managing communications with resources and processes in the control unit .","In a preferred embodiment, as shown in , each printing device , includes an intelligent controller ,, having an alignment application  and a verification application , each application being communicatively coupled to a communication interface , sensors , and a print engine . The print engine  is communicatively coupled to a printhead . The printhead  is typically used to apply toner or ink  to a continuous roll of media . In accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the output of electronic images can be applied to many different output mediums. The word \u201cprint\u201d, as used herein, denotes the output of electronic image from digital representation in a computational system, to a physical medium, such as paper, plastic film, cloth, or other output medium as will be evident to someone of ordinary skill in the art in view of the discussion herein. Lastly, the data memory  is communicatively coupled to the intelligent controller , and may contain a document queue of print jobs , and a configuration database .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["5","6","100","100","402","106","102","106","404","110","112","112","110"]},"As is typical for the system, the control unit  applies encoded marks to the print job to allow the intelligent print controllers , to detect mismatched print data as the paper moves through the system. Having previously loaded (threaded) paper  through all of the separate printing devices, an operator allows the print job to start.","The control unit , at step , builds unique print data to be printed which includes a trivial set of encoded marks, which are able to be sensed by the existing, inexpensive, limited-capability optical sensors  in each of the printing devices ,. The encoded marks are designed, within the limitation of the optical sensor , to be decoded into a 7-bit (1 to 127 decimal) number. Multiple sets of these encoded marks may be printed on one page, or on multiple pages if the page size is too small, to allow for a unique (\u201crandom\u201d) numerical sequence to be described. The number of sets of the encoded marks is made to ensure detection of the unique numerical sequence; even with the loss of one or more of the sets because of poor read rate of the optical sensor, or poor print quality of the marks. Also, because of the unique pattern, failures in printing devices , that leave many sets of marks in the paper path are of no consequence.","The control unit , in step , sends the \u201ckey\u201d (description of the proper unique sequence) to each of the intelligent print engine controllers , located inside each of the printing devices ,. The control unit , at step , sends the special print data containing the encoded marks to the first printing device , and may also send the special print data to another of the multiple printing devices if the marks must be printed on both sides of the paper  for one or more devices past the second device . The control unit , at step , then sends the previously separated print job, in proper separations, to each respective printing device ,. The control unit , at step , then commands all printing devices , to begin moving paper  in unison.","The first printing device , at step , receives its print data from the control unit , starts its engine at step , prints the special marks, then prints the print job at step . The second (and third, and fourth, and . . . ) printing device , at step , watches for the encoded marks, and simply \u201cprints\u201d blank paper. As the encoded marks reach each subsequent printing device, the intelligent print controller , verifies the unique pattern required to signal proper alignment, at step , and then prints the print job on the paper , at step , as it continues to move in a forward direction. The paper  does not slow, pause, stop, or reverse during the alignment. The media always travels at fill speed forward.","If necessary, the intelligent print controller , may signal the master control unit  to stop and allow small (less than one sheet size) changes in the paper position be made by the individual intelligent print controller ,. When this occurs, all print engines stop in unison, and no paper  can ever be moved backward or forward at a slow speed, and the control unit  would then begin paper movement on all print engines again in unison.","Once the individual intelligent print controller , detected the correct encoded sequence, and begins to print the print job, it automatically switches to \u201cverify\u201d mode and uses the encoded marks normally added by the control unit  to begin the verification checking.","The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. A system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system, or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems. Any kind of computer system\u2014or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein\u2014is suited. A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general-purpose computer system with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein.","The present invention can also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein, and which\u2014when loaded in a computer system\u2014is able to carryout these methods. Computer program means or computer program in the present context mean any expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the following a) conversion to another language, code or, notation; and b) reproduction in a different material form.","Although specific embodiments of the invention have been disclosed, those having ordinary skill in the art will understand that changes can be made to the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is not to be restricted, therefore, to the specific embodiments, and it is intended that the appended claims cover any and all such applications, modifications, and embodiments within the scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["5","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
