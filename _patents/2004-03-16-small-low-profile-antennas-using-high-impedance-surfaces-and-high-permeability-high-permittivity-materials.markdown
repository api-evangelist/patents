{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, imported, sold, and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to antennas and, more particularly, to antennas which have a low profile.","2. Related Art","Low profile antennas are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,327,148 to How et al describes a microstrip antenna that has a substrate that includes a ground plane conductor disposed over a first surface and a strip conductor disposed over a second surface. A DC magnetic field biasing circuit provides a directed DC magnetic field to the substrate such that the strip conductor radiates electromagnetic energy that has a circular polarization. In one particular embodiment, the substrate is composed of magnesium ferrite and in another, a second substrate of ferrite material is disposed over the strip conductor to reduce the radar cross section of the antenna.","The antenna, described by How et al, suffers from the drawback that a significant fraction of energy is dissipated in surface waves because of the limited size of the ground plane.","An effort was made to overcome the foregoing drawback by Daniel Frederic Sievenpiper in his Ph.D. thesis entitled \u201cHigh-Impedance Electromagnetic Surfaces\u201d, University of California, Los Angeles, 1999 (below referred to as \u201cSievenpiper\u201d). Sievenpiper describes providing a high impedance surface which reduces surface waves and which consists of a plurality of metal protrusions on a flat metal sheet. The metal protrusions include flat metal plates disposed on vertical posts. Each of the metal plates and posts function to provide a capacitance and an inductance and as such function as electric filters to block the flow of surface waves.","One disadvantage that arises in connection with an antenna employing a relatively high impedance electromagnetic ground plane surface, such as that described by Sievenpiper, is that an associated narrow bandwidth of approximately 8% occurs when transmitting at microwave frequencies. Accordingly, it is desired to provide a low profile antenna that is both efficient and that does not compromise bandwidth.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a low profile antenna comprises an antenna and a ground plane structure operatively associated with the antenna. The ground plane structure comprises a generally planar surface, at least one protrusion extending from the planar surface and a dielectric substrate supported by the planar surface. The dielectric substrate comprises a relative permeability (\u03bc) of greater than or equal to about one and a relative permittivity (\u03b5) of greater than or equal to about one.","One embodiment of the present invention concerns a low profile antenna that is both efficient and that is capable of transmitting a signal with an increased bandwidth. The low profile antenna comprises an antenna and a high impedance ground plane structure that functions to reduce surface waves while not compromising bandwidth. Also, the low profile antenna may be configured for use at relatively low microwave frequencies without incurring unsuitably large dimensional requirements.","Referring now to , a low profile antenna in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment, the low profile antenna  comprises an antenna  and a ground plane structure .","The antenna  preferably comprises a known fractal, microstrip antenna, although, it will be understood that any suitably low profile antenna may be employed in the practice of the present invention. The antenna  is illustrated as having a generally triangular outer configuration and may comprise a Sierpinski triangle which is connected by an input feed line . Further details of antennas suitable for use in this embodiment of the present invention may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,285,325 to Nalbandian et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,760 to Nalbandian et al and U.S. Pat. No. 6,525,691 to Varadan et al, each of which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent necessary to make and practice the present invention.","In accordance with a feature of the present embodiment and referring now to , the ground plane structure  may comprise a plate  having a generally planar surface , protrusions  and a substrate . Depending upon the desired frequency and required dimension, the ground plane structure  may be fabricated using known techniques such as by photolithography including chemical vapor deposition processes or the like and\/or discreet component formation and assembly.","The plate  may comprise a metallic substance, in particular, compositions including, e.g., copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al) and tin (Sn), and mixtures thereof. The planar surface , together with the protrusions , may function as a high impedance ground plane for the antenna  (). The protrusions  may also be composed of a metallic substance, similar to that of the plate , and may comprise pedestals  and posts .","The pedestals  and posts  may function as a filter circuit to reduce surface waves traveling along the ground plane structure . As represented by arrow , a pair of posts , plate  and portions of the pedestals  may be combined to provide an inductance (L), between each pedestal , a capacitance (C) is created. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the particular dimensions of the pedestals  and posts  may be varied based on the particular frequency of the signal transmitted from the antenna.","The pedestals  are illustrated as having a hexagonal outer configuration which provides for a suitable amount of capacitance, although, it will be appreciated that other configurations, such as square, rectangular, circular and triangular may be employed depending upon, e.g., the frequency of a signal transmitted from the antenna . In one particular embodiment, the pedestals  and posts  may be fabricated together as a component such as a rivet.","The posts  may be circular or square in cross section, although, any suitable configuration may be employed. For example, where the ground plane structure  is fabricated using photolithography, the posts  may be configured similar to a via formed in a printed circuit board.","In accordance with another feature of this embodiment, the substrate  comprises a material having a large relative permeability (\u03bc) and a large relative permittivity (\u03b5), which functions to reduce the dimensional requirements of an antenna, for a given frequency, by a factor of ((\u03bc)(\u03b5)). That is in addition to providing an increase in bandwidth over a prior art high impedance ground plane surface structure such as that described by Sievenpiper above. It will be appreciated that the bandwidth of an antenna is proportional to (\u03bc\/\u03b5)since the functional bandwidth of an antenna using a high-impedance surface is approximately equal to the impedance of that surface divided by the impedance of free space (Z\/\u03b7) (see Sievenpiper above) where the impedance of the high-impedance surface is equal to the square root of the inductance divided by the capacitance or (L\/C), and the inductance is dependent on the relative permeability (\u03bc) of the substrate and the capacitance is dependent on the relative permittivity (\u03b5) of the substrate.","The substrate  is illustrated as extending between the pedestals  and planar surface  of the plate , although, it may also extend between the ground plane structure  and the antenna . The substrate  may comprise a relative permeability (\u03bc) that is greater than or equal to approximately one but is more preferably in the range of from approximately one to approximately one hundred. Similarly, the substrate  may comprise a relative permittivity (\u03b5) that is greater than or equal approximately one but is more preferably in the range of from approximately one to approximately one hundred. Particularly suitable materials include ferrimagnetic materials such as magnesium ferrite (designation No. 103-67 and available from Trans-Tech, Inc. of Adamstown, Md.) that includes a relative permeability of 30 (measured at 1 kHz) and a relative permittivity of 11.8 (measured at 9.4 GHz). The impedance level for this material, which is proportional to the formula (\u03bc\/\u03b5), was found to be 1.68. Accordingly, the ground plane structure  provides an enhanced signal bandwidth while also providing an increase in efficiency.","One less preferable material for the substrate  is a circuit board composition no. 5880 manufactured by the Rogers Corporation of Chandler, Ariz., that has a relative permeability of one and a relative permittivity of about four. The antenna  when used with a ground plane structure  having a substrate  employing Rogers' circuit board composition, provides a bandwidth which was approximately 2.4 times less than that of the magnesium ferrite material available from Trans-Tech, Inc.","While the present invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the herein disclosed embodiment. Rather, the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The following detailed description is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
