Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of information networks, and more particularly relates to a protocol for configuring routes over a network.","2. Description of the Related Art","Today's networks carry vast amounts of information. High bandwidth applications supported by these networks include streaming video, streaming audio, and large aggregations of voice traffic. In the future, these demands are certain to increase. To meet such demands, an increasingly popular alternative is the use of lightwave communications carried over fiber optic cables. The use of lightwave communications provides several benefits, including high bandwidth, ease of installation, and capacity for future growth.","The synchronous optical network (SONET) protocol is among those protocols employing an optical infrastructure. SONET is a physical transmission vehicle capable of transmission speeds in the multi-gigabit range, and is defined by a set of electrical as well as optical standards. SONET's ability to use currently-installed fiber optic cabling, coupled with the fact that SONET significantly reduces complexity and equipment functionality requirements, gives local and interexchange carriers incentive to employ SONET. Also attractive is the immediate savings in operational cost that this reduction in complexity provides. SONET thus allows the realization of a new generation of high-bandwidth services in a more economical manner than previously existed.","SONET networks have traditionally been protected from failures by using topologies that dedicate something on the order of half the network's available bandwidth for protection, such as a ring topology. Two approaches in common use today are diverse protection and self-healing rings (SHR), both of which offer relatively fast restoration times with relatively simple control logic, but do not scale well for large data networks. This is mostly due to their inefficiency in capacity allocation. Their fast restoration time, however, makes most failures transparent to the end-user, which is important in applications such as telephony and other voice communications. The existing schemes rely on 1-plus-1 and 1-for-1 topologies that carry active traffic over two separate fibers (line switched) or signals (path switched), and use a protocol (Automatic Protection Switching or APS), or hardware (diverse protection) to detect, propagate, and restore failures.","A SONET network using an SHR topology provides very fast restoration of failed links by using redundant links between the nodes of each ring. Thus, each ring actually consists of two rings, a ring supporting information transfer in a \u201cclockwise\u201d direction and a ring supporting information transfer in a \u201ccounter-clockwise\u201d direction. The terms \u201ceast\u201d and \u201cwest\u201d are also commonly used in this regard. Each direction employs its own set of fiber optic cables, with traffic between nodes assigned a certain direction (either clockwise or counter clockwise). If a cable in one of these sub-rings is damaged, the SONET ring \u201cheals\u201d itself by changing the direction of information flow from the direction taken by the information transferred over the failed link to the sub-ring having information flow in the opposite direction.","The detection of such faults and the restoration of information flow thus occurs very quickly, on the order of 10 ms for detection and 50 ms for restoration for most ring implementations. The short restoration time is critical in supporting applications, such as current telephone networks, that are sensitive to quality of service (QoS) because it prevents old digital terminals and switches from generating red alarms and initiating Carrier Group Alarms (CGA). These alarms are undesirable because such alarms usually result in dropped calls, causing users down time aggravation. Restoration times that exceed 10 seconds can lead to timeouts at higher protocol layers, while those that exceed 1 minute can lead to disastrous results for the entire network. However, the price of such quickly restored information flow is the high bandwidth requirements of such systems. By maintaining completely redundant sub-rings, an SHR topology requires 100% excess bandwidth.","An alternative to the ring topology is the mesh topology. The mesh topology is similar to the point-to-point topology used in inter-networking. Each node in such a network is connected to one or more other nodes. Thus, each node is connected to the rest of the network by one or more links. In this manner, a path from a first node to a second node uses all or a portion of the capacity of the links between those two nodes.","Networks based on mesh-type restoration are inherently more capacity-efficient than ring-based designs, mainly because each network link can potentially provide protection for fiber cuts on several different links. By sharing the capacity between links, a SONET network using a mesh topology can provide redundancy for failure restoration at less than 100% of the bandwidth capacity originally required. Such networks are even more efficient when traffic transits several links. One study found that for an 11-node, 22-span network, only 51% redundant net capacity was required for 100% restorability, as reported in, \u201cThe design and simulation of an intelligent transport network with distributed control,\u201d by T. Chujo, H. Komine, K. Miyazaki, T. Ogura, and T. Soejima, presented at the Network Operations Management Symposium, San Diego, Feb. 11-14, 1990, which is included herein by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes. The corresponding ring-based design required five rings and a total DS-3 redundancy of 330%. However, path restoration often consumes several minutes in such a topology. This is much slower than the restoration times exhibited by ring topologies and is so long that connections are often lost during the outage.","Various kinds of networking equipment can be used to support the ring and mesh topologies just described. Options include:\n\n","WDMs may be connected in back-to-back configurations to allow the connection of various wavelength routes to one another (also known as \u201cpatching\u201d or \u201cnailing up\u201d connections). Provisioning paths in such architectures is done manually using a patch panel. Thus, provisioning is slow and prone to mistakes due to human error and equipment failure. In the event of a failure, restoration is performed manually in such architectures, and is again slow and error-prone. Such architectures scale poorly because additional bandwidth is added by either adding to the number of wavelengths supported (requiring the replacement of equipment at nodes, and possibly the replacement of fiber optic cables as well) or adding new fiber optic cables and supporting node equipment. Such architectures are also inherently unmanageable, due to the lack of centralized control. And while the initial capital investment tends to be relatively low (as a result of their simplicity), operating expenses for such architectures tends to be relatively high because of the costs associated with configuration, expansion, and management. Thus, a mesh topology employing back-to-back WDMs will tend to be slow to deploy and difficult to manage due to the need for manually \u201cnailing up\u201d paths and lack of centralization.","Another architectural element that may be used to create a mesh topology is the optical cross connect (OXC). OXCs allow provisioning using a centralized scheme to accomplish provisioning in a matter of minutes. Restoration in the event of a failure may be performed manually or may be effected using a centralized management system. However, restoration still requires on the order of minutes per wavelength route restored. As with the back-to-back WDM architecture, a mesh topology that employs OXCs scales poorly due, in part, to the large increase in size and cost such scaling entails.","An OXC can be either transparent (purely optical, in which the signals are never converted from optical signals) or opaque (in which the optical signals are converted from optical signals into electrical signals, switched, and then converted back into optical signals). Transparent optical cross connects provide little in the way manageability because the information is never made accessible to the OXC's operator. In contrast, opaque OXCs can be configured to permit access to the information being switched. However, neither type of OXC maintains information regarding the topology of the network and, in fact, OXCs possess no intrinsic network intelligence. Moreover, OXC technology is expensive, making initial investment quite high, as well as the cost of future expansion.","Alternatively, a SONET network may be configured in a ring (SHR) topology by using add\/drop multiplexers (ADMs). An ADM is a SONET multiplexer that allows signals to be added into or dropped from a higher rate signal. ADMs have two bidirectional ports, commonly referred to as an east and a west port. Using ADMs, a SONET network in a SHR topology uses a collection of nodes equipped with ADMs in a physical closed loop such that each node is connected to two adjacent nodes with a duplex connection. Any loss of connection due to a single failure of a node or a connection between nodes is automatically restored. The traffic terminated at a failed node, however, is lost. Two types of SHRs are unidirectional (UPSR) and bidirectional (BLSR), as defined by the traffic flow in normal conditions. Bidirectional rings have a capacity carrying advantage over unidirectional rings because of the ability to share protection capacity among the links between nodes, as opposed to unidirectional rings, which dedicate capacity all the way around the ring.","Provisioning in such architectures is centralized and can be performed in minutes. While restoration can also be performed quickly (on the order of 50 ms, as previously noted), 100% spare bandwidth is required. For all intents and purposes, then, the user must install fiber optic cabling for two networks, one for normal traffic and one to be used in the event of a failure. Moreover, the cabling for each link should be physically diverse in order to minimize the possibility that a cause of physical damage will damage both links and cause both directions of a ring to fail. These issues detrimentally affect cost, manageability, and scalability. With regard to expansion, ADMs are stacked in an SHR in order to increase capacity. However, stacked ADMs are blocking. In other words, the switching function may not be transparent as a result of the ADMs not being available on a full-time basis (i.e., occasionally blocking). Thus, an architecture employing ADMs is best suited for small offices or other situations that do not require the relatively large amounts of bandwidth (implying the need for stacked ADMs). As noted, stacked ADMs are also difficult to manage and expensive due to the extra hardware required for 100% spare capacity.","Other combinations can also be employed. For example, WDMs can be combined with OXCs (either transparent or opaque) in order to create a network having a mesh topology. Such an architecture supports the cross-connection of wavelength routes by either manual connection or under centralized control. However, such an architecture is also difficult to expand due to the need to add WDMs\/fiber optic cables and the increase in size of the OXC, and cannot restore failed links quickly enough to avoid dropping or interrupting telecommunications connections.","Another option is the use of a digital cross-connect system (DCS). A DCS is used to terminate digital signals and cross-connect them, integrating multiple functionalities such as signal adding and dropping, cross-connection capabilities, and multiplexing and demultiplexing of signals. DCS based networks enjoy an advantage over networks employing back-to-back WDMs because the use of DCS eliminates the need for additional back-to-back electrical multiplexing, thus reducing the need for labor-intensive jumpers. Operational cost savings are realized by a DCS through electronically controlling cross-connections, test access and loopbacks, and maintenance. Two types of DCSs are wideband DCSs and broadband DCSs. Wideband DCS (W-DCS) terminates full duplex OC-Ns and DS3s, has VT cross-connection capability, and provides DS 1 interfaces. A broadband DCS (B-DCS) terminates full-duplex OC-N signals and provides DS3 interfaces. The B-DCS makes two-way cross connection at the DS3, STS-1, and concatenated STS-Nc levels. STS-Nc may be used, for example, in broadband services such as high definition television (HDTV), where an STS-3c cross connection may be used to cross connect the signal as a single, high-capacity channel.","Various attempts have been made to use DCSs in a mesh configuration to create a fault-tolerant network, but have not met with broad success in reducing restoration times below a few seconds. Some of these configurations rely on a central database and a central controller (usually an Operations System or OS) to restore failures. Although these schemes often exhibit restoration times exceeding 10 minutes, such restoration times are an improvement over manual restoration, which requires hours, or even days to effect restoration. However, these results are not enough to meet the 50-200 ms restoration time required by existing telecommunication network equipment. Other implementations employ distributed architectures in which control is shared among multiple network nodes. This results in faster restoration times (on the order of about 2-10 seconds), but still does not address the need for restoration times below 200 ms.","A routing protocol that supports relatively simple provisioning and relatively fast restoration (on the order of, for example, 50 ms), while providing relatively efficient bandwidth usage (i.e., minimizing excess bandwidth requirements for restoration, on the order of less than 100% redundant capacity and preferably less than 50% redundant capacity). Such a routing protocol is, in one embodiment, easily be scaled to accommodate increasing bandwidth requirements.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus and method are described for configuring routes over a network. Such a method, embodied in a protocol of the present invention, provides several advantages. A protocol according to the present invention provides relatively fast restoration (on the order of 50 ms), while providing relatively efficient bandwidth usage (i.e., minimizing excess bandwidth requirements for restoration on the order of less than 100% redundant capacity and preferably, less than 50% redundant capacity). Moreover, a protocol according to one embodiment of the present invention scales well to accommodate increasing bandwidth demands of the services being supported.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method of operating an optical network is described. The network includes a number of nodes coupled by a number of links. A method according to this embodiment of the present invention provisions a virtual path between a first and a second one of the plurality of nodes by: identifying the first and the second nodes, discovering a physical path from the first node to the second node, and establishing the virtual path. The method discovers a physical path from the first node to the second node by automatically identifying nodes forming the physical path. The method establishes the virtual path by configuring a set of connections between the nodes forming the physical path.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method is described that terminates the virtual path by sending a termination message from one of the first and second nodes to the other of the first and second nodes. The termination message is sent along the physical path and resources for the virtual path are deallocated by each one of the nodes forming the physical path as the termination message is sent to the next one of the nodes that form the physical path.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method is described that restores a virtual path in response to a failure along the physical path created between a first node and a second node by a provisioning operation such as that described above (although a virtual path restored by a method according to the present invention may be provisioned in any manner deemed desirable). Such a method begins by discovering an alternate physical path from the first node to the second node. The alternate physical path is discovered by automatically identifying nodes forming the alternate physical path. This may be based on any number of criteria, such as cost, quality of service, latency, or other metric. The method then re-establishes the virtual path by configuring a set of connections between the nodes forming the alternate physical path. This may require an entirely new end-to-end alternate physical path, or may simply be the addition of a node or link to the existing physical path.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features, and advantages of the present invention, as defined solely by the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed description set forth below.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following is intended to provide a detailed description of an example of the invention and should not be taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any number of variations may fall within the scope of the invention which is defined in the claims following the description.","In one embodiment, a routing protocol is described that provides many advantages, including restoration times on the order of 50 ms or less (e.g., comparable to those of SHRs) and relatively high utilization efficiency (e.g. by reducing the amount redundant bandwidth, preferably to, for example, 50% or less). The protocol achieves the former by using a physical network layer (e.g., SONET) for communications between network nodes. Preferably, no other protocols are interspersed between the routing protocol and the transmission medium. Also preferably, all protocol-related status and control messages are communicated in-band (e.g., carried by the physical network layer, for example, in certain of a SONET frame's overhead bytes), which allows events to be sent between network nodes at hardware speeds. However, out-of-band communication channels can also be successfully employed to carry such information.","Another mechanism employed by the protocol to improve restoration time is distributed intelligence, which also supports end-to-end provisioning. The protocol, in one embodiment, relies on a distributed routing protocol, which employs event pipelining and parallel execution of protocol processes. Because multiple actions occur in parallel, event delays are minimized. In such an embodiment, the protocol also uses a distributed database and relies on distributed control to restore failures. In one embodiment, every node maintains an up-to-date view of network topology, (i.e., available nodes and links, and configured connections). Changes that occur in the network, whether caused by failed links, newly provisioned connections, or added\/failed\/removed nodes, are \u201cbroadcast\u201d throughout the network, using special protocol packets and procedures. Topology distribution normally runs concurrently with, and in parallel to, failure restoration activities, but at a much lower priority.","This is achieved by making the protection bandwidth a user-configurable parameter, and attaching a priority (or QoS) metric to all configured connections (referred to herein as virtual paths or VPs) and links. The QoS parameter makes it possible to reduce the required percentage of protection bandwidth even further, while maintaining the same quality of service for those connections that need and, more importantly, can afford such treatment. Thus, availability is mapped into a cost metric and only made available to users who can justify the cost of a given level of service.","Network Architecture","To limit the size of the topology database and the scope of broadcast packets, networks like the protocol described herein can be divided into smaller logical groups called \u201czones.\u201d Each zone runs a separate copy of the topology distribution algorithm, and nodes within each zone are only required to maintain information about their own zone. There is no need for a zone's topology to be known outside its boundaries, and nodes within a zone need not be aware of the network's topology external to their respective zones.","Nodes that attach to multiple zones are referred to herein as border nodes. Border nodes are required to maintain a separate topological database, also called a link-state or connectivity database, for each of the zones they attach to. Border nodes use the connectivity database(s) for intra-zone routing. Border nodes are also required to maintain a separate database that describes the connectivity of the zones themselves. This database, which is called the network database, is used for inter-zone routing. It describes the topology of a special zone, referred to herein as the backbone, which is always assigned an ID of 0. The backbone has all the characteristics of a zone. There is no need for a backbone's topology to be known outside the backbone, and its border nodes need not be aware of the topologies of other zones.","A network is referred to herein as flat if it consists of a single zone (i.e., zone 0 or the backbone zone). Conversely, a network is referred to herein as hierarchical if it contains two or more zones, not including the backbone. The resulting multi-level hierarchy (i.e., nodes and one or more zones) provides the following benefits:\n\n","As noted, the protocol routes information at two different levels: inter-zone and intra-zone. The former is only used when the source and destination nodes of a virtual path are located in different zones. Inter-zone routing supports path restoration on an end-to-end basis from the source of the virtual path to the destination by isolating failures between zones. In the latter case, the border nodes in each transit zone originate and terminate the path-restoration request on behalf of the virtual path's source and destination nodes. A border node that assumes the role of a source (or destination) node during the path restoration activity is referred to herein as a proxy source (destination) node. Such nodes are responsible for originating (terminating) the RPR request with their own zones. Proxy nodes are also required to communicate with border nodes in other zones to establish an inter-zone path for the VP.","In one embodiment, every node in a network employing the protocol is assigned a globally unique 16-bit ID referred to herein as the node ID. A node ID is divided into two parts, zone ID and node address. Logically, each node ID is a pair (zone ID, node address), where the zone ID identifies a zone within the network, and the node address identifies a node within that zone. To minimize overhead, the protocol defines three types of node IDs, each with a different size zone ID field, although a different number of zone types can be employed. The network provider selects which packet type to use based on the desired network architecture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0072"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130"],"sup":["13 ","10 "]},"Type 0 IDs work well for networks that contain a small number of large zones (e.g., less than about 4 zones). Type 2 IDs are well suited for networks that contain a large number of small zones (e.g., more than about 15). Type 1 IDs provide a good compromise between zone size and number of available zones, which makes a type 1 node ID a good choice for networks that contain an average number of medium size zones (e.g., between about 4 and about 15). When zones being described herein are in a network, the node IDs of the nodes in a zone may be delineated as two decimal numbers separated by a period (e.g., ZoneID.NodeAddress).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0074"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","201","204","211","217","221","226","231","236","241","247","213","217","222","224","234","235","241","242","200","201","204"]},"Once a network topology has been defined, the protocol allows the user to configure one or more end-to-end connections that can span multiple nodes and zones. This operation is referred to herein as provisioning. Each set of physical connections that are provisioned creates an end-to-end connection between the two end nodes that supports a virtual point-to-point link (referred to herein as a virtual path or VP). The resulting VP has an associated capacity and an operational state, among other attributes. The end points of a VP can be configured to have a master\/slave relationship. The terms source and destination are also used herein in referring to the two end-nodes. In such a relationship, the node with a numerically lower node ID assumes the role of the master (or source) node, while the other assumes the role of the slave (or destination) node. The protocol defines a convention in which the source node assumes all recovery responsibilities and that the destination node simply waits for a message from the source node informing it of the VP's new path, although the opposite convention could easily be employed.","VPs are also assigned a priority level, which determines their relative priority within the network. This quality of service (QoS) parameter is used during failure recovery procedures to determine which VPs are first to be restored. Four QoS levels (0-3) are nominally defined in the protocol, with 0 being the lowest, although a larger or smaller number of QoS levels can be used. Provisioning is discussed in greater detail subsequently herein.","Initialization of Network Nodes","In one embodiment, network nodes use a protocol such as that referred to herein as the Hello Protocol in order to establish and maintain neighbor relationships, and to learn and distribute link-state information throughout the network. The protocol relies on the periodic exchange of bi-directional packets (Hello packets) between neighbors. During the adjacency establishment phase of the protocol, which involves the exchange of INIT packets, nodes learn information about their neighbors, such as that listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0078"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Information regarding neighbors stored by a node."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Parameter","Usage"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Node ID","Node ID of the sending node, which is preferably,"]},{"entry":[{},"from 8 bits to 32 bits."]},{"entry":["HelloInterval","How often Hello packets should be sent by the"]},{"entry":[{},"receiving node"]},{"entry":["HelloDeadInterval","The time interval, in seconds, after which the"]},{"entry":[{},"sending node will consider its neighbor dead if a"]},{"entry":[{},"valid Hello packets is not received."]},{"entry":["LinkCost","Cost of the link between the two neighbors.

The node that constructs the LSA is called the originating node. Normally, the originating node is the only node allowed to modify its contents (except for the HOP_COUNT field, which is not included in the checksum and so may be modified by other nodes). The originating node retransmits the LSA when the LSA's contents change. The LSA is sent in a special Hello packet that contains not only the node's own LSA in its advertisement, but also ones received from other nodes. The structure, field definitions, and related information are illustrated subsequently in  and described in the corresponding discussion. Each node stores the most recently generated instance of an LSA in its database. The list of stored LSAs gives the node a complete topological map of the network. The topology database maintained by a given node is, therefore, nothing more than a list of the most recent LSAs generated by its peers and received in Hello packets.","In the case of a stable network, the majority of transmitted Hello packets are empty (i.e., contain no topology information) because only altered LSAs are included in the Hello messages. Packets containing no changes (no LSAs) are referred to herein as null Hello packets. The Hello protocol requires neighbors to exchange null Hello packets periodically. The HelloInterval parameter defines the duration of this period. Such packets ensure that the two neighbors are alive, and that the link that connects them is operational.","Initialization Message","An INIT message is the first protocol transaction conducted between adjacent nodes, and is performed upon network startup or when a node is added to a pre-existing network. An INIT message is used by adjacent nodes to initialize and exchange adjacency parameters. The packet contains parameters that identify the neighbor (the node ID of the sending node), its link bandwidth (both total and available, on a QoS3\/QoSn basis), and its configured Hello protocol parameters. The structure, field definitions, and related information are illustrated subsequently in  and described in the text corresponding thereto.","In systems that provide two or more QoS levels, varying amounts of link bandwidth may be set aside for the exclusive use of services requiring a given QoS. For example, a certain amount of link bandwidth may be reserved for QoS3 connections. This guarantees that a given amount of link bandwidth will be available for use by these high-priority services. The remaining link bandwidth would then be available for use by all QoS levels (0-3). The Hello parameters include the HelloInterval and HelloDeadInterval parameters. The HelloInterval is the number of seconds between transmissions of Hello packets. A zero in this field indicates that this parameter hasn't been configured on the sending node and that the neighbor should use its own configured interval. If both nodes send a zero in this field then a default value (e.g., 5 seconds) should be used. The HelloDeadInterval is the number of seconds the sending node will wait before declaring a silent neighbor down. A zero in this field indicates that this parameter hasn't been configured on the sending node and that the neighbor should use its own configured value. If both nodes send a zero in this field then a default value (e.g., 30 seconds) should be used. The successful receipt and processing of an INIT packet causes a START event to be sent to the Hello State machine, as is described subsequently.","Hello Message","Once adjacency between two neighbors has been established, the nodes periodically exchange Hello packets. The interval between these transmissions is a configurable parameter that can be different for each link, and for each direction. Nodes are expected to use the HelloInterval parameters specified in their neighbor's Hello message. A neighbor is considered dead if no Hello message is received from the neighbor within the HelloDeadInterval period (also a configurable parameter that can be link- and direction-specific).","In one embodiment, nodes in a network continuously receive Hello messages on each of their links and save the most recent LSAs from each message. Bach LSA contains, among other things, an LSID (indicating which instance of the given LSA has been received) and a HOP_COUNT. The HOP_COUNT specifies the distance, as a number of hops, between the originating node and the receiving node. The originating node always sets this field of 0 when the LSA is created. The HOP_COUNT field is incremented by one for each hop (from node to node) traversed by the LSA instance. The HOP_COUNT field is set to zero by the originating node and is incremented by one on every hop of the flooding procedure. The ID field is initialized to FIRST_LSID during node start-up and is incremented every time a new instance of the LSA is created by the originating node. The initial ID is only used once by each originating node. Preferably, an LSA carrying such an ID is always accepted as most recent. This approach allows old instances of an LSA to be quickly flushed from the network when the originating node is restarted.","During normal network operation, the originating node of an LSA transmits LS update messages when the node detects activity that results in a change in its LSA. The node sets the HOP_COUNT field of the LSA to 0 and the LSID field to the LSID of the previous instance plus 1. Wraparound may be avoided by using a sufficiently-large LSID (e.g., 32 bits). When another node receives the update message, the node records the LSA in its database and schedules it for transmission to its own neighbors. The HOP_COUNT field is incremented by one and transmitted to the neighboring nodes. Likewise, when the nodes downstream of the current node receive an update message with a HOP_COUNT of H, they transmit their own update message to all of their neighbors with a HOP_COUNT of H+1, which represents the distance (in hops) to the originating node. This continues until the update message either reaches a node that has a newer instance of the LSA in its database or the hop-count field reaches MAX_HOPS.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0086"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","300","320","330","340","350","360","370","380","390"]},"It should be noted that those skilled in the art will recognize the boundaries between and order of operations in this and the other flow diagrams described herein are merely illustrative and alternative embodiments may merge operations, impose an alternative decomposition of functionality of operations, or re-order the operations presented therein.

Various versions of the GET_LSA request are generated by nodes along the path, each with a varying number of requested LSA entries. An entry is removed from the request when it reaches a node that has an instance of the requested LSA that meets the criteria of list B.","All database exchanges are expected to be reliable using the above method because received LSA's must be individually acknowledged. The acknowledgment packet contains a mask that has a \u201c1\u201d in all bit positions that correspond to LSA's that were received without any errors. The low-order bit corresponds to the first LSA received in the request, while the high-order bit corresponds to the last LSA. Upon receiving the response, the sender verifies the checksum of all LSA's in its database that have a corresponding \u201c0\u201d bit in the response. It then retransmits all LSA's with a valid checksum and ages out all others. An incorrect checksum indicates that the contents of the given LSA has changed while being held in the node's database. This is usually the result of a memory problem. Each node is thus required to verify the checksum of all LSA's in its database periodically.","The LS checksum is provided to ensure the integrity of LSA contents. As noted, it is used to detect data corruption of an LSA. This corruption can occur while the advertisement is being transmitted, while it is being held in a node's database, or at other points in the networking equipment. The checksum can be formed by any one of a number of methods known to those of skill in the art, such as by treating the LSA as a sequence of 16-bit integers, adding them together using one's complement arithmetic, and then taking the one's complement of the result. Preferably, the checksum doesn't include the LSA's HOP_COUNT field, in order to allow other nodes to modify the HOP_COUNT without having to update the checksum field. In such a scenario, only the originating node is allowed to modify the contents of an LSA except for those two fields, including its checksum. This simplifies the detection and tracking of data corruption.","Specific instances of an LSA are identified by the LSA's ID field, the LSID. The LSID makes it possible to detect old and duplicate LSAs. Similar to sequence numbers, the space created by the ID is circular: it starts at some value (FIRST_LSID), increases to some maximum value (FIRST_LSID-1), and then goes back to FIRST_LSID+1. Preferably, the initial value is only used once during the lifetime of the LSA, which helps flush old instances of the LSA quickly from the network when the originating node is restarted. Given a large enough LSID, wrap-around will never occur, in a practical sense. For example, using a 32 bit LSID and a MinLSInterval of 5 seconds, wrap-around takes on the order of 680 years.","LSIDs must be such that two LSIDs can be compared and the greater (or lesser) of the two identified, or a failure of the comparison indicated.

VPs may be provisioned statically or dynamically. For example, a user can identify the nodes through which the VP will pass and manually configure each node to support the given VP. The selection of nodes may be based on any number of criteria, such as QoS, latency, cost, and the like. Alternatively, the VP may be provisioned dynamically using any one of a number of methods, such as a shortest path first technique or a distributed technique. A shortest path first technique might, for example, employ the shortest path first technique of the present invention. An example of a distributed technique is the restoration method described subsequently herein.","Failure Detection, Propagation, and Restoration","Failure Detection and Propagation","In one embodiment of networks herein, failures are detected using the mechanisms provided by the underlying physical network. For example, when using a SONET network, a fiber cut on a given link results in a loss of signal (LOS) condition at the nodes connected by that link. The LOS condition propagated an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) downstream, and Remote Defect Indication (RDI) upstream (if the path still exists), and an LOS defect locally. Later, the defect is upgraded to a failure 2.5 seconds later, which causes an alarm to be sent to the Operations System (OS) (per Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253 (GR-253: Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) Transport Systems, Common Generic Criteria, Issue 2 [Bellcore, December 1995], included herein by reference, in its entirety and for all purposes)). Preferably when using SONET, the handling of the LOS condition follows Bellcore's recommendations in GR-253, which allows nodes to inter-operate, and co-exist, with other network equipment (NE) in the same network and which is included by reference herein in its entirety and for all purposes. The mesh restoration protocol is invoked as soon as the LOS defect is detected by the line card, which occurs 3 ms following the failure (a requirement under GR-253).","The arrival of the AIS at the downstream node causes it to send a similar alarm to its downstream neighbor and for that node to send an AIS to its own downstream neighbor. This continues from node to node until the AIS finally reaches the source node of the affected VP, or a proxy border node if the source node is located in a different zone. In the latter case, the border node restores the VP on behalf of the source node. Under GR-253, each node is allowed a maximum of 125 microseconds to forward the AIS downstream, which quickly propagates failures toward the source node.","Once a node has detected a failure on one of its links, either through a local LOS defect or a received AIS indication, the node scans its VP table looking for entries that have the failed link in their path. When the node finds one, it releases all link bandwidth used by the VP. Then, if the node is a VP's source node or a proxy border node, the VP's state is changed to RESTORING and the VP placed on a list of VPs to be restored. Otherwise (if the node isn't the source node or a proxy border node), the state of the VP is changed to DOWN, and a timer is started to delete it from the database if a corresponding restore-path request isn't received from the origin node within a certain timeout period. The VP list that was created in the previous step is ordered by quality of service (QoS), which ensures that VPs with a higher QoS setting are restored first. Each entry in the list contains, among other things, the ID of the VP, its source and destination nodes, configured QoS level, and required bandwidth.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0131"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","920","930","940","950","960","970","980","990"]},"Failure Restoration","For each VP on the list, the node then sends an RPR to all eligible neighbors in order to restore the given VP. The network will, of course, attempt to restore all failed VPs. Neighbor eligibility is determined by the state of the neighbor, available link bandwidth, current zone topology, location of the Target node, and other parameters. One method for determining the eligibility of a particular neighbor follows:\n\n","Due to the way RPR messages are forwarded by tandem nodes and the unconditional and periodic retransmmission of such messages by origin nodes, multiple instances of the same request are not uncommon, even multiple copies of each instance, circulating the network at any given time. To minimize the amount of broadcast traffic generated by the protocol and aid tandem nodes in allocating bandwidth fairly for competing RPRs, tandem nodes preferably execute a sequence such as that described subsequently.","The term \u201csame instance,\u201d as used below, refers to messages that carry the same VP ID, origin node ID, and hop-count, and are received from the same tandem node (usually, the same input link, assuming only one link between nodes). Any two messages that meet the above criteria are guaranteed to have been sent by the same origin node, over the same link, to restore the same VP, and to have traversed the same path. The terms \u201ccopy of an instance,\u201d or more simply \u201ccopy\u201d are used herein to refer to a retransmission of a given instance. Normally, tandem nodes select the first instance they receive since in most, but not all cases, as the first RPR received normally represents the quickest path to the origin node. A method for making such a determination was described in reference to . Because such information must be stored for numerous RPRs, a standard data structure is defined under a protocol of the present invention.","The Restore-Path Request Entry (RPRE) is a data structure that maintains information about a specific instance of a RPRE packet.

This is illustrated in  as step  and is the subject of the flow diagram illustrated in .

If the HOP_COUNT is still within acceptable limits, the node then determines whether this is the first instance of the RPR having been received (step ). If this is the case, a Restore-Path Request Entry (RPRE) is created for the request (step ).

The response follows the reverse of the path carried in the request. No broadcasting is therefore necessary in such a case. If a similar instance of the RPR has been processed and accepted by this node (step ), the local node determines whether a Terminate NAK has been received for this RPR (step ). If a Terminate NAK has been received for this RPR, the RPR is rejected by sending a Terminate response to the originating neighbor (step ).

The indicator is propagated all the way back to the originating node and prevents it, and all other nodes along the path, from sending or forwarding other copies of the corresponding RPR instance.","Terminating RPR Packets are processed as follows. The RPR continues along the path until it encounters any one of the following four conditions:\n\n","Conditions 1, 2 and 3 cause a negative response to be sent back to the originating node, flowing along the path carried in the request, but in the reverse direction.","Further optimizations of the protocol can easily be envisioned by one of skill in the art, and are intended to be within the scope of this specification. For examples in one embodiment, a mechanism to further reduce the amount of broadcast traffic generated for any given VP. In order to prevent an upstream neighbor from sending the same instance of an RPR every T milliseconds, a tandem node can immediately return a no-commit positive response to that neighbor, which prevents it from sending further copies of the instance. The response simply acknowledges the receipt of the request, and doesn't commit the sender to any of the requested resources. Preferably, however, the sender (of the positive response) periodically transmits the acknowledged request until a valid response is received from its downstream neighbor(s). This mechanism implements a piece-wise, or hop-by-hop, acknowledgment strategy that limits the scope of retransmitted packets to a region that gets progressively smaller as the request gets closer to its target node.","Optimizations","However, it is prudent to provide some optimizations for efficiently handling errors. Communication protocols often handle link errors by starting a timer after every transmission and, if a valid response isn't received within the timeout period, the message is retransmitted. If a response isn't received after a certain number of retransmission, the sender generates a local error and disables the connection. The timeout period is usually a configurable parameter, but in some cases it is computed dynamically, and continuously, by the two end points. The simplest form of this uses some multiple of the average round trip time as a timeout period, while others use complex mathematical formulas to determine this value. Depending on the distance between the two nodes, the speed of link that connects them, and the latency of the equipment along the path, the timeout period can range anywhere from millisecond to seconds.","The above strategy is not the preferred method of handling link errors in the present invention. This is because the fast restoration times required dictates that 2-way, end-to-end communication be carried out in less than 50 ms. A drawback of the above-described solution is the time wasted while waiting for an acknowledgment to come back from the receiving node. A safe timeout period for a 2000 mile span, for instance, is over 35 ms, which doesn't leave enough time for a retransmission in case of an error.","This problem is addressed in one embodiment by taking advantage of the multiple communication channels, i.e. OC-48's that exist between nodes to:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0186"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1400","1405","1410","1415","1455","1415","1445"]},"Network  is flat, meaning that all nodes belong to the same zone, zone 0 or the backbone zone.

It can use the same packet format as the Restore Path packet. The origin node is responsible for initializing the Path [ ] PathLength, and Checksum fields to the packet, which should include the full path of the VP being deleted. It also sets PathIndex to zero. Tandem nodes should release link resources allocated for the VP after they have received a valid response from the target node. The target node should set the PathIndex field to zero prior to computing the checksum of packet.","The TestPath Packet","The TestPath packet is used to test the integrity of an existing virtual path. It uses the same packet format as the RestorePath packet. The originating node is responsible for initializing the Path [ ], PathLength, and Checksum fields of the packet, which should include the full path of the span being tested. It also sets PathIndex to zero. The target node should set the PathIndex field to zero prior to computing the checksum of packet. The TestPath packet may be configured to test functionality, or may test a path based on criteria chosen by the user, such as latency, error rate, and the like.","The Link-Down Packet","The Link-Down packet is used when master nodes are present in the network.
