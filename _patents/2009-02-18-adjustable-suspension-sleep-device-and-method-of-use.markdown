{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/029,440, filed Feb. 18, 2008, entitled MY INVENTION IS A NAP-SAC KIT THAT HANGS SUSPENDED FROM THE TWO DOORS AND WINDOWS IN ANY TYPE OF VEHICLE AND PROVIDES A PLACE TO SLEEP OR REST ALL INSIDE THE VEHICLE; and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/092,556, filed Aug. 28, 2008, entitled A NAP-SAC KIT HANGS SUSPENDED FROM THE TWO DOORS AND WINDOWS IN ANY TYPE OF VEHICLE AND PROVIDES A PLACE TO SLEEP OR REST INSIDE THE VEHICLE, the contents all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.","The present invention generally relates to devices used for sleeping. More specifically, the present invention relates to a sleeping device which suspends the user above the ground or other surface.","Beds and other sleep devices for use in and around vehicles are well known. Sleep devices may be located around the vehicle in a variety of places, for example in the bed of a pick-up truck, mounted to the roof of a vehicle, or attached to the rear of the vehicle to enable a user to access the device from the cab or passenger compartment through the trunk. However, each of these devices is located outside of the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle. To prepare these devices for use, the user must exit the vehicle and physically set up the sleep device. Further, these sleep devices do not protect the user from extreme weather conditions, especially extreme cold, wind or precipitation. Further, in a situation where the vehicle has been in an accident or has inadvertently traveled off of the road, for example sliding off the road due to snow and\/or ice, these devices may not be used as they require the vehicle to be positioned on flat, stable ground, often with a clear area around the vehicle. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to enable a sleeping device to be used within the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle while limiting exposure to weather conditions during set up of the device.","Beds or sleep devices may also be located inside of the cab or passenger compartment of a vehicle. These devices often include a flat rectangular deck which may be positioned on top of or around the seats within the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle. However, these devices often do not take into account users of different heights or lengths. Specifically, these devices are arranged perpendicular to the seats within the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle. Accordingly, a user is confined to the space between the sides of the vehicle frame, usually between the vehicle doors. A user who is taller or longer than the distance between the frame or doors is unable to comfortably rest, as the user is unable to extend their body. It would be advantageous to allow a user to be comfortably supported by a sleeping device within the confines of a vehicle cab or passenger compartment.","Suspendable sleep devices for use in a vehicle are also known. U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,424 to Eiserman et al. discloses a hammock-like sleeping device which suspends between the doors of a vehicle, specifically a semi-truck cab. However, the Eiserman device does not secure a user within the sleeping device, creating a significant physical risk to the user of falling out of the hammock-like device. It would be advantageous to provide the user with a feature which would enclose the user into the sleeping device and reduce the risk of falling out of the device.","An adjustable suspension sleep device is disclosed for suspending a person while sleeping. The adjustable suspension sleep device has a body support assembly having a first and second longitudinally extending sides spaced apart by first and second ends, a first adjustable tensioning assembly in communication with the first side of the body support assembly, a second adjustable tensioning assembly in communication with the second side of the body support assembly, a first suspension support assembly in communication with the first end of the body support assembly, and a second suspension support assembly in communication with the second end of the body support assembly.","A method of using the adjustable suspension sleep device is also provided. In the method, the first ends of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies are wrapped around a portion of a frame of a vehicle, followed by engagement of the first attachment members of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies. The first suspension support assembly is then engaged with the vehicle. The second ends of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies are wrapped around a portion of the frame of a vehicle, followed by engagement of the second attachment members of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies. The second suspension support assembly is then engaged with the vehicle. The first and second tension adjustment devices are then adjusted to increase the tension of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies, resulting in suspension of the adjustable suspension sleep device from the frame of the vehicle.","One or more embodiments of the present invention result in advantages not provided by vehicular sleep devices known in the art. Specifically, the adjustable suspension sleep device limits exposure to weather conditions during device set up and use, as the device may be set up and used within the cab or passenger compartment of a vehicle. In addition, the adjustable suspension sleep device comfortably supports users of different heights or lengths, as the user is suspended in the air, naturally hanging between the two ends of the adjustable suspension sleep device. Moreover, the tensioning feature of the adjustable suspension sleep device encloses the user into the sleeping device, reducing the risk of bodily injury caused by falling out of the device.","The following presents one or more examples of embodiments of an adjustable suspension sleep device . For ease of discussion and understanding, the following detailed description and illustrations refer to the adjustable suspension sleep device  for use with a vehicle and more specifically, to be suspended inside of the cab or passenger compartment of a vehicle between the vehicle doors.

The adjustable suspension sleep device ,  provides three points of connection with the attached vehicle or structure on both the first and second ends ,  of the adjustable suspension sleep device , . Specifically, the first attachment members ,  of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  and the first suspension support assembly  provide three connection points to the attached vehicle or structure on the first side  of the adjustable suspension sleep device , . The second attachment members ,  and the second suspension support assembly  provide three connection points to the attached vehicle or structure on the second side  of the adjustable suspension sleep device , . Further, the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  reduces the risk of a user from falling out of the adjustable suspension sleep device , . Specifically, when tension is applied to the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  and the adjustable suspension sleep device ,  is suspended above the ground or other surface, the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  are generally positioned above the body of the user. Accordingly, the bodily support assembly  wraps around and encloses the body of the user within the adjustable suspension sleep device , , generally forming a \u201cU-shape\u201d when viewed from the first end  toward the second end  (or the second end  toward the first end ) of the adjustable suspension sleep device , . Since the first and second sides ,  of the bodily support assembly  are also positioned generally above the body of the user (based upon the positioning of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies , ), the bodily support assembly  generally forms a cocoon-like structure or partial cocoon around the body of the user. The risk of falling out of the adjustable suspension sleep device ,  is reduced because the first and second sides ,  are positioned above the body of the user. In order to fall out of the adjustable suspension sleep device , , the user has to move upward and over one of the first or second sides , . An additional structural advantage is the combination of the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  and the bodily support assembly  accounting for different heights or lengths or users. When tension is applied to the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  and the adjustable suspension sleep device ,  is suspended above the ground or other surface, the bodily support assembly  supports the body of a user. The bodily support assembly  hangs downward, toward the ground or other surface, from the first and second ends , . The body of the user (in addition to gravity) generates downward force against the bodily support assembly , creating a downward hang or sag between the first and second ends , . This downward hang or sag naturally supports the entire length or height of the body of the user. This effectively allows the user to comfortably hang or be suspended during sleep. The amount of hang or sag may increase or decrease based upon the length or height (or weight) of the user. Accordingly, the bodily support assembly  may provide comfortable bodily support for users of different heights or lengths.","The adjustable suspension sleep device described herein has several advantages. For instance, the user may minimize exposure to extreme weather or the elements by setting up the adjustable suspension sleep device within the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle. Likewise, the user will be protected by extreme weather while sleeping, especially low temperatures, by the cocoon-like structure around the user and use within the cab or passenger compartment of the vehicle. The user may have the added benefit of additional warmth from at least one of a pocket , blanket  and a casing or cover . This benefits a user who may require sleep or has a disabled vehicle while experiencing low temperatures which could lead to hypothermia and death. Additionally, during operation and use of the adjustable suspension sleep device, the user is suspended in the air in the cocoon-like structure, allowing the user to comfortably hang or be suspended during sleep, accounting for different heights or lengths or users. Further, the cocoon-like structure ensures the user will not fall out of the adjustable suspension sleep device and cause an injury, as the first and second adjustable tensioning assemblies ,  are located above the user during use of the adjustable suspension sleep device.","Although various representative embodiments of this invention have been described above with a certain degree of particularity, those skilled in the art could make numerous alterations to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventive subject matter set forth in the specification and claims.
