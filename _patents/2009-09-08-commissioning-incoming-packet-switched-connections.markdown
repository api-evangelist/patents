{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/101,209 filed Sep. 30, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","The invention relates to communication, especially to a node for communication within a communication system, a communication arrangement for communication within a communication system, a method executed by a node which supports incoming packet switched connections, a computer program adapted to perform such a method, and a computer-readable medium product comprising such a computer program.","Existing Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) platforms already integrate several radio access technologies such as the so-called General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), and Evolved HSPA (eHSPA) in one platform. Concerning packet switched services, a UMTS mobile is independently of the current radio access technology (RAT) always connected to the same domain for packet services, the GPRS core network packet domain. Thus the User Equipment (UE) always uses the same principles for Internet Protocol (IP) bearer\/connection management and allocation between the UE and the network.","The IP bearer\/connection management and allocation in the GPRS packet domain is based on Primary Packet Data Protocol (PDP) contexts and Secondary PDP contexts and comprises functions for activation, deactivation and modification of them, as being described in the specification document issued by the Generation Partnership Project, named 3GPP TS 24.008 \u201cMobile Radio Interface Layer 3 specification; Core Network Protocols; Stage 3\u201d, which is herewith included by reference, thereby especially including the description of handling of Traffic Flow Templates (TFTs) and Quality of Service (QoS) profiles being specified per (Secondary) PDP contexts.","In existing mobile phone platforms, the IP bearer\/connection management and allocation as specified by 3GPP for the GPRS packet domain is also the basis for the IP bearer\/connection management and allocation functionality provided towards applications.","This functionality might be provided through any application programming interface (API). For internal applications, this functionality may be provided through the OPA (Open Platform API) interface, which is the name a mobile phone platform being developed by Telefonaktlebolaget L. M. Ericsson. Alternatively (e.g., for external applications) this functionality may be provided through the so-called AT command interface as described in the document: 3GPP TS 27.007 \u201cAT command set for User Equipment (UE)\u201d, hereby incorporated by reference. To simplify the description in the following exemplarily only the AT command interface is considered, which in addition is an interface that is not only used by Ericsson mobile phone platforms, but probably by all wireless 3GPP based modems as it is part of the 3GPP standard.","Instead of using (Primary) PDP Contexts and Secondary PDP Contexts as in the GPRS packet domain, the Evolved Packet System (EPS), which is the packed-switched domain used for the so-called Long Term Evolution (LTE) radio technology being specified by the above-mentioned 3GPP, defining Default Bearers, Dedicated Bearers and Service Data Flows (SDFs) in the so-called Non-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol, e.g. being specified in the documents 3GPP TS 23.401 \u201cGPRS Enhancements for E-UTRAN access\u201d and 3GPP TS 24.301 \u201cNon-Access-Stratum (NAS) protocol for Evolved Packet System (EPS); Core Network Protocols; Stage 3\u201d. With regard to the SDFs, it should be mentioned that meanwhile the standard defined a further term, i.e. the Traffic Flow Aggregate, refer to TS 23.401, e.g. section 4.7.1 and the figure in section 4.7.2.2.","An SDF is always based on a Bearer. This also holds for a Traffic Flow Aggregate. Whenever statements regarding the term SDF are made in this document, such statements may also apply to the term Traffic Flow Aggregate. Several SDFs or Traffic Flow Aggregate with the same QoS may build an aggregated SDF or Traffic Flow Aggregate and may be mapped to the same Bearer. Contrary to the existing GPRS packet domain, where the decision of how to map SDFs (denoted as Traffic Flow Template in existing GPRS packet domains) and (secondary) PDP Contexts is done in the UE, in EPS the network decides how the mapping shall be done. This means an LTE Resource Allocation Request for an SDF or a Traffic Flow Aggregate issued by the application via NAS signaling can either return a new Dedicated Bearer with an SDF or a Traffic Flow Aggregate or return an already existing bearer with an additional SDF or Traffic Flow Aggregate. For the existing GPRS packet domain, the corresponding Secondary PDP Context Activate Request always returns a new (secondary) PDP Context. In both latter cases, a so-called outgoing packet switched (PS) connection is issued.","An incoming PS connection is characterized by the fact that from the UE perspective, no application has triggered the establishment of such a PS connection. The initiation is perceived as unsolicited. This type of PS connection is not supported by e.g. pre-release 7 3 GPP networks, or by other cellular network e.g. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access).","In case of an outgoing PS connection, the application is the initiator, e.g. in LTE when the application issues a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST in network signaling (NS), the network responds with an activation (i.e. ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST) or modification (i.e. MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST) of an EPS bearer.","In case of an incoming PS connection the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST would be received by the UE without an explicit trigger by the application. In the latter case, the modification of an existing EPS bearer may be sent to establish a new service flow.","There are may be several possibilities to implement the handling of incoming PS connections. One conventional concept is described in the following.","A conventional implementation of the handling of an incoming PS connection is shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["30","36","34","32","30","40","50"]},"The incoming PS connection is commissioned by the connection manager  as soon as the application  initiates the connection setup.","An ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST  is received by the LTE NS stack  of the UE . LTE NS stack  forwards a connection setup request  to the connection manager  which, in turn, may send an accept reply  to the LTS NS stack . Next, an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT  is sent from the LTS NS stack  to the network .","Application  may send a connection setup request  to the connection manager  which, in turn, commissions the PS connection and may send back a response  to the application .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},"Application  sends a connection setup request  to connection manager  which forwards the connection setup request  to LTE NS stack . LTE NS stack  then sends a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST  to the network  responding, in turn, to the LTE NS stack  with an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST . Then, a connection setup response  is sent from the LTE NS stack  to the connection manager  which, in turn, sends a response  to the application  and an accept message  to the LTE NS stack . An ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT  is then sent from the LTE NS stack  to the network .","Hence, the instance which manages the outgoing PS connections, i.e. the connection manager , has to handle also the incoming PS connection.","As shown in , a problem with the conventional implementation depicted in  and  arises when two radio-platforms, e.g. the LTE platform (which supports also the incoming PS connections) is acting as modem  and is connected to an existing\/legacy radio access platform , e.g. WCDMA (which only supports outgoing PS connections).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["80","74","70"]},"Hence, and referring to , in a conventional system application  uses connection manager  to trigger PS data connections into network. Triggered by application  with the connection setup request , the connection manager  configures the network signaling (NS) stack  with parameters for the Bearer like QoS, TFT and protocol type. The NS stack  uses the NAS protocol to signal this connection setup request towards the network . If a Resource Allocation was requested (see message ), the network  provides either a Dedicated EPS Bearer or modifies an existing EPS Bearer. This mechanism shown in  is suitable for handling so-called outgoing connections. Further messages in this context (ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER EVENT , ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT , BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION RESPONSE , and CONNECTION STATUS INFORMATION message ) are shown as well.","This concept works fine for e.g. existing\/legacy WCDMA radio access platforms where only this type of connections had to be supported. However it is no longer sufficient for future systems as PS data connections can also be triggered by the network :\n\n","The messages used in  and  are based on NAS signaling between NS stack  and Network . All other communications are for illustration only but not based on any specific protocol.","It is an object of the invention to enable a flexible interconnection between different radio access platforms.","In order to achieve the object defined above, a node for communication within a communication system, a communication arrangement for communication within a communication system, a method executed by a node which supports incoming packet switched connections, a computer program adapted to perform such a method, and a computer-readable medium product comprising such computer programs according to the independent claims are provided.","According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a node for communication within a communication system is provided. The node comprises a network signaling stack and is adapted for serving as a first radio access platform which supports incoming packet switched connections. The node is further adapted for interconnecting to a second radio access platform (which, in an embodiment, may host the application) which supports outgoing packet switched connections (particularly supports only outgoing packet switched connections, but in an embodiment does not support incoming packet switched connections), and for commissioning incoming packet switched connections. The second radio access platform may be located on a further node.","According to another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a communication arrangement for communication within a communication system is provided, the communication arrangement comprising a node having the above mentioned features. The communication arrangement further comprises a further node adapted for performing connection management, the further node being adapted for being interconnected to the first radio access platform which supports incoming packet switched connections and which commissions an incoming packet switched connection. The further node is also adapted for serving as the second radio access platform which supports (particularly only) outgoing packet switched connections.","According to yet another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a method executed by a node comprising a network signaling stack and serving as a first radio access platform which supports incoming packet switched connections is provided. The node is adapted for interconnecting to a second radio access platform which supports (particularly only) outgoing packet switched connections. The method comprises commissioning of an incoming packet switched connection by the node.","According to still another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a computer program is provided comprising code adapted to perform the step of the above method having the above mentioned features when loaded into a processing unit of a node.","According to yet another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a computer-readable medium product is provided which comprises at least one computer program having the above mentioned features.","Embodiments of the present invention also concern computer programs comprising portions of software codes in order to implement the method as described above when operated at a respective device. A computer program can be stored on a computer readable medium. A computer-readable medium can be a permanent or rewritable memory within a respective device or located externally. A computer program can be also transferred to a respective device for example via a cable or a wireless link as a sequence of signals.","Data processing which may be performed according to embodiments of the invention can be realized by a computer program, that is by software, or by using one or more special electronic optimization circuits, that is in hardware, or in hybrid form, that is by means of software components and hardware components.","The term \u201cnode\u201d may particularly denote any communication device, for instance a transmitter\/receiver device (transceiver), which allows for an exchange of communication messages with a communication partner over a communication system or network. Such a node may particularly be a wireless communication device, i.e. a communication device which communicates without the necessity of wires. However, wire-based communication may be also possible. A node may have processing resources, storage resources, and message transmitting\/receiving resources.","The term \u201cnetwork signaling stack\u201d may be denoted as a functional entity allowing the node to communicate with a communicatively connected network such as a telecommunications network. It may include a protocol stack such as a layered set of protocols which work together to provide a set of network functions.","The term \u201cradio access platform\u201d may particularly denote a platform, scheme or entity allowing for a communication in accordance with a dedicated radio access technology (for instance GPRS, EDGE, WCDMA, eHSPA, CDMA). Radio access technology may indicate a type of radio technology to access a core network. In the context of exemplary embodiments, the first radio access platform may be different from the second radio access platform, i.e. different radio access platforms may be combined in one communication arrangement.","The term \u201cpacket switching\u201d may be denoted as a network communications method that groups all transmitted data, irrespective of content, type, or structure and to suitably sized blocks, called packets. A network over which packets are transmitted may be denoted as a shared network which routes each packet independently from all others and allocates transmission resources as needed. When traversing network adapters, switches and other network nodes, packets may be buffered and queued.","The term \u201cincoming packet switched connection\u201d may particularly denote that, from a perspective of a user equipment, no application has triggered the establishment of a packet switched connection. In other words, a corresponding request can be received by the user equipment without an explicit trigger by the application, i.e. from an external entity.","Accordingly, the term \u201coutgoing packet switched connections\u201d may particularly denote that, from a perspective of a user equipment, an application is the initiator of the establishment of a packet switched connection.","The term \u201ccommissioning\u201d may particularly denote managing a packet switched (PS) connection, which may also include accomplishing and\/or accepting the establishment of such a PS connection from a network. In other words, commissioning a PS connection may include handling the establishment of such a PS connection.","In order to overcome at least some of the above mentioned problems, an embodiment of the present invention interconnects a radio access platform acting as modem and supporting incoming PS connections (outgoing PS connections may or may not be supported by this radio access platform), with another radio access platform that supports only outgoing PS connections (but not incoming PS connections). In the context of this interconnection, the radio access platform acting as modem and supporting incoming PS connections may commission incoming PS connections. According to embodiments of the invention, a system is provided to perform a commission of the incoming PS connection not in the functional instance that performs the connection management, which typically resides on the platform that hosts an application, but to implement the commission of the incoming PS connections on the platform that supports the incoming PS connections, e.g. a LTE modem. Such an embodiment may have the advantage of providing a common interface towards applications for IP bearer and management independent of an active RAT (GPRS, EDGE, WCDMA, HSPA, LTE, or other RATs). Furthermore, it may enable the reuse, e.g. for LTE, of existing legacy applications that currently are working, e.g. for pre-release 7 WCDMA.","In the following, further exemplary embodiments of the node will be explained. However, these embodiments also apply to the communication arrangement, to the method, to the computer program and to the computer-readable medium product.","In an embodiment, the node serving as a first radio access platform which supports incoming packet switched connections may be free of hosting an application, i.e. does not host an application. In contrast to this, a further node serving as a second radio access platform which supports only outgoing packet switched connections may host such an application.","In an embodiment, the first radio access platform may be a Long Term Evolution (LTE) platform. LTE is standardized in 3GPP. By providing the node compatible with LTE, it is possible to operate this node in combination with another node lacking LTE capability but having, for instance, pre-release 7 WCDMA capability, so that such a WCDMA compatible node can be reused without changes.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the second radio access platform may be a legacy platform. The term \u201clegacy platform\u201d in particularly denotes any NS stack or radio access technology platform that deploys outgoing packet switched connections only. Thus, it can be considered as an already existing technology that continues to be used, for instance because it still functions for users needs, even though newer technology (particularly LTE technology) is available.","However, the further node using the second radio access technology may support General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), evolved High Speed Packet Access (eHSPA), etc. Also platforms related to applications provided by a personal computer may be such legacy applications.","In an embodiment, the node may be adapted for completely commissioning of an incoming packet switched connection. In other words, the node alone may include the entire functionality required for providing the commissioning of the incoming package switched connection. The node may serve as the controlling entity which provides other entities with commands with regard to the commissioning. Therefore, in such an embodiment, no further entity is required to provide capability or resources for such commissioning tasks. Thus, all the commissioning services may be centered at the described node.","In an embodiment, the node may be adapted for commissioning of an incoming packet switched connection(s) without simultaneously performing an association towards an application hosted by the second radio access platform. \u201cPerforming an association towards an application\u201d may particularly denote taking an action which is related to commissioning of packet switched connection(s) and which involves the application in this procedure. In other words, the application is not linked to any communication relating to the commissioning in an introductory phase. In a later phase, the application may be involved in the communication. In an embodiment, such an application may be located not at the node performing the commissioning, but at a further node which may also comprise a connection manager. It may be possible to preserve incoming connections in the node, particularly (but not necessarily) in a network signaling stack thereof, until a request from the connection manager for this specific connection is received.","The node may further be adapted for performing an association towards an application hosted by the second radio access platform in response to a receipt of a connection setup request from the application. In other words, although initiation of the commissioning does not require that the node involves a further node providing the application, receipt of a connection setup request from the application may be a trigger for the node to respond to such a received message. When the connection manager of the further node has received such a response from the node, it may confirm acceptance to the node and may send the response also to the application of the further node.","However, still referring to the previously described embodiment, the node may be adapted for performing the association in response to the receipt of the connection setup request only after a successful (previous) check of all known network connections. Such a check may determine whether requested connection parameters match to an existing network connection. Thus, when a connection request is received, the node may first check all known network connections (i.e. EPS bearers) whether the requested connection parameters (for instance IP address, port number, quality of service, etc.) match to an existing network connection. If so, it may link the application connection request to the corresponding modem network connection.","Still referring to the previously described embodiment, the node may further be adapted for\u2014after a non-successful check of all known network connections with regard to the question whether requested connection parameters match to an existing network connection\u2014requesting a new connection to a communicatively connected network and establishing an outgoing packet switched connection. Thus, if the analysis yields the result that the requested connection parameters do not match to an existing network connection, the modem may request a new connection (for instance EPS bearer) towards the network. An outgoing packet switching connection may be established in such a case.","The node may be adapted for acting as a modem. The term \u201cmodem\u201d may be denoted as an entity used to modulate digital information so that it can be carried via an analog carrier. The signal may be then demodulated at a receiver end to extract the original digital data. The term modem originates from modulator and demodulator.","The node may be, or may be part of, a mobile communication device, a portable communication device, a mobile terminal, a mobile phone, a data card, a Personal Digital Assistant, a personal computer, a laptop, etc. The term \u201cmobile communication terminal\u201d may particularly denote any user equipment (UE). Hence, portable or stationary communication devices can be operated in accordance with the disclosed architecture of exemplary embodiments.","For instance, the node may be implemented for use in the context of telecommunications, particularly as a mobile phone or a part thereof.","Next, further exemplary embodiments of the communication arrangement will be explained. However, these embodiments also apply to the node, to the method, to the computer program and to the computer-readable medium product.","The further node may be adapted for hosting an application. An application may denote any instance which uses a service (e.g. connection setup, connection teardown, etc.) of a connection manager.","Moreover, the further node may comprise a connection manager. Such a connection management utility may be a piece of software or hardware that manages the activities and features of a network connection.","An application block and a connection manager block may form part of a user equipment, for instance a pre-release 7 WCDMA user equipment or any other legacy user equipment. Every platform that supports outgoing connections may be such a legacy user equipment.","In the following, further exemplary embodiments of the method will be explained. However, these embodiments also apply to the node, to the communication arrangement, to the computer program and to the computer-readable medium product.","The method may further comprise receiving a request from a communicatively coupled network to activate a dedicated packet switched domain. In an embodiment, such a request may be denoted as an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST. Furthermore, in response to the received request, the method may comprise sending, by the node, a response to the communicatively coupled network to activate the dedicated packet switched domain. In an embodiment, such a response may also be denoted as an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT. Participation of an application in the communication process may be initiated later. The network may allow for a communicative connection to any communication party such as a base station, a further user equipment, a computer, etc.","Furthermore, in an embodiment, the method may comprise\u2014particularly succeeding the previously mentioned method steps\u2014receiving a request from the second radio access platform to setup a connection and, in response to the received request, sending a response to the second radio access platform to setup the connection. The received request may also be denoted as a connection setup request, whereas the sent response may also be denoted as a connection setup response.","The aspects defined above and further aspects of the invention are apparent from the examples of embodiment to be described hereinafter and are explained with reference to these examples of embodiment.","The illustration in the drawing is schematically. In different drawings, similar or identical elements may be provided with the same reference signs.","To simplify the description, exemplarily the LTE network signaling stack will be mentioned in the following as representative for a radio access technology that supports an incoming packet switched connection. The scope of exemplary embodiments of the invention applies for all radio access technologies which are supporting incoming packet switched connection. In the following, the handling of incoming LTE Network connections, i.e. incoming EPS Bearer, will be described exemplarily.","In the following, referring to , a communication system  according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention will be explained.","The communication system  comprises a network  such as a telecommunication network.

This table is forwarded to a handover module (HOM) which translates this mapping table into separate setup connection requests towards the connection manager. Additionally the HOM informs the NS stack about all Bearer IDs which will be received from network during HO. In each setup connection request towards the connection manager a specific Bearer ID and\u2014a specific Packet Filter ID\u2014is passed by HOM. Also the information, if a Default Bearer, Dedicated Bearer or an SDF is requested should be contained in the request. The connection manager forwards this request to the NS stack. As the NS has been informed about the Bearer IDs that will arrive due to HO, it can match the Bearer ID provided with the connect request message of the connection manager.

In this case the NS Stack has to process the NAS container instead of reacting on several Bearer Activation\/Context Modify messages.","Modifications and other embodiments of the disclosed invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
