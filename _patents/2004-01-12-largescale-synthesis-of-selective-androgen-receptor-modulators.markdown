The government may have certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to a synthetic process for the preparation of a novel class of androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which demonstrate androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. The agents define a new subclass of compounds, which are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in mood and cognition; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity and endometriosis, d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen replacement; g) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; h) treatment and\/or prevention of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); i) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell; j) treatment and\/or prevention of cancers of female sexual organs such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","The androgen receptor (\u201cAR\u201d) is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids, which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair pattern (Matsumoto, Endocrinol. Met. Clin. N. Am. 23:857-75 (1994)). The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (\u201cDHT\u201d). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions (Zhou, et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 9:208-18 (1995)). Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone, such as the cypionate, propionate, phenylpropionate, cyclopentylpropionate, isocarporate, enanthate, and decanoate esters, and other synthetic androgens such as 7-Methyl-Nortestosterone (\u201cMENT\u201d) and its acetate ester (Sundaram et al., \u201c7 Alpha-Methyl-Nortestosterone(MENT): The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception,\u201d Ann. Med., 25:199-205 (1993) (\u201cSundaram\u201d)). Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.","Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma, religious implications, and, most certainly, significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices, historically, society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits, women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices, from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options, such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However, to date, the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use, however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity, the interruption in sexual spontaneity, and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men, particularly long-term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior to a sexual act, such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.","Administration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressing and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (Steinberger et al., \u201cEffect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone Levels: A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive, Fertility and Sterility 28:1320-28 (1977)). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very low level (oligospermia). The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However, a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia (i.e., less than 3 million sperm per ml) and infertility in 98% of men receiving therapy (World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility, \u201cContraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone-Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men,\u201d Fertility and Sterility 65:821-29 (1996)).","A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception, it has several drawbacks, including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection (Wu, \u201cEffects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men: Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study,\u201d Fertility and Sterility 65:626-36 (1996)).","Steroidal ligands which bind the AR and act as androgens (e.g. testosterone enanthate) or as antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have been known for many years and are used clinically (Wu 1988). Although nonsteroidal antiandrogens are in clinical use for hormone-dependent prostate cancer, nonsteroidal androgens have not been reported. For this reason, research on androgens useful for male contraception and hormone replacement has focused solely on steroidal compounds.","Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One approach to this problem is to find prostate cancer earlier through screening programs and thereby reduce the number of advanced prostate cancer patients. Another strategy, however, is to develop drugs to prevent prostate cancer. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer. Thus, the development of treatment and preventative strategies against prostate cancer may have the greatest overall impact both medically and economically against prostate cancer.","\u201cBPH (benign prostate hyperplasia)\u201d is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland, and is the most common non-malignant proliferative abnormality found in any internal organ and the major cause of morbidity in the adult male. BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade. BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experience a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to empty urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure.","Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.","Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However, osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength, and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex hormones in non-reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood, but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life cycle. Consequently, when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males, the natural decline in sex hormones at maturity (direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens) is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.","Androgen decline in the aging male (ADAM) refers to a progressive decrease in androgen production, common in males after middle age. The syndrome is characterized by alterations in the physical and intellectual domains that correlate with and can be corrected by manipulation of the androgen milieu. ADAM is characterized biochemically by a decrease not only in serum androgen, but also in other hormones, such as growth hormone, melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone. Clinical manifestations include fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, anemia, and alterations in mood and cognition.","Androgen Deficiency in Female (ADIF) refers to a variety of hormone-related conditions including, common in females after middle age. The syndrome is characterized by sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, anemia, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, and endometriosis. In addition, female sex-organ cancers such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer are hormone related.","Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and\/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle. The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation. Protein degradation occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein degradation, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. Muscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy, In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism. Muscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, poor performance status and susceptibility to injury.","New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to develop compounds which are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in mood and cognition; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity and endometriosis, d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen replacement; g) treatment and\/or prevention of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); i) treatment and\/or prevention of cancers of female sexual organs such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","Tucker et al ((1988), 31, 885-887; and (1988), 31, 954-959) discloses the synthesis and resolution of 4\u2032cyano-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulphonyl)[-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3\u2032-(trifluoromethyl) propionamide (bicalutamide), a non-steroidal antiandrogen useful in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Tucker (U.S. Pat. No. 4,636,505) discloses N-(substituted phenyl)-3-alkyl-, aryl- and heteroarylsulfonyl-2-hydroxy-2-alkyl- and haloalkylpropanamide compounds, methods for their preparation, and their utility in the treatment of malignant or benign prostatic disease or of androgen dependent disease conditions. Kirkovsky et al ((2000), 43, 581-590) discloses the synthesis of chiral non-steroidal affinity ligands which are bicalutamide analogues bearing electrophillic groups in the B aromatic ring. Miller et al (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,160,011 and 6,071,957) discloses the non-steroidal agonist compounds, their preparation and their use in male hormone therapy and in the treatment of prostate cancer. These references all teach methods of preparing non-steroidal agonist compounds having a thio, sulfoxide or sulfone linkage. In addition, the processes disclosed in these references are not suitable for large-scale preparation, since one or more of the steps result in mixtures of products, and thus involve purification procedures which ultimately result in a lower yield.","There is a need in the art to develop synthetic methods for the synthesis of non-steroidal agonist compounds, that can be used for large-scale synthesis, and that provide highly pure products in high yield.","In one embodiment, present invention relates to a synthetic process for the preparation of a novel class of androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which demonstrate androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.

Thus the present invention provides methods for the synthesis of non-steroidal agonist compounds, that can be used for industrial large-scale synthesis, and that provide highly pure products in high yield.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compound represented by the structure of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0022"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"22.86mm","wi":"66.29mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["X is O, NH, Se, PR, or NR;","T is OH, OR, NHCOCH, or NHCOR;","Z is NO, CN, COOH, COR, NHCOR or CONHR;","Y is CF, F, I, Br, Cl, CN, CRor SnR;","Q is alkyl, halogen, CF, CN CR, SnR, NR, NHCOCH, NHCOCF, NHCOR, NHCONHR, NHCOOR, OCONHR, CONHR, NHCSCH, NHCSCF, NHCSR NHSOCH, NHSOR, OR, COR, OCOR, OSOR, SOR, SR; or Q together with the benzene ring to which it is attached is a fused ring system represented by structure A, B or C:"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0028"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00005","num":"00005"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00005","he":"82.13mm","wi":"51.73mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00005.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["R is alkyl, haloalkyl, dihaloalkyl, trihaloalkyl, CHF, CHF, CF, CFCF, aryl, phenyl, halogen, alkenyl or OH; and","Ris CH, CHF, CHF, CF, CHCH, or CFCF;"]}}}},"the process comprising the steps of:","coupling an amide of formula II:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0033"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"22.86mm","wi":"57.49mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Z, Y Rand T are as defined above and L is a leaving group,","with a compound of formula III:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0036"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00007","num":"00007"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00007","he":"14.90mm","wi":"50.29mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00007.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Q and X are as defined above, thereby producing the compound of formula I; and","purifying the compound of formula I using a mixture of alcohol and water.","In one embodiment, the coupling step is carried out in the presence of a base.

In another embodiment, the SARM compound has in-vivo androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.","The novel selective androgen receptor modulator compounds of the present invention, either alone or as a pharmaceutical composition, are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in mood and cognition; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity and endometriosis, d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; g) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; h) treatment and\/or prevention of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); i) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell; j) treatment and\/or prevention of cancers of female sexual organs such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","The selective androgen receptor modulator compounds of the present invention offer a significant advancement over steroidal androgen treatment because the selective androgen receptor modulator compounds of the present invention have been shown in-vivo to have an androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. Thus, the selective androgen receptor modulator compounds have an androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor and will not be accompanied by serious side effects, inconvenient modes of administration, or high costs and still have the advantages of oral bioavailability, lack of cross-reactivity with other steroid receptors, and long biological half-lives.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a synthetic process for the preparation of a novel class of androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which demonstrate androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. The agents define a new subclass of compounds which are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM) which are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in mood and cognition; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity and endometriosis, d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen replacement; g) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; h) treatment and\/or prevention of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); i) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell; j) treatment and\/or prevention of cancers of female sexual organs such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","In copending U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/277,108, assigned to the Assignees of the present invention, Applicants disclose a process for preparing selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compounds. In the disclosed process, the SARM product is purified by using hexane as the purification solvent. However, hexane is known to be neurotoxic, as it is rapidly metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione. Thus, any residual solvents left after the synthesis could result in undesirable toxicity upon administration of the SARM compound.","As demonstrated herein, Applicants have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that when the purification step of the SARM compounds is carried out in the presence of a nontoxic organic solvent and water, such as ethanol and water, for example by recrystallization from a mixture of ethanol and water, a highly pure product with excellent crystal stability is obtained in high yields. In addition, the use of a nontoxic organic solvent\/water for purification is safe and cheap, and avoids any biological hazards that may arise from the use of toxic organic solvents such as hexane. In one embodiment, the nontoxic organic solvent is ethanol.","Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a synthetic process for preparing the SARM compounds described herein, which involves a purification step comprising crystallization of the SARM product using a mixture of a nontoxic organic solvent and water. In one embodiment, the nontoxic organic solvent is ethanol. In a particular embodiment, the crystallization step comprises mixing an ethanol solution comprising the SARM compound with water, so as to crystallize the SARM compound. In a further embodiment, the process further comprises the step of collecting the SARM compound by filtration.","The process of the present invention is suitable for large-scale preparation, since all of the steps give rise to highly pure compounds, thus avoiding complicated purification procedures which ultimately lower the yield. Thus the present invention provides methods for the synthesis of non-steroidal agonist compounds, that can be used for industrial large-scale synthesis, and that provide highly pure products in high yield. In addition, the methods described by the present invention utilize safe, environmentally friendly and cheap reagents and purification steps, thus avoiding any undesirable toxicological issues that may arise from the use of toxic, environmentally unfriendly or biologically unstable reagents.","It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that any nontoxic organic solvent is suitable in the methods of the present invention, for example alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, aromatic compounds such as toluene and xylene, DMSO, THF, ethyl acetate, methyl-t-butyl ether, heptane, cyclohexane and the like. In addition, any combination of such solvents is suitable for use in the methods of the present invention, such as ethyl acetate\/heptane, tetrahyrofuran (THF)\/Heptane, ethyl acetate\/methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE), THF\/MTBE and the like.","In one embodiment, the nontoxic organic solvent is ethanol. Any grade and purity level of ethanol is suitable. In one embodiment, the ethanol is neat ethanol. In another embodiment, the ethanol is an ethanol solution that contains denaturants, such as toluene, methanol and the like. For example, a suitable ethanol grade, is ethanol containing the denaturants toluene (5%), methanol (5%, 10%), isopropanol (5%), ethyl acetate (1%, 4%), acetone (7%), gasoline or any combination of such denaturants.","Accordingly, In one embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compound represented by the structure of formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0095"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00023","num":"00023"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00023","he":"22.86mm","wi":"66.29mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00023.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0030","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0030-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0031","list-style":"none"},"li":["X is O, NH, Se, PR, or NR;","T is OH, OR, NHCOCH, or NHCOR;","Z is NO, CN, COOH, COR, NHCOR or CONHR;","Y is CF, F, I, Br, Cl, CN, CRor SnR;","Q is alkyl, halogen, CF, CN CR, SnR, NR, NHCOCH, NHCOCF, NHCOR, NHCONHR, NHCOOR, OCONHR, CONHR, NHCSCH, NHCSCF, NHCSR NHSOCH, NHSOR, OR, COR, OCOR, OSOR, SOR, SR; or Q together with the benzene ring to which it is attached is a fused ring system represented by structure A, B or C:"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0101"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00024","num":"00024"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00024","he":"82.13mm","wi":"51.73mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00024.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0032","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0032-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0033","list-style":"none"},"li":["R is alkyl, haloalkyl, dihaloalkyl, trihaloalkyl, CHF, CHF, CF, CFCF, aryl, phenyl, halogen, alkenyl or OH; and","Ris CH, CHF, CHF, CF, CHCH, or CFCF;"]}}}},"the process comprising the steps of:","coupling an amide of formula II:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0106"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00025","num":"00025"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00025","he":"22.86mm","wi":"57.49mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00025.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0034","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0034-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0035","list-style":"none"},"li":"wherein Z, Y Rand T are as defined above and L is a leaving group, with a compound of formula III:"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0108"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00026","num":"00026"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00026","he":"14.90mm","wi":"50.29mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00026.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Q and X are as defined above, thereby producing the compound of formula I; and","purifying the compound of formula I using a mixture of alcohol and water.","In one embodiment, the alcohol is ethanol.

The term \u201cpolymorph\u201d refers to a particular crystalline state of a substance, having particular physical properties such as X-ray diffraction, IR spectra, melting point, and the like.","Biological Activity of Selective Androgen Modulator Compounds","The processes provided herein are useful in the preparation of a new subclass of compounds which are selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM). Several appropriately substituted SARMS have an unexpected in-vivo activity for an androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. Further, appropriately substituted compounds are effective to treat prostate cancer and useful for imaging of prostate cancer.","As contemplated herein, the appropriately substituted SARM compounds of the present invention are useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and alterations in mood and cognition; c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF), such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity and endometriosis, d) treatment and\/or prevention of chronic muscular wasting; e) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer; f) oral androgen replacement; g) preventing and\/or treating dry eye conditions; h) treatment and\/or prevention of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH); i) inducing apoptosis in a cancer cell; j) treatment and\/or prevention of cancers of female sexual organs such as breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; and\/or other clinical therapeutic and\/or diagnostic areas.","As used herein, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are collectively referred to as \u201ccell signaling receptors\u201d. Many cell signaling receptors are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface; when they bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), they become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell. As used herein, these receptors are collectively referred to as \u201cintracellular cell signaling receptors\u201d.","Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glucocorticoid type O receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.","In addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration.","The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cells, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction). As a result, substances can be made which bind receptors and activate them (called receptor agonists) or inactivate them (called receptor antagonists). Examples of non-steroidal agonist are described in PCT International Patent Application Number PCT\/US98\/11020, International filing date May 28, 1998.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to processes for preparing selective androgen receptor modulator compounds which are agonist compounds. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and activating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the agonist compound of the present invention is an agonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the agonist compound also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the present invention provides selective androgen modulator compounds which have agonistic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal compound for the androgen receptor.","In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to processes for preparing selective androgen receptor modulator compounds which are antagonist compounds. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and inactivating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the antagonist compound of the present invention is an antagonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the antagonist compound also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds are alkylating agents.","In yet another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist\/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, and cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as inhibitors at the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.","Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and\/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.","The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.","In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone. An \u201calkylating agent\u201d is defined herein as an agent which alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or protein. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for binding the SARM compounds of the present invention to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a SARM compound and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the selective androgen receptor modulator compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the selective androgen receptor modulator compounds to the androgen receptor enables the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for suppressing spermatogenesis in a subject by contacting an androgen receptor of the subject with a SARM compound of the present invention and\/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt,

and effect a change in an androgen-dependent condition.","Androgen-dependent conditions which may be treated according to the present invention include those conditions which are associated with aging, such as hypogonadism, sarcopenia, erythropoiesis, osteoporosis, and any other conditions later determined to be dependent upon low androgen (e.g., testosterone) levels.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for treating a subject suffering from prostate cancer, comprising the step of administering to the subject a SARM compound of the present

This is a term which encompasses all skeletal systems in which such a condition is noted.","\u201cOsteoporosis\u201d refers to a thinning of the bones with reduction in bone mass due to depletion of calcium and bone protein. Osteoporosis predisposes a person to fractures, which are often slow to heal and heal poorly. Unchecked osteoporosis can lead to changes in posture, physical abnormality, and decreased mobility.","\u201cCognition\u201d refers to the process of knowing, specifically the process of being aware, knowing, thinking, learning and judging. Cognition is related to the fields of psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, mathematics, ethology and philosophy. The term \u201cmood\u201d refers to a temper or state of the mind. As contemplated herein, alterations means any change for the positive or negative, in cognition and\/or mood.","The term \u201cdepression\u201d refers to an illness that involves the body, mood and thoughts, that affects the way a person eats, sleeps and the way one feels about oneself, and thinks about things.

Baldness typically begins with patch hair loss on the scalp and sometimes progresses to complete baldness and even loss of body hair. Hair loss affects both males and females.","\u201cAnemia\u201d refers to the condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased. Persons with anemia may feel tired and fatigue easily, appear pale, develop palpitations and become usually short of breath. Anemia is caused by four basic factors: a) hemorrhage (bleeding); b) hemolysis (excessive destruction of red blood cells), c) underproduction of red blood cells; and d) not enough normal hemoglobin. There are many forms of anemia, including aplastic anemia, benzene poisoning, Fanconi anemia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, hereditary spherocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, osteoporosis, pernicious anemia, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and a variety of bone marrow diseases. As contemplated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and\/or treating any one or more of the above-listed forms of anemia.","\u201cObesity\u201d refers to the state of being well above one's normal weight. Traditionally, a person is considered to be obese if they are more than 20 percent over their ideal weight. Obesity has been more precisely defined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) as a Body to Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or above. Obesity is often multifactorial, based on both genetic and behavioral factors. Overweight due to obesity is a significant contributor to health problems. It increases the risk of developing a number of diseases including: Type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes; high blood pressure (hypertension); stroke (cerebrovascular accident or CVA); heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI); heart failure (congestive heart failure); cancer (certain forms such as cancer of the prostate and cancer of the colon and rectum); gallstones and gallbladder disease (cholecystitis); Gout and gouty arthritis; osteoarthritis (degenerative arthritis) of the knees, hips, and the lower back; sleep apnea (failure to breath normally during sleep, lowering blood oxygen); and Pickwickian syndrome (obesity, red face, underventilation and drowsiness). As contemplated herein, the term \u201cobesity\u201d includes any one of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases. Thus the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in preventing and\/or treating obesity and any one or more of the above-listed obesity-related conditions and diseases.","\u201cProstate cancer\u201d is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis. One third of all men over 50 years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50s (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer.","In one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are administered as the sole active ingredient. However, also encompassed within the scope of the present invention are methods for hormone therapy, for treating prostate cancer, for delaying the progression of prostate cancer, and for preventing and\/or treating the recurrence of prostate cancer, which comprise administering the SARM compounds in combination with one or more therapeutic agents.

Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.","In yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990).","The compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance.","Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.","Also comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.","The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient.

Finally, the improvements in Step 5 include the use of ethanol\/water for the purification of the final SARM compound.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0234","num":"0290"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00058","num":"00058"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00058","he":"96.77mm","wi":"74.25mm","file":"US07968721-20110628-C00058.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"A 12 L flask was set up with a triblade propeller style mechanical stirrer, inlet for inert atmosphere, and cooling bath. The flask was placed under an argon atmosphere and was charged with 1250 g (3.37 moles) of R-132 and 5.0 L of anhydrous THF. 416.8 g (3.71 moles) of 4-fluorophenol and 2008.9 g (6.17 moles) of cesium carbonate were charged to the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was heated to 50\u00b0 C. with vigorous mixing. The reaction was monitored HPLC. The reaction was complete when the HPLC showed that the starting material (R-132) was less than 5% after 3 hours at 50\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was filtered and the wet cake washed with THF (2.5 L). The product was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. 2.5 L of ethanol was charged to the rotary evaporator and the solvent was removed to remove all the THF. 6.25 L of ethanol was used to transfer the material in the rotary evaporator to a 22 L flask. Deionized water (12 L) was slowly charged to the flask to precipitate the product. The mixture was stirred for 16 hours and filtered to collect the bright yellow product. The wet cake was washed with water (2.5 L). The wet cake was charged to the rotary evaporator and 6.25 L of ethanol was charged and warmed to dissolve the product. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 micron filter into a clean 22 liter flask. Deionized water (6.25 L) was slowly filtered through the 0.2 micron filter to the flask to precipitate the product. The mixture was stirred for 17 hours and filtered to collect the product. The wet cake was washed with water (1.25 L). The wet cake was charged back to the flask and 6.25 L of deionized water was filtered through the 0.2 micron filter into the flask. The mixture was stirred for 23 hours and filtered to collect the product. The product was dried in a vacuum oven at 25\u00b0 C. The yield was 1128 g (83% yield).","It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove.
