{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to block copolymer-based adhesives. Particularly, acrylic modified, block copolymer pressure sensitive adhesives.","Adhesives and tapes are commonly used to bond two substrates together to form a bonded composite. While a vast array of adhesives and tapes are available, advances in substrates and end use requirements continues to drive a need for new adhesive formulations and tape constructions. In addition to performance properties, environmental regulations and processing costs also influence product formulation requirements. For example, in some applications it may be desirable to use a hot melt adhesive rather than a solvent-based adhesive.","While some efforts are directed at the identification and development of new materials for use in adhesive formulations, much progress can still be made by identifying, selecting, and combining the proper proportions of existing raw materials to arrive at useful adhesives and tapes.","Briefly, in one aspect, the present disclosure provides a pressure sensitive adhesive composition comprising 92 to 99.9 parts of a block copolymer adhesive composition and 0.1 to less than 10 parts of an acrylic adhesive composition.

As used herein, the term \u201clow glass transition temperature tackifier\u201d refers to a tackifier having a glass transition temperature of less than 60\u00b0 C. Exemplary low Tg tackifiers include polybutenes.","Generally, a plasticizer is compatible with one or more blocks of the linear block copolymer, and\/or one or more blocks of the multi-arm block copolymer. Generally, a plasticizer that is compatible with a block will be miscible with that block and will lower the Tg of that block. Exemplary plasticizers include naphthenic oils, liquid polybutene resins, polyisobutylene resins, and liquid isoprene polymers.","In some embodiments, the ratio of multi-arm block copolymers to linear block copolymers ranges from 1.5:1 to 9:1.

In some embodiments, the ratio of the rubbery block compatible high Tg tackifier to the glassy block compatible high Tg tackifier is at least 1.25:1, or even at least 1.5:1. In some embodiments the ratio of the rubbery block compatible high Tg tackifier to the glassy block compatible high Tg tackifier is no greater than 4:1, or even no greater than 3:1.","In some embodiments, the ratio of the combination of the block copolymers and high Tg tackifiers to the acrylate component is at least 8.3:1.

As used herein, a hot melt adhesive is a polymer or blended polymeric material with a melt viscosity profile such that it can be coated on a substrate or carrier in a thin layer at a process temperature significantly above normal room temperature, but retains useful pressure-sensitive adhesive characteristics at room temperature.","The pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions of the present invention can be made using methods known in the art. For example, they can be made by dissolving the block copolymers, suitable tackifiers, any plasticizer(s), and any other additives in a suitable solvent, and coating onto a substrate (e.g., release liner, tape backing, core, or panel) using conventional means (e.g., knife coating, roll coating, gravure coating, rod coating, curtain coating, spray coating, air knife coating).

Discreet film packages were formed from a packaging film (0.0635 mm thick ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer film sold as VA-24 Film from CT Film, Dallas, Tex.). The AP-1 composition was sealed into the film packages, which measured approximately 10 centimeters (cm) by 5 cm by 0.5 cm thick. While immersed in a water bath maintained between about 21\u00b0 C. and about 32\u00b0 C., the packages were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation having an intensity of about 3.5 milliWatts per square centimeter (mW\/sq cm), and a total energy of about 1680 milliJoules per square centimeter (mJ\/sq cm) as measured in NIST units. The method of forming the packages and curing are described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,804,610, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Acrylic Polymer 2 (AP-2) was prepared according to the procedure for AP-1, except that 85 parts of 2-EHA; 15 parts of AA; 0.15 parts of IRGACURE 651; and 0.8 part IOTG were used. Similarly, Acrylic Polymer 3 (AP-3) was prepared according to the procedure for Acrylic Polymer 1 except that the composition was 95 parts of 2-EHA; 5 parts of AA; 0.15 part IRGACURE 651; and 0.03 part of IOTG. AP-2 and AP-3 were placed in packages and exposed to UV energy, according to the procedure for AP-1.","First Skin Adhesive","Pressure-sensitive adhesives according to the compositions shown in Table 2 were compounded using a 60 mm, co-rotating twin screw extruder (available from Berstorff), (the \u201cfirst adhesive extruder\u201d). A polymodal, asymmetric star block copolymer (\u201cPASBC\u201d) was prepared according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,393,373, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The polymer had number average molecular weights of about 4,000 Dalton and about 21,500 Dalton for the two endblocks, 127,000-147,000 Dalton for the arm, and about 1,100,000 Dalton for the star measured by SEC (size exclusion chromatography) calibrated using polystyrene standards. The polystyrene content was between 9.5 and 11.5 percent by weight. The mole percentage of high molecular weight arms was estimated to be about 30%.","The polymodal asymmetric block copolymer and a linear styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block copolymer (KRATON 1161-D) were dry fed into the first zone of the first adhesive extruder. Using a roll-feed extruder (available from Berstorff), either acrylic polymer AP-1 and AP-2 was heated and fed into the third zone of the first adhesive extruder.
