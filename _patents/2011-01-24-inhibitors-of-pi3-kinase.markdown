{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT\/GB2011\/000086, filed Jan. 24, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to novel pharmaceutically-useful compounds, which compounds are useful as inhibitors of protein or lipid kinases (such as inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3\u2032OH kinase (PI3 kinase) family, particularly the PI3K class I sub-type. The compounds may also be useful as inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)). The compounds are of potential utility in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds as medicaments, to the use of such compounds for in vitro, in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells (or associated pathological conditions), to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to synthetic routes for their production.","The malfunctioning of protein kinases (PKs) is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share of the oncogenes and proto-oncogenes involved in human cancers code for PKs. The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis. PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. PKs may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders.","For a general reference to PKs malfunctioning or disregulation see, for instance, 1999, 3, 459-465.","Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid and serine\/threonine kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the 3\u2032-OH of the inositol ring to produce phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphoinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP) and phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP), which act as recruitment sites for various intracellular signalling proteins, which in turn form signalling complexes to relay extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. These 3\u2032-phosphoinositide subtypes function as second messengers in intracellular signal transduction pathways (see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci 22 87, 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al.; Chem. Rev. 101 (8), 2365-80 (2001) by Leslie et al (2001); Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Boil. 17, 615-75 (2001) by Katso et al; and Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 59 (5), 761-79 (2002) by Toker et al).","Multiple PI3K isoforms categorized by their catalytic subunits, their regulation by corresponding regulatory subunits, expression patterns and signalling specific funtions (p110\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3) perform this enzymatic reaction (Exp. Cell. Res. 25 (1), 239-54 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck and Katso et al., 2001, above).","The closely related isoforms p110\u03b1 and \u03b2 are ubiquitously expressed, while \u03b4 and \u03b3 are more specifically expressed in the haematopoietic cell system, smooth muscle cells, myocytes and endothelial cells (see e.g. Trends Biochem. Sci. 22 (7), 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al). Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the cellular, tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context. Inductibility of protein expression includes synthesis of protein as well as protein stabilization that is in part regulated by association with regulatory subunits.","Eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified so far, including four class I PI3Ks. Class Ia includes PI3K\u03b1, PI3K\u03b2 and PI3K\u03b4. All of the class Ia enzymes are heterodimeric complexes comprising a catalytic subunit (p100\u03b1, p110\u03b2 or p110\u03b4) associated with an SH2 domain containing p85 adapter subunit. Class Ia PI3Ks are activated through tyrosine kinase signalling and are involved in cell proliferation and survival. PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 have also been implicated in tumorigenesis in a variety of human cancers. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 are useful for treating various types of cancer.","PI3K\u03b3, the only member of the Class Ib PI3Ks, consists of a catalytic subunit p110\u03b3, which is associated with a p110 regulatory subunit. PI3K\u03b3 is regulated by G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) via association with 3\u2032 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. PI3K\u03b3 is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells and cardiomyocytes and is involved in inflammation and mast cell function. Thus, pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K\u03b3 are useful for treating a variety of inflammatory diseases, allergies and cardiovascular diseases.","These observations show that deregulation of phosphoinositol-3-kinase and the upstream and downstream components of this signalling pathway is one of the most common deregulations associated with human cancers and proliferative diseases (see e.g. Parsons et al., Nature 436:792 (2005); Hennessey et al., Nature Rev. Drug Discovery 4: 988-1004 (2005).","The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) also known as FK506 binding protein 12-rapamycin associated protein 1 (FRAP1) is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FRAP1 gene. mTOR is a serine\/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, and transcription. The inhibition of mTORs are believed to be useful for treating various diseases\/conditions, such as cancer (for example, as described in Easton et al. (2006). \u201cmTOR and cancer therapy\u201d. Oncogene 25 (48): 6436-46).","The listing or discussion of an apparently prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.","US patent application US 2009\/0163489 and international patent application WO 2009\/085230 both disclose various molecules containing a 6,5-fused bicyclic core, which may be useful as inhibitors of PI3 kinase (PI3-K).

However, these documents do not relate to such bicycles that are directly substituted with both an aromatic group and a morpholinyl group.","International patent applications WO 2008\/113469 and WO 2009\/007029 disclose various compounds including bicyclic compounds, for use in treating diseases such as haematological diseases. However, these documents do not relate to bicycles that are substituted with a morpholinyl group.","Journal article Chorvat et al., 1999, 42, 833 discloses various bicyclic compounds that may possess biological activity. However, there is no disclosure of 6,5-fused bicycles in which the 6-membered ring is directly substituted with an aromatic group.","International patent application WO 2005\/035532 discloses various triazolopyrazinones that may be useful in the treatment of asthma or another glycogen synthase kinase mediated condition. However, this document only discloses 6,5-bicyclic compounds in which there is a carbonyl group attached to the 5-membered ring.","US patent applications US 2007\/078136 and US 2008\/045536 (and equivalent application WO 2007\/038314) as well as international patent application WO 2008\/116064 both disclose various compounds, including bicycles, which may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory and immune diseases. However, these documents do not predominantly relate to 6,5-fused bicyclic compounds that are substituted with both an aromatic group and a morpholinyl group.","French patent application FR 26661163 discloses various 6,5-fused bicycles, but does not specifically relate to 6,5-bicycles bearing an aromatic group and a morpholinyl group on the 6-membered ring. Nor does this document relate to kinase inhibitors.","International patent application WO 2010\/119264 discloses various imidazopyrazines for use as kinase inhibitors, which imidazopyrazines may be substituted with an aromatic group and a morpholinyl group.

Salts may also be prepared by exchanging a counter-ion of a compound of the invention in the form of a salt with another counter-ion, for example using a suitable ion exchange resin.","By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable ester, amide, solvate or salt thereof\u201d, we include salts of pharmaceutically acceptable esters or amides, and solvates of pharmaceutically acceptable esters, amides or salts. For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides such as those defined herein may be mentioned, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or salts.","Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides of the compounds of the invention are also included within the scope of the invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides of compounds of the invention may be formed from corresponding compounds that have an appropriate group, for example an acid group, converted to the appropriate ester or amide. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable esters (of carboxylic acids of compounds of the invention) that may be mentioned include optionally substituted Calkyl, Caryl and\/or Caryl-Calkyl-esters. Pharmaceutically acceptable amides (of carboxylic acids of compounds of the invention) that may be mentioned include those of the formula \u2014C(O)N(R)R, in which Rand Rindependently represent optionally substituted Calkyl, Caryl, or Caryl-Calkylene-. Preferably, Calkyl groups that may be mentioned in the context of such pharmaceutically acceptable esters and amides are not cyclic, e.g. linear and\/or branched.","Further compounds of the invention that may be mentioned include carbamate, carboxamido or ureido derivatives, e.g. such derivatives of existing amino functional groups.","For the purposes of this invention, therefore, prodrugs of compounds of the invention are also included within the scope of the invention.","The term \u201cprodrug\u201d of a relevant compound of the invention includes any compound that, following oral or parenteral administration, is metabolised in vivo to form that compound in an experimentally-detectable amount, and within a predetermined time (e.g. within a dosing interval of between 6 and 24 hours (i.e. once to four times daily)). For the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201cparenteral\u201d administration includes all forms of administration other than oral administration.","Prodrugs of compounds of the invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present on the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. The modifications typically are achieved by synthesising the parent compound with a prodrug substituent. Prodrugs include compounds of the invention wherein a hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group in a compound of the invention is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group, respectively.","Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters and carbamates of hydroxy functional groups, esters groups of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives and N-Mannich bases. General information on prodrugs may be found e.g. in Bundegaard, H. \u201cDesign of Prodrugs\u201d p. 1-92, Elesevier, New York-Oxford (1985).","Compounds of the invention may contain double bonds and may thus exist as E (entgegen) and Z (zusammen) geometric isomers about each individual double bond. Positional isomers may also be embraced by the compounds of the invention. All such isomers (e.g. if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, the cis- and trans-forms, are embraced) and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention (e.g. single positional isomers and mixtures of positional isomers may be included within the scope of the invention).","Compounds of the invention may also exhibit tautomerism. All tautomeric forms (or tautomers) and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerisations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganisation of some of the bonding electrons.","Compounds of the invention may also contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may therefore exhibit optical and\/or diastereoisomerism. Diastereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The various stereoisomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional, e.g. fractional crystallisation or HPLC, techniques. Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation (i.e. a \u2018chiral pool\u2019 method), by reaction of the appropriate starting material with a \u2018chiral auxiliary\u2019 which can subsequently be removed at a suitable stage, by derivatisation (i.e. a resolution, including a dynamic resolution), for example with a homochiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric derivatives by conventional means such as chromatography, or by reaction with an appropriate chiral reagent or chiral catalyst all under conditions known to the skilled person.","All stereoisomers (including but not limited to diastereoisomers, enantiomers and atropisomers) and mixtures thereof (e.g. racemic mixtures) are included within the scope of the invention.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature (or the most abundant one found in nature). All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified herein are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, O, C, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I, and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and for substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Scheme 1 and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Unless otherwise specified, Calkyl groups (where q is the upper limit of the range) defined herein may be straight-chain or, when there is a sufficient number (i.e. a minimum of two or three, as appropriate) of carbon atoms, be branched-chain, and\/or cyclic (so forming a C-cycloalkyl group).

For example, protected compounds\/intermediates described herein may be converted chemically to unprotected compounds using standard deprotection techniques.","The type of chemistry involved will dictate the need, and type, of protecting groups as well as the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis.","The use of protecting groups is fully described in \u201c3rd edition, T. W. Greene & P. G. M. Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1999).","Medical and Pharmaceutical Uses","Compounds of the invention are indicated as pharmaceuticals. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention, as hereinbefore defined, for use as a pharmaceutical.","Compounds of the invention may inhibit protein or lipid kinases, such as a PI3 kinase (especially a class I PI3K), for example as may be shown in the tests described below (for example, the test for PI3K (inhibition described below) and\/or in tests known to the skilled person. The compounds of the invention may also inhibit mTOR. Thus, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of those disorders in an individual in which the inhibition of such protein or lipid kinases (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR) is desired and\/or required (for instance compounds of the invention may inhibit PI3K, particularly class I PI3K and, optionally, may also inhibit mTOR).","The term \u201cinhibit\u201d may refer to any measurable reduction and\/or prevention of catalytic kinase (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR) activity. The reduction and\/or prevention of kinase activity may be measured by comparing the kinase activity in a sample containing a compound of the invention and an equivalent sample of kinase (e.g. PI3K, particularly class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR) in the absence of a compound of the invention, as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. The measurable change may be objective (e.g. measurable by some test or marker, for example in an in vitro or in vivo assay or test, such as one described hereinafter, or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to those skilled in the art) or subjective (e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect).","Compounds of the invention may be found to exhibit 50% inhibition of a protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR) at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM or below (for example at a concentration of below 50 \u03bcM, or even below 10 \u03bcM, such as below 1 \u03bcM), when tested in an assay (or other test), for example as described hereinafter, or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to the skilled person.","Compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in the treatment of a disorder in which a protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR) is known to play a role and which are characterised by or associated with an overall elevated activity of that kinase (due to, for example, increased amount of the kinase or increased catalytic activity of the kinase). Hence, compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of a disease\/disorder arising from abnormal cell growth, function or behaviour associated with the protein or lipid kinase (e.g. PI3K, such as class I PI3K, and\/or mTOR). Such conditions\/disorders include cancer, immune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, inflammation, metabolism\/endocrine function disorders and neurological disorders.","The disorders\/conditions that the compounds of the invention may be useful in treating hence includes cancer (such as lymphomas, solid tumours or a cancer as described hereinafter), obstructive airways diseases, allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases (such as asthma, allergy and Chrohn's disease), immunosuppression (such as transplantation rejection and autoimmune diseases), disorders commonly connected with organ transplantation, AIDS-related diseases and other associated diseases. Other associated diseases that may be mentioned (particularly due to the key role of kinases in the regulation of cellular proliferation) include other cell proliferative disorders and\/or non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, bone disorders, atherosclerosis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis. Other disease states that may be mentioned include cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, hepatomegaly, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, hormone-related diseases, immunodeficiency disorders, destructive bone disorders, infectious diseases, conditions associated with cell death, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, liver disease, pathologic immune conditions involving T cell activation and CNS disorders.","As stated above, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of cancer.

The enzyme, PI3K (p110\u03b1\/p85\u03b1 was purchased from Carna Biosciences (#07CBS-0402A). The assay was done following the manufacturer recommendations with slight modifications: Mainly the kinase buffer was replace by 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.04% CHAPS, 2 mM TCEP and 0.01 mg\/ml BGG. The PI3K was assayed in a titration experiment to determine the optimal protein concentration for the inhibition assay. To calculate the ICof the ETP-compounds, serial 1:5 dilutions of the compounds were added to the enzyme at a fixed concentration (2.5 \u03bcg\/ml. The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor and 30 \u03bcM PIPsubstrate (P9763, Sigma) for 5 min and then ATP was added to a final 50 \u03bcM concentration. Reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 25\u00b0 C. Reagent A and B were sequentially added to the wells and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. Fluorescence counts were read in a Victor instrument (Perkin Elmer) with the recommended settings (544 and 580 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). Values were normalized against the control activity included for each enzyme (i.e., 100% PI3 kinase activity, without compound). These values were plot against the inhibitor concentration and were fit to a sigmoid dose-response curve by using the Graphad software.","Cellular Mode of Action","Cell Culture","The cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). U20S (human osteosarcoma) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). PC3 (human prostate carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast cardinoma), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), 768-0 (human neuroblastoma), U251 (human glyoblastoma) were grown in RPMI. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and antibiotics-antimycotics. Cell were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COand passaged when confluent using trypsin\/EDTA.","U2foxRELOC and U2nesRELOC Assay","The U2nesRELOC assay and the U2foxRELOC assay have been described previously (1, 2). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1.0\u00d710cells\/ml into black-wall clear-bottom 96-well microplates (BD Biosciences) After incubation at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% COfor 12 hours, 2 \u03bcl of each test compound were transferred from the mother plates to the assay plates. Cells were incubated in the presence of the compounds for one hour. Then cells were fixed and the nucleus stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Finally the plates were washed with 1\u00d7PBS twice and stored at 4\u00b0 C. before analysis. Compounds of the invention have a range of in vitro cell potency activities from about 1 nM to about 10 \u03bcM.","Image Acquirement and Processing","Assay plates were read on the BD Pathway\u2122 855 Bioimager equipped with a 488\/10 nm EGFP excitation filter, a 380\/10 nm DAPI excitation filter, a 515LP nm EGFP emission filter and a 435LP nm DAPI emission filter. Images were acquired in the DAPI and GFP channels of each well using 10\u00d7 dry objective. The plates were exposed 0.066 ms (Gain 31) to acquire DAPI images and 0.55 ms (Gain 30) for GFP images.","Data Analysis","The BD Pathway Bioimager outputs its data in standard text files. Data were imported into the data analysis software BD Image Data Explorer. The nuclear\/cytoplasmic (Nuc\/Cyt) ratios of fluorescence intensity were determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the nucleus by the cytoplasmic. A threshold ratio of greater than 1.8 was employed to define nuclear accumulation of fluorescent signal for each cell. Based on this procedure we calculated the percentage of cells per well displaying nuclear translocation or inhibition of nuclear export. Compounds that induced a nuclear accumulation of the fluorescent signal greater than 60% of that obtained from wells treated with 4 nM LMB were considered as hits. In order to estimate the quality of the HCS assay, the Z\u2032 factor was calculated by the equation: Z\u2032=1\u2212[(3\u00d7std. dev. of positive controls)+(3\u00d7std. dev. of negative controls)\/(mean of positive controls)-(mean of negative controls)].","PI3K Signalling","AKT Phosphorylation Inhibition Western Blot Analysis","Subconfluent cells were incubated under different conditions and washed twice with TBS prior to lysis. Lysis buffer was added containing 50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM NaVO, 100 mM NaF, 20 mM NaPOand protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with antibodies specific for Akt, phospho-Ser-473-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology) and \u03b1-tubulin (Sigma), they were washed and then incubated with IRDye800 conjugated anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. The bands were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Compounds of the invention have a range of in vitro cell potency activities from about 1 nM to about 10 \u03bcM.","Cytotoxicity Assessment","The compounds were tested on 96-well trays. Cells growing in a flask were harvested just before they became confluent, counted using a haemocytometer and diluted down with media adjusting the concentration to the required number of cells per 0.2 ml (volume for each well). Cells were then seeded in 96-well trays at a density between 1000 and 4000 cells\/well, depending of the cell size. Cells were left to plate down and grow for 24 hours before adding the drugs. Drugs were weighed out and diluted with DMSO to get them into solution to a concentration of 10 mM. From here a \u201cmother plate\u201d with serial dilutions was prepared at 200\u00d7 the final concentration in the culture. The final concentration of DMSO in the tissue culture media should not exceed 0.5%. The appropriate volume of the compound solution (usually 2 microliters) was added automatically (Beckman FX 96 tip) to media to make it up to the final concentration for each drug. The medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 0.2 ml of medium dosed with drug. Each concentration was assayed in triplicate. Two sets of control wells were left on each plate, containing either medium without drug or medium with the same concentration of DMSO. A third control set was obtained with the cells untreated just before adding the drugs (seeding control, number of cells starting the culture). Cells were exposed to the drugs for 72 hours and then processed for MTT colorimetric read-out. Compounds of the invention have a range of in vitro cell potency activities from about 1 nM to about 10 \u03bcM.","mTOR Assay","Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was assayed by monitoring phosphorylation of GFP-4EBP using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonante energy transfer format and assay reagents from Invitrogen. In the presence of 10 M ATP, 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.01% (v\/v) Polysorbate 20, 10 mM MnCl, 1 mM EGTA, and 2.5 mM DTT, the mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of 200 nM GFP-4E-BP1 was measured under initial rate conditions. After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 10 mM EDTA, and phosphorylated GFP-4E-BP1 was detected with 2 nM Tb-anti-p4E-BP1 antibody before reading on a Perkin-Elmer Wallac 1420 Fluorescence Reader (exc 340; em 490\/520).","PI3K Cellular Activity (Elisa Assay)","Activity is measured as endogenous levels of phospho-Aktl (Ser473) protein. Osteosarcoma U2OS cells are plated in 96 Poly-D-Lysine coating tissue culture plates (18.000 cells\/well). After the treatment with serial dilutions of the compound during 3 h, the cells are fixed directly in the wells with 4% paraformaldehyde.","After fixing, individual wells go through the same series of steps used for a conventional immunoblot: including blocking with 5% BSA, incubation with 1\/1000 of primary antibody-AKT (Ser 74) in PBS containing 5% BSA at 4\u00b0 C. overnight (Cell Signalling), washing and incubation with second antibody HRP-anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at RT (Amersham). After the addition of SuperSignal ELISA Femto maximum sensitivity chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) the results are read using a luminescence plate reader (Victor).","Cell Viability Assays and Combination Assays","Cells were seeded at 10000-50000 cells\/well in 96 plates for 16 h. On day two, nine serial 1:3 compound dilutions were made in DMSO in a 96 well plate. The compounds were added to duplicate wells in 96-well cell plates a using a FX BECKMAN robot (Beckman Coulter) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with COatmosphere. After 3 days, relative numbers of viable cells were measured by MTT (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instruction and read on EndVision (Perkin Elmer). ECvalues were calculated using Activityl)ase from IDBS. Drugs in combination assays were dosed starting at 4\u00d7ECconcentrations and continuing with serial dilutions 1:2. PI3K inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents were added simultaneously.","An additional exemplary in vitro cell proliferation assay includes the following steps:\n\n","The individual measured ECvalues against the particular cell of the exemplary compounds and of the chemotherapeutic agent are compared to the combination ECvalue. The combination Index (CI) score is calculated by the Chou and Talalay method (CalcuSyn software, Biosoft). A CI less 0.8 indicates synergy. A CI between 0.8 and 1.2 indicates additivity. A CI greater than 1.2 indicates antagonism.","Where compound names are given herein, they are typically generated with ChemDraw.","The invention is illustrated by way of the following examples, in which the following abbreviations (or chemical symbols) may be employed: \u201cdba\u201d dibenzylidene acetone; \u201cDCM\u201d dichloromethane; \u201cMeOH\u201d methanol; \u201cEtOH\u201d ethanol; \u201cTHF\u201d tetrahydrofuran; \u201cDMF\u201d dimethylformamide; \u201cCHCl\u201d chloroform; \u201cDME\u201d dimethoxyethane; \u201cEtO\u201d diethyl ether; \u201cHex\u201d hexane; \u201cEtOAc\u201d ethyl acetate; \u201cPd(PPh)\u201d tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium; \u201cKOAc\u201d potassium acetate; \u201cDIPEA\u201d diisopropylethylamine; \u201cPd(PPh)\u201d tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium; \u201cPd(dppf)Cl.DCM\u201d 1,1\u2032-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepalladium(II) dichloride, dichloromethane; \u201cmin.\u201d minutes; and \u201ch.\u201d hours.","The HPLC measurement was performed using a HP 1100 from Agilent Technologies comprising a pump (binary) with degasser, an autosampler, a column oven, a diode-array detector (DAD) and a column as specified in the respective methods below.
