The Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to generating optical waveforms of wide optical bandwidth.","2. Description of the Related Art","Optical linear frequency modulation (LFM) signals have many uses in optical devices and processors. For example, optical LFM signals can be used to generate optical signals, to interact with optical signals, and to probe the optical spectral contents of devices or materials.","In a recent approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,265,712, by Kristian Doyle Merkel, Zachary Cole, Krishna Mohan Rupavatharam, William Randall Babbitt, Kelvin H. Wagner and Tiejun Chang, entitled \u201cTechniques for Processing High Time-Bandwidth Signals Using a Material with Inhomogeneously Broadened Absorption,\u201d issued Sep. 4, 2007 (hereinafter Merkel), a temporally extended optical LFM signal is used as a probe waveform to generate a readout signal that represents a temporal map of the structure of the spectral population grating (also referred to as spatial-spectral grating or S2 grating) in an inhomogeneously broadened transition (IBT) material, rather than its Fourier transform. This temporal map signal can be measured with inexpensive, high-dynamic-range, megaHertz (MHz, 1 MHz=10Hertz, 1 Hertz equals one cycle per second) bandwidth detectors and digitizers. Such chirps generally have a duration greater than the decoherence time and less than the population decay time of the inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum in IBT material. As described in Merkel, an optical LFM signal sweeping over some wideband portion of the IBT frequency absorption profile of interest, e.g., typically in excess of 1 gigaHertz (GHz, 1 GHz=10Hertz) can produce a low-bandwidth readout signal that can be detected and digitized with the low-bandwidth high-dynamic-range devices currently available. This low-bandwidth readout signal represents a temporal map of the spectral features in the spatial-spectral grating. For example, in some cases the readout signal includes a temporal spike that represents a single frequency hole burned in the IBT material, and in other cases the readout signal includes a superposition of low-bandwidth beat frequencies, each beat related to a periodic component in the frequency spectrum of the grating.","However, current known techniques for producing spectrally pure, phase continuous radio frequency chirps that are linear in frequency and very stable are limited to pulses with bandwidths less than about 400 MHz. The RF chirp can be impressed on an optical signal using an optical modulator such as an electro-optical modulator (EOM) or an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Such limited bandwidths are inadequate to make full use of the spectral recording properties of the IBT materials, which extends over tens to hundreds of gigaHertz, and have a wide range of uses.","Techniques are provided for an optical source for one single order sideband, suppressed carrier optical signal with a bandwidth that scales from over 1 gigaHertz to greater than 20 gigaHertz.","In one set of embodiments, an apparatus comprises a stable laser source configured to output an optical carrier signal at a carrier frequency. The apparatus further comprises a radio frequency electrical source configured to output an electrical radio frequency signal with a radio frequency bandwidth less than one octave. The apparatus further comprises an optical modulator configured to output an optical signal with the optical carrier signal modulated by the radio frequency signal in a plurality of orders of optical frequency sidebands. The apparatus further comprises an optical filter configured to pass one single order optical frequency sideband of the optical signal.","In another set of embodiments, a method comprises modulating an optical signal with an optical carrier signal by a radio frequency signal to produce a modulated optical signal with a carrier frequency and a plurality of orders of optical frequency sidebands based on the radio frequency signal. The radio frequency signal has a radio frequency bandwidth less than one octave. The method further comprises filtering the modulated optical signal to pass one single order optical frequency sideband.","In other embodiments, an apparatus comprises means for performing two or more steps of the above method.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus are described for producing extended bandwidth single-sideband suppressed carrier optical waveforms. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","In the following description, embodiments of the invention are described in the context of probing the spectral content of an IBT material. However, the invention is not limited to this context. In other contexts, embodiments of the invention are applied to generating optical signals, programming IBT materials, programming or probing other materials, and processing optical signals, among other applications. For example, a broadband chirp may be superimposed with a second optical source of unknown spectral content at a photodetector. The resulting photodetector signal contains the spectrum of the second optical source as a temporal map. If the spectrum of the second source did not change during the time scale of the chirp and if the chirp is well characterized, e.g., substantively continuous (\u201cquasi-continuous\u201d), then the spectrum of the second source can be de-convolved from the photodetector signal. As used herein a \u201cchirp\u201d is a time varying signal that sweeps through a band of frequencies, one frequency at a time. The sweep may be linear (in which case the chirp is a LFM signal), piecewise linear or non-linear. The chirp may be in radio or optical electromagnetic frequencies.","As described above, IBT materials are capable of storing spatial-spectral gratings with spectral features having bandwidths in excess of 1 GHz. Such gratings can represent meaningful information, such as the results of high-bandwidth analog optical processing, as described in Merkel. Available highly sensitive and wide-dynamic-range detectors and digitizers have bandwidths of only about up to a few hundred MHz, bandwidths that are too small by factors of 10 to 1000 or more. As described in Merkel, a frequency chirp sweeping over the IBT frequency band of interest, e.g., in excess of 1 GHz, can produce a low-bandwidth readout signal that can be detected and digitized with the low-bandwidth (<200 MHZ) high-dynamic-range devices currently available. However, current known techniques for producing chirps that are highly linear in frequency and highly stable are limited to narrowband pulses with bandwidths less than about 400 MHz in some single octave and cost-effective cases, and up to bandwidths of 3.5 GHz using wideband digital to analog conversion electronics at 20 Gs\/s. Hardware to generate wider bandwidths typically have poorer performance and higher cost than lower bandwidth hardware. As described in Merkel, a low-bandwidth readout signal is generated by probing the spatial-spectral grating in an IBT material with multiple linear, stable, chirps. The readout signal is produced based on processing multiple outputs received from the IBT material after probing by the multiple chirps.","According to embodiments of the present invention, a broadband frequency chirp probe signal for low-bandwidth readout is produced.","For purposes of illustration, the following description uses an example spatial-spectral grating with spectral features that include two periodic components in frequency representing the interaction of a transmitted signal with a reflected signal having two delayed near-replicas of the transmitted signal, as may occur in applications, such as RADAR, described in Merkel. However, embodiments of the invention are not limited to this example. Embodiments of the invention may be practiced in any application where the bandwidth desired for a waveform exceeds the bandwidth of available waveforms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 10A","b":["1010","1014","1002","1004","1010","1003"]},"The inhomogeneous broadening is typically caused by defects found in the host of the absorbing molecule or ion. These local defects, the \u201cinhomogeneities,\u201d cause similar ions to have different resonant frequencies, but do not broaden the individual homogeneous resonances. The inhomogeneously broadened absorption spectrum  has a band center frequency  and an inhomogeneous spectrum bandwidth , also represented by the symbol Bfor the material bandwidth. The band center frequency  is in the optical band, which encompasses frequencies from 100 to 1000 TeraHz (THz, 1 THz=10Hz). However, the inhomogeneous spectrum bandwidth , B, is typically less than a few THz\u2014large compared to the bandwidths available for processing using other techniques, but small compared to the hundreds of THz bandwidth of the optical band.","When an electron makes the transition to the excited state because of light impinging at a particular location in the material, there is one fewer absorber at that location. Therefore, the population of absorbers decreases and the absorption decreases at that location. Members of a population of excited electrons gradually return to the ground state, and the population of absorbers, along with the absorption, returns to its initial value. The time scale associated with this process is the population decay time, which is typically much longer than the dephasing time.","For purposes of illustration, it is assumed that the bandwidth of interest of the spatial-spectral grating in the IBT material is 4 GHz around a center optical frequency f (i.e., the band of interest spans f\u22122 GHz to f+2 GHz). It is further assumed that there are two periodic components of interest, representing the interaction in the IBT material of a first optical signal with a second signal having two delayed near-replicas of the first optical signal. The first delay, \u03c4, is 0.003 microsecond (\u03bcs, 1 \u03bcs=10seconds); and the second delay, \u03c4, is 0.005 \u03bcs. These delays appear in the spatial-spectral grating as oscillations of absorption in the absorption spectrum with a periodicity equal to 333.3 MHz and 200 MHz, respectively, given by the reciprocals of the respective delays. This relationship is given by Equation 1\n\n1\/\u03c4\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwherein P is the period (in units of frequency) of a spectral component in a spatial-spectral grating which corresponds to a particular delay \u03c4. This period P is noteworthy in that it is a period in frequency rather than a period in time\u2014it is a property of the Fourier transform that a spike in time, such as a correlation peak at delay \u03c4, corresponds to a periodic component in frequency. Although delays of a few nanoseconds (ns, 1 ns=10seconds=0.001 \u03bcs) are used for purposes of illustration, the same methods may be used for much shorter and much longer delays, e.g., for delays of several microseconds.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 10B","FIG. 10B"],"b":["1020","1022","0","1024","1026","1","2"]},"Highly linear, phase continuous, frequency stable, wideband frequency chirps with the appropriate chirp rate are desired as the probe waveform for the readout process. The chirp rate (\u03b3) is given by the chirp bandwidth (B) divided by the temporal extent (\u201cduration\u201d) of the chirp (T), as shown in Equation 2.\n\n\u03b3=\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nIt is assumed for purposes of illustration that a useful duration is about a millisecond (ms, 1 ms=10seconds), on the order of the population decay time for some IBT materials and the pulse rate for some RADAR applications; therefore T=1000 \u03bcs. In the illustrated example, the bandwidth of interest is 4 GHz (4000 MHz); therefore B=4000 MHz. Consequently, a useful chirp rate, in the illustrated embodiment, is about \u03b3=4 MHz\/\u03bcs.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 10C","b":["1030","1032","1034","0","1036"]},"In general, the probe waveform produces multiple high-bandwidth output signals from the spatial-spectral grating in the IBT material, a transmission and zero or more echoes. The transmission includes high-bandwidth information from the absorption spectrum in the spatial-spectral grating. Each echo is a reduced amplitude replica of the probe waveform delayed by a time equal to the delay in the signals that interacted to form the spatial-spectral grating. If no delayed replica interacts to form the spatial-spectral grating, then no echo is typically produced.","To generate a low-bandwidth readout signal that can be detected with sensitive high-precision detectors and digitizers, the high-bandwidth output signals are combined to produce a low-bandwidth beat with a beat frequency Fthat is proportional to the delay \u03c4 and the chirp rate \u03b3, as shown in Equation 3a.\n\n=\u03b3*\u03c4\u2003\u2003(3a)\n\nAs is well known in the art, beat frequencies are formed at both the sum and difference in frequency of two simultaneous signals at a detector. The difference frequency is of use in the illustrated application because the difference is a detectable frequency. With delayed linear chirped signals, as used here, the frequency difference is steady and equal to the chirp rate \u03ba times the delay \u03c4. Each beat frequency commences after the start of the output signal by the delay time corresponding to the beat. In terms of the period P (in units of frequency) of the oscillations in the absorption spectrum, this relationship is expressed in Equation 3b.\n\n\u2003\u2003(3b)\n\nIf the spatial-spectral grating contains delays, the low-bandwidth readout signal includes a linear superposition of the beat frequencies associated with all the delays. Table 1 gives values for the delays \u03c4, periods P, and beat frequencies Ffor the illustrated example of a spatial-spectral grating, and for several values of the constant chirp rate \u03b3. As can be seen in Table 1, the beat frequencies, F, are low bandwidth signals that are easily measured by high-dynamic-range detectors and digitizers operating in the megaHertz range. A readout signal with such beat frequency components provide a low-bandwidth temporal map of the spectral features of interest in the interaction absorption spectrum. Any beat frequencies that can be measured well can be used, such as the beat frequency in the third line of Table 1.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Values of spectral features for example spatial-spectral grating."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"F(MHz) for","F(MHz) for","F(MHz) for"]},{"entry":["\u03c4 (\u03bcs)","P (MHz)","\u03b3 = 2 MHz\/\u03bcs","\u03b3 = 4 MHz\/\u03bcs","\u03b3 = 8 MHz\/\u03bcs"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.003","333.3","0.006","0.012","0.024"]},{"entry":["0.005","200","0.010","0.020","0.040"]},{"entry":["5","0.2","10","20","40"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 10D","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C","FIG. 10D"],"b":["1040","1046","1042","1044","1046","1","2"],"sub":"B "},"A method and apparatus are described to generate a wideband optical waveform, such as a chirp, that is a single order sideband with a suppressed carrier (SSB-SC). The method includes modulating a radio frequency (RF) or microwave signal or waveform onto an optical carrier and optically filtering the output of the modulation to achieve the SSB-SC optical waveform. The optical carrier is typically that of a coherent stable laser and defined as having a frequency fthat becomes a carrier frequency ffor a modulated waveform. When a signal is modulated onto an optical carrier, multiple order optical sidebands are generated that have optical frequencies both above (upper sidebands) and below (lower sidebands) the optical carrier frequency. For each frequency component of the signal, multiple optical upper and lower sidebands are generated, whose optical frequencies are separated from the laser carrier by harmonics of the RF frequency of the component being considered. For broadband signals, upper and lower harmonic sidebands are generated for each frequency component of the signal. Throughout this application, a single optical frequency sideband will be used to refer to one of the set of either upper or lower sidebands produced by a specific harmonic. This is also called a single harmonic sideband or a single order sideband. The modulation operation of taking an RF waveform and modulating into a carrier is often limited to using less than a single octave in RF frequency, so that a single optical frequency sideband can be isolated without substantial overlap with other optical frequency sidebands. SSB-SC here refers to isolating one of these optical frequency sidebands from the set of upper or lower optical frequency sidebands by means of an optical filter. The apparatus includes lasers, electro-optical modulators, RF drive electronics, and optical filters, among others. The resulting waveforms and proposed techniques can also assist in recovering optical spectral features in a target optical spectrum and allow the determination of spectral content of a target optical spectrum during one or more optical interactions (including, for example, optical absorption, transmission, reflection, diffraction, dispersion, and scattering) of the target optical spectrum",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","120","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","100","112","114","116"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, the output of the source  is used as a read input signal  to probe the spectral content of a target .

The depicted RF signals are represented by dotted arrows. The RF source  is a particular embodiment of RF source ; and includes chirp generator  (such as an RF AWG), RF switches through , RF local oscillators (LOs) through , RF mixers through , and RF bandpass filters through (collectively referenced hereinafter as RF switches , RF LO , RF mixers  and RF bandpass filters , respectively). In the illustrated embodiment, the RF source  also includes an RF amplifier . The RF output  is an extended bandwidth RF signal that is next modulated onto a laser signal at optical modulator .","Each segment is passed through a bandpass filter to improve the spur free dynamic range (SFDR) of the waveform before being sent to the intermediate frequency (IF) input of separate mixing stages  on different paths through RF switches and . Each mixer  is ideally driven by a dedicated local oscillator  producing a continuous wave (CW) signal at a drive amplitude designed for operation by each individual mixer . The CW frequency outputs of the local oscillators  are designed to be separated by a frequency span that is slightly less than the initial waveform produced by the RF chirp generator . The mixers  are used to up-convert the initial multi-octave waveform from generator  onto a high frequency RF carrier, creating a sub-octave segment. By using multiple mixers  and LOs , multiple upconverted segments can be created on different paths. In the example embodiment provided herein, four separate mixing paths create four upconverted segments. Each upconverted segment is then passed through an appropriate bandpass filter through , which is beneficial in attenuating carrier leakage, the unwanted sideband, and out of band spurs generated by the mixing stages in RF mixers . The four separate segments are recombined at a final RF switching stage in RF switch . In various embodiments, the RF switches  are multi-pole, single throw switch, or an array of switches, and the one or more switches of RF switch are capable of operating across the entire bandwidth of the combined upconverted segments.","A precision delay generator or similar hardware (not shown) controls the timing of the switches. The delay generator used in this example embodiment controls the switches in a manner as to allow Path 1 to pass first, followed by Path 2 second, Path 3 third and Path 4 fourth. Each upconverted RF chirp slightly overlaps the next in frequency, in order to ensure that there are no gaps in the full RF spectral coverage. This method of RF stitching produces a single output waveform equivalent to the bandwidth of the initial chirped RF waveform multiplied by the number of segments in the RF system. Once the full stitched waveform has been created at the end of the final path (Path 4 in this case), the delay generators continuously repeat the process sequentially transmitting each path. The process creates a continuously running, wideband RF chirp. The use of multiple segments allows the chirp generator  to be operated in a limited spur free range in some embodiments, as described in more detail below, and to still provide an adequate RF chirp as output signal .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3E","FIG. 3C"],"b":["350","352","354","356","356","360","362","364","366","366","366","366","368","370","368","330","334","346"],"i":["a ","d ","a","b","c ","d","c "]},"In various embodiments, RF design considerations are made to produce a stitched waveform that is entirely sub-octave (e.g., 11 GHz to 21 GHz). These considerations include choosing appropriate mixers , LOs , and filters  with high frequency operation near the target RF waveform bandwidth. An important benefit of designing the stitched wideband readout to be sub-octave is eliminating the possibility of introducing second order and higher harmonics of any optical read input signal  into the signal detected from the optical read output signal , thus improving the dynamic range of the system depicted in .","In some embodiments, the stitched RF chirp includes several (e.g., 3) large 3.5 GHz bandwidth segments that are used to get about 10 GHz or more of RF bandwidth. As described above, some embodiments use a 3.5 GHz bandwidth RF chirp extending from 0.5-4.0 GHz produced by the Tektronix AWG7102 repeated in 3 segments to get 10.5 GHz RF from \u02dc11-21.5 GHz, where a first upconverted segment is over 11-14.5 GHz; a second upconverted segment is over 14.5-18.0 GHz; and a third upconverted segment is over 18.0-21.5 GHz. This embodiment relies on a relatively high cost RF feed and high cost AWG. However, in embodiments using the higher order optical sidebands, such as the 3rd order optical sideband, then a total stitched RF bandwidth of only a about 3.5 GHz is desired. This means that, in various embodiments, only one segment of 3.5 GHz is used, or several segments output by a lower cost AWG are used, both simplifying the setup or reducing RF hardware costs or both.","Thus in some embodiments, multiple segments are employed using lower bandwidth segments. However, having 20 segments that have a small bandwidth of 0.5 GHz each to achieve the 10 GHz RF drive signal using the 1order sideband of the modulated optical signal involves working with more than about 3 or 4 segments, which can be difficult to implement practically. Thus in some desirable embodiments, three or four segments are used to create lower bandwidth sub-octave RF waveforms. For example, in some embodiments 3 segments each of about 1.2 GHz (readily generated from a DDS board between 1.5-2.7 GHz) are mixed onto various RF carriers to get an aggregate of 3.6 GHz RF drive signal. These 3 segments include a first segment (e.g., segment ) over 15.5-16.7 GHz; a second segment (e.g., segment ) over 16.7-17.9 GHz; and a third segment (e.g., ) over 17.9-19.1 GHz. This solution has the advantage of relying on a lower cost dedicated RF feed and lower cost AWG\/DDS components.","As described above, in some embodiments, the frequency response of the RF chirp source  is comprised of segments, which each go through various paths of RF hardware, e.g., RF source . The frequency response of each hardware component is not always flat in amplitude, and the amplitude can fluctuate over the waveform bandwidth. The cumulative effect is due to the various amplitude shaping caused by the components in the RF signal chain including mixers , filters , cables, and the AWG .  is a graph  that illustrates an example amplitude trace  from a segment of a radio frequency source, according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis  is RF frequency in gigahertz (GHz); and, the vertical axis  is amplitude in deciBels (dB, 1 dB=10*logof ratio of power of signal to power of reference signal) relative to the output of the generator .","To improve amplitude flatness, in some embodiments, the linear frequency modulated waveform output from the AWG (e.g., chirp generator ) is shaped by the inverse of the amplitude transfer function of the RF signal chain. An example of the uncorrected first segment is shown in  and its inverse amplitude shape used for correction is shown in .  is a graph  that illustrates an example amplitude shaping trace  input to a segment of a radio frequency source to flatten an amplitude trace from an output of the radio frequency source, according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis  is as described for , and the vertical axis  is amplitude in dB.  and  show spectrum analyzer traces of laboratory data for a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, linear frequency modulated waveform produced by a Tektronix AWG7102. The waveform is upconverted in frequency by a mixing stage with a dedicated LO. The upper trace  shows the amplitude profile of the first segment after being passed through the RF chain. This waveform has no amplitude correction algorithm applied and has an amplitude variation of \u02dc10 dB over the waveform bandwidth.","The lower trace  shows the amplitude profile of the shaping waveform used to flatten the RF segment output to produce an amplitude variation of \u02dc2 dB. By shaping the waveform with the inverse of the RF signal chain amplitude transfer function, the RF source  generates segments with much flatter amplitudes. Since each waveform has its own separate path comprised of separate RF components, each waveform is applied separately to each individual path in some embodiments. In some embodiments, this method relies on the ability to output a series of different waveforms from the RF source generator, e.g., chirp generator . While  shows \u02dc2 dB amplitude fluctuations, much better correction responses (e.g., \u02dc0.1 dB) could be obtained from advanced techniques, such as using well defined fixed RF paths, with finer calibration measurements and multiple iterations of a correction routine being applied. The results in  are typical from one iteration and meant to be illustrative only. Additionally, in some cases when using an optical injection locking stage for RIN suppression that is further down the component chain, \u02dc2 dB variations can be sufficient for driving that RIN suppression device.","An example embodiment includes a series of three segmented, linear frequency modulated waveforms. A spectrum analyzer trace showing the amplitude profiles of the three linear frequency modulated waveforms after passing through their individual RF paths is shown in .  is a graph  that illustrates an example amplitude trace from three segments of a radio frequency source, according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis  is RF frequency in gigaHertz (GHz); the vertical axis  is amplitude in dB relative to one milliWatt (dBm), where 1 milliWatt, mW, =10Watts. The amplitude traces , , of three upconverted segments are plotted (collectively referenced hereinafter as segment amplitude traces ). Each segment is upconverted from an RF AWG outputting a continuously running waveform. Each segment passes through a separate RF source path containing RF components capable of operating over the bandwidth of each upconverted segment. This creates three waveforms that have varying amplitude profiles, as shown by segment amplitude traces  from a spectrum analyzer. This creates three waveforms that have varying amplitude profiles. Amplitude correction shaping was then applied to each individual segment, e.g., by controlling the AWG with a computer, to reduce the amplitude variations within each segment.","An example of a laboratory test result is shown in .  is a graph  that illustrates an example amplitude trace  stitched together from three segments of a radio frequency source using shape corrected inputs, according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis  is RF frequency in GHz; the vertical axis  is amplitude in dBm. After applying a shape correction to the three individual segments, an amplitude variation of \u02dc2 dB over the bandwidth of the full waveform was achieved. A spectrum analyzer trace  shows the amplitude profile of a three segment, stitched waveform.","While this technique is very effective at compensating for amplitude variations across the waveform segments, it achieves this at the cost of reduced SNR from the RF waveform source, such as chirp generator . The technique has the effect of reducing the vertical resolution of the RF source by the amount of amplitude correction applied to the waveform, which was nearly 15 dB in some embodiments, thus it is desirable to minimize the amount of shaping applied.","By characterizing both amplitude and phase of the RF signal path (e.g. with a wideband network analyzer) the shape correction technique is extended, in some embodiments, to also correct the phase of the waveform to compensate for dispersion in the RF signal path; thus improving both amplitude flatness and waveform linearity.","Custom, tunable optical filters are available for optical filter , which provide excellent attenuation of unwanted optical signals outside the sideband of interest, while maintaining a flat passband response. As used herein, optical filters are understood to include all known types of filtering methods such as, but not limited to, absorptive, reflective, bandpass, notch, etc. and may or may not have the capability to be tuned in frequency or bandwidth or both.

The instructions and data received in memory  may optionally be stored on storage device , either before or after execution by the processor .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 11"],"b":["1200","1200","1200"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) (not shown), one or more controllers (not shown), or one or more other special-purpose computer chips.","The processor  and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory  via the bus . The memory  includes both dynamic memory (e.g., RAM, magnetic disk, writable optical disk, etc.) and static memory (e.g., ROM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing executable instructions that when executed perform one or more steps of a method described herein. The memory  also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of one or more steps of the methods described herein.","In the foregoing specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2D","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3D","FIG. 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3E","FIG. 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 6A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 6B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 7A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 7D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIGS. 9A","b":["9","9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 10A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 10B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 10D","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 12"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
