In this communications system, low-rate modulations with relatively long symbols compared to the channel time characteristics are less sensitive to multipath propagation issues. OFDM transmits a number of low symbol-rate data streams on separate narrow frequency subbands using multiple frequencies simultaneously, instead of transmitting a single, high symbol-rate stream on one wide frequency band on a single frequency. These multiple subbands have the advantage that the channel propagation effects are generally more constant over a given subband than over the entire channel as a whole. A classical In-phase\/Quadrature (I\/Q) modulation can be transmitted over individual subbands. Also, OFDM is typically used in conjunction with a Forward Error Correction scheme, which in this instance is sometimes termed Coded Orthogonal FDM or COFDM.","As known to those skilled in the art, an OFDM signal can be considered the sum of a number of orthogonal subcarrier signals, with baseband data on each individual subcarrier independently modulated, for example, by Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) or Phase-Shift Keying (PSK). This baseband signal can also modulate a main RF carrier.","OFDM signals are generally created by performing the inverse Fourier transform on the data, with the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) becoming the preferred method since it is numerically efficient. Additionally, OFDM demodulation requires use of the Fourier Transform. This is typically implemented with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) requiring complex multiplications in an OFDM receiver that decodes a packet of k-symbols requiring complex multiplications.","An algorithm's efficiency, such as the FFT or IFFT, is typically measured by the number of required multiplications and additions. The hardware implementation complexity is usually determined by the number of multiplications-per-second, since multipliers typically take up more real estate and clock-cycles on processors and VLSI designs. Direct evaluation of the N-point discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) requires Ncomplex multiplications and N*(N\u22121) complex additions, or 4*Nreal multiplications and N*(4*N\u22122) real additions.

The radix-R FFT algorithms operate by splitting the N-point DFT into v stages, where v is an integer and N=R. The well-known radix-2 algorithm (N=2) is based on decomposing the sequence x[n] into successively smaller sub-sequences for processing by smaller DFT's and is referred to as a decimation-in-time algorithm.

Other details of such OFDM systems are found in commonly assigned and copending U.S. patent application Ser.

Some of the bits or symbols normally transmitted on one channel or carrier are now transmitted by this system on multiple carriers in the channel. Advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques distribute the data over multiple carriers (subcarriers) at predetermined frequencies. For example, if the lowest-frequency subcarrier uses a base frequency, the other subcarriers could be integer multiples of that base frequency. The particular relationship among the subcarriers is considered the orthogonality such that the energy from one subcarrier can appear at a frequency where all other subcarrier's energy equal zero. There can be a superposition of frequencies in the same frequency range. This results in a lower symbol rate on each subcarrier with less Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) due to adverse effects of multipath. In many OFDM communications systems, a Guard Interval (GI) or Cyclic Prefix (CP) is prefixed or appended to the OFDM symbol to mitigate the effects of ISI.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2C"],"b":["30","32","30"]},"The drawings in  show that OFDM is based on a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) system where each frequency channel is modulated. The frequencies and modulation of an FDM system are now orthogonal to each other to eliminate interference between channels. Because low-rate modulations with relatively long symbols compared to the channel time characteristics are less sensitive to multipath, an OFDM communications system allows a number of low-rate symbol streams to be transmitted simultaneously on multiple carriers rather than having one high-rate symbol stream transmitted on a single carrier. Thus, the frequency spectrum in an OFDM communications system is divided into multiple low-bandwidth subbands. Since each subband covers a relatively narrow section of the frequency spectrum, channel propagation effects are more constant or \u201cflat\u201d over a given subband compared to channel variations over the entire occupied spectrum. Any type of in-phase and quadrature (I\/Q) modulation can be used to modulate any subcarrier, for example, Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), or any of the numerous and different derivations of these modulation schemes. Different signal processing techniques, for example, channel coding, power allocation, adaptive modulation encoding, and similar schemes can be applied to one or more subbands. Multi-user allocation is also possible for example using time, coding, or frequency separation.","In an OFDM communications system using a transmitter and receiver such as shown in , one transmitter will transmit a signal on dozens or thousands of different orthogonal frequencies that are independent with respect to the relative amplitude and phase relationship between the frequencies. Each subcarrier signal typically will have space for only a single narrowband signal because the signals are closely spaced and it is important to prevent signals on adjacent subcarriers from interfering with each other. In an OFDM system, the symbols on each subcarrier are constructed such that energy from their frequency components are zero at the center of every other subcarrier, enabling a higher spectral efficiency for OFDM symbols than is possible in classic FDM.","The conventional OFDM system as shown in  includes channel coding as a Forward Error Correction (FEC) technique, using a Forward Error Correction encoder to create a coded orthogonal FDM (COFDM) signal. Channel-State Information (CSI) techniques can also be employed, including continuous wave (CW) interferer and\/or selective channel systems.","An OFDM signal is typically the sum of each of the orthogonal subcarriers. Baseband data is independently modulated onto each of the orthogonal subcarriers using some type of modulation, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) or Phase Shift Keying (PSK) schemes as discussed before. Because the spectrum of each subcarrier overlaps, it can be considerably wider than if no overlap were allowed. Thus, OFDM provides high spectrum efficiency. Because each subcarrier operates at a low symbol rate, the duration of each symbol in the subcarrier is long. (For clarity, \u201csymbol rate\u201d is equal to the inverse of \u201csymbol duration\u201d). By using Forward Error Correction (FEC) equalization and modulation, there can be an enhanced resistance against a) link dispersion, b) slowly changing phase distortion and fading, c) frequency response nulls, d) constant interference, and e) burst noise. Further, the use of a Guard Interval (GI) or cyclic prefix provides enhanced resistance against multipath in the transmission channel.","Typically, in an OFDM communications system, a subcarrier and somewhat rectangular pulse can be employed and operative by an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) circuit within the transmitter. At a receiver, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) circuit reverses this operation. The rectangular pulse shape results in a Sin(x)\/x spectrum in the subcarriers.","The spacing of subcarriers can be chosen such that the received subcarriers can cause zero or acceptably low Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) when the receiver and transmitter are synchronized. Typically, OFDM communications systems split the available bandwidth into many narrow-band subbands from as little as a few dozen to as many as eight thousand to ten thousand. Unlike the communications system providing multiple channels using classical FDM as in , the subcarriers for each subband in OFDM are orthogonal to each other and have close spacing and little overhead. In an OFDM communications system, there is also little overhead associated with any switching that may occur between users as in a Time Division Multiplexing Access (TDMA) communications system. Usually, the orthogonality of subcarriers in an OFDM communications system allows each carrier to have an integer number of cycles over a symbol period. As a result, the spectrum of a subcarrier has a null at the center frequency of its adjacent subcarriers.","Usually, in an OFDM communications system, the spectrum required for transmitting data is chosen based on the input data and a desired modulation scheme to be used with each carrier that is assigned the data to transmit. Any amplitude and phase of the carrier is calculated based on the modulation, for example, BPSK, QPSK or QAM as noted before. Any required spectrum is converted using the IFFT circuit to ensure carrier signals are orthogonal.","It should be understood that a FFT circuit transforms a cyclic time domain signal to an equivalent frequency spectrum by finding an equivalent waveform that is generated as a sum of orthogonal sinusoidal components. The frequency spectrum of the time domain signal is usually represented by the amplitude and phase sinusoidal components. The IFFT circuit performs the reverse process and transforms the spectrum of the amplitude and phase into a time domain signal. For example, an IFFT circuit can convert a set of complex data points into a time domain signal of the same number of points. Each complex input point will result in an integral number of sinusoid and cosinusoid cycles represented by the same number of points as were input to the IFFT. Each sinusoid known as the in-phase component, and cosinusoid known as the quadrature component, will be orthogonal to all other components generated by the IFFT. Thus, orthogonal carriers can be generated by setting an amplitude and phase for each frequency point representing a desired subcarrier frequency and performing the IFFT.","It should be understood that a Guard Interval (GI), also termed a cyclic prefix, often is added to an OFDM symbol. The guard interval reduces the effects of the wireless channel on Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and contains redundant transmission information. Referring to the IEEE 802.11a standard as a non-limiting example, if a carrier spacing is 312.5 KHz, and the Fourier Transforms are performed over 3.2 microseconds, then a 0.8 microsecond guard interval can be applied for ISI rejection. The guard \u201cinterval\u201d could be the last Tseconds of an active symbol period that is prefixed to an OFDM symbol, making it a cyclic prefix. It is kept short for a fraction of \u201cTV\u201d corresponding to the total length of the active symbol, yet longer than the channel impulse response. This helps reduce the ISI and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and maintains subcarrier orthogonality. In this example, a time waveform appears periodic to the receiver over the duration of the FFT.","To reduce ICI, the OFDM symbol can be cyclically extended in the guard time to ensure that delayed replicas of the OFDM symbol can have an integer number of cycles within the FFT interval, as long as the delay is smaller than the guard time. As a result, multipath signals with delays smaller than the guard time would not produce ICI.","Multipath interference is caused when multiple copies of the transmitted signal arrive at the receiver at different times. It should be understood that an OFDM communications system reduces the effect of multipath interference by providing the ability to add signal redundancy in both frequency and time by the use of various coding algorithms. For example, with the IEEE 802.11a standard using OFDM, 48 subcarriers can be transmitted simultaneously. The coding gain can be provided using a one-half (\u00bd) convolutional encoder at the transmitter and later a Viterbi decoder. Data bits can be interleaved across multiple symbols and subcarriers. Lost data often is recoverable because of interleaving across the frequency and time space.","Increasing the data rate requires an increase in the symbol rate for a fixed number of carriers, fixed modulation scheme and fixed sample rate. For a single carrier system, complex equalizers and adaptive filters are required at the receiver to compensate for the magnitude and time distortions caused by the channel. The accuracy and dynamic range required of such equalizers and filters increases markedly as symbol times are decreased. However, in an OFDM system, for example, when 48 subcarriers are transmitted simultaneously, the symbol rate is effectively reduced by 48 times, significantly reducing the requirements of channel equalizers and filters. The reduced symbol rate of an OFDM system enables a robust communication link, resistant to ISI.","It should be understood that an OFDM receiver receives a sum of the different signals as subcarriers. The addition of a guard interval can further enhance performance in an OFDM system by ensuring that no symbol transitions occur during each received symbol time. For example, if an OFDM subcarrier is BPSK modulated, there would be a 180 degree phase jump at symbol boundaries. By choosing a guard interval that is longer than the largest expected time difference between the first and last multipath signals, such phase transitions can occur only during the guard time, meaning there are no phase transitions during the FFT interval. If the phase transitions of a delayed path occur within the FFT interval of the receiver, then the summation of the subcarriers of the first path with the phase modulated waves of the delayed path would no longer produce a set of orthogonal subcarriers, resulting in a certain level of interference.","For purposes of general technical understanding of the OFDM system as will be explained later, basic components of a conventional OFDM transmitter and receiver are explained.  illustrates a high-level block diagram of a prior art transmitter  for the IEEE 802.11a OFDM modem described above, and includes a Forward Error Correction (FEC) Coder circuit  that receives a signal representing the data to be communicated , and encodes the signal with a forward error correction code as described above. The signal passes to an interleaving and mapping circuit  in which interleaving and frequency mapping occurs. An IFFT circuit  receives the interleaved and frequency mapped signal and creates multiple time domain carriers summed in a single in-phase\/quadrature time domain sequence known as a symbol. A guard interval circuit  adds a guard interval. A symbol wave shaping circuit , for example a raised cosine filter, shapes the symbol waveform to limit its spectral content. Afterward, an In-phase\/Quadrature (I\/Q) modulator  processes the baseband I\/Q signal, producing I\/Q modulation, and also receiving a Local Oscillator (LO) signal from LO signal generator . Signal up-conversion to the final transmit carrier frequency occurs at mixer , which receives a local oscillator signal generated by LO signal generator . Afterward, the signal is amplified by a High Power Amplifier (HPA) , and the OFDM signal is transmitted through an antenna  on its carrier wave into the RF channel . Various stages of frequency filtering, for example between the I\/Q Modulator  and mixer , and between the mixer  and HPA , and at the output of the HPA  are not shown in the block diagram.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 13","FIG. 1A"],"b":["32","60","31","62","64","66","68","70","72","74","72","70","74","72","76","78","80","82","83","32","30"]},"As discussed above, OFDM communications systems can use FEC techniques and known interleaving and mapping techniques before IFFT processing as shown in , and demapping and deinterleaving techniques followed by FEC decoding after FFT processing as shown in .","These interleaving, coding, e.g., convolutional codes, including puncturing, and deinterleaving and decoding and related techniques often are integral parts of OFDM communications systems. As an example, a rate 1\/2, K=7 convolutional code can be used as an industry standard code for forward error correction (FEC) during encoding. For purposes of understanding, a more detailed description of these basic system components now follows. A convolutional code is an error-correcting code, and usually has three parameters (n, k, m) with n equal to the number of output bits, k equal to the number of input bits, and m equal to the number of memory registers, in one non-limiting example. The quantity k\/n could be called the code rate with this definition and is a measure of the efficiency of the code. K and n parameters range typically from 1 to 8, m ranges typically from 2 to 10, and the code rate typically ranges from 1\/8 to 7\/8 in non-limiting examples. Sometimes convolutional code chips are specified by parameters (n, k, L) with L equal to the constraint length of the code. Thus, the constraint length can represent the number of bits in an encoder memory that would affect the generation of n output bits. Sometimes the letters may be switched depending on the definitions used.","The transformation of the encoded data is a function of the information symbols and the constraint length of the code. Single bit input codes can produce punctured codes that give different code rates. For example, when a rate 1\/2 code is used, the transmission of a subset of the output bits of the encoder can convert the rate 1\/2 code into a rate 2\/3 code. Thus, one hardware circuit or module can produce codes of different rates. Punctured codes can be used also, which allow rates to be changed dynamically through software or hardware depending on channel conditions, such as rain or other channel impairing conditions.","An encoder for a convolutional code typically uses a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) or look-up table (LUT) for encoding, which usually includes an input bit as well as a number of previous input bits (known as the state of the encoder), the table value being the output bit or bits of the encoder. It is possible to view the encoder function as a state diagram, a tree diagram or a trellis diagram.","Decoding systems for convolutional codes can use 1) sequential decoding, or 2) maximum likelihood decoding, such as Viterbi decoding in one non-limiting example, which typically is more desirable. Sequential decoding allows both forward and backward movement through the trellis. Viterbi decoding as maximum likelihood decoding examines a receive sequence of given length, computes a metric for each path, and makes a decision based on the metric. Turbo codes are another example of a forward error correction scheme that can be used.","Puncturing convolutional codes is a common practice in some OFDM systems and can be used in accordance with non-limiting examples of the present invention. It should be understood that in some examples a punctured convolutional code is a higher rate code obtained by the periodic elimination of specific logic bits or symbols from the output of a low rate encoder. Punctured convolutional code performance can be degraded compared with original codes, but typically the data rate increases.","Some of the basic components that could be used as non-limiting examples of the present invention include the transmitter as described before that incorporates a convolutional encoder, which encodes a sequence of binary input vectors to produce the sequence of binary output vectors and can be defined using a trellis structure. An interleaver, for example, a block interleaver, can permute the bits of the output vectors. The interleaved data would also be modulated at the transmitter (by mapping to transmit symbols) and transmitted. At a receiver, a demodulator demodulates the signal.","A block deinterleaver recovers the bits that were interleaved. A Viterbi decoder could decode the deinterleaved bit soft decisions to produce binary output data.","Often a Viterbi forward error correction module or core is used that would include a convolutional encoder and Viterbi decoder as part of a radio modem or transceiver as described above. For example if the constraint length of the convolutional code is 7, the encoder and Viterbi decoder could support selectable code rates of 1\/2, 2\/3, 3\/4, 4\/5, 5\/6 , 6\/7, 7\/8 using industry standard puncturing algorithms.","Different design and block systems parameters could include the constraint length as a number of input bits over which the convolutional code is computed, and a convolutional code rate as the ratio of the input to output bits for the convolutional encoder. The puncturing rate could include a ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder using the puncturing process, for example, derived from a rate 1\/2 code.","The Viterbi decoder parameters could include the convolutional code rate as a ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder. The puncture rate could be the ratio of input to output bits for the convolutional encoder using a puncturing process and can be derived from a rate 1\/2 mother code. The input bits could be the number of processing bits for the decoder. The Viterbi input width could be the width of input data (i.e. soft decisions) to the Viterbi decoder. A metric register length could be the width of registers storing the metrics. A trace back depth could be the length of path required by the Viterbi decoder to compute the most likely decoded bit value. The size of the memory storing the path metrics information for the decoding process could be the memory size. In some instances, a Viterbi decoder could include a First-In\/First-Out (FIFO) buffer between depuncture and Viterbi function blocks or modules. The Viterbi output width could be the width of input data to the Viterbi decoder.","The encoder could include a puncturing block circuit or module as noted above. Usually a convolutional encoder may have a constraint length of 7 and take the form of a shift register with a number of elements, for example, 6. One bit can be input for each clock cycle. Thus, the output bits could be defined by a combination of shift register elements using a standard generator code and be concatenated to form an encoded output sequence. There could be a serial or parallel byte data interface at the input. The output width could be programmable depending on the punctured code rate of the application.","A Viterbi decoder in non-limiting examples could divide the input data stream into blocks, and estimate the most likely data sequence. Each decoded data sequence could be output in a burst. The input and calculations can be continuous and require four clock cycles for every two bits of data in one non-limiting example. An input FIFO can be dependent on a depuncture input data rate.","Also turbo codes could be used as high-performance error correction codes or low-density parity-check codes that approach the Shannon limit as the theoretical limit of maximum information transfer rate over a noisy channel. Thus, some available bandwidth can be increased without increasing the power of the transmission. Instead of producing binary digits from the signal, the front-end of the decoder could be designed to produce a likelihood measure for each bit.","There now follows a more detailed description of the system and method in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention, which reduces the computations for the IFFT and FFT in OFDM communications systems.

If the system skips every other sample, the system returns back through the memory to complete the approximation of the sine wave. Instead of storing each one of the different frequency sine waves that is a complex exponential function, it is possible to use that first column as a memory module for a low frequency sine wave that is oversampled and skip every other sample for doubling the frequency.

Many emerging wireless standards taking a large share in the market place are using OFDM for their physical layer, such as IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g (Local Area Networks), and 802.16 (Wide Area Networks). OFDM is also used as the global standard for asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and for digital audio broadcasting (DAB) in the European market. A disadvantage of the OFDM waveform is large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) that results from the addition of multiple sinusoids with random amplitude and phases. Due to the central-limit theorem, the dynamic range of the signal approaches a time distribution with a Gaussian distribution. These large peaks will cause intermodulation distortion if compressed by a power amplifier, resulting in an increase in the error rate. The average signal power must be kept low in order to operate the power amplifier in its linear region and prevent compression or clipping of the signal. The power consumption for a communication system is typically bound by the requirements of the final power amplifier. It is therefore important to minimize the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR).","A system and method for reducing the PAPR is the PN-Scrambler technique used by Harris Corporation of Melbourne, Fla., which takes advantage of the fact that the probability of low-PAPR OFDM symbols occurring is frequent.

Furthermore, in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention, it is not necessary to perform all Nadditions. Only D additions are required, where D is the number of carriers. For example, if there are only 52 carriers used, 64\u00d752=3328 complex additions are required instead of 64=4096 complex additions.","The PN-Scrambling technique as described before is a distortion-less way of reducing PAPR in OFDM systems. Since it is distortion-less, it is suitable for cascading with other methods commonly used for PAPR reduction, such as soft clipping, peak windowing, peak cancellation, or companding.

efficient FFT approximation is also operable in an OFDM demodulator, in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention. The system and method requires no multiplications and less storage space. For example, a 1024-FFT in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention stores a 2-bit by 1024=2048 bits in memory.","A high-level block circuit diagram of part of a demodulator  in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention is shown in  and includes a processing and memory module  containing a period of a sine\/cosine approximation, which inputs into a plurality of Read Address Circuits  and Mixers , which output into Summers  and Result Processing Block circuits  as illustrated, with appropriate feedback and mixer input  as illustrated.","At the receive stage, the system and demodulator do not know the phase value and amplitude that is transmitted. The channel corrupts the amplitude and phase that is transmitted. It is possible to use +1's and \u22121's or multilevel values with the exponentials. The signal Y(t) enters the system and a memory contains a period, for example, one period of the sine\/cosine approximation. The signal Y(t) is the signal that is transmitted over-the-air with the sine wave approximation stored in memory. If the process begins at the far left, it is a sine wave, but if the process begins a couple of samples forward, then it is a cosine wave. Thus, the Y(t) signal enters when it is multiplied by values from the sine and cosine and sums together to accomplish the FFT. The sine wave at the top can represent the +1 and \u22121's. It is possible to operate at three level or five level and reduce down to simple logical shifts instead of multiplies. Subtractions can be simple two's complement additions.","There now follows further description relating to the modulation and demodulation of the OFDM signal in accordance with a non-limiting example of the present invention.","Both the modulation and demodulation of the OFDM signal involves a Fourier transform as noted before. This generally requires multiplications, which in turn requires significant hardware resources in the FPGA, ASICs or DSPs. The system and method uses several parts that are somewhat independent of each other. It should be understood that in one part, the description is based on the modulation being QAM, including QPSK and BPSK.","Another part is the approximation of the sine\/cosine basis waveforms by square type pulses. This transforms the multiplications by sine\/cosine to simple additions. Also, in another part, the oversampling of the signals places the harmonics of the square type pulses outside the bandwidth of the oversampled OFDM signal. Limiting the scope to QAM signals has the benefit of the input signal being essentially N level signals that can be decomposed into binary pulses. As a result, the Fourier transform can be transformed into simple multiplies of type +\/\u22121, which are simple additions. Since all known OFDM systems use QAM modulation, this restriction is of no practical concern. The system and method as described can be used to approximate any OFDM modulation to any degree of precision.","Since the OFDM signal will be approximated, it is necessary to know how much distortion is acceptable. The most common forms of OFDM modulation are: QPSK, 16 QAM and 64QAM.

Another alternative is to use the 3 level signal and oversample by 6. This system as described is suited for QPSK, 16 QAM, possibly for 64 QAM.","It should be understood from the preceding that the present invention describes an efficient IFFT for use as an OFDM modulator and an efficient FFT for use as an efficient OFDM demodulator. Advantageously, the invention describes techniques to perform the IFFT modulation and FFT demodulation without using any multipliers. Thus, the modulator and demodulator can be implemented using only logical shifts, two's complement, and adders. Since the implementation complexity is determined by the number of multipliers, the invention provides significantly less implementation complexity, lower number of gates, and lower system power consumption.","On the transmitter side, the complex exponentials can be accurately stored in memory using full precision, and the subcarriers modulated using logical shifts and two's complements operations corresponding to the input digital constellation symbol value to be transmitted. This technique takes advantage of the simple digital constellation integer values. Multipliers present much more rounding error due to significant bit growth, as discussed in the preceding. Since this technique does not require multiplications, significant rounding error is avoided and the invention presented allows more accuracy in the transmitter than the conventional IFFT OFDM modulators. Thus, the present invention describes a IFFT modulator that is distortion-less and does not require multiplications.","On the receiver side, the input into the FFT is no longer simple integer digital constellation symbols. Instead, the input to the receiver's FFT consists of the output of the transmitter plus random amplitude and phase perturbations added to the signal by the transmission channel. A separate technique was described in the preceding to allow removal of multiplications for an efficient FFT implementation in an OFDM receiver. This technique uses approximations of complex exponentials in order to convert the FFT operations into simple logical shifts, two's complement, and adders. The disadvantage of this technique is that it is not distortion-less like the transmitter IFFT OFDM modulator described above. It will be appreciated that the presented FFT demodulator uses oversampling and multilevel sinusoidal approximations in order to reduce the in-band harmonic distortion, in accordance with the present invention.","Efficient storage of the complex exponentials was discussed in the preceding and is applicable to both the IFFT modulator and the FFT demodulator, in accordance with the present invention. The complete storage of the complex exponentials would normally require both the real (cosine) and imaginary (sine) components to be stored in memory (or generated as needed) for each subcarrier. Since the sine can be derived from the cosine, only the real-part needs to be stored. Secondly, since each frequency is an integer multiple of the lowest frequency sinusoid, only the lowest frequency sinusoid needs to be stored. Thus, all of the complex exponentials can be generated from one sinusoid. Advantageously, use of this invention does not restrict the number of subcarriers N to a power of 2.","An example of a radio that can be used with such system and method is a Falcon\u2122 III radio manufactured and sold by Harris Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The Falcon\u2122 III can include a basic transmit switch, and other functional switches and controls known to those skilled in the art. It should be understood that different radios can be used, including but not limited to software defined radios that can be typically implemented with relatively standard processor and hardware components. One particular class of software radio is the Joint Tactical Radio (JTR), which includes relatively standard radio and processing hardware along with any appropriate waveform software modules to implement desired communication waveforms. JTR radios also use operating system software that conforms to the software communications architecture (SCA) specification (see www.jtrs.saalt.mil), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The SCA is an open architecture framework that specifies how hardware and software components are to interoperate so that different manufacturers and developers can readily integrate the respective components into a single device.","The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Component Architecture (SCA) defines a set of interfaces and protocols, often based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), for implementing a Software Defined Radio (SDR). In part, JTRS and its SCA are used with a family of software re-programmable radios. As such, the SCA is a specific set of rules, methods, and design criteria for implementing software re-programmable digital radios.","The JTRS SCA specification is published by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO). The JTRS SCA has been structured to provide for portability of applications software between different JTRS SCA implementations, leverage commercial standards to reduce development cost, reduce development time of new waveforms through the ability to reuse design modules, and build on evolving commercial frameworks and architectures.","The JTRS SCA is not a system specification, as it is intended to be implementation independent, but a set of rules that constrain the design of systems to achieve desired JTRS objectives. The software framework of the JTRS SCA defines the Operating Environment (OE) and specifies the services and interfaces that applications use from that environment. The SCA OE comprises a Core Framework (CF), a CORBA middleware, and an Operating System (OS) based on the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) with associated board support packages. The JTRS SCA also provides a building block structure (defined in the API Supplement) for defining application programming interfaces (APIs) between application software components.","The JTRS SCA Core Framework (CF) is an architectural concept defining the essential, \u201ccore\u201d set of open software Interfaces and Profiles that provide for the deployment, management, interconnection, and intercommunication of software application components in embedded, distributed-computing communication systems. Interfaces may be defined in the JTRS SCA Specification. However, developers may implement some of them, some may be implemented by non-core applications (i.e., waveforms, etc.), and some may be implemented by hardware device providers.","For purposes of description only, a brief description of an example of a communications system that would benefit from the present invention is described relative to a non-limiting example shown in .
