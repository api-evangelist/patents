The specific component  may further receive additional information (environment information, time information and the like) by means of the communication unit. In this instance, the information may be received from another component. That is, at least energy information is contained in the received information.","The specific component  may be a component that constitutes the UAN  or a component that constitutes the HAN .","As described above, the energy information  may be one of information related to electricity, water, gas and the like. Hereinafter, information related to electricity will be described as an example of the energy information, but information related to other energy sources may be identically applied.","For example, the kind of information related to the electricity may include time-based pricing, curtailment, grid emergency, grid reliability, energy increment, operation priority, and the like.","The information may be divided into scheduled information previously produced based on previous information, and real-time information changed in real time. The scheduled information and the real-time information may be divided by whether or not predict information after the current time (in the future).","The energy information  may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the energy information  may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","The energy information  may be divided into time of use (TOU) information, critical peak pattern (CPP) information or real time pattern (RTP) information according to the change in the pattern of data with respect to time.","According to the TOU information, a data is changed step by step depending on time. According to the CPP information, a data is changed step by step or in real time depending on time, and emphasis is displayed at a specific point of time. According to RTP information, a data is changed in real time depending on time.","In a case where the energy information is time-based pricing information as an example, the time-based pricing information is changed. The time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be transmitted\/received as a real price. Alternatively, the time-based pricing information may be transmitted\/received by being divided into a plurality of levels.","In a case where the specific component  receives a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal, one signal may be recognized as an on-peak signal, and the other signal may be recognized as an off-peak signal.","Alternatively, the specific component  may recognize information on at least one drive, which contains the time-based information, and may recognize an on-peak or off-peak signal by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","For example, in a case where the specific component  recognizes information divided into levels or real pricing information, it recognizes an on-peak or off-peak signals by comparing the value of the recognized information with the value of reference information.","In this case, the value of the information on drive may be at least one of time-based pricing, electric energy, the variation of time-based pricing, the variation of electric energy, the average of time-based pricing and the average of electric energy. The value of reference information may be at least one of an average, the average between maximum and minimum values of power information during a predetermined period of time and the reference variation of power information during the predetermined period of time (e.g., the slope of consumed electric energy per unit time).","The value of reference information may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The value of reference information may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","In a case where the specific component  (e.g., the energy consumption component) recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased. The driving scheme of the specific component may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal posterior to the start of operation.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output is maintained under an operable condition. In this case, the operable condition means that the value of the information on drive is less than a predetermined reference. The value of the information on drive may be time-based pricing, consumed electric energy, operation time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The predetermined reference may be determined in real time or may be previously determined. The predetermined reference may be determined on the UAN or may be determined on the HAN (a customer's direct input or an input from the energy management component, the central management component or the like).","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component  recognizes high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained or increased when the difference between a state information value and a reference value is within a predetermined range. For example, in a case where a compressor of a refrigerator is not operated in a low-cost section, the temperature of a cool chamber or freezing chamber is increased. Therefore, the compressor is necessarily turned on when the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber approaches a reference temperature. In a case where a high-cost section comes after the compressor is turned on, the compressor maintains a current output when the difference between the temperature of the cool chamber or freezing chamber and the reference temperature is within a predetermined range. In a case where a user selects a button for cancelling power saving in the state that the specific component  recognizes the high-cost information, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an on-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. However, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total output amount of the specific component during the entire drive period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level. Alternatively, although the output is increased at the point of time when the specific component recognizes the on-peak signal, the total consumed power or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire operation period may be decreased as compared that when the specific component is operated at a normal output level.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output (change in the state of cool air that is a medium for performing the function of the refrigerator). In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated (storage of hot water that is an additional medium for performing the function of the washing machine or washer). Alternatively, in a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, cool air may be stored in a separate supercooling chamber by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","The curtailment information is information related to a mode in which the specific component is stopped or a small amount of time-based pricing is taken. As an example, the curtailment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","If the specific component  recognizes curtailment information, the output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased as described above.","The grid emergency information is information related to a power failure or the like. As an example, the grid emergency information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system. The information related to a power failure or the like has a relation with the reliability of a component using energy.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes grid emergency information, it may be immediately shut down.","The grid reliability information is information related to the supply amount of electricity supplied or information related to the quality of electricity. The grid reliability information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system, or may be determined by a component (e.g., an electric home appliance) through the frequency of AC power supplied to the component.","That is, if a frequency lower than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is small (information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied). If a frequency higher than the frequency of AC power supplied to the component is sensed, it may be determined that the amount of electricity supplied is large (information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied).","In a case where the specific component recognizes shortage of the amount of electricity or poor quality of electricity in the grid reliability information, an output may be determined as zero (stop or maintenance of a stop state) or may be decreased. If necessary, the output may be restored or increased.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component recognizes the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied, the output may be increased, or the operation may be converted from an off-state to an on-state.","The energy increment information is information related to a state that surplus electricity is generated because the amount of electricity used by a component is less than that of power generation. As an example, the energy increment information may be transmitted\/received as a true or false signal such as a Boolean signal on the network system.","In a case where the specific component  recognizes energy increment information, the output may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the drive of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output among a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component  is the energy storage component  or , the energy storage component  or  may store electricity by receiving the electricity supplied from the UAN, for example, when electricity storage cost is smaller than a predetermined value.","However, in a case where the energy storage component  is connected to the energy generation component  that constitutes the HAN, it may continuously store energy generated by the energy generation component  until the electricity storage is completed. That is, the energy generated while the energy generation component  generates energy may be stored in the energy storage component .","The presence of completion of the electricity storage is determined while the energy storage component  or  stores electricity. In a case where the electricity storage is completed, the electricity supply for the electricity storage is cut off. Specifically, the presence of completion of the electricity storage may be determined using a sensor that senses the voltage, temperature or current of the energy storage component  or . The cutoff of the electricity supply may be performed using a switch (or circuit breaker) provided to a supply stage through which the electricity is supplied to the energy storage unit  or .","The electricity storage cost may be cost consumed in the electricity storage for a specific time period or electricity cost at a specific time.","As an example, in a case where the electricity storage cost is in an off-peak section (in a case where the specific component recognizes low-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity. Alternatively, in a case where an on-peak section corresponds to an allowance section (in a case where the specific component recognizes high-cost information which will be described later), the energy storage component  or  may store in the on-peak section. In this instance, the allowance section is a section in which a power consumption information value is less than a predetermined reference. The power consumption information value may be a electricity cost, a power consumption amount, a time range, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a predetermined cost, a predetermined power consumption amount, a predetermined time, or the like. The predetermined reference may be a relative value or absolute value, and may be changed automatically or manually.","The energy storage component  or  may store a counter electromotive force generated when an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component is stopped (rotated).","Alternatively, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity using an energy consumption component that is rotatably operated or a motor provided to the energy consumption component. For example, in a case where the energy consumption component is a refrigerator, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a fan motor provided to the refrigerator is rotated (the fan motor may serve as a power generator or may be connected to the power generator). Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component is a washing machine, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor that rotates a drum for accommodating the laundry is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is a cooking appliance, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a cooling fan is rotated. In a case where the energy consumption component is an air cleaner, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when a motor for rotating a fan is rotated. That is, in this embodiment, in a case where a motor is provided regardless of the kind of the energy consumption component, the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generated when the motor is rotated. Alternatively, in a case where a power generator is connected to a fan rotated by the flow of air (natural flow or forcible flow), the energy storage component  or  may store electricity generaged by the power generator.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to one or more energy consumption components . In a case where electricity cost is higher than a reference value, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . As an example, in a case where the electricity cost is an on-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the high-cost information), the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component . In a case where the electricity cost is an off-peak (in a case where the specific component recognizes the low-cost information) but is close to the on-peak, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. If the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  is less than a predetermined value, electricity generated in the energy generation component  is supplied to the energy consumption component. Thus, it is possible to prevent the operation of the energy consumption component from being stopped due to the cutoff of the electricity supply while the energy consumption component is operated.","In a case where the supply of electricity generated in the energy generation component  is cut off by interruption of electric power, the electricity stored in the energy component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component. In a case where the energy consumption component is an electric product, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to a communication unit or control unit provided to the electric product.","The electricity stored in the energy component  or may be supplied to a portion of a plurality of energy consumption components. As an example, the stored electricity may be supplied to an electric product such as a refrigerator required in continuous operation among a plurality of electric products. Alternatively, the stored electricity may be supplied to an energy consumption component with relatively low power among a plurality of energy consumption components that constitute one electric product. It will be apparent that the stored electricity is supplied to an energy consumption component with high power. Alternatively, when a course using a relatively small amount of power is performed among a plurality of courses in which an electric product is performed, the stored electricity may be supplied. It will be apparent that the stored electricity may be supplied even when a course using a large amount of power is performed.","Meanwhile, in a case where electricity is generated and stored by a fan or motor as described above, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an energy consumption unit with relatively low power. As an example, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to an LED lamp, a display, a control unit, a communication unit, a low-power heater, or the like. Alternatively, in a case where the energy consumption component performs a plurality of courses, the electricity stored in the energy storage component  or  may be supplied to the energy consumption component in a course that requires low power.","The energy storage component  may be built in connected to one energy consumption component. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to a plurality of energy consumption components, respectively. Alternatively, a plurality of energy storage components  may be built in or connected to one energy consumption component. The plurality of energy storage components  may be connected to one another to share the stored electricity.","Among the information related to energy, the on-peak information, the curtailment information and information on the deficiency of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as high-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively expensive. In this instance, the section in which the high-cost information is recognized by the specific component may referred to as a low-cost section.","On the other hand, among the information related to energy, the off-peak information, the energy increment information and the information on the excess of the amount of electricity supplied may be recognized as low-cost information considered that energy cost is relatively cheap. In this instance, the section in which the low-cost information is recognized by the specific component may be referred to as a low-cost section.","The information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information) may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component). That is, the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component into at least two or more.","A high period means a high price time period (period of high cost) or a high pricing period and a low period means a low price time period (period of low cost) and a low pricing period.","As an example, in a case where the information related to energy is recognized as a Boolean signal, the time slot (time period) based on energy cost or pricing period (pricing zone) for determining a driving scheme of the specific component may be divided into two. In a case where the information related to energy is divided into a plurality of levels or recognized as real-time information, the time period or pricing period may be divided into three or more.","Meanwhile, the information related to energy cost corresponding to at least time may be recognized as information for determining a power saving driving scheme of the specific component. That is, the information related to energy cost may be recognized by dividing a time slot (time period) or pricing zone (time period) into at least two or more. As described above, the divided time period or pricing period may be determined based on the kinds of the recognized information (the Boolean signal, the plurality of levels and the real-time information).","In other words, the information related to fluctuation of energy cost may be recognized by dividing a determination factor for driving the specific component into two or more, and functions on time and energy cost may be included in the determination factor.","In a case where the information related to energy cost is divided into two levels or more, the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined according to the information divided into levels.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized information related to energy cost is not divided based on a specific reference (e.g., real-time cost information), it is compared with predetermined information, and the driving scheme of the specific component may be determined based on the compared result.","Here, the predetermined information may be reference information (e.g. reference value) for dividing the information related to energy cost, and the compared result may be whether not the information related to energy cost is more or less than the reference value.","Specifically, each of the kinds of information related to energy may be divided into first information  that is raw information, second information  that is refined information, and third information  that is information for performing the function of the specific component. That is, the first information is a raw data, the second information is a refined data, and the third information is a command for performing the function of the specific component.","The information related to energy is included a signal, and the signal is transmitted. In this instance, one or more of the first to third information may be transmitted several times while the content of the information is not converted but only the signal including the information is converted.","For example, as shown in , a component that receives a signal including the first information may convert only the signal and transmit a new signal including the first information to another component.","Therefore, it is described in this embodiment that the conversion of signal is a different concept from the conversion of information. In this instance, it can be readily understood that when the first information is converted into the second information, the signal including the first information is also converted into the signal including the second information.","However, the third information may be transmitted several times in the state that the content of the third information is converted or in the state that only the signal including the third information is converted while the content of the third information is identically maintained.","Specifically, in a case where the first information is raw information on time-based pricing, the second information may be refined information on the time-based pricing. The refined information on the time-based pricing is information in which the time-based pricing is divided into a plurality of levels or analysis information. The third information is a command generated based on the second information.","The specific component may generate, transmit or receive one or more of the first to third information. The first to third information are not necessarily transmitted or received in sequence. Only a plurality of pieces of third information without the first and second information may be transmitted in sequence or parallel. Alternatively, the first and third information may be transmitted or received together, the second and third information may be transmitted or received together, or the first and second information may be transmitted or received together.","As an example, in a case where the specific component receives the first information, it may transmit the second information or may transmit the second and third information.","In a case where the specific information receives only the third information, it may generate and transmit new third information.","Meanwhile, in the relation between two pieces of information, one is a message and the other is a response for the message. Thus, each of the components that constitute the network system may transmit or receive a message. In a case where each of the components receives a message, it may respond to the message. Therefore, in the case of an individual component, the transmission of a message is a relative concept with the response for the message.","The message may include a data (first or second information) and\/or a command (third information).","The command (third information) may include a command for storing the data, a command for generating the data, a command for processing the data (including the generation of an additional data), a command for generating an additional command, a command for transmitting the additionally generated command, a command for transmitting a received command, and the like.","In this specification, the response for the received message means storage of the data, processing of the data (including generation of an additional data), generation of a new command, transmission of the newly generated command, simple transmission of a received command (including generation of a command for transmitting the received command to another component), operation, transmission of the stored information, transmission of an acknowledge message (acknowledge character or negative acknowledge character), or the like.","For example, in a case where the message is first information, the specific component that receives the first information may generate second information by processing the first information, or may generate the second information and new third information, as a response for the message.","The specific component that receives the message may provide a response related to energy. Here, the term \u201cresponse\u201d may be understood as a concept including an operation through which the specific component can perform a function. As an example, the HAN  may perform an operation related to energy by receiving a message.","The response (operation) related to energy, provided by the specific component, will be described in detail. For example, the specific component may be an energy consumption component.","The energy consumption component may be driven so that the energy cost when it is driven based on the recognition for energy information is reduced as compared with that when it is driven without the recognition for energy information.","The specific component may include a plurality of modes in which it is driven to perform its own function. The plurality of modes are a first mode and a second mode in which energy cost is relatively saved as compared with that in the first mode. The specific component may be driven in at least one of the first and second modes.","Here, the first mode may be a general mode and the second mode may be a power saving mode. Alternatively, the first and second modes may all be power saving modes.","The general mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed without recognition of energy information. On the other hand, the power saving mode may be understood as a mode in which the function of the specific component is performed based on the recognition of energy information so as to save energy cost.","In a case where the first and second modes are power saving modes, the first mode may be specified as a driving scheme for saving energy cost and the second mode may be specified as a driving scheme in which the energy cost in the second mode is more saved than that in the first mode.","Meanwhile, in a case where the specific component (e.g., the energy consumption component) is driven, at least a portion is recognized in a driving scheme including at least drive time and course. In this case, an unrecognized portion may be generated so as to save energy cost, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme.","For example, at least a portion of the driving scheme may be recognized under the control of the energy management component, the control of the energy consumption component, or the like. In a case where a specific driving scheme is further required so as to save energy cost, an unrecognized portion of the driving scheme may be newly generated, and a recognized portion may be converted into another scheme so as to save energy.","It will be apparent that the process of generating the unrecognized portion may be omitted. In this case, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme. On the other hand, the process of converting the recognized portion into another scheme may be omitted. In this case, the process of newly generating the unrecognized portion may be performed.","The drive time may include a drive start time or drive end time. The course may include a drive period of the specific component and the power of the specific component.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be a scheme recommended by the specific component so as to save energy cost. Here, the specific component may be an energy consumption component (control component) or the energy management component.","As an example, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific drive time, the specific drive time may be converted into another time so as to save energy cost, and a specific course may be generated.","On the other hand, in a case where the recognized scheme is a specific course, the specific course may be converted into another course so as to save energy cost, and a specific time may be generated.","Under the control described above, a change in time or power may be made with respect to the output function of the specific component based on time.","The generated scheme or converted scheme may be performed within a set range. That is, in the process of recognizing at least a portion of the driving scheme, the generation or conversion of the driving scheme may be performed within a predetermined reference in which the recognized portion appears (e.g., restriction set by a user, constraint set under the control of the energy management component or energy consumption component, or the like).","Therefore, in a case where the set range is out of the predetermined reference, it is restricted to generate the unrecognized portion or to convert the recognized portion into another scheme.","Another embodiment is proposed.","Cost information may further included in the recognized driving scheme. That is, in a case where the cost information is recognized, a portion related to the drive time or course may be generated. The generated driving scheme may be recommended.","Meanwhile, a response of the specific component based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), e.g., a power control for power saving driving, may be performed. An output decrease (including an output of zero) or output increase may be included in the output control.","It is as described above that the output is decreased or zero, maintained or increased based on the recognition for the information (on-peak or off-peak) related to energy cost.","If high-cost information is recognized, the output may be zero or decreased. Specifically, the output in the recognition of the high-cost information may be decreased as compared with that in the recognition of low-cost information. As described above, the decrease of the output may be previously determined before the specific component is operated, or may be changed when the high-cost information is recognized posterior to the start of the operation of the specific component.","In a case where the output of the specific component is zero or decreased, the function to be performed by the specific component may be lost as compared with a normal case. Therefore, a response for restoring the lost function may be performed.","As an example, after the output of the specific component is decreased, the specific component may be controlled so that the total operation time of the specific component is increased or so that the output is increased in at least a time period.","In other words, if specific reference information related to energy information is recognized in a period after the output of the specific component is controlled, the response for controlling the output may be released. Here, the term \u201cperiod\u201d may be divided based on a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized.","The total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a specific target in the process of performing the function of the specific component. As an example, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (washing machine, drying machine, cooking appliance or the like) intermittently driven (or driven in a specific course), the total operation time may be understood as a time until a corresponding course is completed.","On the other hand, in a case where the specific component is an electric appliance (refrigerator, water purifier, or the like) driven at normal times, the total operation time may be understood as a time approaching a target set for performing the function of the specific component. For example, the set target may be a target temperature, a target amount of ice produced, or a target amount of clean water in the refrigerator.","The total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time set before the output of the specific component is decreased. In a case where the output of the specific component is not decreased, the total operation time may be increased as compared with the operation time of the specific component. However, although the total operation time of the specific component is increased, the specific component is controlled so that the total energy cost generated through the drive of the specific component can be saved as compared with that when the output of the specific component is not decreased.","If the high-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased.","However, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total output of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased or maintained as compared with that when the specific component is operated under a normal output. Alternatively, although the output is increased at a point of time when the high-cost information is recognized, the total power consumption or total time-based pricing of the specific component during the entire driving period may be decreased as compared with that when the specific component is operated under the normal output.","If the low-cost information is recognized, the output of the specific component may be increased. For example, in a case where the operation reservation of the specific component is set up, the driving of the specific component may be started before the setup time, or a component having a large output in a plurality of components may be first driven. In a case where the specific component is a refrigerator, supercooling may be performed by increasing an output as compared with the existing output. In a case where the specific component is a washing machine or a washer, hot water may be stored by driving a heater earlier than the time when the heater is to be operated. Alternatively, in a case where the specific component recognizes an off-peak signal (e.g., at a point of time of recognition), electricity may be stored.","Meanwhile, in a case of a specific condition (additional condition) is generated based on the information related to the fluctuation of the energy cost (high-cost or low-cost information), the response of the specific component, e.g., the output control for power saving driving, may be limited. That is, the output of the specific component may be maintained.","Here, the term \u201climitation\u201d may be understood as the release of the output control performed or not performed.","The specific condition includes a case where influence on energy cost is minute even though the output control of the specific component is not performed or a case where it is necessary to prevent a function to be performed by the specific component from being degraded when the output of the specific component is controlled.","Whether or not the influence on the energy cost is minute may be determined based on a predetermined reference (time-based pricing, power consumption or information on operation time). The predetermined reference may be a relative or absolute value.","The case where the function to be performed by the specific component is degraded may be considered as a case where the specific component is a defrosting heater, for example.","In a case where it is controlled to decrease the output in a high-cost time period and to increase the output in the low-cost time period, the driving of the defrosting heater is more frequently performed than that during a normal time (setup period). In this case, the temperature of a storage room in the refrigerator is increased, and thus, the control of the output can be limited.","Meanwhile, the specific component  may include a display unit  for displaying information. In this embodiment, the term \u201cinformation display\u201d means that visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile information is known to the outside. The display unit  may include a touch screen for selecting or inputting information. Alternatively, the specific component  may include a separate input unit for inputting information by cable or radio.","All the information (energy information or additional information except the energy information) described above may be displayed in the display unit . One of the energy information and additional information may be displayed, or two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed. That is, two or more pieces of information may be simultaneously displayed in the display unit . As an example, in a case where two or more pieces of information are simultaneously displayed, any one of the information is selected. Then, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may reduced. As another example, if any one of the two or more pieces of information is selected, the selected screen may be enlarged, and the unselected screen may disappear. In a case where specific information is selected and the selected screen is enlarged, information more specific that the previous information or information different from the previous information may be displayed on the enlarged screen. For example, in a case where the selected information is a character, graphic information may be displayed on the enlarged screen, or two or more pieces of information may be sequentially displayed on the enlarged screen. In a case where two or more pieces of information are displayed in the display unit , two or more relative positions may be varied.","Information except energy cost information and energy cost may be displayed in the display unit . The energy cost information may include current cost, past cost or estimated cost in the future.

If the remaining amount of the stored electricity is less than a predetermined value, alarm information may be displayed.","The information displayed in the display unit  may include one or more of information on number, character, sentence, figure, shape, symbol, image and light. The information displayed in the display unit  may include one or more of information on graph for each time or period, level, table. One or more of the shape, color, brightness, size, position, alarm period, alarm time of the information displayed in the display unit  may be varied.","A currently operable function (or menu) may be displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, among a plurality of functions, operable and inoperable function may be divided by size, color, position and the like, and then displayed in the display unit . Alternatively, in a case where separate input units are provided, only input units for selecting an operable function may be activated, or an input unit for selecting an operable function and an input unit for selecting an inoperable function may be displayed in different colors.","The target or display method of information displayed in the display unit  may be set and changed by a user, or may be changed automatically.","In a case where a condition for informing the user of information is satisfied, specific information may be displayed in the display unit . It will be apparent that a portion of a plurality pieces of information may be continuously displayed in the state that a component is turned on. The display time of the information may be changed or set automatically or manually.","If specific information (one or more pieces of information) is selected using the input unit, the selected information may be displayed. If a user contacts a portion of a component, e.g., an input unit, a handle, a display or the like, regardless of information display selection, or operates one or more buttons or knobs that constitute the input unit, a portion of the information may be displayed. In this instance, the information to be displayed may be set or changed. It will be apparent that a sensing unit for sensing a user's contact may be provided to the component. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed by installation environment or variation of outdoor environment. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the specific component receives new information. Alternatively, the specific information may be displayed when the kind or state of the specific component is changed. As an example, if a light emitting unit is turned off in an off-peak section and an on-peak section comes, the light emitting unit may be turned on. Alternatively, the specific information may be automatically displayed when the operation or state of the component is changed. As an example, in a case where the mode of the component is changed, information related to the changed mode may be automatically displayed.","Meanwhile, the display unit  may be separably connected or fixed to the component . In a case where the display unit  is separable from the component , it may perform wired or wireless communication with the component  (or control unit of the component).

On the other hand, in a case where the display unit  is not communicated with the component  or information is not included in the communication signal due to the weak intensity of the signal, the display unit may be in an unavailable state. One of the display unit  and the component  transmits a communication signal, and the other of the display unit  and the component  transmits a response signal. The presence of use of the display unit  may be determined by the presence of reception of the communication and response signals and the signal intensity. That is, in a case where any one of the display unit  and the component  does not receive a signal or the intensity of received signal is less than a reference intensity, it may be determined that the display unit  is unavailable. Any one of the display unit  and the component  may increase the intensity of a transmission signal until it receives a response signal of which intensity is more than the reference intensity.","Information for informing the user of the presence of use of the display unit  may be displayed in the display unit  or the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is unavailable, the component  may be controlled to increase its unique performance, to perform a door locking function or to limit its operation. Alternatively, the power of the component may be off while maintaining the power of a communication apparatus (modem) required to perform communication in the network system. Alternatively, the power of the component may be off while maintaining only a memory function for storing the state information of the component.","Meanwhile, sensors may be provided to the respective display unit  and component  so as to sense the presence of mounting of the display unit . As an example, the presence of mounting of the display unit  may be determined when the component  is operated. Each of the sensors may be a vibration sensor for sensing vibration. If the display unit  is mounted on the component , vibration generated in the operation of the component  can be transferred to the display unit . Therefore, in a case where the difference between the values of vibrations respectively sensed by the sensors is less than a predetermined value, it may be recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component . If it is recognized that the display unit  is mounted on the component , the operation of the component  may be controlled so that vibration or noise generated in the operation of the component  is decreased.

Also, the communication member  may communicate with the control part . The control part  may receive at least one of first to third information pieces through the communication member .","The control part  may recognize energy-related information, and control the motor  according to recognized information. That is, the control part  may recognize high price-related information or low price-related information. When the control part  recognizes high price-related information, the control part  may control an operation of the motor  to decrease energy consumption and\/or energy price.","The input part  may include a course selection part  for selecting various washing courses, and a mode selection part  for selecting a normal mode and a power saving mode.","A washing course may be an operation of the component  in which a washing process, a rinsing process, and a dehydrating process are sequentially and automatically performed. In the washing process, a washing target is washed using washing water and detergent. In the rinsing process, washing water removes a detergent residue and a contaminant from the washing target. In the dehydrating process, washing water is removed from the washing target.","For example, the course selection part  may be a rotary knob. Printed matters corresponding to washing courses may be disposed around the rotary knob, so that a user can select one of the washing courses by rotating the rotary knob. The rotary knob includes LEDs corresponding to the washing courses, respectively. Thus, when a specific course is selected, an LED corresponding thereto emits light, so that a user can easily recognize the selected course.","Before an operation of the component  is started, the normal mode or the power saving mode may be selected using the mode selection part . Furthermore, while the component  is operated in a selected mode, the selected mode may be switched to the normal mode or the power saving mode.","The control part  may variously control the motor  during a washing course. That is, various types of driving including normal driving and spin driving may be performed on the drum. The normal driving is a drum driving motion (a tumbling motion or a general motion) in which a washing target is raised up and dropped down during a washing or rinsing operation of a typical drum washing machine. The spin driving is a drum driving motion (a spin motion) in which a washing target attached to an inner portion of the drum is continually rotated during a dehydrating operation.","According to the current embodiment, a drum driving motion includes a revolutions per minute (RPM) speed of the drum and a motion of a washing target within the drum according to the RPM speed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0339","num":"0338"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A to 13G","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13D","FIG. 13E","FIG. 13F","FIG. 13G"]},"Referring to , drum driving motions are combinations of rotation directions and rotation speeds of the drum, and a drop direction and a drop time point of a washing target in the drum are varied according to the drum driving motions, thereby varying movement of the washing target in the drum. The drum driving motions are performed by controlling the motor .","When the drum is rotated, a washing target is raised by a lift (not shown) disposed on the inner circumferential surface of the drum. Thus, impact applied to a washing target can be varied by controlling a rotation speed and a rotation direction of the drum. That is, mechanical force such as friction between washing targets, friction between a washing target and washing water, and drop impact of a washing target can be varied. In other words, a degree of beating or rubbing a washing target, and a degree of dispersing or overturning washing targets can be varied.","As such, an component according to the current embodiment can vary a drum driving motion, depending on the type of a washing target, a contaminated degree of the washing target, each process of the component, and detail operations constituting each process. Thus, the washing target can be treated using optimal mechanical force. Accordingly, the washing target is washed more efficiently. In addition, an increase of washing time due to an unvaried drum driving motion is prevented.","The motor  may be a direct connection type motor to perform various drum driving motions. For example, a stator of a motor may be fixed behind a tub (not shown, which is disposed outside of a drum, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted since the tub is a typical configuration), and the drum may be directly driven by rotation of a rotor of the motor. In this case, a time delay or backlash is maximally prevented by controlling a rotation direction and torque of the motor. Thus, a drum driving motion can be quickly controlled.","When torque of a motor is transmitted to a rotation shaft through a member such as a pulley, a drum driving motion in which a time delay or backlash is allowed, for example, tumbling driving or spin driving can be performed. Since methods of driving a motor and a drum would be obvious to a person skilled in the art, a description thereof will be omitted.","Referring to , in a rolling motion, the motor  rotates the drum in a rotation direction, and a washing target located on the inner circumferential surface of the drum is controlled to be dropped to the lowest point of the drum from a region within about 90 degrees in the rotation direction of the drum.","That is, when the motor  rotates the drum, e.g., at about 40 RPM, a washing target located at the lowest point of the drum is raised to a predetermined height in a rotation direction of the drum and is then returned through rolling-like movement to the lowest point of the drum from a position that is within about 90 degrees in the rotation direction of the drum from the lowest point thereof. As illustrated in , when the drum rotates clockwise (on the basis of ), washing targets continually roll in a third quadrant of the drum.","In the rolling motion, washing targets are washed through friction between the washing targets, friction between the washing targets and washing water, and friction between the washing targets and the inner circumferential surface of the drum. In addition, a washing target is sufficiently overturned in the rolling motion, which provides a smooth rub effect.","In this case, an RPM speed of the drum is determined according to the radius of the drum. In particular, when the drum is rotated, centrifugal force is applied to a washing target in the drum. Movement of the washing target in the drum is varied according to the difference between the centrifugal force and the force of gravity. In addition, the movement of the washing target is affected by torque of the drum and frictional force between the drum and the washing target. Thus, in the rolling motion, an RPM speed of the drum is determined such that the centrifugal force and the friction force are smaller than the force of gravity (1G).","Referring to , in a tumbling motion, the motor  rotates the drum in a rotation direction, and a washing target located on the inner circumferential surface of the drum is controlled to be dropped to the lowest point of the drum from a region within about 90 to 110 degrees in the rotation direction of the drum.","That is, a washing target put in the drum is located at the lowest point of the drum before the motor  is driven. When the motor  provides torque to the drum, the drum is rotated, and the lift disposed on the inner circumferential surface of the drum moves the washing target from the lowest point of the drum to a predetermined height. For example, when the motor  rotates the drum at about 46 RPM, a washing target is dropped to the lowest point of the drum from a region that is within about 90 to 110 degrees in a rotation direction of the drum from the lowest point thereof.","An RPM speed of the drum is determined such that centrifugal force generated in the tumbling motion is greater than that of the rolling motion and is smaller than the force of gravity. As illustrated in , when the drum is rotated clockwise in the tumbling motion, a washing target is moved from the lowest point of the drum to a portion of a second quadrant of the drum through the third quadrant and is then dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum to the lowest point of the drum.","Accordingly, the washing target is washed by friction with washing water and impact due to the drop, and thus, is washed and rinsed using mechanical force greater than that of the rolling motion. In addition, since washing targets are spaced a predetermined distance from the inner circumferential surface of the drum before the washing targets are dropped, the washing targets are separated from each other and are dispersed.","Referring to , in a step motion, the motor  rotates the drum in a rotation direction, and a washing target located on the inner circumferential surface of the drum is controlled to be dropped to the lowest point of the drum from the uppermost point (at about 180 degrees) in the rotation direction of the drum.","For example, when the motor  rotates the drum at about 60 RPM or higher, centrifugal force prevents a washing target from being dropped while the washing target is rotated. As such, the drum is rotated at a speed such that centrifugal force prevents a washing target from being dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, and then the drum is quickly stopped, to thereby maximize impact applied to the washing target.","The motor  is controlled to rotate the drum at a speed (about 60 RPM or higher) such that centrifugal force prevents a washing target from being dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, and then to provide reverse torque to the drum when the washing target approaches the uppermost point of the drum (at 180 degrees in the rotation direction).","Thus, after the washing target is lifted in the rotation direction from the lowest point of the drum, just when the drum is stopped by the reverse torque from the motor , the washing target is dropped from the uppermost point to the lowest point. Thus, in the step motion, a washing target located in the drum is washed by impact generated when a drop distance of the washing target is maximized. Mechanical force generated in the step motion is greater than the mechanical force of the rolling motion or the tumbling motion.","As illustrated in , the drum is rotated clockwise in the step motion, a washing target is moved from the lowest point of the drum to the uppermost point of the drum through the third and second quadrants and is then suddenly dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum to the lowest point of the drum. As such, the step motion maximizes the drop distance of a washing target in the drum. Thus, when a laundry amount is small, the step motion can provide mechanical force more effectively.","The motor  may undergo an opposite phase brake process for stopping the drum. In the opposite phase brake process, a motor is stopped by generating torque in a direction opposite to a rotation direction of the motor. To this end, a phase of current supplied to the motor may be reversed. The opposite phase brake process can quickly stop a motor. Thus, the opposite phase brake process is most appropriate for the step motion that provides strong impact to a washing target.","After the opposite phase brake process, the motor  applies torque to the drum to lift the washing target from the lowest point to the uppermost point. That is, in the step motion, clockwise torque is applied to the drum, then, counterclockwise torque for quickly stopping the drum is momentarily applied thereto, and then, clockwise torque is applied again to the drum.","As a result, in the step motion: when the drum rotates, a washing target is washed by friction with washing water introduced through an opening of the drum; and when the washing target arrives at the uppermost point, the washing target is dropped to be washed by impact.","Referring to , in a swing motion, the motor  rotates the drum in both rotation directions, and a washing target is controlled to be dropped from regions located at about 90 degrees in the rotation directions of the drum.","That is, when the motor  rotates the drum counterclockwise, e.g., at about 40 RPM, a washing target located at the lowest point of the drum is lifted counterclockwise to a predetermined height.","When the washing target is lifted to a region located at about 90 degrees counterclockwise, the motor  stops the drum to move the washing target to the lowest point.","After that, the motor  rotates the drum clockwise, e.g., at about 40 RPM, and the dropped washing target is lifted clockwise to a predetermined height. When the washing target is lifted to a region located at about 90 degrees clockwise, the motor  stops the drum to move the washing target to the lowest point.","That is, in the swing motion, a rotation of the drum in a direction, a stop of the drum, a rotation of the drum in a reverse direction, and a stop of the drum are repeated. As illustrated in , an operation in which a washing target is lifted from the third quadrant of the drum to a portion of the second quadrant and is then gently dropped, and an operation in which the washing target is lifted from a fourth quadrant of the drum to a portion of a first quadrant thereof and is then gently dropped may be repeated.","At this point, the motor  undergoes a generator brake process to minimize a load applied to the motor  and mechanical abrasion thereof and adjust impact to a washing target.","In the generator brake process, a motor functions as a generator by means of rotational inertia by cutting off current applied to the motor. When the current applied to the motor is cut off, the direction of current flowing through a coil of the motor is reversed from the direction before the cutting off. Accordingly, force is generated in a direction of interrupting a rotation of the motor (according to Fleming's right hand rule), thereby stopping the motor. Unlike the opposite phase brake process, a motor is not quickly stopped in the generator brake process, but a rotation direction of the drum is smoothly changed.","Thus, in the swing motion as illustrated in , a washing target is moved in a horizontal eight shape within both the third and fourth quadrants.","The swing motion may be performed at least one time in a wool course, a delicate course, or a sportswear course. The wool course is used to wash a hand-washable target formed of wool. The delicate course is used to wash a garment including an accessory, a metal ornament or delicate fibers such as silk or plastic fibers. The sportswear course is used to wash a washing target formed of a functional material having excellent perspiration absorbing performance and permeability, such as a hiking outfit or sportswear.","If such a washing target is washed using great mechanical force, the washing target may be damaged. Thus, the washing target may be gently washed using the swing motion.","Referring to , in a scrub motion, the motor  rotates the drum in both rotation directions, and a washing target is controlled to be dropped from regions located at about 90 degrees or greater in the rotation directions of the drum.","That is, when the motor  rotates the drum counterclockwise, e.g., at about 60 RPM, a washing target located at the lowest point of the drum is lifted counterclockwise to a predetermined height. When the washing target is passed by a region located at about 90 degrees counterclockwise, the motor  provides reverse torque to the drum to temporarily stop the drum. Accordingly, the washing target is quickly dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum.","After that, the motor  rotates the drum clockwise, e.g., at about 60 RPM, and the dropped washing target is lifted clockwise to a predetermined height. When the washing target is passed by a region located at about 90 degrees clockwise, the motor  provides reverse torque to the drum to temporarily stop the drum. Accordingly, the washing target is dropped to the lowest point from the region located at about 90 degrees clockwise on the inner circumferential surface of the drum.","Thus, the scrub motion washes a washing target by quickly dropping the washing target from a predetermined height. The motor  may undergo an opposite phase brake operation for stopping the drum.","Since a rotation direction of the drum is quickly changed, a washing target is not significantly moved away from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, which provides a strong scrub effect. In the scrub motion, an operation in which a washing target is lifted from the third quadrant of the drum to a portion of the second quadrant and is then quickly dropped, and an operation in which the washing target is lifted from the fourth quadrant of the drum to a portion of the first quadrant and is then dropped are repeated. Thus, as illustrated in , a lifted washing target is repeatedly moved downward along the inner circumferential surface of the drum.","Referring to , in a filtration motion, washing water is injected into the drum and the motor  rotates the drum such that centrifugal force prevents a washing target from being dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum.","That is, a washing target is spread and then tightly contacts the inner circumferential surface of the drum. In this state, the drum is rotated, and washing water is injected into the drum. Accordingly, centrifugal force discharges the washing water to the tub through the washing target and through holes of the drum. Thus, the filtration motion increases a surface area of a washing target, and passes washing water through the washing target, thereby uniformly supplying the washing water to the washing target.","Referring to , in a squeeze motion, an operation, in which the motor  rotates the drum such that centrifugal force prevents a washing target from being dropped from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, and an operation, in which a rotation speed of the drum is decreased to remove the washing target from the inner circumferential surface of the drum, are repeated, and washing water is injected into the drum during the rotation of the drum.","That is, the filtration motion continually rotates a washing target at a constant speed without a drop of the washing target to the inner circumferential surface, whereas the squeeze motion varies a rotation speed of the drum to repeat tight contact of a washing target with the inner circumferential surface and removal of the washing target from the inner circumferential surface.","Although a process of injecting washing water into the drum in the filtration motion and the squeeze motion is not shown, a circulation passage and a pump may be used for the process. The pump may communicate with a bottom surface of the tub to press washing water, and the circulation passage may have an end connected to the pump and another end for injecting washing water from the upper side of the drum to the inside of the drum.","Since the circulation passage and the pump are used for injecting washing water stored in the tub, an injection water supply passage connected to a water supply source outside of a cabinet may be used to inject washing water into the drum.","That is, a side portion of the injection water supply passage may be connected to a water supply source, and another side thereof may be connected to the tub, and a nozzle may inject washing water into the drum. In this case, washing water can be injected into the drum during the filtration motion and the squeeze motion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0383","num":"0382"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A to 14D","FIG. 13C"]},"Referring to , when the motor  applies torque to the drum in a predetermined rotation direction, the drum is rotated in the predetermined rotation direction. Accordingly, a washing target is lifted, tightly contacting the inner circumferential surface of the drum. At this point, the drum may be rotated, e.g., at about 60 RPM or higher such that the washing target is lifted, tightly contacting the inner circumferential surface of the drum. In this case, the rotation speed of the drum is determined according to the inner diameter of the drum, and is determined such that centrifugal force is greater than the force of gravity. Just before the washing target arrives at the uppermost point of the drum after a region located at about 90 degrees in the rotation direction of the drum, the motor  undergoes the opposite phase brake process for temporarily stopping the drum.","Since an opposite phase brake time point of the motor  is closely connected to a position of a washing target in the drum, a device for determining or predicting a position of a washing target may be provided. For example, a sensing device including a hall effect sensor for determining a rotation angle of the rotor may be provided. The control part  can determine not only a rotation angle of the rotor but also a rotation direction thereof, by using the hall effect sensor. This would be obvious to a person skilled in the art, and thus a detail description thereof will be omitted.","The control part  determines a rotation angle of the drum, by using the sensing device, and controls the motor  to undergo the opposite phase brake process before the drum arrives at a region located at about 180 degrees.","Accordingly, the drum rotating clockwise is temporarily stopped. At this point, a rotation angle of the drum is substantially about 180 degrees, and the washing target is dropped from the uppermost point to the lowest point. After that, current is continually applied to continually rotate the drum clockwise.","Although the drum is rotated clockwise in , the drum may be rotated counterclockwise for the step motion. Since the step motion applies a great load to the motor , it may be needed to decrease an actual operation rate.","The actual operation rate is a ratio of driving time of a motor to the sum of the driving time and stop time of the motor. When the actual operation rate is 1, a motor is driven without a stop. For example, the actual operation rate may be about 70% according to a load to the motor  in the step motion, and the motor  may be driven for about 10 seconds and be stopped for about 4 seconds.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0390","num":"0389"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A to 15F","FIG. 13E"]},"Referring to , when the motor  applies torque to the drum, a washing target is rotated clockwise in the drum.

After that, when the washing target passes by a region located at about 90 degrees clockwise, the motor  undergoes the opposite phase brake process. Accordingly, the washing target tightly contacting the inner circumferential surface of the drum is dropped to the lowest point of the drum.","Then, the motor  provides counterclockwise torque to the drum. Accordingly, the dropped washing target is rotated counterclockwise, tightly contacting the inner circumferential surface of the drum, and is located between the uppermost point of the drum and a region located at about 90 degrees counterclockwise from the lowest point. At this point, the motor  undergoes the opposite phase brake process.

A vertical axis denotes vibration or noise level, and vibration level is increased toward the upper side of the vertical axis, whereas washing time for a washing target is decreased toward the upper side of the vertical axis.","The step motion and the scrub motion are excellent in cleaning performance and are thus appropriate to a severely contaminated washing target or a washing course for decreasing washing time. The step motion and the scrub motion have high vibration and noise level and are thus inappropriate to a delicate washing target or a washing course requiring minimized vibration and noise level.","The rolling motion is excellent in cleaning performance and has low vibration level. In addition, the rolling motion minimizes damage to a washing target and decreases load to a motor. Thus, the rolling motion can be applied to any washing course, particularly, to a course of dissolving a detergent in an initial washing stage and a course of soaking a washing target.","The cleaning performance of the tumbling motion is lower than that of the scrub motion, and the vibration level thereof is between those of the scrub motion and the rolling motion. The rolling motion has low vibration level, but washing time thereof is longer than that of the tumbling motion. Thus, the tumbling motion can be applied to any washing course, particularly, to a course of dispersing washing targets.","The cleaning performance of the squeeze motion is similar to that of the tumbling motion, and the vibration level thereof is higher than that of the tumbling motion. While tight contact of a washing target with the inner circumferential surface of a drum and removal of the washing target therefrom are repeated in the squeeze motion, washing water is discharged out of the drum through the washing target.

One of washing courses may be selected using the course selection part , and at least one of a normal motion and specific motions is performed in each course.","When an operation course is selected, the component senses a laundry amount in operation S to determine washing time and an water supply amount, and performs a laundry process in operation S. In operation S, the component determines whether a power saving mode is selected. If the power saving mode is selected, the power saving mode is performed. If a normal mode is selected, the normal mode is performed. That is, if the normal mode is selected, the selected course is normally performed in operation S. In the current embodiment, the sentence \u201ca selected course is normally performed\u201d means that various motions and functions in the selected course are performed without a change. It may be determined whether the power saving mode is selected before or after the laundry process is started.","If the power saving mode is selected, while the component performs the laundry process, it is determined in operation S whether the control part recognizes high price-related information. The high price-related information may be determined by the control part or be received from the outside of the component.","If the control part recognizes high price-related information, the control part controls the component to perform an energy saving operation in operation S. In particular, if the control part recognizes high price-related information while the component performs a specific motion, the control part controls the component to perform a normal motion. For example, if high price-related information is recognized while the rolling motion is performed in the washing process, the tumbling motion is performed.","While the component performs the energy saving operation, it is determined in operation S whether high price-related information is not recognized. According to the current embodiment, a failure in recognizing high price-related information may mean recognition of low price-related information.","If high price-related information is not recognized while the component performs the energy saving operation, the component normally performs the selected course in operation S. If high price-related information is not recognized while the component performs the normal motion, the specific motion to be performed at a time point when high price-related information is not recognized is performed.","A case will now be exemplified, in which when the component normally performs the washing process, the scrub motion is performed for about 30 minutes and the rolling motion is performed for about 30 minutes. When the scrum motion is performed for about 10 minutes, high price-related information may be recognized, and a high price time period may be about 30 minutes. In this case, after the normal motion is performed, when high price-related information is not recognized, the component does not perform the scrum motion and perform the rolling motion. Operations S to S may be performed one or more times.","While the component normally performs the selected course, when the selected course is completed, the component is stopped in operation S.","Reference values for determining high price-related information to change a motion may be set, thereby preventing a frequent motion change while the component is operated.","For example, when high price-related information (e.g., an on-peak) is recognized using an energy price, reference values for changing a motion may be set to an A value and a B value smaller than the A value.","When energy price-related information is real-time information, and a current price is greater than the A value, the on-peak is recognized. Then, a specific motion performed by the component is changed into the normal motion. The energy price may be varied during the normal motion. When the energy price is equal to or smaller than the B value, it is determined that the high price-related information is not recognized, and the component performs the specific motion again. When the energy price increases to be equal to or greater than the A value during the specific motion, the normal motion is performed again. Thus, according to the current embodiment, a frequent motion change according to a price variation can be prevented.","Alternatively, on\/off peaks may be recognized using a reference value.","Although a specific motion is changed into the normal motion when high price-related information is recognized according to the current embodiment, a specific motion may not be changed. For example, when a selected course is one of the wool course, the delicate course, and the sportswear course, the swing motion may be performed. In this case, even in the case that high price-related information is recognized, the swing motion may not be changed. This is because protection of a washing target is more important than energy saving. Thus, a process of determining whether a motion change is needed when high price-related information is recognized may be added. That is, when high price-related information is recognized, it may be determined that a change of a method of controlling the motor  is needed. When a motion change is unneeded (when one of the wool course, the delicate course, and the sportswear course is selected), a current motion is maintained. When a motion change is needed, a current motion is changed into the normal motion.","Although a motion is immediately changed when high price-related information is recognized according to the current embodiment, a motion may not immediately be changed. For example, when high price-related information is recognized, the high price-related information may be transmitted to a mobile device of a user. In this case, only when the user selects a motion change, a motion is changed. Alternatively, when high price-related information is recognized, a motion may be immediately changed, and information denoting the change of the motion may be transmitted to a mobile device of a user.","According to the current embodiment, when high price-related information is recognized, a specific motion is changed into the normal motion, thereby decreasing energy costs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0422","num":"0421"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},"Hereinafter, a washing machine will be exemplified as the washing device.","Referring to , a component  according to the current embodiment may include: a control part ; a communication member ; an input part  for inputting an operation condition; a display part  for displaying at least one of an operation state, energy-related information, and addition information; a water discharge pump  for discharging wasted washing water; and a water level sensor  for sensing the level of washing water.","The communication member  may communicate with a component constituting a home network, or an utility network.
