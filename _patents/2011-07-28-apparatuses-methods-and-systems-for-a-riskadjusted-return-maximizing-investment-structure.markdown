In one implementation, the RAR-MAX server  may comprise a wide variety of different devices and technologies such as, but not limited to, mobile devices, laptop computers, desktop computers, work stations, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the RAR-MAX server may be housed remotely to the user , wherein the user  may operate a personal device (e.g., a mobile device, a personal computer, etc.) to exchange data with the RAR-MAX server. In another implementation, the RAR-MAX server may be housed within a location of the user, who may directly interact with and\/or operate the RAR-MAX server\/apparatus.","In some embodiments, the RAR-MAX server  may receive market data  from a public trade platform , such as, but not limited to Dow Jones Industry Average (DJIA), S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, S&P\/TSX Composite Index, and\/or the like. In one implementation, the public trade platform  may comprise a stock exchange platform, such as New York Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, and\/or the like. In another implementation, the public trade platform  may comprise a market data center, such as Bloomberg, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, Capital Market Daily, and\/or the like.","In one implementation, the RAR-MAX server  may analyze market data and the user's investment request  to submit a proposed transaction  to the public trading platform  for execution. For example, the user  may make an order via the RAR-MAX server, which may in turn generate a HTTPS message to the trading floor.","In some implementations, the RAR-MAX server  may return a proposed portfolio construction  to the user , and may monitor the investment return  for the user.","In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX server may communicate with a RAR-MAX database . In some embodiments, distributed RAR-MAX databases may be integrated in-house with the RAR-MAX server . In additional or alternative embodiments, the RAR-MAX server  may access a remote RAR-MAX database  via the communication network . In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX server may send data to the database  for storage, such as, but not limited to market data history, transaction record, user investment portfolio data, and\/or the like.","In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX database  may be one or more online database connected to a variety of data platforms, such as a public trading platform, a market data center, and\/or the like, and obtain updated market data information, real-time trade information, and\/or the like from such data platforms. In another embodiment, the RAR-MAX server may constantly, intermittently, and\/or periodically obtain historical data from the database  for investment portfolio analysis.","For example, in one implementation, an example eXtensible Markup Language (XML) record of a transaction may take a form similar to the following:","<Transaction>","<TransactionID>123456789<\/TranactionID>",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["<TransactionTime>09:10:23 06-06-2000<\/TransactionTime>","<TRansactedInstrument>\n        \n        ","<\/TransactedInstrument>","<Volume> 500<\/Volume>","<Type> rollover <\/Type>",". . .\n\n<\/Transaction>\n"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},"As shown in , a user may initiate RAR-MAX at the start of a trading period (e.g., 3 months, 6 months, etc.). In one embodiment, RAR-MAX may receive information of a list of available VIX future contracts  from a financial data service terminal, e.g., Bloomberg data center, etc. For example, in one implementation, RAR-MAX may download a list of posted future contracts data everyday at 9:45 a.m. NY time, based on the VIX <INDEX> <CT> <GO> page on Bloomberg.","In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX may determine a trading strategy based on the timing. In one implementation, during the initial period of the trading period, RAR-MAX may purchase eligible future contracts from the public trade platform, e.g., the listing VIX futures on CBOE For example, for the first 20 trading days  of the trading period, RAR-MAX may calculate the implied roll cost of each listed eligible future contact ; and purchase 1\/20th of the VIX futures position of the cheapest eligible contract based on the implied roll cost on a daily basis for the first 20 days of the trading period . In an alternative implementation, RAR-MAX may select a rolling contract on a daily basis, e.g., everyday at 9:45 a.m. NY time, choosing the cheapest eligible contract based on the VIX <INDEX> <CT> <GO> page on Bloomberg. For example, eligible contracts may be the 2nd-nearby to 7th-nearby listed VIX futures contracts.","In one embodiment, RAR-MAX may calculate an implied roll cost associated with the rolling. For example, in one implementation, RAR-MAX may calculate the implied roll cost as the difference in the mid level of a VIX contract with the mid level of the VIX contract expiring one month prior as of 9:45 a.m. NY Time on the VIX <INDEX> <CT> <GO> page on Bloomberg as the implied roll cost. For another example, for the 4th nearby contract, the implied roll cost may be calculated as the difference in the 4th nearby contract mid level and the 3rd nearby contract mid level. In one implementation, the respective mid level may be the average of the respective bid and ask levels.","For another example, in one implementation, RAR-MAX may calculate the index excess return to track the performance of the rolling of the VIX futures, which may be calculated according to a formula similar to:\n\nIndex=Index\u00b7(1)\n","Where Ris the return of a portfolio of futures at Date t.","In one implementation, RAR-MAX may calculate a portfolio value of futures by portfolio value (before rebalance)=\u03a3n\u00b7p, where nis the number of future contracts of j, at time TIME, and Date t, and pbe the price of future contract j, at time TIME, and Date t; TYPE may be BID, ASK or MID, eligible future contracts may be selected between 2 to 7. In one example, RAR-MAX may calculate an implied roll cost=IC=p\u2212p.","In another embodiment, if after the initial purchasing period, e.g., after the 20th trading day , on each trading day, RAR-MAX may evaluate the currently owned VIX future contracts  and select a daily rolling contract. In one implementation, if any currently-owned VIX Futures contracts become the nearby-VIX Future (e.g., close to termination date), the daily rolling contract may be 1\/20th of the overall position may be rolled each day until no more nearby-VIX Future contracts are held . If not, RAR-MAX may roll 1\/20th of the VIX futures position from the currently owned-contract with the highest implied roll cost to an eligible contract with the lowest implied roll cost as determined at 9:45 a.m. NY time , subject to the eligible contracts and subject to a roll cost-benefit rule as discussed below.","In one implementation, the rolling may take place on a daily basis according to a roll cost-benefit rule based on the implied roll cost. For example, in one implementation, if a portion of the VIX future position is the nearby-VIX future contracts, 1\/20th of the overall position may be rolled from the nearby-VIX Future contract until there is no nearby-VIX future contacts in the current portfolio. In an alternative implementation, RAR-MAX may roll 1\/20th of the overall position if the difference in the implied roll costs is greater than 0.50 points of the currently owned-VIX futures contract. For another example, if the currently owned-contract with the highest implied roll cost has an implied roll cost of 2 points and the contract with the lowest implied roll cost has an implied roll cost of 1.6 points, then the contract may not be rolled on that day.","In one embodiment, RAR-MAX may calculate the index level , which may observe the final traded level of the futures as of the close of each day. For example, in one implementation, on the first rolling date, the index level may be calculated as (notional amount+the sum of the mark-to-market of the VIX futures contract outstanding); and on each subsequent daily VIX futures rolling date, the index level may be calculated as (previous strategy level+VIX futures payoff from the 1\/20th notional that is rolled+the sum of the mark-to-market of the VIX futures contracts outstanding).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":"24","i":"o "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0042"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03be","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}},"mo":"."}}}}},"In one implementation, RAR-MAX may dynamically adjust the rolling process  by comparing the calculated dollar amount to roll at  with the actual rolled amount. When the actual rolled amount is less than the calculated amount , the RAR-MAX may elect to keep rolling . For example, during the rolling period, if the amount rolled by RAR-MAX is less  than the calculated amount to roll, RAR-MAX may sell an up to the amount to roll of the front month future and roll into another future , e.g., a future with the lowest implied roll cost. In another implementation, RAR-MAX may alternatively sell the remaining amount to roll from currently owned futures with the highest implied roll cost and buy the cheapest available future, e.g., with the lowest implied roll cost, which satisfies the cost benefit rule. For example, the RAR-MAX may select a currently owned future with the highest implied roll cost , and an available future with the lowest implied roll cost ; and then determine whether the selected futures satisfy the cost benefit rule. For example, the cost benefit rule may be expressed as:\n\nmax{}\u2212min{}>\u03b6\n","where ICdenotes the implied roll cost of currently owned contracts if the contract is a k-th nearby contract, and \u03b6 denotes the minimum threshold (e.g., 0.5 point). In this example, if there is a tie in the roll cost-benefit rule evaluation , RAR-MAX may select the longest future in the current portfolio for rolling .","For example, in one implementation, Tables 1-8 provides an illustrative example of a portfolio of future contract and roll data over a trading period, such as, but not limited to the associated implied roll cost, the contract volume to be rolled over, and\/or the like. In one implementation,  provides a data plot illustrating the overall portfolio value over the trading period. It is to be noted that the data, figures and plots in Tables 1-8 and  are for illustrative purpose only.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0046"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"336pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

In one implementation, Position A may commence on the first Position A hedge roll date, Position B will commence on the first Position B hedge roll date, and Position C will commence on the first Position C hedge roll date.","In one implementation, for each position in the formulated portfolio, the RAR-MAX may determine a hedge roll date . The RAR-MAX may determine whether the instant position is the first to roll in the portfolio . If yes, the position may commence on the first trading date of the trading period . If not, the position may be configured to quarterly commence on the hedge roll date of the position . For example, in one implementation, for Position A in , the first Position A hedge roll date may be on a trade date. Following the trade date, Position A may be quarterly starting on the SPX listed options expiry date that is closest to 3 months following the trade date. In one implementation, RAR-MAX may enter into the Position A hedge rolling . In one implementation, the expiration for a first Position A put spread collar may be longer or shorter than 3 months.","For Position B hedge roll date, in one implementation, Position B may be quarterly starting on the SPX listed options date that is closest to 1 month following the trade date, on which RAR-MAX may enter into the Position B hedge rolling .

For example, the rolling parameters may include strike prices for an upper strike put, a lower strike put, and a call strike, and\/or the like. In one implementation, RAR-MAX may roll an amount of the expiring 3-month put spread collar into a new 3-month put spread collar. In one implementation, the upper strike put of each put spread collar will be the closest listed SPX option that is below 100% of the SPX level as of 4 p.m. NY time; the lower strike put of each put spread collar will be the strike that is closest to a 25-delta 3-month put; and the call strike is the lowest listed strike whose fair value will fully finance the fair value of the put spread.","In one implementation, RAR-MAX may determine the hedge notional amount for each Position for the hedge rolling . For example, the hedge notional amount may be equal to the prevailing notional of the long S&P 500 index upon inception of the hedge.","In one implementation, on each hedge roll date, RAR-MAX may calculate the monthly settlement amount for each position , which may be the intrinsic value of the respective put spread collar. In one implementation, if the monthly settlement amount is positive , then the hypothetical proceeds of the put spread collar are hypothetically reinvested in the long S&P 500 position , causing the number of index units to grow. If the monthly settlement amount is negative, then the number of index units necessary to pay for the monthly settlement amount is reduced from the long position generating a smaller position going forward .","In one embodiment, after a hedge roll date, RAR-MAX may proceed with a next trading cycle (e.g. quarterly)  for each position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4D","FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"]},"Graph I on  provides example performance comparison of rolling nearby futures and the RAR-MAX volatility hedging.

It should be noted that the term \u201cserver\u201d as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting \u201cclients.\u201d The term \u201cclient\u201d as used herein refers generally to a computer, program, other device, user and\/or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer, other device, program, or combination thereof that facilitates, processes information and requests, and\/or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a \u201cnode.\u201d Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a \u201crouter.\u201d There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks  (LANs), Pico networks, Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Networks (WLANs), etc. For example, the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.","The RAR-MAX controller  may be based on computer systems that may comprise, but are not limited to, components such as: a computer systemization  connected to memory .","A computer systemization  may comprise a clock , central processing unit (\u201cCPU(s)\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor(s)\u201d (these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary)) , a memory  (e.g., a read only memory (ROM) , a random access memory (RAM) , etc.), and\/or an interface bus , and most frequently, although not necessarily, are all interconnected and\/or communicating through a system bus  on one or more (mother)board(s)  having conductive and\/or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions (e.g., binary encoded signals) may travel to effect communications, operations, storage, etc. Optionally, the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally, a cryptographic processor  may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization's circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted, received, and the cause of return and\/or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to: communications networks, input devices, other computer systemizations, peripheral devices, and\/or the like. Of course, any of the above components may be connected directly to one another, connected to the CPU, and\/or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.","The CPU comprises at least one high-speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and\/or system-generated requests. Often, the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units, such as, but not limited to: integrated system (bus) controllers, memory management control units, floating point units, and even specialized processing sub-units like graphics processing units, digital signal processing units, and\/or the like. Additionally, processors may include internal fast access addressable memory, and be capable of mapping and addressing memory  beyond the processor itself; internal memory may include, but is not limited to: fast registers, various levels of cache memory (e.g., level 1, 2, 3, etc.), RAM, etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address, which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as: AMD's Athlon, Duron and\/or Opteron; ARM's application, embedded and secure processors; IBM and\/or Motorola's DragonBall and PowerPC; IBM's and Sony's Cell processor; Intel's Celeron, Core (2) Duo, Itanium, Pentium, Xeon, and\/or XScale; and\/or the like processor(s). The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and\/or transportive conduits (e.g., (printed) electronic and\/or optic circuits) to execute stored instructions (i.e., program code) according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the RAR-MAX controller and beyond through various interfaces.","Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and\/or capacity, distributed processors (e.g., Distributed RAR-MAX), mainframe, multi-core, parallel, and\/or super-computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively, should deployment requirements dictate greater portability, smaller Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) may be employed.","Depending on the particular implementation, features of the RAR-MAX may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST's R8051XC2 microcontroller; Intel's MCS 51 (i.e., 8051 microcontroller); and\/or the like.

Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer, after the FPGA is manufactured, to implement any of the RAR-MAX features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the RAR-MAX system designer\/administrator, somewhat like a one-chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA's logic blocks can be programmed to perform the function of basic logic gates such as AND, and XOR, or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple mathematical functions. In most FPGAs, the logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances, the RAR-MAX may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate RAR-MAX controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the \u201cCPU\u201d and\/or \u201cprocessor\u201d for the RAR-MAX.","The power source  may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells: alkaline, lithium hydride, lithium ion, lithium polymer, nickel cadmium, solar cells, and\/or the like.

However, memory is a fungible technology and resource, thus, any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the RAR-MAX controller and\/or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example, a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on-chip CPU memory (e.g., registers), RAM, ROM, and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism; of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration, memory  will include ROM , RAM , and a storage device . A storage device  may be any conventional computer system storage.

Thus, a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.","The memory  may contain a collection of program and\/or database components and\/or data such as, but not limited to: operating system component(s)  (operating system); information server component(s)  (information server); user interface component(s)  (user interface); Web browser component(s)  (Web browser); database(s) ; mail server component(s) ; mail client component(s) ; cryptographic server component(s)  (cryptographic server); the RAR-MAX component(s) ; and\/or the like (i.e., collectively a component collection). These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and\/or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non-conventional program components such as those in the component collection, typically, are stored in a local storage device , they may also be loaded and\/or stored in memory such as: peripheral devices, RAM, remote storage facilities through a communications network, ROM, various forms of memory, and\/or the like.","The operating system component  is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the RAR-MAX controller. Typically, the operating system facilitates access of I\/O, network interfaces, peripheral devices, storage devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant, scalable, and secure system such as: Apple Macintosh OS X (Server); AT&T Nan 9; Be OS; Unix and Unix-like system distributions (such as AT&T's UNIX; Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) variations such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and\/or the like; Linux distributions such as Red Hat, Ubuntu, and\/or the like); and\/or the like operating systems.

Most frequently, the operating system communicates with other program components, user interfaces, and\/or the like. For example, the operating system may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses. The operating system, once executed by the CPU, may enable the interaction with communications networks, data, I\/O, peripheral devices, program components, memory, user input devices, and\/or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the RAR-MAX controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the RAR-MAX controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction, such as, but not limited to: multicast, TCP\/IP, UDP, unicast, and\/or the like.","An information server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as, but not limited to Apache Software Foundation's Apache, Microsoft's Internet Information Server, and\/or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page (ASP), ActiveX, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts, dynamic (D) hypertext markup language (HTML), FLASH, Java, JavaScript, Practical Extraction Report Language (PERL), Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP), pipes, Python, wireless application protocol (WAP), WebObjects, and\/or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as, but not limited to, File Transfer Protocol (FTP); HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP); Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), messaging protocols (e.g., America Online (AOL) Instant Messenger (AIM), Application Exchange (APEX), ICQ, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft Network (MSN) Messenger Service, Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol (PRIM), Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF's) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions (SIMPLE), open XML-based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (i.e., Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance's (OMA's) Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS)), Yahoo! Instant Messenger Service, and\/or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers, and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server, the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the RAR-MAX controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example, a request such as http:\/\/123.124.125.126\/myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request \u201c123.124.125.126\u201d resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address; that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the \u201c\/myInformation.html\u201d portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information \u201cmyInformation.html.\u201d Additionally, other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports, e.g., FTP communications across port , and\/or the like. An information server may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the information server communicates with the RAR-MAX database , operating systems, other program components, user interfaces, Web browsers, and\/or the like.","Access to the RAR-MAX database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below (e.g., CGI) and through inter-application communication channels as enumerated below (e.g., CORBA, WebObjects, etc.). Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the RAR-MAX. In one embodiment, the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields, and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags, which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and\/or fields. In one embodiment, the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join\/select commands based on the tagged text entries, wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the RAR-MAX as a query. Upon generating query results from the query, the results are passed over the bridge mechanism, and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server, which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.","Also, an information server may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, IBM's OS\/2, Microsoft's Windows 2000\/2003\/3.1\/95\/98\/CE\/Millenium\/NT\/XP\/15 Vista\/7 (i.e., Aero), Unix's X-Windows (e.g., which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment (KDE), mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)), web interface libraries (e.g., ActiveX, AJAX, (D)HTML, FLASH, Java, JavaScript, etc. interface libraries such as, but not limited to, Dojo, jQuery(UI), MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface, any of which may be used and) provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.","A user interface component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU.

Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and\/or the like from the RAR-MAX enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.","A mail server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU .

Generally, the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.","A cryptographic server component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU , cryptographic processor , cryptographic processor interface , cryptographic processor device , and\/or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and\/or decryption requests by the cryptographic component; however, the cryptographic component, alternatively, may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and\/or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric (e.g., Pretty Good Protection (PGP)) encryption and\/or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as, but not limited to: digital certificates (e.g., X.509 authentication framework), digital signatures, dual signatures, enveloping, password access protection, public key management, and\/or the like.

Employing such encryption security protocols, the RAR-MAX may encrypt all incoming and\/or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network (VPN) with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of \u201csecurity authorization\u201d whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition, the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content, e.g., employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the RAR-MAX component to engage in secure transactions if so desired.

Most frequently, the cryptographic component communicates with information servers, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The cryptographic component may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The RAR-MAX database component  may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component, which is executed by the CPU; the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional, fault tolerant, relational, scalable, secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field; i.e., the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely, they uniquely identify rows of a table on the \u201cone\u201d side of a one-to-many relationship.","Alternatively, the RAR-MAX database may be implemented using various standard data-structures, such as an array, hash, (linked) list, struct, structured text file (e.g., XML), table, and\/or the like. Such data-structures may be stored in memory and\/or in (structured) files. In another alternative, an object-oriented database may be used, such as Frontier, ObjectStore, Poet, Zope, and\/or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and\/or linked together by common attributes; they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object-oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the RAR-MAX database is implemented as a data-structure, the use of the RAR-MAX database  may be integrated into another component such as the RAR-MAX component . Also, the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures, objects, and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases, e.g., tables, may be exported and\/or imported and thus decentralized and\/or integrated.","In one embodiment, the database component  includes several tables -. A user table includes fields such as, but not limited to: user_ID, user_password, user_device, user_IP, user_entity, user_project, and\/or the like. The user table may support and\/oPortr track multiple entity accounts on a RAR-MAX. A Market Data table includes fields such as, but not limited to: market_data feed ID, asset_ID, asset_symbol, asset_name, spot_price, bid_price, ask_price, and\/or the like; in one embodiment, the market data table is populated through a market data feed (e.g., Bloomberg's PhatPipe, Dun & Bradstreet, Reuter's Tib, Triarch, etc.), for example, through Microsoft's Active Template Library and Dealing Object Technology's real-time toolkit Rtt.Multi. A Client table may include fields such as, but not limited to: client_ID, client_name, client_address, client_legalInfo, client_income, client_loan, and\/or the like. A Strategy table may include fields such as, but not limited to: Strategy_ID, Strategy_instrument, Strategy_term, Strategy_clientID, and\/or the like. A transaction table may include fields such as, but not limited to TransactionID, TransactionName, TRansactionTime, TransactionDate, TransactionAmount, TransactionInstrument, TransactionType, TransactionDescription, TransactionClientID, TransactionStrategyID, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search RAR-MAX component may treat the combination of the RAR-MAX database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX database may interact with other database systems. For example, employing a distributed database system, queries and data access by search RAR-MAX component may treat the combination of the RAR-MAX database, an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.","In one embodiment, user programs may contain various user interface primitives, which may serve to update the RAR-MAX. Also, various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the RAR-MAX may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment, these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers (i.e., individual database controllers for each of the above tables). Employing standard data processing techniques, one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and\/or storage devices. Similarly, configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and\/or distributing the various database components -. The RAR-MAX may be configured to keep track of various settings, inputs, and parameters via database controllers.","The RAR-MAX database may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the RAR-MAX database communicates with the RAR-MAX component, other program components, and\/or the like. The database may contain, retain, and provide information regarding other nodes and data.","The RAR-MAX component  is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX component incorporates any and\/or all combinations of the aspects of the RAR-MAX discussed in the previous figures. As such, the RAR-MAX affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of information, services, transactions, and\/or the like across various communications networks.","The RAR-MAX component may transform market data inputs via RAR-MAX components into trade execution outputs, and\/or the like and use of the RAR-MAX. In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX component  takes inputs (e.g., market data , client's investment request , and\/or the like) etc., and transforms the inputs via various components (e.g., market data updating component , portfolio construction component , transaction authorization component , and\/or the like), into outputs (e.g., transaction record , investment return , and\/or the like), as shown in , as well as throughout the specification.","The RAR-MAX component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as, but not limited to: Apache components, Assembly, ActiveX, binary executables, (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), C# and\/or .NET, database adapters, CGI scripts, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, PHP, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, web development environments and libraries (e.g., Microsoft's ActiveX; Adobe AIR, FLEX & FLASH; AJAX; (D)HTML; Dojo, Java; JavaScript; jQuery(UI); MooTools; Prototype; script.aculo.us; Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP); SWFObject; Yahoo! User Interface; and\/or the like), WebObjects, and\/or the like. In one embodiment, the RAR-MAX server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The RAR-MAX component may communicate to and\/or with other components in a component collection, including itself, and\/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the RAR-MAX component communicates with the RAR-MAX database, operating systems, other program components, and\/or the like. The RAR-MAX may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and\/or provide program component, system, user, and\/or data communications, requests, and\/or responses.","The structure and\/or operation of any of the RAR-MAX node controller components may be combined, consolidated, and\/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and\/or deployment. Similarly, the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and\/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.","The component collection may be consolidated and\/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and\/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node, and\/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and\/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and\/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques. For example, RAR-MAX server(s) and database(s) may all be localized within a single computing terminal. As another example, the RAR-MAX components may be localized within one or more entities (e.g., hospitals, pharmaceutical companies etc.) involved in coordinated patient management.","The configuration of the RAR-MAX controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and\/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and\/or integrated program components, results in a more distributed series of program components, and\/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and\/or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate, obtain, and\/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and\/or the like.","If component collection components are discrete, separate, and\/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and\/or providing data with and\/or to other component components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and\/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), local and remote application program interfaces Jini, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), SOAP, process pipes, shared files, and\/or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and\/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. For example, a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command, e.g.:\n\n","where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d is part of the grammar syntax, and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly, with such a grammar, a variable \u201cValue1\u201d may be inserted into an \u201chttp:\/\/\u201d post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and\/or other wise used to generate the parsing mechanism (e.g., a syntax description text file as processed by lex, yacc, etc.). Also, once the parsing mechanism is generated and\/or instantiated, it itself may process and\/or parse structured data such as, but not limited to: character (e.g., tab) delineated text, HTML, structured text streams, XML, and\/or the like structured data. In another embodiment, inter-application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and\/or readily available parsers (e.g., the SOAP parser) that may be employed to parse communications data. Further, the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing, but may also be used to parse: databases, data collections, data stores, structured data, and\/or the like. Again, the desired configuration will depend upon the context, environment, and requirements of system deployment.","Additional embodiments of RAR-MAX may comprise the following:","1.
