title: Boat propeller entanglement apparatus and munition
abstract: A compressed air launched munition comprises a projectile which after firing forms a multiplicity of elongated ropes held in a tubular configuration by a series of stiff spacers. The stiff spacers retain a rope tube diameter of at least about 8 inches. The ropes and stiff spacers have an essentially neutral specific gravity in water. The projectile is effective in entangling a boat propeller and stopping an uncooperative boat with little damage.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","Example 1","Comparative Example 2","Example 3","Example 4"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/352,848, filed Jun. 9, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties Thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to rope apparatus for forcibly stopping a moving boat. The invention also relates to a method of fouling a boat propeller. The invention additionally relates to line throwing ordnance.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Military and law enforcement authorities regularly stop boats for interrogation and inspection. Most stops are routine and the boat is released and sent on its way. Occasionally a boat crew will attempt to avoid the stop by fleeing. Flight from authorities is a primary indication that the boat carries contraband or is involved in other illegal activity. It is desirable for authorities to have the ability to stop, a fleeing boat without significantly damaging the boat or injuring the crew.","Nets or rope lines have been used against boats fleeing at high speeds of 50 knots or more. Launched munitions comprising folded rope lines have gained acceptance. In one apparatus presently in use, the primary elongated rope lines have been enhanced with many secondary rope loops. The munition is launched so that the fleeing boat passes over the unfolded, extended rope lines. The munition is successful when it contacts and entangles a boat propeller, stopping the boat.","Skill is required in deploying the munition because a fleeing boat may succeed in steering clear of rope lines. Also, a boat may pass over the rope lines, however, the present elongated ropes and loops are only about 60% successful in fouling a contacted propeller. Inboard motor boats with propellers that are spaced less from the hull than outboard motor boats are less susceptible to propeller fouling. Finally, large propellers may cut or shred the rope line or carry the rope line along without sufficient reduction in speed to allow capture.","A rope tube has proven effective for entangling a boat propeller. The rope tube comprises a multiplicity of ropes held on a tubular wall. The ropes are held in place annularly by a series of stiff spacers having a size to produce an elongated rope tube having a diameter of at least about 8 inches. The rope tube has a specific gravity that causes it to float, in water.","The apparatus is deployed as a barrier or folded to make a munition that is deployed by rocket launching. The apparatus is used against fast boats having outboard or inboard motors.","The invention is described with reference to the drawing wherein numerals in the written description correspond to like-numbered elements in the several figures. The drawing discloses a preferred embodiment of the invention and is not intended to limit the generally broad scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","20","30","20","10","15","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","b ","a ","a","a ","a ","b "],"b":["30","20","20","30","1","40","40","40","20","40","40","40","20"]},"Material\u2014Ropes","In general, the ropes must be able to survive contact with a sharp, high speed boat propeller. That is, they have a breaking strength of at least 17,000 lbs. Ropes useful for the invention have strengths of 17,000 lbs to 100,000 lbs or more are commercially available. Rope diameters are \u215c-inch to 1-inch depending on the target boat. This rope weights 3 lbs\/100 ft. to 22 lbs\/100 ft. Rope is made by braiding multiple strands. The braiding is accomplished to leave a void in the core that can be filled with low density foam material to control buoyancy. This method of making denser polymer rope buoyant or buoyancy neutral in water is so common that the ropes are commercially available. Rope is available having a specific gravity of 0.9 and greater, preferably 0.96 to 1.1. The buoyancy is near neutral so that the rope floats at the surface in fresh water or salt water. In the alternative small buoys can be attached to control buoyancy.","Rope having the above described physical properties are made of high strength, flexible material, that is difficult to cut. Suitable materials include various commercially available synthetic fibrous materials. Such synthetic fibers include aramid polymers, polvaramid polymers and polyethylene polymers. The preferred ropes are made of super-fiber materials such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene sold under the trademarks DEEMA\u00ae and SPECTRA\u00ae.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"KEVLAR\u2009\u00ae para-aramid fiber "},{"entry":"12-Strand single braided rope"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Diameter","Tensile Strength","Weight"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1\/4 inch","6,600 lbs","2.0 lbs\/100 ft."]},{"entry":[{},"5\/16","9,500","3.0"]},{"entry":[{},"3\/8","12,000","4.0"]},{"entry":[{},"7\/16","15,000","5.0"]},{"entry":[{},"1\/2","22,000","7.75"]},{"entry":[{},"5\/8","36,000","14.0"]},{"entry":[{},"3\/4","49,000","19.3"]},{"entry":[{},"7\/8","60,000","23.6"]},{"entry":[{},"1","78,000","30.7"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Specific Gravity 1.44"]},{"entry":[{},"Elongation at Break 1.5% to 4.5%"]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"TECHNORA\u2009\u00ae para-aramid "},{"entry":"fiber 12-Strand single braided rope"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Diameter","Tensile Strength","Weight"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1\/4 inch","8,000 lbs","2.2 lbs\/100ft."]},{"entry":[{},"5\/16","13,000","3.3"]},{"entry":[{},"3\/8","18,000","4.4"]},{"entry":[{},"7\/16","27,000","6.6"]},{"entry":[{},"1\/2","32,000","8.2"]},{"entry":[{},"9\/16","38,000","8.0"]},{"entry":[{},"5\/8","48,000","13.0"]},{"entry":[{},"3\/4","62,000","18.0"]},{"entry":[{},"7\/8","80,000","25.0"]},{"entry":[{},"1","97,000","30.8"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Specific Gravity 1.44"]},{"entry":[{},"Elongation at Break 1.5% to 4.5%"]}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 3"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SPECTRA\u2009\u00ae -

Stiffness is about 1 inch of deflection\/pound of force or less deflection\/pound of force. In general these materials are referred so as marine polymers and include epoxy resins, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene, NYLON\u00ae and polyethylene terephthalate. The stiff spacers may be made of composites of these materials. The composites may be reinforces with fiber materials such as glass fiber, carbon fiber, aramid polymer fiber (e.g. KEVLAR\u00ae) and copolymers of acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride (e.g. DYNEL\u00ae). These materials are exemplary of a wide variety of suitable materials used in a marine environment. Steel may also be used.","Munition","The munition is fabricated by folding the tube of rope and stiff spacers to form a compact munition. The compact munition may be covered to maintain compaction, folding and cleanliness. A cover also facilitates identification labeling, handling and storage.","The order of folding is carried out either from last stiff spacer to first, or the reverse. Rope tubes comprising hoop shaped spacers are advantageously folded with the rope within the hoops to produce a munition having a diameter not much greater than the hoop diameter. Rope tubes with star shaped spacers are folded with the rope outside the diameter of the star shape to produce a munition of greater diameter requiring a larger diameter launching tube. The munition has a specific gravity of 0.5 to 1.5.","The munition is launched by compressed gas rocket  in  from a launching tube having a diameter and length that contains the munition. Pulled by the rocket, the munition exits the firing tube in the folded configuration and extends to its full elongated configuration before landing in the water. Twisting and rolling should be avoided during folding because there is no additional means provided to untwist or unroll the rope tube once deployed. The rope tube can be folded so that it is in the effective three-dimensional configuration and fully functional immediately on landing. A small buoy may be attached so the munition to assist in retrieval. The propellant for the munition launching rocket  is compressed gas, such as compressed air, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Compressed carbon dioxide has been used with success. In she alternative, she munition can be launched by line throwing ordnance or by hand.","Theory","Boat allisions with the apparatus of the invention were photographed and evaluated. Photographic films showed that the stiff spacers retained the relative three\u2014dimensional configuration of the ropes as the boat hull passed over it. As a result, the three\u2014dimensional structure successfully contacted and entangled boat propellers.","Criticality was discovered in the buoyancy of the apparatus. Particularly critical are the stiffness of the stiff spacers and most particularly the diameter of the stiff spacers.","First, the apparatus is buoyant or neutrally buoyant so that when a boat contacts the device, it rides along the bottom of the boat.","Second, the stiff spacers have to be stiff enough to hold the three-dimensional configuration of the rope tube as the boat passes over the apparatus. A boat contacting and passing over a propeller entanglement apparatus acts to collapse and distort the three-dimensional structure. It was found experimentally, that there is insufficient motive force and time for a collapsed or distorted rope entanglement tube to recover its shape before contacting the propeller. As a result, collapsed or distorted devices were less effective in contacting and entangling a propeller. Any entanglement device must retain its shape during transit under the boat until it contacts the propeller. The inventive rope tube apparatus was found to retain its shape. The spacers have a stiffness of about 1 inch of deflection\/pound of force or less deflection\/pound of force.","Third, it was found experimentally that the hydrodynamics around the propeller do not draw a rope apparatus to the propeller to cause entanglement. The rope tube apparatus of the invention was successful because the stiff spacers position the ropes at the proper distance below the boat bottom. That is, it was seen experimentally that as the rope tube lost contact with the boat bottom, at least some of the ropes were at propeller depth. The range of stiff spacer diameters is 8 inches to 36 inches to produce a rope tube of that diameter. The lower end of the stiff spacer diameter range, around about 8 is sized for smaller boats, particularly boats with outboard motors. The range of about 12 to 24 inches is sized for somewhat larger boats with outboard motors and boats of moderate size with inboard motors. The upper end of the range, about 24 to 36 inches, is sized for larger boats and particularly for inboard motor boats. Size of the target boat should be taken into consideration in selecting the munition.","Reference is made to  showing a side elevation and time lapse sequence of events A-E of inboard motor boat  traveling at surface S in the direction indicated by arrow  contacting a propeller entanglement rope tube . Boat  has a hull  with a fore end , a bottom  and an aft end . At the fore end  is bow . At the aft end  are stern  and rudder . On the bottom , in the stuffing box area  adjacent the aft rise in the keel line, a propeller shaft  protrudes from hull  and is supported and distanced from the bottom  by fore support bracket and aft support bracket . Propeller  is attached at the terminal end of propeller shaft .","The gunner's mate has fired a munition which has landed as an extended rope tube  one boat length or less ahead of a boat. Rope tube  extends a length of about 30 feet perpendicular to the direction the boat is headed. Rope tube  is shown in cross section. Event A shows the contact of the bow  with rope tube . The following event B shows the hull bottom  riding over the rope tube . Buoyancy causes rope tube  to remain in contact with hull  as the hull rides over it. Photographs of experiments described in the Example show that the inventive rope tube apparatus retains its three-dimensional shape while in contact with the bow and the hull. This is distinguished from here-to-fore used devices that collapse or distort on contact with the bow  or after riding under the hull bottom .","Event C shows rope tube  contacting the propeller shaft  in the stuffing box area . Event C shows rope tube  between bracket and bracket where it is separated and spaced from bottom . Again, rope tube  retains its three-dimensional configuration.","Event E shows rope tube  contacting propeller . This causes propeller to become entangled with rope and to stop rotating. It is essential to point, out that experiments have shown that the rope tube  has retained the same three-dimensional configuration from before event. A through event. E. The first event. A and the final event B event are separated by only moments and if the device had collapsed, there would have been no recovery time or motive force to cause a collapsed device to reorient to the original shape before Event A. It is also essential to note that the diameter of the tube caused some component ropes to be spaced from the bottom of the boat by an amount to contact the propeller .","Reference is made to  showing a side elevation and time lapse of sequence of events F-J of a long-range outboard motor boat  traveling at the surface S in the direction indicated by arrow  and contacting a propeller entrapment rope tube . Boat  has a hull  with a fore end , a bottom  and an aft end . At the fore end  is bow . At the aft end  is the stern  to which is attached to a single outboard motor . Outboard motor  has a lower gear case  which terminates in a fin . Propeller  is driven by outboard motor .","A munition has landed rope tube  one boat length or less ahead of boat . Rope tube  extends a length of about 50 feet perpendicular to the direction the boat is heading. Rope tube  is shown in cross section. Event F shows contact of the bow  with rope tube . The following event G shows the hull bottom  riding over the rope tube . Buoyancy causes rope tube  to ride under the hull  while maintaining contact with hull . Photographs of experiments described in the Example show that the inventive device retains its three-dimensional shape in this position. This is distinguished from here-to-fore used devices that are collapsed or distorted on contact with the bow  or after riding under the hull bottom .","Event H shows rope tube  contacting the bottom  just before separation from hull . Rope tube  retains its three-dimensional configuration.","Event I shows rope tube  contacting fin . High speed film showed that this was immediately followed by event J where rope tube  contacts propeller . This causes propeller  to become entangled with rope and to stop rotating. It is essential to point out that experiments have shown that rope tube  has retained the same three-dimensional configuration from before event F through event J. The first event F and the final event J are separated by a moment and had device collapsed, there would have been no recovery time or guiding force that would have caused a collapsed device to reassemble to the original shape. It is also essential to note that the diameter of the tube caused component rope to be spaced from the bottom of the boat by an amount to contact ropes with the propeller .","This invention is shown by way of Example.","The apparatus of the invention was tested to compare it with other rope line propeller entanglement devices, particularly the Running Gear Entanglement System (RGES) rope line device. The RGES device in munition form is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,441,511 for a Watercraft Arresting System to M. D. Farinella at al. The configuration of the device in commercial use is a primary elongated rope with floats and secondary 40-inch pendant rope loops spaced by 8 inches. We tested variations in rope geometry, rope stiffness and buoyancy.","One device we tested was referred to as a ladder because it had two horizontally elongated rope sides and periodic perpendicular rope ties between the two elongated sides. The ladder device was the ROES device modified to eliminate spacing between adjacent loops. Adjacent loops were joined such that adjacent loops had a common secondary rope side.

It appeared that propeller hydrodynamics kept the drogue designs from successfully entangling the propeller. We modified the drogue chute design but were not able to appreciably improve performance.","Films of the ladder design were evaluated. The films show that the boat hull passed over the candidate device, collapsing it. The candidate device did not regain shape in the region of the propeller. As a result, the ladder design device experienced failures.","Films of the RGES design were evaluated. The films show that the boat hull passed over the candidate device, collapsing it. The candidate device did not regain shape in the region of the propeller. As a result, the RGES design device experienced failures.","Films of the design of the invention were evaluated. They showed that the stiff spacers held the three-dimensional configuration ropes as the boat hull passed over it. As a result, the three-dimensional structure successfully contacted and entangled the propellers.","Criticality was discovered in stiffness and size of the spacers. First, the spacer had to be stiff enough to hold the three-dimensional configuration of the ropes as the boat passed over it. Stiffness is about 1 inch of deflection per pound or force or less deflection per pound of force. The ropes had to be in the design three-dimensional configuration in the region of the propellers. This implied that for a fast moving boat, the device has to hold its configuration through transit under the boat. There is insufficient time for a collapsed device to recover shape before contacting the propellers.","Second, the hydrodynamics around the propeller do not cause a device to be pulled in to cause entanglement. The apparatus of the invention was successful because the stiff spacers position the ropes at propeller depth. The stiff spacers provide a tubular diameter of 8 inches to 36 inches. This range was discovered experimentally. Diameters at the lower end of the range are sized for smaller boats with outboard motors. Diameters at the upper end of the range are sized for larger boats with inboard motors, e.g. boats up to 100 feet in length. The range around 24 inch diameters is used for she largest outboard motor boats and moderately sized inboard motor boats.","Tube diameters less than 8 inches were tried on an outboard motor boat. A marked improvement in entanglement success exceeding 60% was seen when tube diameter was 8 to 10 inches and greater.","The foregoing discussion discloses and describes embodiments of the invention by way of example.
