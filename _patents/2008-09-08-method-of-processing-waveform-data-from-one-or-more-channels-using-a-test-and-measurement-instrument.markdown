title: Method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument
abstract: The method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument, such as an oscilloscope, is described in which waveform data is collected from a DUT; defining a context is defined by instructing the instrument to obtain the focus of each waveform datum having a first user-defined attribute; defining a selection criteria by instructing the instrument to obtain the focus of each waveform datum having both a first user-defined attribute and a second user-defined attribute; and defining an action by instructing the instrument to perform an operation responsive to finding at least one waveform datum having both the first user-defined attribute and the second user-defined attribute.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to a method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument for use in connection with analyzing waveforms. The method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument has particular utility in connection with providing a query language to facilitate analysis and display of large quantities of waveform data as well as complex waveforms.","Methods of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument are desirable for providing a query language to facilitate analysis and display of large quantities of waveform data as well as complex waveforms. Currently, in order to perform analysis on a test and measurement instrument, users have to work with an entire record. Records consist of a series of measurements made over time, typically of voltage. Record lengths are increasing because many serial digital signals are in use, such as those utilized by the Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) computer bus. The SATA computer bus is designed for transferring data between a computer and mass storage devices.","To prevent noise from causing significant interference with the data signal at the high transmission speeds of SATA systems, differential signaling is used to make it easy to filter out the noise from the data signal at the receiving end. However, the waveforms of such systems are difficult to analyze because jitter in the signal is present to reduce the noise interference. In order to remove the jitter from the signal, a large amount of data must be collected so that linear regression can be performed to obtain start and stop points, and then a low pass filter can be used to eliminate the jitter. Although these operations eliminate the jitter, the long record makes it very difficult for users to sort through the captured data to find areas of interest. With longer waveforms, it is more difficult for users to see cause-and-effect in serial data.","Although analyzing serial digital signals is increasingly important, current test and measurement instruments do not make it easy for users to analyze such signals. Currently available test and measurement instruments provide either a very limited math subsystem that can work only on an entire record or require users to write code in a programming language running on an existing math engine to perform complex analyses. Neither of these approaches makes it easy to find abnormalities because users cannot evaluate only a portion of the waveform. Furthermore, math is not a very expressive way to interact with long waveforms, and general-purpose programming languages introduce a large barrier for many users of test and measurement instruments.","Existing high-end oscilloscopes, such as those currently manufactured by Tektronix, Inc., already incorporate a search\/mark capability to mark foci automatically on a waveform matching a user-defined event. A user can subsequently navigate through these marks to inspect the waveform in identified foci. However, the types of events users can specify are very limited.","The use of query languages is known in the prior art. For example, Structured Query Language (SQL) is the predominant approach used to interact with databases. SQL is a standard interactive and programming language for querying and modifying data and managing databases. SQL is designed for a specific purpose: to query data contained in a relational database. Although SQL is not as powerful as directly manipulating the database with a native programming Application Programming Interface (API), it is nonetheless very useful and easy to learn. Data analysis in a test and measurement instrument could be greatly simplified and generalized by using a query language. However, the underlying data type in most oscilloscopes is some form of digitized waveform. This data type does not lend itself to being manipulated using the same access model as SQL. Therefore, a novel method of modeling waveforms so that an expressive query language can be defined for generalized analysis is required.","Therefore, a need exists for a new and improved method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument that can be used for providing a query language to facilitate analysis and display of large quantities of waveform data as well as complex waveforms. In this regard, the various embodiments of the present invention substantially fulfill at least some of these needs. In this respect, the method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of providing a query language to facilitate analysis and display of large quantities of waveform data as well as complex waveforms.","The present invention provides an improved method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument, and overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide an improved method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument that has all the advantages of the prior art mentioned above.","To attain this, the preferred embodiment of the present invention essentially comprises the steps of: providing a test and measurement instrument; attaching the test and measurement instrument to a Device Under Test (DUT) to be measured; collecting waveform data comprising at least one waveform datum from the DUT, each waveform datum having an amplitude and a position in horizontal units defining its focus; defining a context by instructing the test and measurement instrument to obtain the focus of each waveform datum having a first user-defined attribute, wherein the attribute is a characteristic of the waveform datum's focus and\/or amplitude; defining a selection criteria by instructing the test and measurement instrument to obtain the focus of each waveform datum having both a first user-defined attribute and a second user-defined attribute, wherein the attributes are a characteristic of the waveform datum's focus and\/or amplitude; and defining an action by instructing the test and measurement instrument to perform an operation responsive to finding at least one waveform datum having both the first user-defined attribute and the second user-defined attribute. The test and measurement instrument may be an oscilloscope. Contexts, selection criteria, and actions may be defined by providing the test and measurement instrument with a command written in any waveform query language. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims attached.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.","The same reference numerals refer to the same parts throughout the various figures.","A preferred embodiment of the method of processing waveform data from one or more channels using a test and measurement instrument is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral .","The principles of the present invention are applicable to a variety of computer hardware and software configurations. The term \u201ccomputer hardware\u201d or \u201chardware,\u201d as used herein, refers to any machine or apparatus that is capable of accepting, performing logic operations on, storing, or displaying data, and includes without limitation processors and memory; the term \u201ccomputer software\u201d or \u201csoftware,\u201d refers to any set of instructions operable to cause computer hardware to perform an operation. A \u201ccomputer,\u201d as that term is used herein, includes without limitation any useful combination of hardware and software, and a \u201ccomputer program\u201d or \u201cprogram\u201d includes without limitation any software operable to cause computer hardware to accept, perform logic operations on, store, or display data. A computer program may, and often is, comprised of a plurality of smaller programming units, including without limitation subroutines, modules, functions, methods, and procedures. Thus, the functions of the present invention may be distributed among a plurality of computers and computer programs. The invention is described best, though, as a single computer program that configures and enables one or more general-purpose computers to implement the novel aspects of the invention.","The present invention provides a method of decomposing a larger waveform into smaller pieces and then qualifying which pieces are used in further analysis. A \u201ccontext\u201d is used to allow the user to specify a set of regions in a larger waveform that are of interest. A context is simply a set of rules that allow the waveforms be divided into sets. The context must have some meaning to the user. For example, Period could be the high-level name for a context that defined a region between a rising edge and the next rising edge of a waveform.","Once a set of regions is identified that meets the context's criteria, those areas can be subjected to further analysis. Examples of further analysis that could be directed by the query language could include:\n\n","The query language relies upon a syntax consisting of an Action, a Context, and a Selection Criteria. For example, to mark all of the rising edges less than 200 ns on a waveform collected by Channel , the user would create the query, mark CH.Edge when CH.Rise<200 ns. The results of such a query, depicted as triangle annotations on the waveform, are illustrated in .","The Context and the Selection Criteria together define a selection list that the Action is performed on. Using this style of syntax, queries that are more complex can be expressed. For example, the following query selects only Periods where both of the specified criteria are met: mark CH.Period When CH.Rise<200 ns And CH.Fall>210 ns.","This technique can also be used with protocol decoding the specified context. For example, the selection list in the following returns only the TCP\/IP packets where Channel  to Channel  crosstalk is greater than 2.5 dB: mark CH.TCPIP.Packet when (CH, CH).Crosstalk>2.5 dB.","Contexts are simply a set of foci and widths on a waveform. Contexts are defined either programmatically as part of the underlying waveform query engine or as part of the query language. For example, consider , which illustrates some common features of a waveform. In , a Period is defined as a context from one rising midpoint to the next rising midpoint. The small number of context definitions in  can easily be defined programmatically in the underlying query engine.","Several possible contexts are easily identified in . For example, a waveform segment between 10% and 90% or 90% and 10% is an Edge. Each Edge has a crossing that is the focus of interest. An Edge that is moving up as a Rising Edge and one that is moving down as a Falling Edge. A Period is a context from the crossing of one Rising Edge to the crossing on the next Rising Edge. This implies that besides having a Start and End focus, a context can have additional properties.","In fact, a context has several properties that can be used in a query. These properties are:\n\n","Some contexts will want to define their own properties. For example, an Edge context will probably want to define a property for direction.","Contexts can also be defined in the query language itself It is possible to define a small number of built in contexts programmatically. From those built-in contexts, it is possible to build more complicated contexts using the query language. For example:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Define Context (Waveform x).Period"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003when (x.Edge[occurrence].Direction == Rise)"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003return x.Edge[occurrence].Focus to x.Edge[occurrence+2].Focus"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"This example of a Period context definition works because a context is defined by moving through the waveform in ascending order on the horizontal axis. As referenced contexts (Edge in this example) are encountered, it is given an occurrence value. The first Edge has a value of 1, the second of 2 and so on. Each time the Period context definition is evaluated, the occurrence variable is set. By default, referring to x.Edge is equivalent to x.Edge[occurrence]. This example could be rewritten as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0056"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Define Context (Waveform x).Period"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003when (x.Edge.Direction == Rise)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003return x.Edge.Focus to x.Edge[occurrence+2].Focus"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"This definition says that a period starts with a rising Edge and ends at the next rising Edge. Note that the \u201cto\u201d language construct defines the Start and End foci. If no additional focus is provided, then Start is used. By default, the Start point is included in the context but the End point is excluded for selection purposes. This means that a query such as, Mark CH.Period when CH.Rise>200 ns will only include the first Rise in the selection criterion. This can be overridden in the definition of a context by saying:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0058"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Define Context (Waveform x).Period"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003when (x.Edge.Direction == Rise)"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003return x.Edge.Focus to x.Edge[occurrence+2].Focus"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003include End in Selection"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"A waveform may have zero or more contexts that match a specific context definition. For example, the Period context for the waveform depicted in  would have three occurrences of contexts that match the Period definition.","Specifying a context in a waveform query implicitly returns a list of all contexts (foci and widths) that match the context definition. For example, the following query would return all periods and mark them on the screen: mark Ch.Period.","A selection criterion refines that set into a smaller set that contains specific information that the user is interested in. For example, the query: mark CH.Period when CH.Fall>200 ns would consider only CH period contexts. It would then check the fall time within those contexts for values greater than 200 ns. In this example, the selection list will only have one period in it that is a Period, occurrence 2 (see ).","Compound selection criteria, using the And Boolean expression, imply that all context selections must be met for a context to be selected. For example: mark CH.Period when CH.Rise<196 ns And CH.Fall>212 ns would only return a set of Periods where both conditions are met.","A compound selection using the Or Boolean expression returns a set of contexts where either is true. For example, mark CH.Period when CH.Rise<196 ns Or CH.Fall>212 ns.","A compound selection containing a Not Boolean operation performs a logical inversion. For example, mark CH.Period when Not (CH.Rise<196 ns Or CH.Fall>212 ns) returns the set of all Periods that are do not meet the selection criterion.","Many selection criteria expressions are built using context definitions. For example the query, mark CH.Period when CH.Rise<196 ns Or CH.Fall>212 ns uses the context definition of CH.Rise and CH.Fall. For the selection to be return true the following must be true:\n\n","Any of the standard set of Boolean operators applies. These operators include And, Or, and Not.","Comparison operators are available for using in numeric expressions. These operators include ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.","As mentioned earlier, by default a context returns its Width if no specific property is referenced. This means the selection criterion, CH.Rise<196 ns Or CH.Fall>212 ns, is equivalent to, CH.Rise.Width<196 ns Or CH.Fall.Width>212 ns.","Not all selection criteria will include just contexts. It is also desirable to include measurements. For example, a user might want to find all periods whose Root Mean Square (RMS) is greater than 17.8. This could be defined in the following query: mark CH.Period when CH.RMS>17.8.","Since RMS is a measurement rather than a query, there is an implied gate for the measurement. This gate is simply the Start and End positions for the context, which is CH.Period in this case. This allows for some very expressive queries. For example, a user might want to perform the following query: mark CH.Edge when (CH, CH).Crosstalk is >2.5 db. . shows how the measurements are gated and applied to the context defined in this query.","Math is referred to as types of computations where one or more waveforms are input and one more waveforms are output. For example, Math=CH+CH. Any math operation built into the test and measurement instrument could be used in a query. For example, Mark CH.Period when (CH+CH).Rise>200 ns. The actions performed on the result of a math operation are equivalent to the result if the same waveform was available as a channel.","In addition to a mark action, the query language defines a number of additional actions that can be performed on a set of selected contexts.

In the past, oscilloscopes have not been good at relating with data at a protocol level. Currently available oscilloscopes now support decoding several slow speed serial buses.

It also implies that a decoded protocol may also include Fields that can be used to extract the underlying value in the decoded protocol. The fields can be used in the selection criterion expression to help reduce the packets to ones that the user cares about. Notice in this example that both protocol specific fields and physical layer measurements can be mixed to return a meaningful result.","Configuring custom measurements is an essential feature of any analysis done on test and measurement signals.

The user can do this today using a conventional test and measurement instrument, but the mask cannot be seen simultaneously in both views of the data.","For example, the mask might show a violation in the eye diagram (). The user can choose to view the violating section of the record in Y-T format (). This will allow the user to see the shape of the waveform in Y-T format (including the same mask that the user was looking at with the eye diagram in ).
