{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["One embodiment is directed generally to a computer system, and in particular to a financial computer system configured to run business processes.","Companies can have business processes, where each business process requires that a set of tasks be completed before the business process can be deemed to be completed. An example of a business process is a financial close process, which is a process to complete an accounting reporting cycle of a company. The financial close process can include one or more tasks that need to be performed in order to complete the accounting reporting cycle. Such tasks can include ledger and sub-ledger close, data loading and mapping, financial consolidation, reconciliation, tax\/treasury, and internal\/external reporting tasks.","A computer system can be configured to manage one or more business processes, such as a financial close process, for a company. However, there are many challenges in configuring a computer system to manage business processes. One challenge is the wide diversity of business processes. For example, in the context of a financial close process, a financial close can mean different things to different employees of a company. To a divisional controller, a financial close may mean closing out the sub-ledgers and general ledger at month end or quarter end and submitting the results to a corporate branch of the company. To a headquarters accountant, the financial close may mean collecting the details from the respective divisions of the company, making final adjustments, and performing the corporate financial consolidation and reporting. To a Chief Financial Officer and other financial executives, the financial close may mean finalizing results, announcing earnings, and creating 10Q\/10K's and other regulatory filings for the SEC and other stakeholders. Thus, it is desirable to a company that the computer system configured to manage such diverse business processes, and the diverse tasks associated with a business process, provide a flexible and robust mechanism for creating, grouping, and managing tasks of one or more business processes.","Furthermore, a computer system configured to manage one or more business processes may need to interact with one or more external computer systems. For example, a computer system configured to manage a financial close process may need to interact with external computer systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and financial consolidation systems. An ERP system is a computer system configured to manage internal and external resources such as tangible assets, financial resources, materials and human resources. A financial consolidation system is a computer system configured to streamline the internal financial reporting of a company. However, the ERP and financial consolidation systems may be independent systems that are separate from the computer system configured to manage the financial close process. The independent nature of the systems may make integration and coordination of the systems difficult.","One approach for overcoming these difficulties is to use several ad-hoc and disconnected tools to interconnect the ERP systems and financial consolidation systems with the computer system configured to manage the financial close process, in order to complete associated tasks, such as creating external-facing financial statements. One problem with this approach is that there is no visibility into the activities necessary to create the financial statements. Activities performed outside the ERP systems or financial consolidation systems often do not have a system of record. Thus, the tasks performed are difficult to audit, and, as a result, a risk is associated with the goal of achieving accurate financial statements.","One embodiment of the invention is directed to a computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to manage a schedule in a financial close management system. The instructions include creating the schedule in the financial close management system, the schedule including an ordered set of tasks and a status, where each task of the schedule is assigned a calendar date. The instructions further include modifying the schedule in the financial close management system, while the schedule is active. The instructions further include restricting modifications that can be made to the schedule, based, in part, on the status of the schedule.","Financial Close Management Framework","One embodiment of the invention is directed towards to a financial close management system. According to the embodiment, a financial close management system can help define, execute, and report on the interdependent processes of a financial close period. The financial close management system can provide centralized monitoring of all financial close processes tasks, and can provide a visible, automated, repeatable system of record for running financial close processes.","According to an embodiment of the invention, the financial close management system can provide the following functionality: defining financial close tasks for a financial close process; defining a schedule of financial close tasks to ensure the correct flow of tasks; automating the management of the financial close process to track the status of financial close tasks; providing notification and alerts relating to the financial close process; integrating the financial close tasks with products tasks; generating end user notifications; monitoring an overall status of a financial close process from a central dashboard; acting on errors or delays with financial close tasks; and analyzing the effectiveness of the financial close process.","In accordance with an embodiment, the financial close management system can visualize all the tasks required to complete a specific process. More specifically, the financial close management system can show all the tasks within a specific process, and also show their expected sequencing and interrelationships. In an example where the specific process is a company's financial close process, the financial close management system can summarize all the required tasks needed to complete an accounting reporting cycle.","According to an embodiment, the financial close management system includes an extensible workflow engine and an integration framework that, in part, allows the financial close management system to monitor and orchestrate tasks into all applications necessary for the completion of a specific process. The extensible workflow engine and integration framework can utilize a process manager that uses an orchestration language, such as Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), to create business processes. The extensible workflow engine and integration framework can also utilize web services and a service-oriented architecture (SOA).","An orchestration language, such as BPEL, is a language for specifying business process behavior based on web services. Using an orchestration language, a business process can be modeled by a computer system. Models for business processes generally involve sequences of peer-to-peer message exchanges, both request-response and one-way, within stateful, long-running interactions involving two or more parties. An orchestration language provides a formal description of the message exchange protocols used by business processes in their interactions. In other words, an orchestration language defines a model and grammar for describing the behavior of a business process based on interactions between the process and its partner processes. The interaction with each partner process can occur through web service interfaces, and the structure of the relationship at the interface level can be encapsulated. Thus, an orchestration process, such as a BPEL process, can define how multiple service interactions with partner processes are coordinated to achieve a business goal.","A web service is a software application designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. A web service can have an interface described in a machine-processable format. A computer system can interact with a web service by sending messages over a sequential, stream-oriented protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Examples of web services are Big Web services and RESTful web services. Big Web services are web services that follow a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) standard and use Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages. RESTful web services are services that utilize a Representational State Transfer (REST) style of software architecture, where clients are separate from servers by a uniform interface. A SOA is a flexible set of design principles used during the phases of systems development and integration. A deployed SOA-based architecture will provide a loosely-integrated suite of services that can be used within multiple business domains.","A user is a user of the financial close management system that has the capabilities of viewing a schedule, owning a task, viewing a dashboard, modifying statuses, and creating and managing filters. A power user is a user of the financial close management system that has all the capabilities of a user, and has the additional capabilities of creating and importing tasks, and creating and managing templates and schedules. An administrator is a user of the financial close management system that has all the capabilities of a power user, and has the additional capabilities of having full access to all tasks, templates, and schedules, defining years and periods, creating and managing task types, and creating and managing custom attributes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","130","100","100","100","100","100"]},"Task type  can also define one or more attributes. An attribute is a value associated with an object, such as task type , task , template , or schedule . Task type  can also define a value for each defined attribute of task type . Thus, according to an embodiment of the invention, task type  can define attribute values and parameter values that can be inherited by any task that is created from task type .","Task  is a core unit of action, and is a component of a financial close process. In other words, a financial close process can include one or more tasks. Task  can be implemented as an orchestration process, such as a BPEL process, which can be a sub-process of a larger orchestration process that corresponds to the financial close process. Task  can be inserted into either a template or a schedule. Task  inherits from task type . In other words, task  is based on task type , and can include all attributes and parameters (and any defined value for each inherited attribute and parameter) defined by task type . Task  can also define a value for each parameter where task type  has not already defined a value. A parameter value defined by task  is only associated with task  rather than task type . Also, task  can define one or more attributes, in addition to any attributes inherited from task type . In addition, task  can also define a value for each defined attribute of task type . Thus, based on the definitions inherited from task type , and based on its own definitions, task  can define one or more parameters and attributes, and define a value for each parameter and attribute.","Template  is a repeatable set of tasks, such as task . Template  has a one-to-many relationship with task . Tasks within template  are organized in an ordinal hierarchy. For example, in an embodiment, tasks within template  can be organized by offset days. An offset day is not a calendar date, but a numeric identifier used to order the tasks that make up template . According to the embodiment, one or more tasks of template  can be assigned an offset day of 0. Furthermore, all tasks that precede the one or more tasks assigned an offset day of 0 can be assigned offset days that are negative numbers, and all tasks that succeed the one or more tasks assigned an offset day of 0 can be assigned offset days that are positive numbers. More than one task can be assigned to an offset day. For example, five tasks can be assigned to offset day \u22121, three tasks can be assigned to offset day 0, and twelve tasks can be assigned to offset day 5. Template  can be used as a basis to create one or more schedules. In addition, template  can define one or more attributes, and can define a value for each defined attribute.","Schedule  is an expression of template . In other words, schedule  inherits from template , including all the tasks of template , and assigns each task to a particular point in time on a calendar (such as date). The order of tasks in template  is maintained in schedule , and template  can be expressed in more than one schedule. For example, a first schedule can be created from template  where a first task of the first schedule starts on January 1 of a calendar year, and a second schedule can be created from template  where a first task of the second schedule starts on April 1 of the calendar year. Both schedules include the same tasks as template , but the first schedule begins before the second schedule. In an alternate embodiment, a schedule can be created manually, rather than inheriting from a template.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"According to the illustrated embodiment, two task types, task types  and , can be defined for a financial close management framework. As previously described, task types  and  can each define a specific type of task. Two tasks, tasks  and , can also be defined for the financial close management framework within a template, template . While in the illustrated embodiment, the two tasks are defined within a template, in an alternate embodiment, tasks can be defined for the financial close management framework within a schedule, rather than a template. Tasks  and  each inherit from task type . A third task, task , can also be defined for the financial close management framework within template . Rather than inheriting from task type , task  inherits from task type . As one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, any number of tasks and task types can be defined for the financial close management framework, with any number of tasks inheriting from a given task type. Furthermore, any number of tasks can be defined within a schedule or within a template.","According to the embodiment, a template, template , can be defined for the financial close management framework. As previously described, a template is a set of tasks. In the illustrated embodiment, template  can include tasks , , and .

For example, for schedule , task  can be assigned to run on January 1 of a calendar year, task  can be assigned to run on February 1 of the calendar year, and task  can be assigned to run on March 1 of the calendar year. In contrast, for schedule , task  can be assigned to run on April 1 of the calendar year, task  can be assigned to run on May 1 of the calendar year, and task  can be assigned to run on June 1 of the calendar year.

The system automated task is completed, according to an embodiment, when an external application returns an indication that the task is completed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":["1100","1110","1120","1130","1100","1120","1110","1100","1130","1120","1130","1120","1130","1120"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"b":["1200","1210","1220","1230","1220","1230","1230","1230","1240","1230","1240","1230","1240","1220","1230","1220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"b":["1300","1310","1300","1300","1301","1302","1301","1302","1300"]},"According to the illustrated embodiment, task  also includes parameters  and , but also includes values  and . Thus, according to the embodiment, parameters can be defined for an integration type, which are inherited by a corresponding task, and parameter values can be defined for the parameters at the corresponding task.","According to an embodiment, each parameter defined for an integration type can have the following attributes: parameter name, parameter code, required flag, parameter order, tooltip and parameter dependencies. A parameter name is a display name of the parameter. The parameter name can be displayed next to the parameter when a task is created based on an integration type. A parameter code is an internal name used for the parameter. The parameter code can be used to generate a service request or URL when the task is processed. The value for a parameter code can be alpha-numeric. The required flag indicates whether or not a parameter value is required to execute the tasks. The parameter order is a number value indicating an order to display the parameters in a user interface of the financial close management system. A tooltip is descriptive text about the parameter and its usage. The tooltip value can be displayed if a user \u201chovers\u201d over the parameter displayed at the user interface of the financial close management system. The parameter dependencies are a list of parameters that this parameter is dependent on. For example, if a parameter is dependent on another parameter (its parent), the parameter can be disabled in the user interface of the financial close management system until the parent parameter has a value.","In addition to the above attributes, a parameter can be of a specific parameter type. Such parameter types include the following: text, number, date, checkbox, static list, dynamic list, options group, document navigator, and dimension selector. A text type is used for a text value. When creating a parameter of this type, a maximum field length and maximum number of text rows can be specified. A number type is used for a numeric value. When creating a parameter of this type, a lower and upper bound of the numeric value can be specified. A date type is used for a date value. When creating a parameter of this type, a lower and upper bound can be specified. When a parameter of this type is displayed in a user interface of the financial close management system, the user can have the ability to use a date picker control. A checkbox type is used for a Boolean value. In the user interface of the financial close management system, a parameter of this type can be displayed as a checkbox control. A static list type is used for a pre-defined set of text values. A user can choose from the set of values using the user interface of the financial close management system. A dynamic list type is used for a dynamic set of text values, which can be determined at runtime, and is described below in more detail. An options group type is used for a pre-defined set of values, where a user can chose multiple values from the set. A document navigator type is used for a hierarchical set of values (e.g., folders and documents), which can be determined at runtime, and is described below in more detail. A dimension selector type is used for a pre-determined set of dimension values, and is described below in more detail.","According to an embodiment, a dynamic list parameter type represents a flat set of values that has an associated web service of an external application to provide a valid list of values. Thus, a dynamic list parameter has values that can be determined at run time. As an example, a task can require a name of a report and the list of valid reports can be retrieved from an external application by calling a web service. If the report name parameter is defined as a dynamic list parameter, the financial close management system can use an external application's web service to retrieve a list of values for a user to select from. Thus, instead of having to manually enter the name of a report, the end user will have a valid list of reports to select from.","According to the embodiment, to provide this functionality, the financial close management system needs to know how to call the appropriate web service. Thus, the following attributes can be defined for each dynamic list parameter type: Web Service Description Language (WDSL) location, namespace, port, name, SOAP action, response element, and response transform. The WSDL location is a URL for a web service's WDSL. The namespace is the namespace of the web service. The port is the web service port type, as defined in the WSDL. The name is the web service name, as defined in the WSDL. The SOAP action is the SOAP action for the web service. The response element is the name of the SOAP response Extensible Markup Language (XML) element that contains the parameter value. The response transform is an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XLST) string to transform a response XML into a valid form.","According to an embodiment, a document navigator parameter type is similar to the dynamic list parameter type in that the valid set of values can be retrieved from an external application at runtime. However, the document navigator parameter type represents a hierarchical set of values instead of a flat list. Thus, as an example, a document navigator parameter type can be used to represent documents and their folders.","A document navigator parameter type can have the same attributes as the dynamic list parameter type to define an associated web service. In addition to those attributes, the document navigator parameter type can also include the following attributes: parameter path code, one time query flag, parent folder parameter, item type web service, and item type filter parameter. A parameter path code is a path to a value of a hierarchical set of values. A one time query flag used to determine whether the web service returns an entire hierarchy in a single call. If a web service returns the entire hierarchy in a single call, the one time query flag can be set to a value of \u201cY.\u201d Likewise, if the web service returns the hierarchy one level at a time, the one time query flag can be set to a value of \u201cN.\u201d A parent folder parameter is a web service parameter that indicates where a financial close management system should place a parent folder name. If the web service is not a \u201cone time query\u201d service (i.e., if the one time query flag is set to \u201cY\u201d) then the financial close management system will send a parent folder to the web service to provide the hierarchical context on each call. An item type web service is an additional web service that can be used to list out valid item types, when the items returned by an associated web service are segregated into types. An item type filter parameter is the item type to filter on if the item types can be filtered.","According to an embodiment, a dimension selector parameter type allows a user to select dimension values (such as a year or a period). The dimension selector parameter type can include a dimension selector URL and a dimension selector selection. The dimension selector URL is a URL of an external application's dimension selector user interface. The dimension selector selection is an XML string stating which dimensions are selectable, and whether the parameter type allows multiple selections.","An execution of an integrated task, such as an end user task and a system automated task, will now be described in more detail.","For an end user task, a financial close management system uses a directly callable external web application URL to execute the end user task. The URL can display the external user interface associated with the end user task. An example format of the URL, according to an embodiment of the invention, is:\n\n","According to the embodiment, the values for $PARAM1$, $PARAM2$, etc., can be filled in by the financial close management system with parameter codes that match based on the integration type definition. An example URL, utilizing the above format, is as follows:\n\n","In the above example, a \u201creportName\u201d parameter code can be defined in the integration type. The financial close management system can use the value for the \u201creportName\u201d parameter in place of $PARAM1$.","For a system automated task, a financial close management system uses endpoint information for an external web service. The web service endpoint information can be specified in an integration type's WSDL location element. An example format of the web service endpoint information, according to an embodiment of the invention, is:\n\n","An example web service endpoint information, utilizing the above format, is as follows:\n\n","In addition to the WSDL location, the integration type can describe the web service detail using the following information: service name, service namespace, service operation, and service port type. The service name is the name of the service being called. In other words, the service name is the name of the web service defined in the WSDL (i.e., <wsdl:definitions name=\u201cService Name\u201d>). The service namespace is the namespace associated with the web service. The namespace is defined in the WSDL (i.e., <wsdl:definitions name=\u201cService Name\u201d targetNamespace=\u201cService Namespace\u201d>). The service operation is the name of the method to call on the web service. The service operation is also defined in the WSDL (i.e., <wsdl:operationname=\u201cOperation Name\u201d>). The service port type is the port definition for the web service. The port type is also defined in the WSDL (i.e., <wsdl:portType name=\u201cService Port Type\u201d>).","An integrated task, such as a system automated task and an end user task, can also handle security for the task to prevent unauthorized users from accessing an external application. Security involves authentication and authorization. Authentication is the process of verifying an identity of a user, and verifying that the user is a trusted user. Authorization is the process of verifying that an authenticated user has the authority to perform a certain operation.","For a system automated task, a financial close management system can rely on a Web Services Security (WS-Security) standard to establish an identity of a user when making web service calls. WS-Security is an extension to SOAP that can apply security to web services through the use of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Kerberos, and X.509. An external web service that is integrated with the financial close management server can support WS-Security and SAML based tokens for authentication. According to an embodiment, with SAML tokens, a trust relationship is established between the financial close management system and an external application through an exchange of certificates. This allows the financial close management system to invoke a system automated task using credentials such as a user's credentials or an assignee's credentials. According to the embodiment, a public key of the financial close management system can be imported into an external application's keystore, and a public key of the external application can be imported into a keystore of the financial close management system. Also according to the embodiment, while the financial close management system can handle authentication of a user, the financial close management system can let the external application handle authorization of a user.","For an end user task, a financial close management system can support single sign-on (SSO) with an external application, if that application is integrated with a SSO framework utilized by the financial close management system. According to an embodiment, when invoking an end user task, the financial close management system can include a SSO token in the URL if the task includes a SSO token replacement parameter. The external application can receive the SSO token and use it to launch the end user task. In an alternate embodiment, if the external application does not support the integration described above, the financial close management system can invoke the end user task URL without providing any user credentials. In this embodiment, the external application can prompt the user for credentials before displaying the end user task.","According to an embodiment, a system automated task supports asynchronous invocation. Asynchronous invocation, as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, is a type of web service invocation that allows other processing to continue before the invoked service returns a response. Also according to the embodiment, a web service can have two port types, where each port type performs a one-way operation. One port responds to the web service request and the second port calls back into a financial close management system with a response. In addition to the two port types, according to the embodiment, the web service can accept Web Security Addressing (WS-Addressing) based reply information. The WS-Addressing headers can be used by the web service to direct responses to the correct callback service.","A handling of a web service response by an integrated task, such as an end user task and a system automated task, will now be described in more detail.","According to an embodiment, there are three types of web services that a financial close management system can receive a response from. These three types of web services include: a web service that executes a system automated task, a web service that provides a list of values for a dynamic list parameter type, and a web service that provides a hierarchical list of values for a document navigator parameter type. When invoked, each of the services described above responds with an XML-based SOAP message. The data types returned may be different based on the external application. A financial close management system can provide a mechanism to translate the response XML into a format understandable by the financial close management system. More specifically, for a web service defined in an integration type, an XLST string can be specified to take the actual web service response and translate it into a response expected by a financial close management system.","The following paragraphs describe the response XML expected for each of the web service types.","For a system automated task, according to an embodiment of the invention, a schema for a response XML, or XML schema document (XSD) that is transmitted by the web service, is as

The description element can be used to store a translated description of each integration type. There can be a localized description element for each language supported by the financial close management system. The parameter element describes one parameter of an integration type. The selectltem element describes one element in a selectable list for a list of values type parameter or a radio type parameter. The dependency element indicates that one parameter is dependent on another parameter. Each element may have one or more attributes that further define the element.","In accordance with an embodiment, the integration XML document can also describe an external application that each integration type is associated with.

In accordance with the embodiment, the integration framework can allow a user to leverage services from external applications as part of a process flow, and thus, provides a single application to manage all the activities of the process flow.","Managing Schedules","One embodiment of the invention is directed towards managing schedules. As previously described, a schedule is a core object of a financial close management system, and is an expression of a template. According to the embodiment, managing a schedule can include creating a new schedule, modifying an existing schedule, deleting an existing schedule, duplicating an existing schedule, validating an existing schedule, creating a template from an existing schedule, setting a status of an existing schedule, and importing and exporting an existing schedule. In addition, according to the embodiment, managing a schedule can include defining task type parameters that can be set during scheduling and setting task parameters of a schedule at a schedule level rather than a task level.","As described above, a schedule is an expression of a template, which is an ordered set of tasks. A schedule can inherit from a template, including all the tasks of the template, and assigns each task to a particular point in time on a calendar (such as date). A schedule can have one of four statuses: Pending, Open, Closed, and Locked. The status of Pending indicates that the schedule has been created, but is not yet active. The status of Open indicates that the schedule is active, that the schedule is open for work to be performed, and that tasks in the schedule can be run. The status of Closed indicates that the schedule is no longer active but follow-up work may be required. In this status, tasks in the schedule continue to proceed based on their definitions, but tasks cannot be added to the schedule. The status of Locked indicates that the schedule is locked, that tasks in the schedule are forced to complete, and that only an administrator can modify the schedule or its tasks. In this status, a user cannot modify the schedule or its tasks, but can only view and delete the schedule.","According to an embodiment, when a schedule is created in a financial close management system, the schedule can have a default status of Pending. The default status of Pending allows adjustments to be made to the schedule. To run a schedule, the status of the schedule can be changed from Pending to Open. When the schedule has a status of Open, tasks can execute according to their definition. The status of the schedule can be changed to Closed after all tasks of the schedule are completed, or after it is determined that no new tasks should be added to the schedule.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a status of a schedule can determine, in part, how a schedule can be managed. Specifically, the status of the schedule can determine, in part, what type of modifications can be made to an existing schedule. Specific types of modifications that can be made to an existing schedule will be discussed below in more detail.  illustrates different statuses of a schedule according to an embodiment of the invention. Specifically,  illustrates four instances of a schedule, schedule , where each instance of schedule  has one of the following statuses: Pending, Open, Closed, and Locked. In the instance of schedule  where the status is Pending, schedule  has been created, but is not yet active, which means that none of the tasks of schedule  have started. Thus, schedule  can be modified in any way, as no initiated tasks will be affected by the modifications to schedule . Thus, as illustrated in , the financial close management system can allow a user to make any type of modification to schedule . However, in the instance of schedule  where the status is Open, schedule  is active, and one or more tasks of schedule  have started to run. Thus, schedule  can only be modified in a way that does not affect the tasks of schedule  that have started to run. Thus, as illustrated in , the financial close management system only allows a user to perform one of the following modifications: create a new task for schedule , modify any task of schedule  that has not begun, or delete any task of schedule  that has not begun.","In the instance of schedule  where the status is Closed, schedule  is in an administrative status where no modifications to schedule  are permitted. Specifically, no additional tasks can be added, no existing tasks can be modified, and existing tasks can complete. Any tasks that have not yet run continue to execute according to schedule . In the instance of schedule  where the status is Locked, no modifications to schedule  are permitted, and all tasks are forced to a completed status. Any tasks that have not yet run will not execute.","Thus, according to the illustrated embodiment of , the ability to modify an existing schedule is restricted as the schedule proceeds from a status of Pending, to a status of Open, to a status of Closed, and to a status of Locked. Furthermore, according to the embodiment, as illustrated in  through the use of arrows, a schedule can move from a status of Pending to a status of Open, can move from a status of Open to a status of Closed, can move from a status of Closed to a status of Locked, can move from a status of Pending to a status of Closed, and can move from a status of Pending to a status of Locked, where a user of a financial close management system can change the status of the schedule. According to the embodiment, a schedule can also move from a status of Closed back to a status of Open, or from a status of Locked back to a status of Open, but only an administrator of a financial close management system can change the status of the schedule from Closed or Locked back to Open.","Methods for creating a new schedule will now be described in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0167","num":"0170"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 31"],"b":["1900","1910","1920"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0168","num":"0171"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["2000","2010","2020"]},"In an embodiment, when the schedule is created from the template, a rule can be enforced so that a task is not scheduled on a date that is a weekend day (i.e., Saturday or Sunday). In this embodiment, each task of the template is scheduled for the first available date based on the assigned offset day, and taking into account the rule that a task cannot be scheduled on a date that is a weekend day. For example, if a task of the template assigned an offset day of 0 is scheduled for a date that is a Friday in the schedule, then a task of the template assigned an offset date of 1 is scheduled for a date that is the following Monday in the schedule. Likewise, if a task of the template assigned an offset day of 0 is scheduled for a date that is a Monday in the schedule, then a task of the template assigned an offset date of \u22121 is scheduled for a date that is the previous Friday in the schedule.","According to an embodiment, a user can manually align an offset day for a task of the template to a calendar date for the corresponding task in the schedule. For example, if a template includes a task with an offset day of 0, and a task with an offset day of 1, a user can manually align the task with an offset day of 1, so that the task in the template with an offset day of 1 is scheduled in the schedule on a calendar date that is a number of days, for example three days, after the task in the template with an offset day of 0.","In accordance with the embodiment, if a task has predecessors in other templates, a user can review a list of predecessor tasks and manually adjust any predecessor task that requires assignment.","According to the embodiment, the creation of the schedule based on the template can further include setting attributes of the schedule. More specifically, attributes of the schedule can be set by the user. In an example embodiment, the attributes of the schedule can include a schedule name, a schedule description, a start date, an end date, a year, a period, and a schedule owner.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a user can create a schedule from a template by selecting a button displayed on a user interface of the financial close management screen which displays a \u201cManage Schedules\u201d screen on the user interface.

At , an existing schedule is selected in a financial close management system. At , a duplicate schedule is created from the selected schedule. According to an embodiment of the invention, the existing schedule is copied into a duplicate schedule, which is a separate object in the financial close management system. The copying of the existing schedule can include copying each task of the existing schedule. Optionally, the financial close management system can allow a user to modify attributes of the duplicate schedule. At , the task calendar dates of the duplicate schedule are aligned. In accordance with the embodiment of the invention, the calendar dates of tasks of the duplicate schedule are set, where the calendar dates of the duplicate schedule are different from the calendar dates of the existing schedule.","Modifications to an existing schedule can also include validating a schedule.  illustrates a method of validating a schedule according to an embodiment of the invention. At , a schedule is selected. At , a schedule is validated. More specifically, according to the embodiment, the financial close management system determines that the schedule complies with a set of business rules defined within the financial close management system. At , when the validation of the schedule does not result in any errors, the financial close management system displays a success message in a user interface. At , when the validation of the schedule does result in errors, the financial close management system displays a list of errors in the user interface.","Modifications to an existing schedule can also include creating a template from a schedule.  illustrates a method of creating a template from a schedule according to an embodiment of the invention. At , a schedule is selected. At , a template is created from the schedule. According to the embodiment, creating a template from the schedule includes copying each task from the schedule into the template. At , the offset days of the tasks of the template are aligned with the calendar dates of the tasks of the schedule. According to the embodiment, aligning the offset days of the tasks of the template with the calendar dates of the tasks of the schedule includes organizing the tasks of the schedule by offset days. According to the embodiment, one or more tasks of the schedule can be assigned an offset day of 0. Furthermore, all tasks of the schedule that precede the one or more tasks assigned an offset day of 0, can be assigned offset days that are negative numbers in the template, and all tasks of the schedule that succeed the one or more tasks assigned an offset day of 0 can be assigned offset days that are positive numbers in the template.","Modifications to an existing schedule can also include importing a schedule.  illustrates a method of importing a schedule according to an embodiment of the invention. At , a file is selected. According to the embodiment, a file can be a flat file, such as a common separated values (CSV) flat file.

More specifically, the filtering criteria of the filter can be defined to only include values of attributes that are associated with at least one object from the set of objects. For example, if a set of objects includes a first task with an attribute A with a value of \u201cA\u201d, and a second task with the attribute A with a value of \u201cA,\u201d then the filtering criteria of the filter can be defined to only include one of, or both, the values \u201cA\u201d and \u201cA\u201d of attribute A. Thus, according to the embodiment, a filter that is defined will return at least one task (either the first task, the second task, or both tasks).","According to another embodiment, once a filter is applied, a filtering criteria for an additional filter applied to the original filter can be based on the subset of objects returned by the original filter. More specifically, the filtering criteria for the additional filter can be defined to only include values of attributes that are associated with at least one object from the subset of objects returned by the original filter. As an example, a set of objects includes three tasks: a first task, a second task, and a third task. The first task can include two attributes: attribute A with a value of \u201cA,\u201d and attribute B with a value of \u201cB.\u201d The second task can also include two attributes: attribute A with a value of \u201cA,\u201d and attribute B with a value of \u201cB.\u201d The third task can include three attributes: attribute A with a value of \u201cA,\u201d attribute B with a value of \u201cB,\u201d and attribute C with a value of \u201cC.\u201d Initially, a filter can be defined, where the filter defines a subset of objects using a filtering criteria. For example, a filter can be defined that defines a subset of objects that includes the first task and a second task. In the embodiment, a second filter can be defined, where the second filter defines a second subset of objects using a second filtering criteria, where the second filtering criteria be defined to only include values of attributes that are associated with at least one object from the subset of objects. According to the example, the second filtering criteria can be defined to include one of, or both, the values \u201cB\u201d and \u201cB\u201d of attribute B. In this example, the second filtering criteria does not include any values for attribute C, because attribute C is not associated with any object in the subset of objects (i.e., the first task and the second task).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0211","num":"0214"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 43","FIG. 44"],"b":["4300","4300","4301","4301","4310","4310","4311","4311"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0212","num":"0215"},"figref":["FIG. 44","FIG. 43"],"b":["4400","4400","4410","4410","4400","4410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0213","num":"0216"},"figref":"FIG. 45","b":["4500","4500","4500","4510","4520","4520"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0214","num":"0217"},"figref":["FIG. 46","FIG. 46","FIG. 46"],"b":["110","111","112","170","110","160","111","160","112","160","170","170","170","110","111","112","170","110","110"]},"While the illustrated embodiment of  illustrates filtering of custom attributes, in an alternate embodiment, a filter can be configured to filter based on one or more attributes that are associated with at least one object. In this alternate embodiment, custom attribute  can be replaced with an attribute. As previously described, an attribute is a system-defined attribute, as opposed to a user-defined attribute. In this embodiment, the functionality of the filter is the same as the functionality of filter  illustrated in .
