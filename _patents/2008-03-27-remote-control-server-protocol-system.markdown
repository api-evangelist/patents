title: Remote control server protocol system
abstract: A remote control server protocol system transports data to a client system. The client system communicates with the server application using a platform-independent communications protocol. The client system sends commands and audio data to the server application. The server application may respond by transmitting audio and other messages to the client system. The messages may be transmitted over a single communications channel.

No. 60\/973,131, filed Sep. 17, 2007, which is incorporated by reference.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure relates to a communications protocol, and more particularly to a protocol that transports control, configuration, and\/or monitoring data used in a speech enhancement system in a vehicle.","2. Related Art","Vehicles may include wireless communication systems. A user may communicate with the wireless communication system through a hard-wired interface or through a wireless interface, which may include a hands-free headset. Such wireless communication systems may include or may be coupled to a noise reduction system. The noise reduction system may include a plurality of noise reduction modules to handle the various acoustic artifacts.","To optimize the noise reduction system, a technician may manually adjust the noise reduction system based on the specific acoustic chamber corresponding to the vehicle or vehicle model. Adjusting the noise reduction system by depressing buttons and indicators on the head-end or noise reduction system may be time consuming and expensive. Once the noise reduction system has been initialized, activating and\/or deactivating individual modules may require rebooting of the system, which may be time consuming.","A remote control server protocol system transports data to a client system. The client system communicates with the server application using a platform-independent communications protocol. The client system sends commands and audio data to the server application. The server application may respond by transmitting audio and other messages to the client system. The messages may be transmitted over a single communications channel.","Other systems, methods, features, and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures, and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.","The system provides platform and transport independent methods for transferring character and embedded data (e.g., binary data). It allows for the same interface to be used for monitoring multiple channels of audio data and sending and receiving configuration and control parameters. The protocol may handle sending signals to trigger application events in speech signal enhancement systems.  is a vehicle environment , which may include an application-to-client environment . The application-to-client environment  may include a client system  and an \u201capplication\u201d or speech enhancement system . The speech enhancement system  may be coupled to or communicate with a wireless communication device , such as a wireless telephone system or cellular telephone.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","116","116","120","116","102"]},"The client system  may be a portable computer, such as laptop computer, terminal, wireless interface, or other device used by a technician or user to adjust, tune, or modify the speech enhancement system . The client system  may be separate and independent from the speech enhancement system , and may run under a Windows\u00ae operating system. Other operating systems and\/or computing platforms may also be used.","The application-to-client environment  may provide a platform and transport independent system for transferring commands, messages, and data, such as character data, embedded data, binary data, audio streams, and other data, between the client system  and the speech enhancement system  by using a remote control server (RCS) protocol . The RCS protocol  may be a communications protocol that may transport control data, configuration data and\/or for monitoring data between the speech enhancement system  and the client system . Data may be sent over a single or common interface or channel. The RCS protocol  may permit a user to efficiently tune and adjust the speech enhancement system  in the vehicle for optimum performance through the client system . Because the acoustic \u201cchamber\u201d may differ from vehicle to vehicle and from vehicle model to vehicle model, a user may tune and adjust the parameters of the speech enhancement system  for each specific acoustic environment loudly or remotely.","The client system  may include an RCS protocol client application , which may comprise a software \u201cplug-in.\u201d The RCS protocol client application  may translate commands issued by the client system  under user control into an RCS protocol format . The speech enhancement system  may include a corresponding RCS protocol server application , which may comprise a software \u201cplug-in.\u201d The RCS protocol server application  may translate data and commands received from the client system  in an RCS protocol format  into control commands and data, which may be processed by the speech enhancement system . By using the software  and , communication may occur independent of the platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["116","116","304","116","304","120","116","102"]},"In some systems, the processing modules  may comprise a collection of routines and data structures that perform tasks, and may be stored in a library of software programs. The processing module may include an interface that recognizes data types, variables and routines in an implementation accessible only to the module. The processing modules may be accessed to process a stream of audio data received from or sent to the wireless communication device . Any of the processing modules  may process the audio data during operation of the speech enhancement system . The speech enhancement system  may process a stream of audio data on a frame-by-frame basis. A frame of audio data may include, for example, 128 samples of audio data. Other frame lengths may be used. Each sample in a frame may represent audio data digitized at a basic sample rate of about 8 KHz or about 16 KHz, for example.","The processing modules  may be \u201ccreated\u201d or generated during initialization of the speech enhancement system  or during normal operation of the speech enhancement system that may be under control of the client system . During the generation process , memory may be mapped, allocated, and configured for some or all of the modules, and various parameters may be set. The processing modules  may be uninstalled during initialization or during normal operation of the speech enhancement system  under the control of the client system .","Each processing module  or software process (or hardware) that performs the speech enhancement processing may be accessed and copied from a library of speech enhancement processes into memory. The speech enhancement system  may include processing modules, such as an echo-cancellation module , a noise reduction module , an automatic gain control module , a parametric equalization module , a high-frequency encoding module , a wind buffet removal module , a dynamic limiter module , a complex mixer module , a noise compensation module , and a bandwidth extension module . For example, a signal enhancement module may be included, which may be described in application Ser. Nos. 10\/973,575, 11\/757,768, and 11\/849,009, which are incorporated by reference.
