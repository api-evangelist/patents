In some cases, this feedback takes the form of statements regarding a particular seller, a good or service, or a category of good or service being sold. These statements may range form being very general to being very specific in terms of the information that they convey.","Systems and methods for the visualization of reputation ratings are provided. In some embodiments, a method comprises receiving a feedback request identifying a particular user. A feedback entry may be retrieved in response to the feedback request. The feedback entry may contain a first term. A scoring model may be built based, in part, upon a term frequency count denoting a frequency with which the first term appears in a searchable data structure. The first term may be mapped to a graphical illustration based upon a second term associated with the graphical illustration such that the graphical illustration may be used to represent the second term. A feedback page may be generated containing the first term and the graphical illustration.","Example methods and systems to facilitate feedback ratings are described. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","In some embodiments, a system and method for providing feedback to a potential purchaser of a good or service is illustrated. This system and method may provide specific and unique feedback (e.g., feedback ratings), which, in some cases, is devoid of redundant, cumulative, or other types of information that do not contribute to educating a potential purchaser of a good or service about either the good or service or about the party selling the good or service. Further, this system and method may provide a potential purchaser with one or more visual clues as to the quality of the purchasing experience that actual purchasers have had with the particular party selling the good or service, and\/or the good or service actually sold. In one embodiment, these visual clues may take the form of a graphical illustration (e.g., an emoticon), and\/or various textual highlights displayed on a feedback page in the form of, for example, a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) based webpage.","Providing generalized feedback ratings for marketplace participants often lacks the specificity to be informative for a user. Example marketplace feedback scores may give a quantitative measure of user trustworthiness, but they may at the same time lack the requisite detail to be informative. This may be true even where the feedback may be categorized to include a plurality of positive, negative and neutral comments. More to the point, pure feedback scores, even if categorized by positives, negatives, and neutrals, may not differentiate between users.","While feedback may give a sense of how good or bad users are (e.g., in terms of the quality of service or goods they provide), it does not describe why the users may be good or bad. In some cases, it may be difficult to tell what qualities differentiate one buyer from another and one seller from another. For example, it may be important to know whether a particular market participant is good, for example, at communication, packaging, pricing or service. Further, in some cases, users (e.g., those who have actually purchased a good or service from a seller) may leave neutral or positive feedback to avoid confrontation or may put in information that relates to the quality of their business conduct. In some cases, without a proper tool to differentiate the feedback, potential customers may have to go through pages of text trying to glean particulars.","Some example embodiments may include providing potential purchasers with an ability to automatically extract representative textual phrases or tags from a marketplace feedback text. Once the feedback tags are extracted, graphical representations in the form of, for example, emoticons, may be attached to the feedback tags. Multiple feedback tags may have the same emoticons attached to them revealing the sentiments of users who have actually purchased a good or service from the seller.","In some embodiments, technology may be implemented that includes the visualization of reputation ratings by parsing the feedback and analyzing its text for specific pattern frequencies. Text size may be used, for example, to show popularity of feedback by displaying more frequently-used phrases in a bigger font. In other example embodiments, other visual differentiation techniques may be used to highlight or distinguish more frequently-used (or otherwise identified) phrases included in the feedback data. Uniqueness of the particular feedback is also considered. An emoticon icon (e.g., emoticon) may be generated based on the feedback and may be displayed.","Further, in some embodiments, a tool may provide users with a legend of emoticons used to visualize the feedback. The emoticons may be representative of emoticons specific to the feedback provided by a particular community and may be displayed automatically. Moreover, users may be given an option of using cached information, and may select whether the feedback information should come from the item category or from user feedback. Additionally, in some embodiments, users may be provided with hints to further explain the meaning of the icons and terms.","Example Technology","In some embodiments, the example technology may include allowing searching by a user (e.g., a seller of goods or services), an identifier (e.g., a screen name, handle, or numeric identifier), or allowing a user to pick a user name from cached user names. The potential purchaser may select and search for visualized feedback that may, for example, be presented in positive, negative, or neutral categories. Additionally, the potential purchaser may use emoticon legends (e.g., emoticon legends) that correspond to the feedback terms. Further, the more frequently-occurring feedback terms may be displayed in correspondingly larger font. Example embodiments may include using displayed terms or phrases which are clickable to expose further details about the feedback associated with these terms or phrases. Moreover, the technology may include demonstrating the frequency of use of the term or phrases by displaying the percentage of occurrence in the feedback.","Some example embodiments may include extracting representative textual phrases from a user's feedback text as \u201ctags\u201d. These tags may be extracted to differentiate feedback for one user from that of another. For example, if all users have the text \u201cAAAAA++++\u201d in their feedback, this information does not serve to distinguish one user from another. In some embodiments, the example technology may extract other distinguishing phrases that summarize a user's (e.g., a seller's) feedback text. This information may be extracted at a global level, a category level, a domain level (e.g., static or dynamic), or at any other suitable level. Also, this information may be extracted for all the transactions that have occurred for all users in a given category to describe the most representative tags for that category feedback. For example, \u201cvery cute\u201d may be a typical phrase in a positive feedback text in a bag category, \u201cdoes not fit\u201d may be a common phrase in an apparel category, and \u201cwrong size\u201d may be a common phrase in a jewelry-ring category.","Once the text is extracted, the information may be presented at a user level, across all categories, at a category level, domain level, or at some other suitable level. Example representations of the feedback may be shown with the text differentiated by its size (e.g., highlighted with larger text for more frequent phrases and smaller text for less frequent ones).","Further, in some embodiments, an example technology may represent text emoticons or sentiments that may have emoticons attached to them. This may be done by keeping a dictionary of phrases and mapping the phrases to a static set of emoticons. For example, \u201cspeedy shipping\u201d and \u201cfast delivery\u201d may be associated with a common emoticon. Linguistic analysis and natural language processing may help to identify such similar phrases and map them to the same emoticon. Techniques of sentiment mining from small text may be used to attach sentiments to the tag phrases.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","112","112","102","103","104","105","106","102","101","126","126","101","124","112","127","125","112","128","126","127","128","150","130","130","131","131","132","130","126","127","128","131","130","131","132"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","201","112","202","201","112","202","202","150","130","131","202","203","203","203","130","150","112","201","203"]},"Example Screen Shots of Interfaces","In some embodiments, a feedback page  is displayed to a potential purchaser. Feedback page  may contain feedback regarding a particular seller of a good or service, or regarding a particular category of goods or services for sale. In one embodiment, when a potential purchaser clicks on a tag underlying the text displayed on the feedback page , an asynchronous request is sent to the server to obtain details for that tag. This asynchronous request may be generated using technology including, for example, AJAX, or DHTML. Once the asynchronous request is received, then feedback information related to that tag is extracted from a pool of feedback for that user. Next, in some cases, a percentage is computed to determine how many comments out of the total pool of comments (e.g., for that particular seller) actually relate to that specific tag. Then, in some embodiments, a feedback servlet again constructs the HTML to be displayed to the client (e.g., displayed as part of the feedback page ). In some example embodiments, synchronous transmissions of web page queries are utilized in lieu of or in combination with the asynchronous queries. Further, technologies such as ASP may be utilized in lieu of servlets.","In some cases, a potential purchaser may generate a feedback request relating to comments regarding a seller, comments regarding another potential purchaser, a feedback score, a category of items for sale, a particular item, or some other type of suitable information pertinent to the sale of a good or service. This information may be supplied by purchasers or by others having access to this type of information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["203","301","302","303","304","305","306","201","306","307"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["203","401","405","408","401","402","403","301","402","404","401","405","35","406","407","303","408","401","405","408","101","124","125"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["203","501","502","501","501","501","503","503","503"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["203","601","602","601","502","601","603","601","603"]},"Example Method",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["131","701","702","703","704","705","706","707","708","709","709","710","711","712","713"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","131","802","803","805","814","102","801","804","815"]},"With regard to the first stream, an operation  may be executed that generates feedback in the form of feedback data  that is then transmitted to, or otherwise received through, the execution of an operation . Once operation  is executed, an operation  may be executed that parses and stores feedback data  into feedback data store . This process of generating feedback data and subsequently parsing and storing it into a data store may serve to, for example, seed or otherwise populate a data store with user feedback. In some cases, this user feedback may be subsequently utilized for the generation of a feedback page, its associated graphical illustrations (e.g., emoticons), and phrases describing a particular user in terms of feedback regarding that user. Once feedback data store  is populated, a reviewer such as reviewer  may execute an operation  to generate a feedback request, such as feedback request . This feedback may be generated with respect to a particular user, category of good, services, at a static or dynamic domain context, or even for all transactions (e.g., globally). Further, these types of feedback may be combined. Next, through the execution of an operation , feedback request  may be received and processed. Once feedback request  has been received, an operation  may be executed that may retrieve feedback entries from, for example, the feedback data store . This operation  may use various Application Programming Interface (API) calls, or even calls generated using a Structured Query Language (SQL) to retrieve feedback entries. Then, an operation  may be executed that generates a list of positive, neutral, or negative feedback entries. Put another way, in some embodiments, a list containing only positive feedback may be generated, a list containing only neutral feedback may be generated, and a list containing only negative feedback may be generated. In lieu of a list, some other suitable data structure (e.g., a Binary Search Tree (BST), a stack, a queue, a double linked list) may be utilized.","Once these lists are generated, an operation  is executed that filters certain noise words, wherein these noise words may be contained in some type of predefined dictionary (e.g., a stop word dictionary). This dictionary may be based upon certain words that may be deemed to be uninformative or otherwise unhelpful in terms of facilitating a reviewer's, such as reviewer 's, understanding of feedback regarding a particular user. The execution of operation  may be optional in some embodiments. Once operation  is executed, or if operation  is optionally not executed, the method  continues to an operation  that assigns any remaining words to an array, or some other suitable data structure, wherein a unique integer value is associated with each one of the words. Then, an operation  may be executed that assigns each one of these words to some type of searchable data structure, such as, for example, a trie, a BST, a heap, or a list. In some embodiments, a data structure may be generated for each feedback type (e.g., positive, neutral, and\/or negative feedback), resulting in a plurality of data structures. An operation  may then be executed that extracts certain phrases from the searchable data structure (or plurality of searchable data structures) and passes these phrases through a frequency engine. In some embodiments, the frequency engine counts the number of times these phrases appear in all of the searchable data structures, or in some cases, only one or more of the searchable data structures.","An operation  is then executed that builds a scoring model using the frequency count. In some cases, this scoring model may, for example, be a hash table that contains a phrase and its frequency count based upon the aggregation of the frequency values for the words associated with the phrase. In some cases, this hash table may be implemented using bucket hashing or cluster hashing as may be suitable. In other cases, some other suitable data structure may be used such as, for example, a BST, heap, linked list, or doubly linked list. Next, an operation  is executed that maps or compares the frequency count for each of the phrases to certain graphic standards relating to particular graphical illustrations (e.g., emoticons). In effect, this comparison takes the phrase contained in a hash table entry and compares it to phrases associated with a particular emoticon. In some cases, a dictionary of sentiments, or emoticon mining system (collectively referenced herein as an emotion database) is implemented such that the phrases are compared to possible synonyms and where a match is found the corresponding emoticon is used. If, for example, the phrase \u201cBest Purchase Ever\u201d is considered to be synonymous with the phrase \u201cExactly Described\u201d, then the emoticon  denoting that one is \u201cpleased\u201d with a transaction might be appropriate. Once the phrases are mapped to an emoticon, an operation  is executed that generates a feedback page, such as feedback page . The generation of feedback page  may be more fully illustrated below, but includes, for example, the generation of an HTML-based page that contains, for example, the phrases and their respective emoticons. In some embodiments, the phrases themselves may be highlighted in some manner (e.g., font size, bolded font, italicized font, underlined font, color font, or some other suitable method of highlighting) where a particular phrase may need to stand out relative to other phrases contained in a particular field (e.g., a positive feedback field , negative feedback field , neutral feedback field ). Some embodiments may include using a method of gradation based upon import to highlight certain phrases such that the more unique the phrase is relative to some universe of phrases, the great degree of highlighting it may receive. The method of gradation based upon import may be more fully discussed below is the section relating to the generation of the Inverse Document Frequency (e.g., referenced as idf) value.","Feedback page  may then be received through the execution of an operation  that may receive feedback page  and display it. In some embodiments, the execution of operation  may be carried out through some type of application capable of interpreting an HTML-based page, such as, for example, a web browser or other suitable application that may interpret, for example, HTML or XML. Further, through the execution of operation , details relating to a particular piece of feedback may be displayed (see e.g., phrase  selected with mouse pointer  so as to display the specifics of the selected phrase in screen object or widget ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["803","901","126","127","128","902","903","803","132","203"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["806","1001","1002","1003"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["808","1101","1102","1103","1104","201","203","1105"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["809","1201","1202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["810","1301","1302","1303"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":["1400","1429","1430","1431","1429","1401","1402","1432","1403","1401","1402","1401","1432","1401","1403","1402","1404","1402","1404","1404","1406","1406","1404","1406","1432","1405","1432","1405","1403","1401","1401","1406","1429","1401","1405","1401","1403"]},"The second sub-trie  provides an illustration of a suffix ordering relating to neutral feedback in the form of the phrase \u201cService Was About Average\u201d.

In some cases, the use of an idf value may ensure the uniqueness of a phrase relative to the universe of phrases within which the phrase may be found. This idf value may also be used to determine the gradation based upon import of a phrase such that the phrase may be highlighted to a greater or lesser degree.

Some embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier) that is relatively free of application processing. Further, a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical\/mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level, and communicates the results of these logical\/mathematical manipulations to the interface tier and\/or to a backend, or storage tier. These logical\/mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules, or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third, storage tier, may be a persistent or non-persistent storage medium. In some cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology, or as will be discussed below, a variety of technologies. This three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server-client, peer to peer, or some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer system as various software components.","Component Design","Some example embodiments may include the above described tiers, and processes or operations that make them up, as being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component oriented, or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various Application Programming interfaces (APIs), and then compiled into one complete server, client, and\/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Distributed Computing Components and Protocols","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above described components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may reside on a first computer system that is located remotely from a second computer system containing a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above-described object-oriented programming techniques, and can be written in the same programming language or in different programming languages. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language(s) used to write them. For example, a component written in C++ may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language through use of a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or the Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.","A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client","Some embodiments may utilize the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) basic reference model or Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems is described as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. The TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. The TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, the IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data is transmitted over a network such as an internet, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or some other suitable network. In some cases, the word \u2018internet\u2019 refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP as well as ATM, SNA, SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.","A Computer System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 21","b":"2100"},"The example computer system  includes a processor  (e.g., a Central Processing Unit (CPU), a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system  may further include a video display unit  (e.g., a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) or a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)). The computer system  also includes an alphanumeric input device  (e.g., a keyboard), a User Interface (UI) cursor controller  (e.g., a mouse), a disk drive unit , a signal generation device  (e.g., a speaker) and a network interface device (e.g., a transmitter) .","The disk drive unit  includes a machine-readable medium  on which is stored one or more sets of instructions  and data structures (e.g., software) embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory  and\/or within the processor  during execution thereof by the computer system , the main memory  and the processor  also constituting machine-readable media.","The instructions  may further be transmitted or received over a network  via the network interface device  utilizing any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP, SIP).","In some embodiments, a removable physical storage medium is shown to be a single medium, and the term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and\/or associated caches and servers) that store the one or more sets of instructions.

The term \u201cmachine-readable medium\u201d shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, optical and magnetic media, and carrier wave signals.","Marketplace Applications","In some embodiments, a system and method is illustrated that facilitates the generation of feedback that is useful and non-cumulative by removing redundant information or only providing useful feedback information. Feedback regarding a particular seller of a good or service may only be useful insofar as it instructs a potential purchaser regarding specific information about a seller and\/or the good or services that are being sold. In cases where this feedback is merely cumulative, the feedback is not informative. Feedback that is informative will attract more potential purchasers, since these purchasers may be more able to research the sellers and the goods or services being sold on, for example, a website.","The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. \u00a71.72(b), requiring an abstract that will allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition, in the foregoing Detailed Description, it can be seen that various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment.
