{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention relates to virtual storage systems, virtual storage methods and methods of over committing a virtual RAID storage system.","Computer systems including hardware, software, firmware etc. have continued to experience expansive growth and sophistication in recent years. Peripherals and other components arranged to interface with computer systems have also experienced expansive growth and improvements.","In addition, computer systems are generally used in an increasing number of applications especially with the advancements made in networking solutions enabling communication between remotely spaced computers. For example, computer systems may be utilized in client applications, server applications as well as stand-alone personal computing applications.","With the increased processing speeds of computer systems, and the increasing usage of computer systems in new and varied applications, devices are desired to assist with storing and quickly accessing data processed and used by computer systems. Mass storage devices have been developed to handle large amounts of digital data utilized by computer systems. Redundant storage systems have been developed to provide continued, correct operations during the presence of a fault or other failure in a component or peripheral of a computer system. More specifically, three primary design criteria are typically considered when developing mass storage devices and include cost (low cost per unit of data storage), high input\/output performance, and availability (ability to recover data even though some components have failed and to insure continued operation). Redundant array of independent disk (RAID) systems have been utilized to provide redundant storage of relatively large amounts of data.","As described below, aspects of the present invention provide improved systems and methodologies for storing and providing data for use in associated computer applications.","Attention is directed to the following commonly assigned applications, which were filed the same day as the present application and are incorporated herein by reference:","U.S. patent application Ser.

Nelson; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/264,661 entitled \u201cVirtual Storage Systems and Virtual Storage System Operational Methods,\u201d by inventors Lee L. Nelson and Rodger Daniels.","According to one aspect of the invention, a virtual storage system comprises a virtual storage space, a physical storage space, a mapping system configured to associate a plurality of addresses of the virtual storage space with respective addresses of the physical storage space and a controller configured to automatically remove a portion of the mapping system according to a prioritization protocol which specifies removal of portions of the mapping system according to an order.","According to another aspect of the invention, a virtual storage system comprises physical storage means for storing data, virtual storage means for providing a representation of the physical storage means to a host, mapping means for providing a plurality of pointers from a plurality of addresses of the virtual storage means to a plurality of respective addresses of the physical storage means and control means for detecting a predetermined status of the physical storage means and automatically removing at least some of the pointers responsive to the detecting.","According to an additional aspect of the invention, a virtual storage method comprises providing a virtual storage space comprising a plurality of virtual storage volumes, providing a physical storage space, creating a plurality of snapshot volumes of at least some of the virtual storage volumes, assigning respective priorities to the snapshot volumes and removing at least one of the snapshot volumes according to the priorities.","According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method of over committing a virtual RAID storage system comprises providing a plurality of pointers to associate a plurality of physical storage locations of a physical storage space with a plurality of virtual storage locations of a virtual storage space, over committing the virtual storage system including copying at least some of the pointers providing a plurality of snapshot volumes, assigning a plurality of priorities to respective ones of the snapshot volumes, diverging at least some of the pointers after the copying including associating the diverged pointers with a plurality of new respective physical storage locations, the diverging consuming additional physical storage space to store diverged data associated with respective ones of the diverged pointers, detecting a remaining storage capacity of the physical storage space obtaining a predetermined status after the diverging, selecting at least one of the snapshot volumes using the priorities and responsive to the detecting and removing the at least one of the snapshot volumes after the selecting.","Referring to , an exemplary arrangement of a data storage system is depicted as reference number . According to aspects of the invention, storage system  is embodied as a virtual storage system. In one arrangement, storage system  is a virtual array (RAID) storage system having abstract addressing or mapping between a virtual storage space and physical storage space as described in further detail below. Virtual storage system arrangements differ from conventional disk array constructions which utilize mathematical functions to provide literal addressing which are fixed to blocks of physical storage space wherein a given address corresponds to a known physical block. Virtual storage systems implement adaptive, dynamic and arbitrary addressing enabling increased flexibility compared with conventional arrangements. For example, a plurality of virtual storage addresses of virtual storage space may be utilized to address a single physical storage location of physical storage space. In such a virtual storage system arrangement, point in time copies of data, also referred to as snapshot volumes of data, may be created which may result, in over commitment of a virtual storage system as divergence of data occurs. Virtual storage system arrangements provide increased apparent capacity and flexibility compared with conventional constructions.","Storage system  arranged as a virtual storage configuration utilizes linear addressing space according to a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command set in one exemplary configuration. Although the presentation of storage system  to a host  may be consistent at different moments in time, a mapping system of a virtual storage system arrangement may change to accommodate demands or requirements of the storage system. Exemplary details regarding a virtual storage system are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,392,244 to Jacobson et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Further details and aspects of virtual array technology are described in HP Virtual Array Technology, 2001 and Executive Summary: Virtualization, Simplification and Storage, November 2001, both available from www.hp.com, and the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Still referring to , storage system  in the exemplary described arrangement includes a controller  and storage space  arranged to store data. Storage system  in the illustrated application is configured to interface with host . Storage system  is arranged to store data received from host  as well as provide requested data to host . Host  may be implemented as a workstation, personal computer, server, network of computer devices, or other appropriate computer structure utilizing a separate data storage system.","In the illustrated configuration, controller  is arranged to implement interfacing operations with respect to host  including handling of input\/output (I\/O) requests. In addition, controller  provides management of storage space  including addressing of storage space  and implementing storage of data therein. As described below in one exemplary configuration, controller  is arranged to create a virtual storage space representation of physical storage space and a mapping system to provide addressing therebetween.","In the depicted exemplary arrangement, controller  includes a central processing unit (CPU)  and memory . An exemplary central processing unit is a PowerPC 440 or 8240 available from Motorola, Inc.","Controller  of storage system  may be configured to implement AutoRAID operations as discussed in the '244 patent discussed above. Controller  implementing AutoRAID operations may monitor use of data stored within system  and determine a best RAID level for the data. For example, infrequently written data is stored in RAID 5DP providing storage efficiency while frequently written data may be stored in RAID 1+0 providing optimum performance. Data may be moved between RAID levels depending upon the age of the data, frequency of accessing the data, and other factors.","Memory  may be utilized to store maps as described further below for use in addressing storage space , to store executable code usable by controller , and to provide a cache for temporarily storing data. Memory  may include a plurality of separate memory areas for storing executable code, maps, and cache in one embodiment.","Referring to , an illustrative representation of storage space  of system  is shown. Storage space  includes a virtual storage space  and a physical storage space  according to an exemplary virtual storage architecture of the described system . Virtual storage space  includes a plurality of virtual storage volumes  and physical storage space  includes a plurality of physical storage volumes . The depicted number of volumes ;  is exemplary and more or less volumes  or volumes  may be utilized in a given application.","Virtual storage volumes  may be referred to as logical unit numbers (LUNs), logical volumes or logical drives. Virtual storage space  including virtual storage volumes  provide a convenient representation of storage capacity to host . Host  may utilize a SCSI command set to implement addressing of storage space  including virtual storage volumes . Host  may implement a logical volume manager, such as LVM software for use in an HP-UX operating system and available from Hewlett-Packard Company, to provide centralized management of storage system . For example, a logical volume manager may provide a virtualization of data storage of storage system  within host  for use in interfacing storage system  with host applications. Management features of system  may appear in a plurality of software management interfaces: SCSI command set, Virtual Front Panel (VFP), Graphical User Interface (GUI), Command Line User Interface (CLUI), Application Programming Interface (API), etc. for use in various solutions integrations.","Physical storage volumes  may comprise an array of disks individually configured to provide actual storage digital data (i.e., no data is stored using virtual storage space in the described configuration). In one aspect, controller  controls storage of data using volumes  according to desired RAID levels. The number of volumes  may be tailored to the particular implementation of system .","Virtual storage space  provides an abstract representation of physical storage space  to host . Virtual storage space  may be modified as desired by controller  or host . For example, virtual storage space  may be tailored to represent physical storage space  in a format which may be conveniently accessed by host . In turn, a logical volume manager of host  may provide yet another virtual abstraction of virtual storage space  (not shown) in a format which may be conveniently utilized by host applications.","Virtual storage space  of system  includes a plurality of addresses or storage locations . The depicted exemplary physical, storage space  includes a plurality of addresses or storage locations . Addresses  of virtual storage space  are utilized to provide addressing of addresses  of physical storage space  wherein data is stored.","For example, in one embodiment, controller  operates to create and implement a mapping system  comprising a plurality of pointers . Pointers  of mapping system  may be stored within memory  and associate a plurality of respective addresses  of virtual storage space  with respective addresses  of physical storage space .","Host  may read or write data with respect to system  by submitting requests. Such requests may address a storage location  of virtual storage volumes . A request received from host  identifying a virtual storage location  has an associated pointer  which identifies the respective physical storage location  which contains the actual data to be read by host , or written to by host , as indicated in the request identifying the virtual storage location .","Individual virtual storage locations  may represent a common predefined amount of data at physical storage locations  in the described implementation. For example, virtual storage locations  may refer to clusters including  blocks which individually include 512 bytes of data in one exemplary arrangement. Accordingly, a virtual storage location  refers to a cluster size piece of data of a respective physical storage location  including 512 blocks individually comprising 512 bytes of data providing a total of 256 kbytes of data per physical storage address or location  in one embodiment.","Storage system  arranged according to a virtual storage architecture is able to implement operations not capable in conventional RAID systems. For example, controller  may create a virtual copy of a storage volume  by duplicating the pointers of the original volume  being copied rather than duplicating the data itself. Such duplication of pointers may be referred to as providing a point in time copy or a snapshot volume of a virtual storage volume .","Referring to , additional details of exemplary point in time copy or snapshot operations are described. A plurality of virtual storage volumes  and physical storage volumes  are shown in . A first virtual storage volume  may be referred to as a parent or original volume while a second virtual storage volume  may be referred to as a snapshot volume . Snapshot operations may be performed to create a new snapshot volume or to refresh an existing snapshot volume to provide a snapshot of the original volume.","In the depicted example, original volume  includes a plurality of respective pointers  at a given moment in time which map virtual storage locations  to physical storage locations . During a snapshot operation, controller  creates another virtual storage volume  of the original volume . In one embodiment, controller  copies the associated pointers  of volume  and creates volume  including the same pointers  pointing to the same physical storage locations  as original volume  at the moment in time when volume  is snapped.","When first created, snapshot volume  shares all of its associated physical storage space  with original volume . Thereafter, data of either the snapshot volume  or the original volume  may be updated responsive to operations from host  or internal operations of controller . When an update occurs, new physical storage space is allocated to hold the new\/modified data. The corresponding pointer(s)  for the new\/modified data of either the snapshot volume  or the original volume  (i.e., the volume that received the new\/modified data) are set to point to the new physical storage address  storing the new data while the corresponding respective pointer(s)  of the unmodified data point to the same or original address(s)  to preserve the snapped data. The provision of new pointers for the new\\modified data process is called divergence. Space that has diverged is no longer shared between snapshot volume  and original volume .","For example, as shown in , a virtual storage location  initially addresses a physical storage location . Accordingly, following a snapshot operation  of original volume , a respective virtual storage location  of snapshot volume  also addresses physical storage location . Thereafter, assume a first write operation  occurs to virtual storage location . Data is retrieved from physical storage location , modified by the first write operation, and stored as diverged data in a new physical storage location . The pointer  associated with virtual storage location  becomes a divergence pointer to address physical storage location  following the first write operation . However, a pointer  of virtual storage location  of snapshot volume  still addresses physical storage location  providing access to the unmodified original data which was snapped.","Updates to data of snapshot volume  may also occur as illustrated by the exemplary second write operation  to a virtual storage location  of snapshot volume . A pointer  previously associated with virtual storage location  and a corresponding physical storage location  is adjusted to now refer to a new physical storage location  following the second write operation and including the modified data which was previously stored as physical storage location . A pointer  associated with a virtual storage location  of original volume  still addresses physical storage location  following the second write operation.","Since a snapshot volume does not consume additional physical storage space at the moment in time the parent volume is snapped, it is possible to configure a snapshot volume so that available physical storage space of storage system  becomes exhausted as divergence occurs. System  permits snapshot operations even if system  does not have sufficient physical storage space to accommodate divergence of the resulting snapshot volume as data is modified. This state of the storage system  may be referred to as over committed. It may be advantageous to allow storage system  to become over committed because one or more snapshot volumes of system  may not experience complete divergence in their cycle of use. In such a case and with over commitment, storage system  may give an appearance that it has more storage space (represented by virtual storage space) than its available physical storage space. Details of representing non-guaranteed available capacity are discussed in U.S. patent application entitled \u201cComputer Systems, Virtual Storage Systems, Virtual Storage System Operational Methods,\u201d naming Michael Jacobson and Lee Nelson as inventors, having Docket No. 100110839-1, incorporated herein by reference.","However, permitting storage system  to become over committed presents problems of how to respond if the physical storage space becomes exhausted. Aspects of the present invention provide management of over commitment of physical storage space to avoid an out-of-space condition that might lead to data unavailability. Aspects of the invention avoid out-of-space conditions by allowing predetermined snapshot volumes to be automatically removed by system  to fulfill space commitments. Accordingly, automatic removal of one or more snapshot volume (and the associated pointers of the mapping system) is provided according to aspects of the invention to avoid data unavailability.","In one aspect, snapshot volumes are associated with a specific category including guaranteed snapshot volumes and non-guaranteed snapshot volumes upon creation of the snapshot volumes. Guaranteed snapshot volumes may correspond to volumes including critical data of host  or otherwise indicated by a system administrator or other entity to be critical while non-guaranteed snapshot volumes may correspond to non-critical data of host  or otherwise indicated by the system administrator or other entity to be non-critical. According to one exemplary operational protocol, parent virtual storage volumes and guaranteed snapshot volumes can not be automatically deleted while non-guaranteed snapshot volumes may be automatically deleted by system  to avoid exhaustion of the physical storage space. In one arrangement, system  will not allow space commitments of parent virtual storage volumes and guaranteed snapshot volumes to exceed the available physical storage space of system . According to other aspects, all types of snapshot volumes may be removed.","Accordingly, some aspects of the invention allow non-guaranteed snapshot volumes to be over committed and automatically removed from system . Host , administrator of system  or other entity should configure system  to avoid the storage of critical data within non-guaranteed snapshot volumes. Additional aspects of the invention permit prioritization of non-guaranteed snapshot volumes and automatic removal of one or more non-guaranteed snapshot volume according to a prioritization protocol.","Referring to , exemplary prioritization of a plurality of non-guaranteed snapshot volumes  is shown according to aspects of the invention. A plurality of association groups , ,  are provided during the formation of respective snapshot volumes . Respective groups , ,  correspond to respective priorities of a prioritization list specifying the removal order of snapshot volumes  by groups to avoid exhaustion of physical storage space  in exemplary aspects.","Individual groups , ,  may include one or more snapshot volume . Snapshot volumes  of a common group have a common priority assigned by an administrator, host , system , or other entity. According to one possible removal prioritization protocol, if one snapshot volume  of a group is removed, the other snapshot volume(s)  of the same group may also be removed to free additional physical storage space . For example, snapshot volumes  may be provided in respective groups corresponding to associated application programs of host . A given application of host  may use snapshot volumes  of a given group and if one snapshot volume  of the group is removed, other snapshot volumes  of the same group may also be removed inasmuch as they will no longer be useful to the application. Other criteria may be utilized for grouping snapshot volumes .","In one implementation, individual groups of snapshot volumes may have respective group identifiers and group priority attributes which specify member snapshot volumes of the group and the priority of removal of the respective snapshot volumes according to the groups. Grouping of snapshot volumes and prioritization of groups may cause automatic removal of all snapshot volumes of a particular group to occur before any removal of snapshot volumes of a different group.","According to one embodiment, a host application, administrator, or other entity maintains consistency in assignment of group identifiers and group priority attributes to snapshot volumes to assure proper automatic removal. When automatic removal is to occur, group priority is used first for selection followed by the group identifier. Selection for automatic removal may be arbitrary among remaining candidates if group identifier and group priority attributes are not deterministic.","If an administrator, host application, or other entity does not establish a group priority for a given snapshot volume, controller  of system  may utilize a default priority protocol to specify removal of the given snapshot volume. One possible default priority protocol may specify removal of at least some of the snapshot volumes in chronological order of creation. Accordingly, the oldest snapshot volumes will be automatically removed first if other snapshot volumes or groups have not been assigned with a lower priority in one exemplary protocol.","Aspects of the invention provide a plurality of ways of establishing priority of snapshot volumes. The group priority of a created snapshot volume may be explicitly defined. In another aspect, the group identity of one or more snapshot volume may be explicitly defined which corresponds to an existing group whereupon the group priority of the existing group is defaulted to snapshot volumes of the group. Group priority may be defaulted if an indicated group identifier is assigned to a snapshot volume but does not match an existing group. The described prioritization is exemplary and other prioritization procedures may be utilized.","According to one exemplary operational aspect of system , controller  is arranged to monitor the remaining capacity of available storage of the physical storage space  at a plurality of moments in time during operation of system . Upon detection of the remaining data storage capacity of physical storage space  reaching a predetermined status, controller  is arranged to implement removal operations to preserve the availability of stored data. Controller  is arranged to implement removal operations according to the prioritization list which specifies removal priorities as assigned by host , the administrator, other entity or default as described above. Following removal of a group of one or more snapshot volumes, it may be necessary to remove additional groups. All non-guaranteed snapshot volumes may be removed if necessary to avoid unavailability of data in one operational aspect.","Upon creation of snapshot volumes, removal action attributes may be assigned to the respective volumes which determine the action taken by controller  when automatic removal of the respective snapshot volumes is appropriate. In one aspect, possible removal operations include deletion or detachment. If a snapshot volume is deleted, the respective pointers are removed from memory and the snapshot volume entity is also removed. For detachment of a snapshot volume, the respective pointers are removed but the snapshot volume remains in existence and may be attached and addressed at later moments in time. Reattachment results in refreshment of the snapshot volume. Removal of the pointers removes portions of the mapping system for the respective snapshot volume and frees the physical storage space of the removed pointers.","Additional aspects of the invention enable a given snapshot volume to be modified at a later moment in time between non-guaranteed and guaranteed statuses. However, in one exemplary operational aspect, if a conversion change of a snapshot volume is requested from non-guaranteed to guaranteed, such change is only allowed if the additional physical storage space implied by the change is available. Guaranteed snapshot volumes may be converted to non-guaranteed snapshot volumes. Non-guaranteed snapshot attributes may be assigned to guaranteed snapshot volumes upon creation in case such guaranteed snapshot volumes are converted to non-guaranteed at a later moment in time.","Additional aspects of the invention enable system  to generate one or more warning corresponding to one or more available capacity status of the physical storage space. One or more warning may be utilized to alert an administrator or other entity as system  approaches an out-of-space condition. Following the warning(s), an administrator or other entity may implement space management operations before a non-guaranteed snapshot volume is deleted. For example, additional disks may be added to the physical storage space or unused virtual storage volumes may be removed. In one aspect, three thresholds (25%, 10%, and 5% remaining capacity of the physical storage space) and associated warnings may be provided prior to automatic removal of a snapshot volume at another threshold such as 2% remaining capacity. Other thresholds and warning operations may be utilized.","According to other aspects of the invention, system  may provide no warnings before removal of a snapshot volume and system  may perform the removal without host application or user assistance.","Additional aspects provide an alarm that is raised after removal of one or more snapshot volume. A host, administrator or other entity may deactivate the alarm after it has been raised by system  so that a new occurrence of an automatic removal alarm is not raised during an acknowledgement of a previous one.","Additional aspects of the invention provide generation of a list of snapshot volumes by controller  including the volumes that are subject to automatic removal and the order they will be removed as the physical storage space continues to be consumed.","Some aspects of the invention may impose restrictions upon creation of non-guaranteed snapshot volumes. For example, some restrictions may be based upon a current condition of the physical storage space according to exemplary aspects. For example, the creation of a new non-guaranteed snapshot volume may be prevented if it is determined that the creation of the new non-guaranteed snapshot volume would cause the deletion of one or more existing non-guaranteed snapshot volume as additional physical space is consumed after creation. Alternatively, such creation of the new non-guaranteed snapshot volume may be permitted according to other aspects, and it is the responsibility of host , administrator or other entity to accommodate the creation and possible deletion of other non-guaranteed snapshot volumes.","Referring to , an exemplary operational method executable by controller  to implement aspects of the invention is illustrated. The depicted methodology may be embodied as executable code within memory  and executed by controller . The methodology is presented to illustrate exemplary steps for performing aspects of the invention. Other methods are possible including more, less or alternative steps.","Referring to a step S, the controller operates to create one or more non-guaranteed snapshot volume.","At a step S, the controller processes one or more write command, for example, from a host.","At a step S, the controller creates one or more divergence pointer to point to a new physical storage address(es) wherein the modified data resides.","At a step S, the controller compares the remaining available capacity of the physical storage space with one or more threshold.","In one embodiment, physical capacity is continuously monitored at a step S to determine if removal is appropriate. Additional snapshot volumes may also be created at future moments in time and monitoring of the physical capacity status would be implemented as described herein.","If the condition of step S is positive indicating exhaustion of the physical storage space, the controller may access the prioritization list including the priorities of groups of non-guaranteed snapshot volumes at a step S.","At a step S, controller operates to remove the non-guaranteed snapshot volumes associated with the group having the lowest priority.","Aspects of the present invention provide numerous improvements to techniques for accommodating over commitment. For example, some solutions provided predictive capabilities including monitoring systems and system administrator warnings if the physical storage space neared exhaustion. Corrective action could be performed by the system administrator in terms of adding additional physical space (e.g., disks) to the system or manually deleting unused volumes from the system. Numerous disadvantages exist inasmuch as a response from the system administrator is required and the individual may be unavailable. If there is no response, physical space may become exhausted often resulting in data unavailability or data loss.","Aspects of the present invention provide automatic removal of snapshot volume(s) including associated benefits of not requiring system administrator response to avoid physical space exhaustion. The storage system, host, administrator, or other entity may configure an automatic deletion policy according to aspects of the invention to enable appropriate action without human intervention when physical storage space nears exhaustion. Aspects of the invention eliminate the possibility that lack of administrator response will lead to data unavailability or data loss making over committed snapshot operations more feasible, manageable, useful, and acceptable to users of storage systems.","The protection sought is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, which are given by way of example only, but instead is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
