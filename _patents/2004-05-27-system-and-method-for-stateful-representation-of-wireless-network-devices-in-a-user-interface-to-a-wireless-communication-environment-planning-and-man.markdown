title: System and method for stateful representation of wireless network devices in a user interface to a wireless communication environment planning and management system
abstract: A system for providing multiple graphical representations for wireless network devices indicating status of the devices. The generated graphical representations of the devices are indicative of radio frequency channels the devices are operating on, as well as whether devices are on, off or in a standby mode. A device in standby mode monitors the wireless network to determine when it can resume normal operation. A menu or other interface construct is generated to enable a user to determine additional properties of the devices, such as addresses. Device representations may also indicate that devices are operating within the wireless network, but do not support one or more functions associated the system for managing the wireless network.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to wireless networks and communications, and more specifically to a system and method for stateful representation of wireless network devices in a user interface to a wireless communication environment planning and management system.","Wireless communication networks are becoming increasingly common for interconnecting many types of electronic devices. Computer systems of all sizes, personal digital assistants, input\/output devices, entertainment system components and other types of home appliances, are all examples of client station devices that are candidates for interconnection using a wireless communication network. Various specific wireless communication protocols have been developed. Examples of existing wireless communication protocols may be found in the family of standards for wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) known as IEEE 802.11, including the 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g wireless communication standards.","Generally, wireless networks include some number of access devices (referred to herein as \u201caccess points\u201d) that provide network access to some number of wireless client devices (referred to herein as \u201cstations\u201d). For example, an access point in a wireless network may be connected to a wired communication network, and client stations using the wireless network are provided wireless access to the wired network through the access point.","Existing systems provide inadequate visual information describing the status and properties of devices within a wireless network. For example, access point representations in existing systems do not conveniently indicate information about the associated access point such as whether the access point is on, whether the access point can participate in a system used by a network manager to manage the wireless network, and\/or what radio frequency channel the access point is currently using. Additionally, existing systems fail to provide a convenient way for access points to be removed from and reintroduced to the wireless network.","For the above reasons and others it would be desirable to have a new system for representing wireless network devices in a way that indicates access point status and properties. The system should provide convenient access to device properties not reflected in a top level graphical representation, to enable quick understanding access point operation with respect to other devices. The system should also provide a convenient way for a network manager to conveniently determine whether devices are active or in a standby mode.","To address the above described and other shortcomings of existing systems, a system and method for managing a wireless network is disclosed that generates visually distinctive graphical representations for wireless network devices that reflect the state of the devices. Wireless network devices represented using the disclosed system include access points and stations. Specific graphical representations are provided indicating whether the associated device is off or on, the radio frequency channel the device is operating on, and\/or whether the device is in a standby mode. The disclosed interface includes a menu or other interface construct allowing the user to determine additional properties of the device, such as an address. The disclosed system further operates to put a device into a standby mode in response to a determination that the operation of the device would otherwise interfere with the operation of one or more other devices. When the device is in standby mode, it is not participating in the wireless network, but is monitoring the network to determine whether it can become operational and join the network. When the device determines there is no longer another device that would interfere with its operation, it automatically transitions to normal operation. The graphical representation of a device generated by the disclosed system may also indicate that a device is operating within the wireless network, but does not include functionality to support one or more functions associated with the managing the disclosed wireless network in accordance with the disclosed system.","By representing a wireless network in a way that distinctly shows device status, and by providing convenient access to further properties of each device, the disclosed system enables a user to quickly and easily understand how devices are operating with respect to other devices. In addition, the disclosed system provides a convenient way to determine whether a device is in a standby mode, in which the device monitors the wireless environment until it can effectively transition to normal operation.","As shown in , an illustrative embodiment of the disclosed system includes a wireless communication network management software program  and a separate drawing software program  executing on a management station . The management station  may, for example, consist of any specific type of computer system, including one or more processors operable to execute program code stored in a computer program memory or other type of computer program storage device, and having a number of input\/output devices and interfaces. The management station  is communicably coupled to a wired network , which in turn is coupled to a number of wireless access point devices , shown for purposes of illustration as access points AP A, AP B, and AP C. The access point devices  provide wireless access to the wired network  to client station devices . The client station devices  are shown for purposes of illustration as client stations CS A, CS B, CS C, CS D, and CS  E. The access point devices  and the client station devices  are shown within a wireless communication network . The wireless communication network  is accessible to and managed by the wireless communication network management program . The management station , and each of the access point devices  and client station devices  shown in  include hardware, firmware, and\/or software implemented functionality enabling them to communicate using one or more networking protocols to exchange information, such as messages or packets.","During operation of the embodiment shown in , the wireless communication network management program  uses graphical user interface software (GUI SW)  to provide a user interface output . The output  includes a graphical representation of the radio frequency domain characteristics of one or more devices in the wireless communication network , in combination with a graphical representation of the physical space in which the wireless communication network  is deployed. In order to generate the output , the wireless communication network management program  communicates with the drawing program  through an application programming interface (API) . For example, display objects , commands and\/or other data may be communicated between the wireless communication network management program  and the drawing program . An electronic, computer readable representation  of the physical space , such as a data file or other type of electronic document, is stored by or within the drawing program . In an illustrative embodiment, the drawing program  consists of a copy of the Visio\u00ae drawing program provided by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["50","20","50"]},"At step , the disclosed system operates to discover the access point and client station devices in the wireless communication network being managed. For example, the wireless communication network may be associated with a predetermined subnet mask, and that subnet mask may be used to discover devices on the wireless network that match the subnet mask. Such wireless network device discovery may be performed using techniques such as the PING (Packet Internet Groper) utility, which check for all responding device IP (Internet Protocol) addresses corresponding to the predetermined subnet mask. In addition, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) may, for example, then be used for translating IP addresses into the 6-byte Ethernet addresses of the discovered devices.","After the disclosed system has discovered a device on the wireless communication network, a request message, such as an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) request message, is sent to that device to determine whether the device is manageable by the wireless communication network management program  of . Devices that return a positive response are sent further request messages to determine characteristics and settings of the devices. Such characteristics and settings may be obtained, for example, through values stored in the Management Information Base (MIB) of the devices, and include indications of characteristics and settings such as transmit power settings and lists of associated client stations for access points.","At step , the disclosed system operates to combine representations of the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices with the physical space representation. As a result, the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices may be conveniently indicated to the user within the context of and at the same scale as the physical space representation. For example, the disclosed system may operate by creating one or more wireless device radio frequency domain representations in one or more graphical \u201clayers\u201d defined using the drawing program , that may be superimposed over the physical space representation in a user interface display.","The wireless communication network management program  subsequently operates to periodically send further request messages to the access point devices discovered in step , in order to monitor their radio frequency domain characteristics and settings, such as current transmit power settings and associated client station lists. Any changes detected using these requests may then be used to modify radio frequency domain representations of the wireless network devices that are layered over the physical space representation  in the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["60","62","64","66","60","60","62"]},"As shown in , access point representation  has an associated power range ring . The multi-band access point representation  represents a single corresponding access point device having multiple radio frequency band capabilities, and includes conjoined access point representations  and , each having the same visual appearance as representations of single radio frequency band capable access point devices. For example, the access point representation  may represent the IEEE 802.11a radio frequency band circuitry within the multi-band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation , and the access point representation  may represent the IEEE 802.11g radio frequency band circuitry within the multi-band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation .","The conjoined access point representations  and  each have respective associated power range rings  and . The areas within the power range rings ,  and  represent radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. The greater the diameter of a power range ring, the larger the area of the radio coverage range it represents.","The thickness of each of the power range rings , , and  represents the potential bandwidth that can be provided by the associated access point devices to client stations located within them. A thicker power range ring indicates a relatively larger amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring, while a thinner power range ring indicates a relatively lower amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring. The appearances of the access point representations and associated power range rings are further indicative of the radio frequency channels on which the corresponding access point devices are currently operating. For example, the access point representation  may be displayed in a first predetermined color associated with a corresponding radio frequency channel, indicating that the corresponding access point device is operating within that radio frequency channel.","Similarly, since the multi-band access point representation  may correspond to a \u201cdual mode\u201d access point device, thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry, each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly, each of the conjoined access point representations  and , and their associated power range rings may be represented to visually indicate the respective colors associated respectively with two different radio frequency channels that currently being used by the corresponding access point.","Each access point representation may further include textual information. For example, the access point representation  includes text  indicating the specific channel (\u201c153\u201d) that the corresponding access point device is currently operating on, text  indicating the wireless LAN protocol used (\u201ca\u201d for 802.11a) by the corresponding access point device, and the last three characters of the MAC (Media Access Control) address (\u201c300\u201d) of the corresponding access point.","The specific appearance, such as diameter, width, color and textual information, for each access point representation and associated power range ring may be determined in part response to configuration and setting information determined from the corresponding devices, for example by way of SNMP requests for MIB values stored in the devices. Such configuration information may include the type of wireless communication protocol supported and\/or enabled in the device, such as one of the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b or 802.11g protocols. The configuration and setting information determined from the devices may also include a current transmit power setting for the device, current channel, or other information that may be used to determine the appearance of the access point representations and power range rings. User provided information may also or alternatively be used to determine in part or completely how the access point representations and power range rings are represented, as described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["60","80","82","70","84","86","88","74","72","72","88","74","72","92","90","76","72","90","76","72","94","64"]},"The association lines provided between the client station and access point representations of  are formatted to visually indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding access point and client station devices, as well as the currently selected radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices. For example, the width of an association line may be used to indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations connected by the association line. In such an embodiment, a relatively thick association line may be used to represent a relatively large amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices, while a relatively thin association line may be used to represent a relatively small amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices. Similarly, the format of the association lines in  may be used to visually indicate a current radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations the connect. For example, the color of the association lines may indicate which radio frequency channel is currently being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations they connect.

The association line  similarly indicates the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation  and the client station device corresponding the client station representation .

The icon interface display window enables a user to indicate various visual aspects of the user interface display with regard to the device representations and association lines. The address display buttons  enable the user to indicate whether some portion of the MAC or IP address of a device should be shown in a text portion of its graphical representation. The automatic client station placement button  enables a user to indicate that representations of client stations should be automatically placed in physical proximity to the representations of the access point devices with which they are associated. The channel representation buttons  enable a user to indicate how radio frequency channels currently in use should be represented in the device representations, power range rings, and association lines. For example, different radio channels may be distinctly represented by respective ones of a set of \u201cCRT\u201d colors, respective ones of a set of \u201cLCD\u201d colors, or by corresponding line formats in black and white patterns. The association line thickness check box  enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of association lines should be used to represent the relative amount of available bandwidth between associated devices. The association line thickness value field  enables a user to indicate an association line thickness to be used if the association line thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth between associated devices. The power range ring thickness check box  enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of displayed power range rings is to be used to indicate the amount of bandwidth available to client station devices within them. Similarly, the power range ring thickness value field enables a user to indicate a power range ring thickness to be used if the power range ring thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth within the power range rings.","The \u201cpower Halo\u201d check box  enables a user to indicate an additional visual characteristic, such as a shaded area referred to as a \u201chalo\u201d, should be used with access point representations.

Such a shading may resemble a colored cloud of the same color as used to represent the current radio frequency channel that the device is currently operating on. If the \u201chalo\u201d visual characteristic is enabled, the user may further indicate the diameter of the shaded area to be used in the field .","The field  enables a user to indicate a distance at which client station representations are to be placed when they are automatically placed near the representations of access point devices with which the corresponding client station devices are associated.

A relatively small selected transmit power value in column  results in relatively smaller diameter power range rings, while a relatively large selected transmit power value in column  results in relatively larger diameter power range rings. This reflects the fact that a higher transmit power enables the radio signals from the wireless devices associated with the power range rings to carry greater amounts of data over greater distances. Accordingly, the disclosed system determines a diameter for each power range ring that corresponds to the distance in the physical space representation, based on scale information provided by the user, that would reflect the throughputs shown for the corresponding transmit power in the selected row. For example, if the radio button for \u221264 dBm were selected, and a device is being represented that uses IEEE 802.11b technology, the disclosed system generates power range rings having a diameter equal to the distance, in the scale of the physical space representation, that could be traversed using a transmit power of \u221264 DBm, and providing a maximum throughput of 11 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11b protocol. If the device being represented is an IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g device, the generated ring would have a diameter equal to the distance, in the scale of the physical space representation, that could be traversed using a transmit power of \u221264 DBm, and providing a maximum throughput of 54 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g protocols.","Similarly, the thickness of each power range ring decreases as the power range ring diameter increases, reflecting a smaller amount of available bandwidth within the area of the physical space representation within the power range ring. Accordingly, the values in columns ,  and  increase as the amount of transmit power in column  increases. For example, if the radio button in column  corresponding to \u221264 dBm is selected, the generated power range rings would have a relatively smaller thickness indicative of 11 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11b protocol devices, and a relatively greater thickness indicative of 54 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g protocol devices. Thus the thickness of each power range ring may be responsive to a user selected amount of radio signal attenuation, and reflects the distance in the physical space representation corresponding to the diameter of the power range ring, and the type of communication protocol used by the associated wireless device. The user may also select the bottom of the six radio button in the column , and then enter a value in dBm from \u221225 to \u221299 in the adjacent box.
