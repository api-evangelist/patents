An example of a service is a connection to a language interpreter to obtain language interpretation. A seamless approach is provided so that a user may easily connect to the service irrespective of limitations imposed by the Internet enabled device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","118","104","102","118","118"]},"The Internet enabled communication device  has a processor  and a memory . The processor  executes instructions for a module stored in memory for a period of time. Further, the Internet enabled communication device  has a telephony module  and a data module . In one embodiment, the Internet enabled communication device  imposes a restriction such that the memory  can only store one module at a time. Accordingly, the Internet enabled communication device  would not be able to store both the telephony module  and the data module  in the memory  at the same time for execution. If the user has entered in user data for a language interpretation account such as user name, account information, a language for language interpretation, etc., that information cannot be kept in memory once the telephony module is placed in memory to make a telephone call. In addition, the only data that can typically be transmitted to an automated telephone system is data in Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (\u201cDTMF\u201d), which is a system utilized for touch tone telephones. A frequency, i.e., the dual tones, is configured for each button so that a processor can recognize the button that is pressed. The restriction of having one module in memory at a time prevents the transfer of the user data in DTMF to the telephony module after the call has been initiated. As a result, the user may have to enter all of that information in when the telephone call is placed to an automated system .","In one embodiment, the data module  receives the user data from the user. The data module  then provides the user data along with an identifier through the Internet  to a web services system . The web services system  may be a computer that is utilized by the language interpretation platform . An example of the identifier is the telephone number corresponding to the Internet enabled communication device. However, other types of identifiers may be utilized. The web services system  stores the user data and the identifier in a database . The web services system  determines if the user is authorized to proceed with the telephone call. For example, the web services system may contact a credit card processor to determine if the credit card provided by the user is valid and if a predetermined minimum amount of available credit is available on the credit card of the of the user. If the user is authorized to proceed with the telephone call, the web services system  provides an acknowledgement to the data module  that the web services system  received the user data with the identifier and that the user is authorized to proceed with the telephone call. In one embodiment, the data module  requests the acknowledgement. In an alternative embodiment, the web services system  provides the acknowledgement without the data module  providing a request to the web services system .","Subsequent to the data module  receiving the acknowledgement from the web services system , the telephony module  initiates the telephone call through a telephone network such as a public switched telephone network (\u201cPSTN\u201d) . For example, the telephone call is received at a switch  at the language interpretation platform  that can be connected to the PSTN . However, other phone networks such as digital phone networks may be utilized. The switch  provides the telephone call to the automated system . Further, the automated system  obtains the identifier. For example, the automated system  may utilize caller id to obtain the telephone number of the Internet enabled communication device . For instance, the automatic number identification (\u201cANI\u201d) service may be utilized to determine the telephone number of an incoming call. The automated system  then utilizes the identifier to retrieve the user data from the database . The user data had been previously stored by the web services system  in the database . Accordingly, the automated system may then utilize the user data to automatically connect the user to a service without the user having to input the user data through the automated system . As a result, the user may not even realize that he or she has been connected to the automated system . For example, the user may enter his or her user data into the Internet enabled communication device  prior to the telephone call and then after the telephone call is initiated, the automated system  may automatically connect the user with a language interpreter without the user having to directly provide the user data through the automated system . The user may not even realize that he or she has been first connected to the automated system  before being connected to the language interpreter. The automated system  selects an interpreter with the qualifications to provide language interpretation to the user based on the user data. For example, if the user needs an interpreter for Spanish, the automated system  selects an interpreter that is qualified to interpreter Spanish. Accordingly, the Internet enabled communication device  has the ability to transmit control and attribute data to the automated system  without utilizing DTMF or voice interaction.","In one embodiment, the web services system  is a server. Further, the web services system  may provide Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) to access different services on the server. Accordingly, a set of data services APIs may be accessible through external API requests. These data services may utilize various data transport mechanisms and protocols. In one embodiment, the API calls can be made synchronously or asynchronously to the voice call. Among other things, the API calls can provide the following services: identification of the caller and his or her account, identification of the language requested, ability to create a new account, ability to initiate an interpretation call, ability to query the system to determine the current language, availability prior to initiating a call, ability to provide a secure handshake and acknowledgement that the voice call initiated will be accepted, and the ability request a voice call back.","In one embodiment, the identifier may be utilized in addition to other data to store the user data in the database . For example, a timestamp that the request was initiated and a password may additionally be utilized.","Further, in one embodiment, the data module  receives the acknowledgement and informs the Internet enabled communication device  that the telephone call may be initiated. The Internet enabled communication device  then informs the telephone module that the telephone call may be initiated. In another embodiment, the data module  informs the telephony module  that the telephone call may be initiated.","In one embodiment, a first network such as the Internet  may be utilized for the communication between the data module  and the web services system  whereas a second distinct network such as the PSTN  may be utilized for the communication between the telephony module  and the language interpretation platform  or other type of platform providing a different service. In an alternative embodiment, a single network may be utilized for both communications. For example, the Internet  may be utilized for both the first communication between the data module  and the web services platform  and the second communication between the telephony module  and the language interpretation platform  or other type of platform providing a different service. The PSTN  may alternatively be utilized for both communications.","For illustrative purposes, the Internet enabled communication device  is Internet enabled and sends data from the data module  to the web services system  through the Internet . However, a network enabled communication device may be utilized to connect to a services system through networks other than the Internet. For example, a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), wireless network, etc. may be utilized. Accordingly, any of the configurations described herein may be utilized with network enabled communication device that communicates through with a services system through a network other than the Internet.","In one embodiment, the user may utilize the Internet  enabled communication device  to download the data module  to the Internet enabled communication device . The data module  may be downloaded from an Internet store. For example, the manufacturer of the Internet enabled communication device  may provide an Internet store for various applications that may be downloaded to the Internet enabled communication device . Alternatively, the user may download the data module  directly from the provider of the service . For example, the user may download the data module  directly from the language interpretation platform  when seeking a language interpretation service. In yet another alternative, the Internet enabled communication device  comes with the data module  preinstalled.","In an alternative embodiment, the data module  may be independent of the platform utilized by the Internet enabled communication device . Accordingly, the data module  may be utilized with different types of Internet enabled communication devices  with different types of platforms. For example, the data module  may be downloaded to both an Internet enabled communication device  that has a limitation preventing simultaneous execution of the data module  and the telephony module  and an Internet enabled communication device that allows simultaneous execution of the data module  and the telephony module . As a result, each of the Internet enabled communication devices  connects to the service  in a uniform manner irrespective of the specific platforms of the Internet enabled communication devices .","In another embodiment, the data module  may be utilized by an Internet enabled communication device  that allows simultaneous execution of the data module  and the telephony module . Accordingly, the data module  may be utilized even if the Internet enabled communication device  does not have a restriction on having both the data module  and the telephony module  in the memory at the same time.","In one embodiment, the Internet enabled communication device  allows the user to input user data through visual interaction. For example, after the user has downloaded the data module , the user may visually interact with the Internet enabled communication device  to provide information to create an account. For instance, the user can be visually prompted for information such as name, password, credit card number, etc. The user may also be visually prompted about the specifics regarding the service . For example, the user may be visually prompted to enter the language for which the user needs an interpreter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2E","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","102","102","102","102","204","102","206","102","206","106","206"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["102","206"]},"The user can also select the My Phrases tab, which provides the user with translations of many everyday spoken phrases in a particular language.
