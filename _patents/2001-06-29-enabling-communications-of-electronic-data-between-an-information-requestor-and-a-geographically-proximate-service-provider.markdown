{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/215,774 filed Jun. 30, 2000, which is incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates generally to a system and method for transferring electronic data in a communications system.","Online service providers are constantly offering new services and upgrading existing services to enhance the online experience of their subscriber. Subscribers have on-demand access to news, weather, financial, sports, and entertainment services as well as the ability to transmit electronic messages and to participate in online discussion groups. For example, subscribers of online service providers (OSPs), such as America Online or CompuServe, may access servers located throughout the world and retrieve information concerning a wide variety of topics from those servers. A server may be maintained by the service provider or by a third party provider who makes information and services available to the service provider through a worldwide network of computers.","In one general aspect, electronic data are transferred by receiving subsequent requests from the client to access a communications system at a first geographic location from a client located at a second geographic location remote from the first geographic location; identifying a proxy local to the client in the second geographic location; and receiving subsequent data requests from the client at the proxy.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the data requests may be encapsulated in a tunneling protocol at a proxy. The tunneling proxy may include a user datagram protocol. Implementations also may include determining whether the data requests can be satisfied by electronic data stored in a cache at the second geographic location; sending the data requests to the Internet; retrieving electronic data responsive to the data requests at the proxy; storing electronic data responsive to the data requests in a cache at the second geographic location; performing filtering of electronic data at the proxy according to user-defined preferences; and transferring electronic data responsive to the data requests to the client from the proxy.","The first geographic location may be in a first country and the second geographic location may be in a second country different than the first country. The communications system may be an online service provider, and the proxy may be an IP tunnel, such as a Layer Two Tunneling Protocol tunnel.","The described techniques reduce the time required for an OSP to fulfill data requests from subscribers and enable the OSP to maintain a certain level of control over the content delivered to its subscribers. Because unfettered access to the public Internet may compromise its proprietary nature, an OSP may prevent Internet servers from directly fulfilling requests from its subscribers. A subscriber thus may be required to communicate with a remote OSP even when the request could be satisfied by data stored on an Internet server local to the subscriber.","By using a proxy local to the subscriber, for example, an OSP that must communicate with a significant number of geographically dispersed subscribers from a centralized location can avoid the significant delays resulting from long distance communication and still buffer its subscriber from the public Internet. Through the proxy, the OSP may act transparently to the subscriber and perform functions such as protocol conversion and\/or encapsulation of requests from subscribers and data received from Internet servers.","Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description, including the drawings, and from the claims.","For illustrative purposes,  describe a communications system for implementing techniques for transferring electronic data. For brevity, several elements in the figures described below are represented as monolithic entities. However, as would be understood by one skilled in the art, these elements each may include numerous interconnected computers and components designed to perform a set of specified operations and\/or dedicated to a particular geographical region.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging data between a client system  and a host system  through a communications link .

In particular, the host system  and communications link  typically have attributes comparable to those described with respect to host system  and communications link  of . Likewise, the client system  of  typically has attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the client system  of .","The client device  typically includes a general purpose computer  having an internal or external storage  for storing data and programs such as an operating system  (e.g., DOS, Windows\u2122, Windows 95\u2122, Windows 98\u2122, Windows 2000\u2122, Windows NT\u2122, OS\/2, or Linux) and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications  (e.g., word processing, database programs, spreadsheet programs, or graphics programs) capable of generating documents or other electronic content; client applications  (e.g., AOL client, CompuServe client, AIM client, AOL TV client, or ISP client) capable of communicating with other computer users, accessing various computer resources, and viewing, creating, or otherwise manipulating electronic content; and browser applications  (e.g., Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer) capable of rendering standard Internet content.","The general-purpose computer  also includes a central processing unit  (CPU) for executing instructions in response to commands from the client controller . In one implementation, the client controller  includes one or more of the application programs installed on the internal or external storage  of the general-purpose computer . In another implementation, the client controller  includes application programs externally stored in and performed by one or more device(s) external to the general-purpose computer .","The general-purpose computer typically will include a communication device  for sending and receiving data. One example of the communication device  is a modem. Other examples include a transceiver, a set-top box, a communication card, a satellite dish, an antenna, or another network adapter capable of transmitting and receiving data over the communications link  through a wired or wireless data pathway . The general-purpose computer  also may include a TV (\u201ctelevision\u201d) tuner  for receiving television programming in the form of broadcast, satellite, and\/or cable TV signals. As a result, the client device  can selectively and\/or simultaneously display network content received by communications device  and television programming content received by the TV tuner .","The general-purpose computer  typically will include an input\/output interface  for wired or wireless connection to various peripheral devices . Examples of peripheral devices  include, but are not limited to, a mouse , a mobile phone , a personal digital assistant  (PDA), a keyboard , a display monitor  with or without a touch screen input, a TV remote control  for receiving information from and rendering information to subscribers, and an audiovisual input device .","Although  illustrates devices such as a mobile telephone , a PDA , and a TV remote control  as being peripheral with respect to the general-purpose computer , in another implementation, such devices may themselves include the functionality of the general-purpose computer  and operate as the client device . For example, the mobile phone  or the PDA  may include computing and networking capabilities and function as a client device  by accessing the delivery network  and communicating with the host system . Furthermore, the client system  may include one, some or all of the components and devices described above.","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices .

Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems  and  shown in , respectively.","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host device  includes a login server  for enabling access by subscribers and routing communications between the client system  and other elements of the host device . The host device  also includes various host complexes such as the depicted OSP (\u201cOnline Service Provider\u201d) host complex  and IM (\u201cInstant Messaging\u201d) host complex . To enable access to these host complexes by subscribers, the client system  includes communication software, for example, an OSP client application and an IM client application. The OSP and IM communication software applications are designed to facilitate the subscriber's interactions with the respective services and, in particular, may provide access to all the services available within the respective host complexes.","Typically, the OSP host complex  supports different services, such as email, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is generally designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other and employs certain protocols (i.e., standards, formats, conventions, rules, and structures) to transfer data. The OSP host complex  ordinarily employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access by selected client applications. The OSP host complex  may define one or more specific protocols for each service based on a common, underlying proprietary protocol.","The IM host complex  is generally independent of the OSP host complex , and supports instant messaging services irrespective of a subscriber's network or Internet access. Thus, the IM host complex  allows subscribers to send and receive instant messages, whether or not they have access to any particular ISP. The IM host complex  may support associated services, such as administrative matters, advertising, directory services, chat, and interest groups related to the instant messaging. The IM host complex  has an architecture that enables all of the machines within the IM host complex to communicate with each other. To transfer data, the MI host complex  employs one or more standard or exclusive IM protocols.","The host device  may include one or more gateways that connect and therefore link complexes, such as the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway . The OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex  gateway may directly or indirectly link the OSP host complex  with the IM host complex  through a wired or wireless pathway. Ordinarily, when used to facilitate a link between complexes, the OSP host complex gateway  and the IM host complex gateway  are privy to information regarding the protocol type anticipated by a destination complex, which enables any necessary protocol conversion to be performed incident to the transfer of data from one complex to another. For instance, the OSP host complex  and IM host complex  generally use different protocols such that transferring data between the complexes requires protocol conversion by or at the request of the OSP host complex gateway  and\/or the IM host complex gateway .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

Likewise, the host system  of  may have attributes comparable to and illustrates one possible embodiment of the host systems , , and  shown in , respectively. However,  describes an aspect of the host system , focusing primarily on one particular implementation of OSP host complex . For purposes of communicating with an OSP host complex , the delivery network  is generally a telephone network.","The client system  includes a client device  and a client controller . The client controller  is generally capable of establishing a connection to the host system , including the OSP host complex , the IM host complex  and\/or the Internet . In one implementation, the client controller  includes an OSP application for communicating with servers in the OSP host complex  using exclusive OSP protocols. The client controller  also may include applications, such as an IM client application, and\/or an Internet browser application, for communicating with the IM host complex  and the Internet .","The host system  includes a host device  and a host controller . The host controller  is generally capable of transmitting instructions to any or all of the elements of the host device . For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . However, in other implementations, as described above, the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system , including an OSP host complex  and an IM host complex . The login server  may implement one or more authorization procedures to enable simultaneous access to the OSP host complex  and the IM host complex . The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","The OSP host complex  supports a set of services from one or more servers located internal to and external from the OSP host complex . Servers external to the OSP host complex  generally may be viewed as existing on the Internet . Servers internal to the OSP complex  may be arranged in one or more configurations. For example, servers may be arranged in centralized or localized clusters in order to distribute servers and subscribers within the OSP host complex .","In the implementation of , the OSP host complex  includes a routing processor . In general, the routing processor  will examine an address field of a data request, use a mapping table to determine the appropriate destination for the data request, and direct the data request to the appropriate destination. In a packet-based implementation, the client system  may generate information requests, convert the requests into data packets, sequence the data packets, perform error checking and other packet-switching techniques, and transmit the data packets to the routing processor . Upon receiving data packets from the client system , the routing processor  may directly or indirectly route the data packets to a specified destination within or outside of the OSP host complex . For example, in the event that a data request from the client system  can be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request to a local server . In the event that the data request cannot be satisfied locally, the routing processor  may direct the data request externally to the Internet  or the IM host complex  through the gateway .","The OSP host complex  also includes a proxy server  for directing data requests and\/or otherwise facilitating communication between the client system  and the Internet  through. The proxy server  may include an IP (\u201cInternet Protocol\u201d) tunnel for converting data from OSP protocol into standard Internet protocol and transmitting the data to the Internet . The IP tunnel also converts data received from the Internet in the standard Internet protocol back into the OSP protocol and sends the converted data to the routing processor  for delivery back to the client system .","The proxy server  also may allow the client system  to use standard Internet protocols and formatting to access the OSP host complex  and the Internet . For example, the subscriber can use an OSP TV client application having an embedded browser application installed on the client system  to generate a request in standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). In a packet-based implementation, data packets may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d) and routed to the proxy server . The proxy server  may include a L2TP (\u201cLayer Two Tunneling Protocol\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (PPP) session with the client system .","The proxy server  also may act as a buffer between the client system  and the Internet , and may implement content filtering and time saving techniques. For example, the proxy server  can check parental controls settings of the client system  and request and transmit content from the Internet  according to the parental control settings. In addition, the proxy server  may include one or more caches for storing frequently accessed information. If requested data is determined to be stored in the caches, the proxy server  may send the information to the client system  from the caches and avoid the need to access the Internet .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link . Client system  typically includes one or more client devices  and one or more client controllers  for controlling the client devices . Host system  typically includes one or more host devices  and one or more host controllers  for controlling the host devices . The communications link  may include communication pathways ,  enabling communications through the one or more delivery networks . As shown, the client system  may access the Internet  through the host system .","Examples of each element within the communication system of  are broadly described above with respect to .

The OSP host complex  and the IM host complex  are connected through one or more OSP host complex gateways  and one or more IM host complex gateways . Each OSP host complex gateway  and IM host complex gateway  may perform any protocol conversions necessary to enable communication between the OSP host complex , the IM host complex , and the Internet .","To access the IM host complex  to begin an instant messaging session, the client system  establishes a connection to the login server . The login server  typically determines whether the particular subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex  by verifying a subscriber identification and password. If the subscriber is authorized to access the IM host complex , the login server  employs a hashing technique on the subscriber's screen name to identify a particular IM server  for use during the subscriber's session. The login server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular IM server , gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie), and breaks the connection. The client system  then uses the IP address to establish a connection to the particular IM server  through the communications link , and obtains access to that IM server  using the encrypted key. Typically, the client system  will be equipped with a Winsock API (\u201cApplication Programming Interface\u201d) that enables the client system  to establish an open TCP connection to the IM server .","Once a connection to the IM server  has been established, the client system  may directly or indirectly transmit data to and access content from the IM server  and one or more associated domain servers . The IM server  supports the fundamental instant messaging services and the domain servers  may support associated services, such as, for example, administrative matters, directory services, chat and interest groups. In general, the purpose of the domain servers  is to lighten the load placed on the IM server  by assuming responsibility for some of the services within the IM host complex . By accessing the IM server  and\/or the domain server , a subscriber can use the IM client application to view whether particular subscribers (\u201cbuddies\u201d) are online, exchange instant messages with particular subscribers, participate in group chat rooms, trade files such as pictures, invitations or documents, find other subscribers with similar interests, get customized news and stock quotes, and search the Web.","In the implementation of , the IM server  is directly or indirectly connected to a routing gateway . The routing gateway  facilitates the connection between the IM server  and one or more alert multiplexors , for example, by serving as a link minimization tool or hub to connect several IM servers to several alert multiplexors. In general, an alert multiplexor  maintains a record of alerts and subscribers registered to receive the alerts.","Once the client system  is connected to the alert multiplexor , a subscriber can register for and\/or receive one or more types of alerts. The connection pathway between the client system  and the alert multiplexor  is determined by employing another hashing technique at the IM server  to identify the particular alert multiplexor  to be used for the subscriber's session. Once the particular multiplexor  has been identified, the IM server  provides the client system  with the IP address of the particular alert multiplexor  and gives the client system  an encrypted key (i.e., a cookie). The client system  then uses the IP address to connect to the particular alert multiplexor  through the communication link  and obtains access to the alert multiplexor  using the encrypted key.","The alert multiplexor  is connected to an alert gate  that, like the IM host complex gateway , is capable of performing the necessary protocol conversions to form a bridge to the OSP host complex . The alert gate  is the interface between the IM host complex  and the physical servers, such as servers in the OSP host complex , where state changes are occurring. In general, the information regarding state changes will be gathered and used by the IM host complex . However, the alert multiplexor  also may communicate with the OSP host complex  through the IM gateway , for example, to provide the servers and subscribers of the OSP host complex  with certain information gathered from the alert gate .","The alert gate  can detect an alert feed corresponding to a particular type of alert. The alert gate  may include a piece of code (alert receive code) capable of interacting with another piece of code (alert broadcast code) on the physical server where a state change occurs. In general, the alert receive code installed on the alert gate  instructs the alert broadcast code installed on the physical server to send an alert feed to the alert gate  upon the occurrence of a particular state change. Upon detecting an alert feed, the alert gate  contacts the alert multiplexor , which in turn, informs the client system  of the detected alert feed.","In the implementation of , the IM host complex  also includes a subscriber profile server  connected to a database  for storing large amounts of subscriber profile data. The subscriber profile server  may be used to enter, retrieve, edit, manipulate, or otherwise process subscriber profile data. In one implementation, a subscriber's profile data includes, for example, the subscriber's buddy list, alert preferences, designated stocks, identified interests, and geographic location. The subscriber may enter, edit and\/or delete profile data using an installed IM client application on the client system  to interact with the subscriber profile server .","Because the subscriber's data is stored in the IM host complex , the subscriber does not have to reenter or update such information in the event that the subscriber accesses the IM host complex  using new or a different client system . Accordingly, when a subscriber accesses the IM host complex , the IM server  can instruct the subscriber profile server  to retrieve the subscriber's profile data from the database  and to provide, for example, the subscriber's buddy list to the IM server  and the subscriber's alert preferences to the alert multiplexor . The subscriber profile server  also may communicate with other servers in the OSP host complex  to share subscriber profile data with other services. Alternatively, user profile data may be saved locally on the client device .","Referring to , a communications system  is capable of delivering and exchanging information between a client system  and a host system  through a communication link .

For example, in one implementation, the host controller  includes one or more software applications loaded on one or more elements of the host device . In other implementations, at the host controller  may include any of several other programs, machines, and devices operating independently or collectively to control the host device .","The host system  includes a login server  capable of enabling communications with and authorizing access by client systems  to various elements of the host system .","The host system  may have elements that are located in geographically remote locations, such as, for example, in more than one country. In one implementation, the host system  includes an OSP host complex  that includes hardware dispersed throughout multiple geographically remote locations, e.g., different countries. The OSP host complex  supports services including, but not limited to, e-mail, discussion groups, chat, news services, and Internet access. The OSP host complex  is designed with an architecture that enables the machines within the OSP host complex  to communicate with each other, and typically employs one or more OSP protocols and custom dialing engines to enable access only by subscribers. Some of the OSP protocols may be proprietary.","The OSP host complex  may include redundant OSP server banks , , each of which being capable of supporting the services offered by the OSP host complex . The OSP server banks ,  are located in a main (i.e., central) location. They may be configured redundantly such that they are capable of performing identical functions and storing the same information. For instance, the OSP server banks ,  may store the same subscriber information to provide backup functionality in case one of the OSP server banks ,  fails. The login server  also is located proximate to OSP server banks ,  at the main location, authorizing subscribers to enter the OSP host complex  irrespective of the location of the client system  used by the subscriber.","The OSP host complex  includes a remote Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) tunnel or web tunnel  located in a geographically remote location, e.g., a different country, relative to the OSP server banks ,  and the login server . The IP tunnel  may include one or more interrelated servers capable of operating together to provide one or more services offered by the OSP host complex . The IP tunnel  also may cache content received from sources within the OSP host complex  or the Internet , making frequently requested information readily available to local subscribers served by the IP tunnel . The IP tunnel may be a Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (\u201cL2TP\u201d) tunnel capable of establishing a point-to-point protocol (\u201cPPP\u201d) session with the client system .","The IP tunnel  is located local to the client system  relative to the central location of the OSP host complex . In one implementation, the IP tunnel  is located in the same geographical region (e.g., same country) as the client system . A subscriber located in a country different from the central location of the OSP host complex , therefore, can use the geographically local IP tunnel  to retrieve information from a geographically local server  on the Internet . The IM tunnel  effectively acts as a proxy for the centralized web and IP tunnels, eliminating the need for communications from the client system  and the geographically remote elements within the OSP host complex .","Due to the proprietary nature of the OSP host complex , requests from the client system  to the Internet  generally pass through the OSP host complex . For example, even where the destination server  is geographical local to the client system , the destination server  does not fulfill a request from the client system  directly. Rather, the OSP host complex  performs protocol conversion and\/or encapsulation of requests from subscribers and received data. Accordingly, the OSP host complex  acts as a buffer between its subscribers and the public Internet . In this way, the OSP host complex  can enforce a subscriber's parent controls and ensure appropriate safeguards.","However, by using IP tunnel  to route communications between client system  and a geographically local server , communications between those components can be made quicker and with less Internet traffic. It is noteworthy that communications handled by IP tunnel  may be directed from the client system  or the local server .","Referring to , a client and a host interact according to procedures  and  to transfer electronic data between a client  and a host . In one implementation, delays inherent in the transmission of the electronic data to a remotely located OSP device are at least partially avoided through the use of a proxy. The procedures  and  may be implemented by any type of hardware, software, device, computer, computer system, equipment, component, program, application, code, storage medium, or propagated signal.","Examples of each element of  are broadly described above with respect to . In particular, client  typically has attributes comparable to those described with respect to client devices , , , , , and  and\/or client controllers , , , , , and . The host  typically has attributes comparable to those described above with respect to host devices , , , , , and  and\/or host controllers , , , , , and . The client  and the host  may be directly or indirectly interconnected through a known or described delivery network.","The procedure  of  generally pertains to communications between a client  through a proxy that is identified by the host , and other communications initiated by or directed from the client . Initially, the client  establishes a connection to the host  (step ). In one implementation, the client  requests access from a login server. An access request from the client  may take many forms. For instance, an access request may be the initial communication from the client  to the host  or may be included in a subsequent communication between the client  and the host . An access request also may be a request for access to an OSP host complex, a request for information, or any other communication with the host  after access is gained.","Upon receiving an access request, the login server uses the IP address of the client  to look up relevant information (e.g., parental control settings, user preferences, demographic information) associated with the subscriber. Such relevant information may have been entered previously by the subscriber or determined on the fly by the host . The demographic information may include, but is not limited to, information about the geographic location (e.g., the country) where the subscriber access request originated, the current client software version, and the type of access device being used. Using the relevant information, the host  identifies a suitable IP tunnel (step ). Identification of a suitable IM tunnel may be based, for example, on whether the IP tunnel exists in the same geographic region as the client  and whether the client  is able to use the IP tunnel. Other information that may be used to identify an appropriate IP tunnel may include demographic information about user-preferred routing paths, the location of the server being accessed by the client  through the OSP, and the relative locations of the client  and the destination server.","After the host  identifies an IP tunnel in a geographic region suitable for the subscriber making the request, the host  directs the client  to the identified IP tunnel (step ). The host  also may transmit subscriber information to the IP tunnel to enable the IP tunnel to function as an OSP proxy capable of tailoring the content and user interfaces for the individual subscriber being routed. The client  then transmits subsequent communications to the Internet through the local IP tunnel (step ).","In one implementation, the client  uses a browser application to transmit subsequent requests to the identified local IP tunnel in a standard Internet protocol, such as HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d). However, other protocols also may be used. The local IP tunnel receives the subsequent communications (e.g., requests for Internet data) from the client (step ) and then encapsulates the requests in a tunneling protocol (step ). In a packet-based implementation, the requests may be encapsulated inside a standard Internet tunneling protocol, such as, for example, UDP (\u201cUser Datagram Protocol\u201d).","After encapsulating the requests (step ), the local IP tunnel sends the encapsulated data to the Internet (step ). The encapsulated data are directed to the proper destination server storing the data that satisfies the request. Next, the requested electronic data are retrieved from the destination server and received at the local IP tunnel (step ). The requested electronic data then is transferred from the local IP tunnel (step ), received by the client  (step ), and finally rendered by the client  (step ).","If the host  does not identify a suitable IP tunnel, or if identified IP tunnels are not available, the client  is directed to remote elements of the OSP host complex, and conventional processing ensues.","The procedure  of  generally pertains to communications directed to the client  from a device (e.g., a local server) through the IM tunnel. In one implementation, the IP tunnel effectively acts as a proxy to an OSP that located remotely from a client. As shown in , a server that has received communications from a client  through a proxy (e.g., IP tunnel) (step ) segregates the communication from within the encapsulating tunneling protocol information (step ). The tunneling protocol information includes information identifying the proxy (e.g., an IP address for an IP tunnel functioning as a proxy). Based on this identifying information, a responsive communication generated by the Internet accessible server may be routed to the proxy (step ). Once routed to the proxy, the server-initiated communication may be routed to the client  based on identifying information for the client . Such identifying information may be located at the proxy, gleaned from the tunneling protocol information, and\/or determined from the communication received by the server (step ).","The described implementations identify an appropriate proxy according to relative differences in geographic locations between a client , a host , and a destination server residing on the Internet. However, other criteria, such as, load management information also can be used to identify an appropriate proxy.","Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-7","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 8 and 9","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
