Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-translational modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.","The compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, are particularly suitable for controlling the following plant diseases:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0107"},"i":["Albugo ","A. candida","A. tragopogonis","Alternaria ","Alternaria ","A. brassicola ","A. tenuis","A. solani ","A. alternate","A. solani ","A. alternate","Aphanomyces ","Ascochyta ","A. tritici ","A. hordei ","Bipolaris ","Drechslera ","Cochliobolus ","D. maydis","B. zeicola","B. sorokiniana","B. oryzae ","Blumena ","Erysiphe","graminis ","Botrytis cinerea ","Botryotinia fuckeliana","Bremia lactucae ","Ceratocystis ","Ophiostoma","C. ulmi ","Cercospora ","Cercospora ","C. zeae","maydis","C. beticola","C. sojina ","C. kikuchii","Cladosporium ","C. fulvum","C. herbarum ","Claviceps purpurea ","Cochliobolus ","Helminthosporium ","Bipolaris","C. carbonum","C. sativus","B. sorodniana","C. miyabeanus","H. oryzae","Colletotrichum ","Glomerella","C. gossypii","C. graminiCola","C. coccodes","C. lindemuthianum","C. truncatum ","C. gloeosporiodes","Corticium ","C. sasakii ","Corynespora cassiicola ","Cycloconium ","C. oleaginum ","Cylindrocarpon ","Nectna ","Neonectna ","C. liriodendri","Neonectria liriodendri","Dematophora ","Roselinia","Diaporthe ","D. phaseolorum ","Drechslera ","Helminthosporium","Pyrenophora","D. teres","D. tritici","repentis","Formitipona ","Phellinus","punctata, F. mediterranea, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora ","Phaeo","acremonium chlamydosporum","Phaeoacremonium aleophllum ","Botryosphaeria obtusa; Elsinoe ","E. pyri","E. veneta","E. ampelina","Entyloma oryzae ","Epicoccum ","Erysiphe ","E. betae","E. pisi","E. cichoracearum","E. cruciferarum","Eutypa lata ","Eutypa ","Cytosporina lata","Libertella blepharis","Exseroholum ","Helminthosporium","E. turcicum","Fusarium ","Gibberella","F. graminearum ","F. culmorum ","F. oxysporum ","F. solani ","F. verticilliodes ","Gaeumannomyces graminis ","Gibberella ","G. zeae","G. fujikuroi","Glomerella angulata ","G. gossypii ","Guignardia bewellii ","Gymnosporangium ","G. sabinae ","Helminthosporium ","Drechslera","Cochliobolus","Hemilsia ","H. vastataX ","Isariopsis clavispora ","Cladosporium vitis","Macrophomina phaseolina ","phaseoli","Microdochium ","Fusarium","nivale ","Microsphaera diffusa ","Monilinia ","M. laxa, M. fructicola ","M. fructigena ","Mycosphaerella ","M. graminicola ","Septoia tritici, Septoria blotch","M. figiensis ","Peronospora ","P. brassicae","P. parasitica","P. destructor","P. tabacina","P. manshurica","Phakopsora pachyrhizi ","P. meibomiae ","Phialophora ","P. tracheiphda ","P. tetraspora","P. gregata","Phoma lingam ","P. betae ","Phomopsis ","P. viticola","P. phaseoli","Diaporthe phaseolorum","Physoderma maydis ","Phytophthora ","P. capsici","P. megasperma","P. sojae","P. infestans","P. ramorum","Plasmodiophora brassicae ","Plasmopara ","P. viticola ","P. halstedii ","Podosphaera ","P. leucotricha ","Polymyxa ","P. graminis","P. betae","Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides ","Tapesia yallundae","Pseudoperonospora ","P. cubensis ","P. humili ","Pseudopezicula tracheiphila ","Phialophora","Puccinia ","P. triticina ","P. striiformis ","P. hordei ","P. graminis ","P. recondita ","P. kuehnii ","P. asparagi ","Pyrenophora ","Drechslera","tritici","repentis ","P. teres ","Pyriculana ","P. oryzae","Magnaporthe grisea","P. grisea ","Pythium ","P. ultimum ","P. aphanidermatum","Ramularia ","R. collo","cygni ","Ramularia ","R. beticola ","Rhizoctonia ","R. solani ","R. solani ","R. cerealis ","Rhizoctonia ","Rhizopus stolonifer ","Rhynchosporium secalis ","Sarocladium oryzae ","S. attenuatum ","Sclerotinia ","S. sclerotiorum","S. rolfsii ","S. sclerotiorum","Septoria ","S. glycmes ","S. tritici ","Septoria blotch","Stagonospora","Stagonospora blotch","Uncinula ","Elysiphe","necator ","Odium tuckeri","Setospaeria ","S. turcicum","Helminthosporium turcicum","Sphacelotheca ","S. reiliana","Sphaerotheca fuliginea ","Spongospora subterranea ","Stagonospora ","S. nodorum ","Stagonospora ","Leptosphaeria ","Phaeosphaeria] nodorum","Synchytrium endobioticum ","Taphrina ","T. deformans ","T. pruni ","Thielaviopsis ","T. basicola ","Chalara elegans","Tilletia ","T. tritici ","T. caries","T. controversa ","Typhula incarnata ","Urocystis ","U. occulta ","Uromyces ","U. appendiculatus","U. phaseoli","U. betae","Ustilago ","U. nuda ","U. avaenae","U. maydis","Venturia ","V. inaequalis","Verticillium ","V. dahliae "]},"The compounds I and compositions thereof, respectively, are also suitable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection of stored products or harvest and in the protection of materials.
