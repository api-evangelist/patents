No. 61\/052,188, filed May 10, 2008. The entirety of such patent application is incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Present Invention","The present invention relates generally to the aggregation and publication of sensor node data and control node data, and, in particular, to subscription to content channels and sensor data by channel client, other sensor owners, and service providers who bid for the right to advertise services to content channel clients based on sensor data patterns for which the service providers can provide particular insight.","2. Background","Input devices (sensors, etc.) and output devices (control outputs, etc.) are often networked to enable remote monitoring and management operations, creating a network of sensor\/control nodes.","It is common for access to networked sensor\/control nodes to be carefully limited to only the owner of the sensor\/control devices. For example, a network of sensors and controls for a home automation system might be purchased and installed by a consumer, and then managed privately by the consumer. A commercial entity, such as a manufacturing company, might install a similar network of sensors and controls in order to automate a manufacturing process. After installation, the sensor\/control nodes are managed privately and directly by the company and its employees. In both cases, security safeguards are put in place to make sure that access to the sensor\/control network is limited to authorized users.","In another common model, ownership and management of a sensor\/control network may be partially or completely delegated to a third-party service provider. An example would be a security services firm which installs and maintains a network of cameras, sensors, alarms and so forth in order to protect the premises of their customers. In this case, the sensor\/control network nodes could be owned by either the customer or the security company and management might be similarly split between the customer and the security company which also provides monitoring and management services which are tied to the sensor\/control nodes.","Often, there may be a high degree of specialization required to delegate control of a sensor\/control network to a service provider. Entire industries are created to manage one particular type of sensor\/control network (security, for example) and single-provider management approaches are common. For example, it would be unlikely that a consumer would attempt to engage more than one security company to manage different parts of their property, even though one security service provider could be more adept at one type of security, say outdoors, while another might be better at managing indoor security or vehicle security.","Another challenge is that as sensor and control networks become cheaper and easier to install, the number and types of sensor\/control devices increases to the point where fine-grained monitoring and management of a customers sensor\/control network would be most efficiently accomplished by using multiple service providers, each of which must be given access to different portions of the same sensor network in a controlled and secure fashion. Since each connection between a sensor\/control device and its related service provider may require customer interaction, the overhead of maintaining service provider relationships may quickly overwhelm the customer, leading to higher cost and less efficiency in the management of their sensor\/control network.","Also, as sensor\/control devices become increasingly cheaper and more numerous, device owners may discover that the sensor data and control points on their network have value to other network owners or to service providers. For example, temperature, rainfall, video surveillance, or other environmental monitoring data might have value to an entire geographical community, beyond the value to the individual device owner. Furthermore, it is well known that the value of an aggregated sensor\/control network, shared amongst many owners, can be far higher than the sum of its individual sensor\/control nodes. For example, a network of traffic cameras is far more useful than a single camera. So, it would make sense that sensor\/control network owners will increasingly wish to offer subscription to their sensor\/control network data and controls in a fine-grained, low-overhead, secure and controlled manner.","However, at present, monolithic service provider approaches are not amenable to this activity, as each provider tends to address only one class of sensor and control data (security, auto diagnostics, etc.) and generally limits access to the sensor and control networks to in-house experts. In addition, each service provider typically requires a significant customer commitment before offering service. For example, a customer of a security firm might pay a monthly fee for a set collection of services applied to a set collection of sensors and controls, and might also be required to sign a 12 month, or longer contract before receiving service. Changing the service arrangement requires a change in contract. And the security firm will not be able to manage the rest of the customer's sensor\/control network, such as the lawn maintenance sensors and controls, or the home automation controls (lights, environmental, coffeepot timers, etc.)","In another scenario, an automotive diagnostic and management system might be attached to a network by means of a mobile radio network, linking the vehicle to the manufacturer's monitoring facilities. Again, in this case, any error or diagnostic condition will be available to and serviced by only the manufacturer's chosen representatives, limiting the ability of the vehicle owner to shop for competitive auto service based on the diagnostic sensor data.","Recently, the rise in the popularity of the Internet and its various forms of data publishing have enabled access to sensor data of all kinds, often in real-time. Web Cams are one example. Also, the dissemination of documentation for various sensors and sensor data values is becoming more widely available. For example, the trouble codes reported by most makes of automobiles are now widely available in web page form. Finally, networked interfaces are becoming more common for remote control and management of control outputs. An example would be remote control of a home's lights or environmental systems. However, although this increase in availability of information and control has made it easier for an individual or organization to understand and collect relevant sensor information and, in some cases, to control it, the complexity and volume of this data has only increased and will continue to increase as more sensor and control devices become networked.","Thus, a need exists for a system that makes possible the fine-grained and efficient outsourcing of sensor\/control network device management and control, as well as providing for the efficient publishing of and subscription to sensor\/control network data and control amongst numerous sensor\/control network owners, service providers, and other parties. With such a system in place, users no longer need to perform tedious searches for relevant information, or manage numerous ongoing business relationships with service providers. Instead, the network of service providers collaborates to select and interpret sensor data and manage control endpoints, each hewing to their particular area of expertise, and each competing with others and paying for the right to interact with system users to provide services particular to their immediate needs. The system can be contrasted with the popular web search model, where users search for relevant information and services. In this system, information and services search for the user.","Broadly defined, the present invention according to one aspect is a method of aggregating and publishing sensor node data, including: receiving sensor data from each of a first plurality of sensor nodes; developing a plurality of content channels, each created by one or more channel developers, and aggregating sensor data from a second plurality of sensor nodes, the second plurality of sensor nodes being a subset of the first plurality of sensor nodes; publishing the content channels such that they can be accessed by one or more channel clients over one or more data communications networks; tracking a plurality of content channel stakeholders for each of the content channels; enabling channel clients to configure content channels to trigger on patterns of data, meeting predetermined criteria, from the aggregated sensor data and to generate events descriptive of the data patterns; enabling one or more service providers to configure content channels to trigger on the patterns of data, meeting the predetermined criteria, from the aggregated sensor data, and to associate advertising content with the data patterns; notifying channel clients whenever sensor data patterns that meet the predetermined criteria are detected; attaching, to the notification, the advertising content, from the one or more service providers, that is associated with the sensor data patterns that meet the predetermined criteria; identifying and tracking the viewing of advertising content; identifying and tracking any purchasing or other business-related actions of channel clients based on the display of the advertising content from the one or more service providers; accounting for service provider fees related to the display of the advertising content; accounting for business transactions resulting from the display of the advertising content; and distributing accumulated fees to one or more of the content channel stakeholders.","In a feature of this aspect, receiving sensor data from each of a first plurality of sensor nodes includes receiving sensor data from both physical sensor nodes and virtual sensor nodes, and the method further includes combining data from the virtual sensor nodes with data from the physical sensor nodes into a single content channel.","In another feature of this aspect, the method further includes: integrating one or more control nodes, owned or controlled by one or more owners, into a content channel; and allowing the channel clients to selectively give access to content channel output controls, controlled by the channel clients, to service providers. In a further feature, integrating one or more control nodes includes integrating both physical data output control nodes and virtual data output control nodes.","In another feature of this aspect, the method further includes: extracting data from individual sensor nodes; and recombining the extracted data into a content channel by means of a programmable script or filter. In a further feature, the method further includes developing the programmable script or filter in a computing programming language. In a still further feature, the computing programming language includes at least one of Java, PHP, Perl, Javascript, Visual BASIC, .NET, C, C++, XSLT, and CSS.","In another feature of this aspect, tracking a plurality of content channel stakeholders for each of the content channels includes tracking entities responsible for creating, operating, and publicizing the content channel, including one or more of the channel developers, the owners, manufacturers, and retailers of the sensor nodes aggregated by the content channel, the operators of the content manager, owners of data communications networks, and entities who control the physical or logical locations of sensor and control nodes.","Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.","As a preliminary matter, it will readily be understood by one having ordinary skill in the relevant art (\u201cOrdinary Artisan\u201d) that the present invention has broad utility and application. Furthermore, any embodiment discussed and identified as being \u201cpreferred\u201d is considered to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. Other embodiments also may be discussed for additional illustrative purposes in providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. Moreover, many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein and fall within the scope of the present invention.","Accordingly, while the present invention is described herein in detail in relation to one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative and exemplary of the present invention, and is made merely for the purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. The detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor is it to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention, which scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof. It is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.","Thus, for example, any sequence(s) and\/or temporal order of steps of various processes or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes or methods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise. Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention is to be defined by the appended claims rather than the description set forth herein.","Additionally, it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which the Ordinary Artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual use of such term herein. To the extent that the meaning of a term used herein\u2014as understood by the Ordinary Artisan based on the contextual use of such term\u2014differs in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended that the meaning of the term as understood by the Ordinary Artisan should prevail.","Furthermore, it is important to note that, as used herein, \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d each generally denotes \u201cat least one,\u201d but does not exclude a plurality unless the contextual use dictates otherwise. Thus, reference to \u201ca picnic basket having an apple\u201d describes \u201ca picnic basket having at least one apple\u201d as well as \u201ca picnic basket having apples.\u201d In contrast, reference to \u201ca picnic basket having a single apple\u201d describes \u201ca picnic basket having only one apple.\u201d","When used herein to join a list of items, \u201cor\u201d denotes \u201cat least one of the items,\u201d but does not exclude a plurality of items of the list. Thus, reference to \u201ca picnic basket having cheese or crackers\u201d describes \u201ca picnic basket having cheese without crackers\u201d, \u201ca picnic basket having crackers without cheese\u201d, and \u201ca picnic basket having both cheese and crackers.\u201d Finally, when used herein to join a list of items, \u201cand\u201d denotes \u201call of the items of the list.\u201d Thus, reference to \u201ca picnic basket having cheese and crackers\u201d describes \u201ca picnic basket having cheese, wherein the picnic basket further has crackers,\u201d as well as describes \u201ca picnic basket having crackers, wherein the picnic basket further has cheese.\u201d","Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like components throughout the several views, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are next described. The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","90","30","40","25","60","75","80","10"]},"The channel manager  is the processing and coordination hub of the system. The channel manager  is preferably implemented as one or more data processing servers which connect to external entities via the data communications network . A common example of such a server would be an Internet web server.","The communications network  may comprise any network topology capable of transmitting and receiving data between multiple network endpoints. Examples of preferred communications network include the Internet, 802.11 wireless local area networks, mobile telephony wireless wide area networks, short-hop data networks such as 802.14, and others, and any combination thereof.","The system also includes sensor nodes  which act as system inputs. Any device which can measure an input and transmit the input over the communications network is considered as a sensor node . Some sensor nodes  may embody physical input devices, including, but not limited to:\n\n","Other sensor nodes  may embody \u201cvirtual\u201d or logical input devices, where no physical input is measured, but, instead, an existing data stream is adapted for use as an input. Some forms of data streams that could be used as virtual sensor nodes  include, but are not limited to:\n\n","By way of these examples it can be seen that any data object can be treated as a virtual sensor node . Accordingly, this description generally does not distinguish between sensor nodes  which interface to physical inputs and \u201cvirtual\u201d sensor nodes  which are implemented as data or content bridges.","Sensor data can be of any format and is categorized to allow for the easy interchange of sensor nodes  within content channels . For example, a temperature sensor node might be defined as returning a numeric temperature value using the Fahrenheit temperature scale, and also as having a geospatial location. A physical temperature sensor might be implemented as a transducer input located in a building or at an airport. The temperature value might be the actual air temperature at a specified geospatial location. Another temperature sensor node  might be implemented \u201cvirtually\u201d by retrieving data from a national weather service web site, or content feed. The reported temperature value and geospatial location would be the current values reported by the weather service. It can be seen that data from either sensor  would be interchangeable and that it is a significant feature of this system that physical sensor nodes  are not distinguished from, and can be used interchangeably with \u201cvirtual\u201d sensor nodes .","In a manner similar to sensor nodes , the system also contains control nodes  which act as system outputs. Any networked device which can control an output signal is considered to be capable of use as a control node . For example, a bridge to an X10 home control system might expose all of the outputs in its network as control nodes  Some control nodes  may embody physical output devices, including, but not limited to:\n\n","Other control nodes  may embody \u201cvirtual\u201d or logical output devices, where no physical output is controlled, but, instead, any network data output interface can be adapted for use as a logical output. For example, sending a formatted email to a certain email address could be considered as an output node  which could be included in a content channel  as a signaling output node . Some common logical interfaces that could be used as virtual control nodes  include, but are not limited to:\n\n","By way of these examples it can be seen that any networked data output interface can be treated as a virtual control node . Accordingly, this description generally does not distinguish between control nodes  which interface to physical outputs and \u201cvirtual\u201d control nodes  which control logical data interfaces. It is a significant feature of this system that physical control nodes  are not distinguished from, and can be used interchangeably with \u201cvirtual\u201d control nodes .","Sensor and control nodes , may be owned or controlled by one or more node owners  who allow the nodes to be accessed in return for advertising revenue generated by the node data or other consideration. There may also be nodes , for which no owner is identified.","Referring now to , which extends  with additional details of the channel manager's  internal structure, a node database  is incorporated into the channel manager  and is used to store information about nodes , and their owners , as represented by the dashed lines.","Nodes , may be classified by type, independent of implementation or specific deployment. The node database  is where the specific details of node configuration and deployment are stored. For example, a temperature sensor node  may have several configuration options that might be common to every type of temperature sensor, in particular the temperature scale in use, as well as geospatial location. However, there may be specific attributes for a particular temperature sensor node that can assist in the correct usage of the sensor data. For example, it may be relevant to know if the reported temperature is an air temperature, or water temperature, or the temperature being reported by an industrial process, or the interior of a home appliance, such as a freezer. The node database  stores these and other attributes as defined by the node owner  for each sensor and control node ,.","Also illustrated in  is the content channel  element. Content channels , sometimes generally referred to hereinafter as \u201cchannels\u201d, are the basic information abstraction of the system. Channels  are preferably implemented as computer software or scripts running on the channel manager  server(s) and are accessed via common network communications protocols such as HTTP, or TCP\/IP in the case of the Internet. A channel database  may be utilized to track channel  configurations settings, channel ownership information, and other channel metadata.","Content channels  aggregate event data from one or more sensor nodes , and format it for access by the channel clients . They also associate relevant control nodes  which may be used to respond to events coming in from the sensor nodes  referenced by the content channel . As an example, a lawn care channel  might be created that aggregated inputs from temperature, humidity, rainfall, and calendar sensor nodes . Furthermore, the channel  might also incorporate control nodes  for turning the lawn sprinklers on and off, or reprogramming the sprinkler system.","Channels  locate nodes , by referring to the node database  to access input and control interfaces that may be shared amongst multiple content channels  when it makes sense. For example, a sensor node  might be created that reports national weather service data. This node might then be referenced by any channel  that needs temperature, rainfall, weather alerts, or other weather-related data.","Content channels  also incorporate event generation or notification interfaces and have the ability to generate events based on data received from their aggregated sensor nodes . To extend the lawn care example, the channel  would have the ability to generate a warning or diagnostic event whenever a problem is detected, such as an extended drought, or the detection of low pressure in the sprinkling system water supply.","Although a content channel  might support a browsing or query interface, it might also operate in an autonomous mode where it converts incoming sensor data changes into control outputs with no external intervention. In this role, the content channel acts more as an automated control system, or data filter and may actually be treated in its own right as virtual sensor or control node ,, producing logical sensor node  events and exposing logical output node  interfaces that can be referenced by other content channels . This self-referential property of content channels  allows them to be arranged into arbitrarily complex relationships, while still allowing separation of function and complexity into smaller sub-channels.","Content channels  also incorporate a configuration capability that allows general-purpose channels  to be targeted to the specific needs of a particular application. Returning to the example of a national weather service sensor , such a sensor might be configurable so as to only generate events relevant to a particular geographical location. Or, the capability to enable, disable or filter classes of events might be made available, as in the case where only severe weather alerts are enabled, and all alerts of lower severity are filtered.","There may be many working copies of a content channel , each of which may be configured for a specific combination of channel client , nodes ,, and other configuration settings.","Channel clients  subscribe to, and are the primary users of, the content channels . They may be persons viewing channel  data on a web page, or persons running channel  control panel software on a mobile phone, or another server or automated process that has been programmed to consume channel  input and respond programmatically by manipulating channel  outputs. Channel clients  use channels  by requesting instances of channels  from the channel manager . The clients  then configure the channel instances  to access sensor  and control nodes  that they wish to monitor or control, and by configuring whatever settings a particular type of channel  makes available. In this way content channels  are customizable to the specific deployment needs of channel clients .","Channel clients  derive value from the system by having related sensor and control node , data aggregated, filtered, and presented by channels  in a manner that is relevant to the task they wish to accomplish. This is as opposed to the alternative of having to track down and assemble relevant data inputs and control outputs on their own.","Channel clients  are also consumers of services related to content channel  notifications and events, and may pay for service providers , to address repair or maintenance issues detected by the content channels  to which they subscribe.","Content channels  are created by one or more channel developers , sometimes generally referred to hereinafter as \u201cdevelopers\u201d, who develop the programmable scripts, filters and other computing mechanisms which unify the various sensor node  inputs, and control node  outputs, and advertising content into a content channel .","Channel developers  have an ownership stake in the channels they develop, and are identified and tracked in the channel database . The system takes account of channels  which have been developed or maintained by single or multiple channel developers , and also recognizes channels  that have been developed and maintained by the channel developer  community at large, and are not considered to be owned by any developer  or group of developers .","A content channel  will also incorporate service advertising content and selection filters which are stored in an advertising database . Advertising content and filters are created by service providers  who offer services related in some way to content channels . A service provider  may be an individual, business, or other entity that has goods or services to offer in relation to one or more content channels . The channel manager  provides a networked interface whereby service providers  can add their advertising content to the advertising database .","In addition to pricing and product information, advertising content may contain matching patterns for sensor data, as well as programming scripts which can be applied dynamically to sensor data as it appears in a channel , in real time. Given that advertising content can be specifically tailored to individual sensor node events, it becomes possible for service providers  to optimize their advertising campaigns for the services for which they are most competent, and therefore, can be most efficient in providing.","As an example, consider an \u201cAuto Maintenance\u201d content channel  which monitors and filters sensor nodes  located in a vehicle, perhaps by attaching a wireless network interface to the vehicle's OBD-II diagnostic interface port. The channel client  allocates one \u201cAuto Maintenance\u201d content channel  from the channel manager  for each vehicle that they wish to have monitored. They then configure each automobile's channel , uniquely identifying the networked sensor interface attached to each vehicle's OBD-II port, and configuring the channel  to deliver the types and amounts of diagnostic information that they are interested in. As the vehicles are driven, sensor data is collected and filtered by the content channel , which is configured, in this example, by the channel user  to watch for maintenance events, such as the automobile exceeding a certain mileage, or an error code being reported by the automobile's on-board diagnostics.","When such an event occurs, any content channels  that include the sensor data would pass the new data through an advertisement selection filter from the advertising database . Since the advertising content in the database would be specific to the sensor  event data, the notification of the event to the client  would also contain advertising content relevant to the event, giving the user quick access to the information and to service provider(s)  who are prepared to diagnose, and repair the auto as necessary.","From the perspective of a service provider , the system makes it convenient to specify their preferred areas of expertise, in addition to pricing and product or business information. To extend the automotive maintenance example, a mechanic might create advertising filters specific to a certain brand of automobile for which they have special expertise, say \u201cAudi\u201d. In addition, they might add even more specific advertising filters for model years or vehicle models which they know even more about, or prefer to work on for some other reason. For example, the mechanic might create a more specific advertising filter such as \u201c2000-2004 Audi A6 and A8 models\u201d.","Furthermore, if the mechanic knew that a certain model of vehicle tended to have a particular failure, manifesting as an engine diagnostic code, after a certain age, he or she might create an even more restrictive filter that would watch for those failures. For example, a filter might be set up to look for \u201c2000-2004 Audi A6 and A8 models showing engine diagnostic code EC, Low Catalytic Converter Efficiency\u201d. Having the expertise, and parts inventory, to solve that specific problem would allow the mechanic to advertise their services in conjunction with matching channel  events, possibly at a lower price point than their competitors, or with increased confidence of making a quick, profitable repair, while gaining maximum customer satisfaction.","It can be seen that this matching of advertising content to specific sensor event data patterns leads to more precise and efficient matching of service providers  and channel clients . It also leads to convenience on the part of the channel client  and service provider  as the burden of event detection, identification and interpretation is carried by the system.","Continuing with another example, consider the case of household appliance maintenance and repair. If all of a home's major appliances are networked with low-cost diagnostic sensors, it can easily be seen that individual appliance failures can be routed to a \u201cHome Appliance\u201d content channel . Home appliance service providers  best equipped to handle a particular failure will then add advertising content and filters that matches the repairs they are best qualified to address.","For example, a service provider  who specializes in the repair and maintenance of Maytag freezers might set up an advertising filter and corresponding content for content channel  events corresponding to \u201cMaytag freezers, duty cycle >30% at air temperatures <90 degrees Fahrenheit\u201d. When the content channel  event occurs, the service provider's advertisement to offer maintenance is triggered and added to the content channel , whereupon the channel client  is able to see what the problem is, and has the option of contacting one or more of the advertised service providers  in order to have the problem corrected.","This fine-grained matching of sensor  events to service providers  directly enables \u201cmicro-service\u201d interactions, where a service provider  located anywhere in the world is able to render expertise and advice to address a situation for which they are especially well suited. If a content channel  includes control nodes  then a service provider  may be able to offer remote diagnostic and repair activities, simply by being given access to the control nodes  for the device that is having a problem.","Although the examples given here are informative as to how the system might be implemented and deployed to address specific situations, they are not intended to limit the scope of the applications of this system. It can be readily seen that the described system can be used to map any pattern of sensor data to any combination of service providers and\/or advertising content and that numerous system configurations may be deployed applying to various service provider  business models.","In at least one embodiment, when a channel client  selects an advertisement or otherwise takes action to engage an advertised service provider , the service provider  pays a fee for that service.","Additionally, service providers  may pay promotional fees to have their advertisement delivered more prominently to a channel client  instead of the advertisements of other service providers  who provide the same or a similar service. Unlike the common web advertising model, where service providers  bid for screen space based on user's web search keywords, channel service providers  bid for ad placement based on content channel  node data which they can use to more precisely gauge the relative value of their services to a potential channel client , as well as the cost of providing the service. In this way, it can be expected that service providers  who have advantages in expertise or efficiency in providing a particular service will be able to pay more to advertise to channel clients  who are in need of that service and will also be able to advertise a lower service price, thus increasing the overall efficiency of service delivery from service provider  to channel client .","In order to promote the creation of new content channels  as well as the deployment and creation of shared sensor nodes  and shared control nodes , it is advantageous to pool and distribute advertising revenue amongst all of the stakeholders who contribute to the creation and deployment of a content channel .","Referring now to , which is a flow chart showing an example of how advertising revenue could be distributed amongst stakeholders involved in creating and deploying a content channel , and where like steps in the process flow are numbered.","Starting at step , a content channel  includes advertising data and is presented to a channel client , in step , whereupon one or more service providers  are charged for the display of their service offers and other advertising content in step .","In step  the channel client  has the option to act upon the advertising data. If the channel client  does not act upon the advertisement(s), no additional advertising revenue is realized and the process continues with step .","If, however, the channel client  does act upon an advertisement, advertising revenue is realized from the selected service provider(s)  who provided the advertising content in step .","Continuing with step , advertising revenue from steps  and  is pooled and apportioned by referring to the node database  to determine node ownership, and the content channel , which triggered the transaction, to determine channel developer  involvement.","In step , advertising revenue is apportioned to the channel developers  who created the content channel , if any. Continuing with step , revenue is apportioned to the node owners , if there are any. Finally, the remaining ad revenue is apportioned to the channel manager owner in step  and the process completes with step .","The advertising revenue distribution process, as illustrated in , apportions advertising revenue to channel developers , node owners , and the operator of the channel manager system . This particular implementation is chosen merely to simplify the system illustration and it is to be understood that an actual system of this type may have fewer or more types of stakeholders, with the end goal being the multiplication of system stakeholders and the division of development effort and financial reward amongst all contributors to the system, leading to the rapid and decentralized development of new content channels, service advertisements, sensor and control node networks, and other system services and enhancements.","For example, the roles described here could be combined, as in the case where a single entity markets a product combining sensor and control nodes ,, creates one or more content channels  which access their nodes ,, and, finally provides service based on the content channels . In this case, the single entity occupies the roles of service provider , channel developer , and node owner .","In a like fashion, stakeholder roles could be divided more narrowly than as described in the foregoing examples.
