The provided devices and methods may be particularly effective in noisy environments which contain tonal type noise sources, such as vehicular horns and alarms. With the devices and methods, these vehicular horn sounds may be reduced, and any reference to traffic noise may for example imply this sound disturbance.

Single-channel speech enhancement systems in mobile communication devices may be used to reduce the level of noise from noisy speech signals. A common problem in such speech enhancement systems may be the reduction of traffic noise sources, such as vehicular horn sounds, which contaminate the target speech signal. Vehicular horns may be highly non-stationary and they may have a tonal structure. The spectral characteristics of the horn source may vary with its device of origin. Therefore, this may affect the performance of a noise reduction technique which may utilize a comb filter to notch predefined frequencies. In such highly non-stationary environments, the noise power may be desired to be tracked, even during speech activity. Noise estimation techniques which operate in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain may be used, including newer noise estimation systems such as the Minimum Statistics (MS). These MS-based techniques may estimate the noise spectrum based on the observation that the noisy signal power decays to values characteristic of the contaminating noise during speech pauses. The main challenge faced by these techniques may be tracking the noise power during speech segments. This may result in poor estimates during long speech segments with few pauses. This noise estimate may then be used to filter the measured signal to suppress the noise and enhance the output speech.","MS noise estimation may provide small MS windows and tuning of attenuation parameters may result in more noise reduction. However, MS noise estimation does not provide a good balance between noise reduction and low speech distortion for non-stationary noises. Subspace-based noise estimation may provide low-rank approximations for speech in the presence of tonal noises, but may be computationally expensive and not suitable for real-time applications. Amplitude modulation features may provide detection and classification of speech only, noise only and speech in noise situations may be used to control the noise reduction performed; however, it may be sensitive to training and may require a-priori knowledge of the signals being processed. Energy-based noise detection may provide that detection of noise onsets may be used to trigger significant attenuation of the detected components; however this technique may be not robust to low SNR conditions. Pause detection for noise spectrum estimation by tracking power envelope dynamics may provide that pauses may be detected when the interfering noise is present in either the low frequency or high frequency band; however, it may provide low performance in the presence of broadband noise sources. The approaches described in this paragraph are general methods for speech processing and are not specifically targeted to traffic noise reduction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["200","202"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302"],"br":[{},{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["x[n]=s[n]+d[n],","X","k,m","S","k,m","D","k,m"]},"The TNR system  may first perform Traffic Noise Detection (TND, which may also be referred to as a noise detection circuit) in  to extract underlying signal characteristics which may be used to detect the presence of traffic noise.

Vehicular traffic horns sounds may occur at different frequencies depending on their source of origin. However, it was observed that the power levels of these sounds are either stationary for short time segments (signal dependent) or the power level decays with time. This characteristic may be not the same for speech signals, as the power level fluctuates at a faster rate (for example 4 to 6 syllables per second) than the vehicular horn noises. Therefore, in this branch of the TND system, the minimum and maximum power envelopes of the noisy signal are tracked in  and the magnitude of their difference may be used to classify either the desired speech or the target noise sources. The first iteration of this technique involves the smoothing of the noisy speech spectral components |X(k,m)|, which may be determined in . X(k,m) may denote the Fourier coefficient related to a k-th frequency (wherein k may be an number between f(which may be a design parameter and may represent a cut-off frequency) and N\/2+1) and an m-th point in time (in other words: the m-th time frame).

These may be set to allow minimum time for the convergence of P(k,m) and P(k,m) to avoid misdetections of speech as noise components. There may be instances of short, strong vehicular horn sounds. Therefore, an additional detection stage to determine the Spectral Peak Profile Ratio (SPPR, module  in ; the SPPR may also be referred to as a second indicator) may be provided and may be included in the TND system for such cases as shown in the bottom branch of . Male and female speakers typically may have spectral profiles for speech where their pitch frequency exists below 500 Hz.
