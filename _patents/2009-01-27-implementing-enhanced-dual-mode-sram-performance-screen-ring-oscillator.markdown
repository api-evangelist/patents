This causes the SRAMs to loose tracking to the standard logic PSROs used as performance monitors for manufacturing line tuning.","Prior art circuits exists to determine 6T SRAM read performance and 8T SRAM write-through performance. In a prior art 6T SRAM PSRO, frequency is a function of only read performance and not write performance. In a prior art 8T SRAM PSRO, frequency is only a function of write-through performance.","All prior art arrangements of SRAM PSROs require modifications to the SRAM cell. This is a major flaw of the prior art because this introduces differences between the monitoring circuit and the functional circuits and separate versions of the SRAM cell are required to be maintained.","U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/782,808 filed Jul. 25, 2007 by Chad Allen Adams, Todd Alan Christensen, Travis Reynold Hebig, and Kirk David Peterson, discloses a method and apparatus for implementing an enhanced SRAM read performance sort ring oscillator (PSRO). A pair of parallel reverse polarity connected inverters defines a static latch or cross-coupled memory cell. The SRAM cell includes independent left and right wordlines providing a respective gate input to a pair of access transistors used to access to the memory cell. The SRAM cell includes a voltage supply connection to one side of the static latch. For example, a complement side of the static latch is connected to the voltage supply. A plurality of the SRAM cells is assembled together to form a SRAM base block. A plurality of the SRAM base blocks is connected together to form the SRAM read PSRO.","The above-identified patent application provides an improved effective method and apparatus for implementing an enhanced six-transistor (6T) SRAM read performance sort ring oscillator (PSRO). The frequency of this prior art 6T SRAM PSRO is a function of only read performance and not write performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","106","108","106","108","110","112","110","112","110"]},"An invention is needed to separately monitor read and write-through performance of an 8T SRAM cell using an unmodified SRAM cell.","Principal aspects of the present invention are to provide a method and circuit for implementing an enhanced dual-mode eight-transistor (8T) static random access memory (SRAM) performance screen ring oscillator (PSRO), and a design structure on which the subject circuit resides. Other important aspects of the present invention are to provide such method, circuit and design structure substantially without negative effect and that overcome many of the disadvantages of prior art arrangements.","In brief, a method and circuit for implementing an enhanced dual-mode static random access memory (SRAM) performance screen ring oscillator (PSRO), and a design structure on which the subject circuit resides are provided. The dual-mode SRAM PSRO includes a plurality of SRAM base blocks connected together in a chain. Each of the plurality of SRAM base blocks includes an eight-transistor (8T) SRAM cell, a local evaluation circuit and a logic function coupled to the SRAM cell and the local evaluation circuit. The eight-transistor (8T) static random access memory (SRAM) cell is an unmodified 8T SRAM cell. The dual-mode SRAM PSRO includes a write-through mode of operation, where the output frequency is determined by write-through performance of the 8T SRAM cell; and a read mode of operation, where the output frequency is determined by read performance of the 8T SRAM cell.","In accordance with features of the invention, the dual-mode SRAM PSRO separately monitors read performance and write-through performance of the 8T SRAM cell. The dual-mode SRAM PSRO directly tracks the performance of 8T SRAM macros much closer than standard logic PSROs. In accordance with features of the invention, the dual-mode SRAM PSRO independently measures read performance and write-through performance, mirroring functional mode SRAM operation.","In accordance with features of the invention, an unmodified eight-transistor (8T) static random access memory (SRAM) cell is used to create an 8T SRAM performance screen ring oscillator (PSRO) that effectively and efficiently separately monitors both read and write performance of 8T SRAM macros. The 8T SRAM PSRO of the invention provides accurate representations of functional SRAM performance and has a robust circuit implementation.","In accordance with features of the invention, the 8T SRAM PSRO includes one mode where the output frequency is determined by write-through performance of the cell, and in the other mode the output frequency is determined by read performance of the cell.","The 8T SRAM PSRO of the invention provides a significant improvement over the prior art, which suffers from design problems and poor performance matching. Also none of the prior art arrangements can measure both read performance and write performance in the same circuit.","Having reference now to the drawings, in , there is shown exemplary SRAM base block using an unmodified SRAM cell generally designated by the reference character  in accordance with the preferred embodiment. SRAM base block  is used for implementing a dual-mode static random access memory (SRAM) performance screen ring oscillator (PSRO), as illustrated in .","SRAM base block  includes an unmodified eight-transistor (8T) static random access memory (SRAM) cell . The 8T SRAM cell  includes four transistors defining a pair of parallel reverse polarity connected inverters ,  for storing data, a pair of N-channel field effect transistors (NFETs) ,  respectively connected to a respective side of the static latch and a respective one of a write bit line pair WBLC, WBLT, and receiving a write wordline gate input WWL that is activated to turn on NFETs ,  to perform a write operation, and a pair of series connected NFETs ,  connected to a read bitline RBLT with NFET  receiving a read wordline gate input RWL, and NFET  receiving a gate input connected to a first side or complement side (CMP) of the static latch NFET  is activated by the read wordline gate input RWL to perform a read operation.","SRAM base block  includes a logic function generally designated by the reference character  for applying the read wordline gate input RWL, the write wordline gate input WWL, and the write bit line pair WBLC, WBLT to the SRAM cell . The logic function  includes a NAND gate  receiving a wordline input WLIN and a reset signal RESET_B. An output of NAND gate  at NET is applied to a first input of a NAND gate  and to an inverter .","The logic function  includes a NOR gate  receiving the wordline input WLIN and a read input R_WB. The NORed output provides the write bit line WBLT to NFET . The NORed output is applied to an inverter , which provides the write bit line WBLC to NFET . The read input R_WB is applied to an inverter , which provides an inverted read input R_WB_B applied to a 3-input NAND gate . The reset signal RESET_B and the output of NAND gate  at NET are applied to other inputs the 3-input NAND gate . An output of the 3-input NAND gate  provides a write wordline input WWL applied to a gate input of both NFETs , .","SRAM base block  includes a local evaluation circuit . A portion of the local evaluation circuit  shown in  for the illustrated 1 bit slice of the dual-mode 8T SRAM PSRO circuit , as illustrated in . The local evaluation circuit  includes a P-channel field effect transistor (PFET)  connected between a voltage supply rail VCC and a connection of the read bitline RBLT output of SRAM cell  and a first input of a NAND gate . The output PCH of inverter  applies a gate input to the PFET . A second input of the NAND gate  is connected the voltage supply rail VCC. The NAND gate  provides the output WLOUT of the SRAM BASE BLOCK .","While the SRAM base block  is shown with a single modified SRAM cell , it should be understood that multiple dummy SRAM cells can be connected to the same write bit line pair WBLT, WBLC and read bitline RBLT. Dummy SRAM cells  optionally are added in parallel with the SRAM cell  shown in , to match the bitline capacitance of the dual-mode 8T SRAM PSRO  as illustrated in , to the bitline capacitance of functional SRAM circuits.","Referring now to , there is shown an 8T SRAM dual-mode performance screen ring oscillator (PSRO) generally designated by the reference character  in accordance with the preferred embodiment.","The 8T SRAM PSRO  includes a chain  of a plurality of SRAM base blocks , #-N connected together in a chain as illustrated. The reset signal RESET_B is brought into all SRAM base blocks , #-N in parallel. The read input signal R_WB is brought into all SRAM base blocks , #-N in parallel. The output WLOUT of SRAM base blocks  #-(N\u22121) is connected to the input WLIN in the next SRAM base block  #-N. The output WLOUT of SRAM base block  #N is coupled to the input WLIN in the SRAM base block  # through the illustrated logic gates.","The 8T SRAM PSRO  provides a ring oscillator output signal RINGOUT. As shown, the wordline input WLIN is applied to the first SRAM base block , # and the output WLOUT of the SRAM base block , #N provides a feedback signal applied to an inverter  providing an inverted feedback signal applied to a NAND gate . The inverted feedback signal is combined with a control signal GO by NAND gate . The NAND gate  is used to stop and start the ring operation. The GO signal of the feedback two input NAND gate  stops the ring operation when low and allows the ring to run when high. The output of NAND gate  is applied to an inverter  providing an inverted controlled feedback signal applied to a NAND gate  and coupled to the input WLIN in the SRAM base block  #. Since the operation is a series write and read but parallel reset the output RINGOUT of the 8T SRAM PSRO  is a short pulse. A plurality of inverters , , ,  optionally is included in a ring output path to a second input to NAND gate  to expand the pulse width of the ring oscillator output signal RINGOUT for sending across an associated chip. A final pair of inverters ,  optionally is connected to the output of NAND gate , which provide the ring oscillator output signal RINGOUT.","The reset signal RESET_B is applied in parallel to each of the plurality of the SRAM base blocks  so that the period of the ring oscillator output signal RINGOUT is a function of many series write and read operations but only a single reset time.","The operation of the 8T SRAM base block  illustrated in  and used in 8T SRAM PSRO  may be understood as follows:","Read Performance Mode","1) The RESET_B signal will start high with WLIN low, applied to the gate of NAND gate . Input R_WB is a DC signal, and in read performance mode it is always high. In read performance mode, WBLT, WBLC, and WWL are also DC signals. The reset signal RESET_B is NORed with R_WB to make WBLT node of the SRAM cell  to go low and WBLC node of the SRAM cell  to go high. R_WB_B being low applied to NAND gate  makes WWL always high. This configuration forces node TRU of the SRAM cell  to be low and node CMP of the SRAM cell  to be high in read performance mode.","2) While RESET_B is still high, WLIN goes high causing output NET of NAND gate  to go low and output RWK of NAND gate  and output PCH of inverter  to go high. This causes a \u201c0\u201d to be read from the SRAM cell . The read bitline RBLT goes low and NAND  in the local evaluation circuit  causes output WLOUT to go high.  shows the entire circuit 8T SRAM PSRO  where many base blocks , #-N are connected together, where WLOUT is connected to WLIN of the next base block and this operation now repeats.","3) The RESET_B signal is significant after this reading of the 8T SRAM cell has propagated through all of the base blocks . The feedback is inverted to reset all the 8T SRAM cells in parallel. During this reset, RESET_B goes low causing NET to go high and RWL and PCH to go low. This causes PFET  to pull read bitline RBLT high and WLOUT to go low. The waveforms are shown in , , A, B, and .","Write-Through Performance Mode","1) The RESET_B signal will start high with WLIN low, applied to the gate of NAND gate . Input R_WB applied to NOR gate  and NAND gate  is a DC signal, and in write-through performance mode Input R_WB is always low, which the output R_WB_B of inverter  always high. In write performance mode, output RWL of NAND gate  is also a DC signal and output RWL is always high. The reset signal RESET_B is NORed with R_WB to make WBLT node of the SRAM cell  low and WBLC node of the SRAM cell  high. Input WLIN is low so output NET of NAND gate  is high. All \u201c1's\u201d at the input of NAND gate  make gate input WWL of NFETs ,  low.","2) While input RESET_B is still high, input WLIN goes high causing output NET of NAND gate  to go low and PCH to go high. The output NET of NAND gate  going low causes output WWL of NAND gate  to go high. This causes a zero to be written to the SRAM cell  from node WBLT to node TRU. Then, node CMP goes high and the read bitline RBLT goes low and in the local evaluation circuit , the NAND gate  provides output WLOUT high. Again refer to , the entire circuit 8T SRAM PSRO  is shown with many base blocks , #-N connected together. Output WLOUT of NAND gate  is connected to WLIN in the next base block where this operation now repeats.","3) The signal RESET_B is significant after this write-through of the 8T SRAM cell  has propagated through all of the base blocks , #-N. The feedback is inverted to reset all the 8T SRAM cells in parallel. During this reset, the signal RESET_B goes low causing SRAM cell node WBLT to go high, SRAM cell node WBLC to go low, and SRAM cell node WWL to go high. This writes the opposite state back to the SRAM cell . Also, output NET of NAND gate  goes high causing node PCH to go low and PFET  pulls read bitline RBLT high and NAND gate  in the local evaluation circuit  causes WLOUT to go low. The waveforms are shown in , , A, B, and .","Referring also to , , A.
