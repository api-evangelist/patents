{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The presently disclosed embodiments deal generally with the field of document management, and more specifically with downloading multiple files or folders as a zip file.","Microsoft SharePoint is a central web application platform associated with document management and web content management systems for various enterprise requirements. Microsoft SharePoint was first released in year 2001, and the latest version was released in 2010 as SharePoint 2010. People can manage files and set up their web sites for sharing with others using the SharePoint. Typically, a SharePoint Site is a collection of pages, lists, and libraries configured to achieve an objective. Sites have the ability to be configured or customized in a number of ways. SharePoint provides a central location to put content such as files or folders. The content can be accessed and modified within a web browser or using a client application on a desktop or smartphone. The content is stored in libraries and lists in the SharePoint 2010 environment. The libraries include a number of files or folders which users can browse and download depending on the access permissions. Different types of libraries exist in the SharePoint 2010 such as picture library, documents library, forms library, report library, etc.","SharePoint 2010 allows users to download only a single file at a time and does not allow the user to download multiple files simultaneously. Therefore, downloading multiple files in the SharePoint 2010 is a time consuming process.","The present disclosure describes a system to facilitate a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment and primarily in SharePoint 2010. The system includes a detection module configured to detect a selection of at least one item from a document library by a user. The item can be one or more file or folder which in turn can include one or more files or sub-folders. The system also includes a download button configured to be activated on selection of the at least one item. The system further includes a packaging module configured to package the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user. Furthermore, the system includes a downloading module configured to download the zip file.","Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer implemented method to allow a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment. The method includes detecting a selection, by a user, of at least one item from a document library. The at least one item can be one or more files or folders including one or more files or sub-folders. The method also includes activating a download button on selection of the at least one item. The method further includes packaging the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user. Finally, the method includes downloading the zip file.","Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a computer program product embodied on a computer readable medium having instructions to perform business center operations. The computer program product performs the steps of detecting a selection of at least one item from a document library by a user, wherein the at least one item is at least one of a file or folder including a sub-folder; activating a download button on selection of the at least one item: packaging the at least one item as a zip file based on the selection of the download button by the user, and downloading the zip file.","The following detailed description is made with reference to the figures. Embodiments are described to illustrate the claimed invention, not to limit its scope, which is defined by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize a variety of equivalent variations on the description that follows.","Overview","The present disclosure describes systems and methods that allow a user to download multiple files in a SharePoint environment. The system detects a selection of at least one item from a document library. The item can be a file or a folder. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the files or groups of files, e.g., folders are limited to document files and do not include other content such as picture files or links. The system has a download button that gets activated when the user has selected at least one item. A packaging module of the system packages the selected item(s) as a zip file when the user selects the download button. The packaging module also creates folders in the zip file corresponding to the selected folders. Thereafter, a downloading module downloads the zip file.","The disclosed system and method allows a user to select multiple files in a Microsoft SharePoint environment and download them as a single zip file. The disclosed system and method also allows the user to select the whole document set, e.g., in the form of a folder, along with its files as a zip file.","It should be noted that the description below does not set out specific details of manufacture or design of the various components.
