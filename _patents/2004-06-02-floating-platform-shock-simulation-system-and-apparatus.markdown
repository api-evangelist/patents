Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to hydrostatic shock simulation systems and more particularly to apparatus for simulating the shock effects on barge-mounted equipment of an underwater weapon detonation.","2. Description of the Related Art","Perhaps the most demanding requirement of a naval surface environment is the effects of underwater explosions and concussions. Major underwater explosions transmit impulses through nearly incompressible water, causing substantial shock impulses of up to 50 g or more to the vessel. The shipboard equipment on Navy vessels must be designed to withstand the significant shock effects of underwater weapon detonations during wartime. The design of such shipboard equipment requires shock testing to verify design efficacy and the Navy has developed and promulgated the shock test specification MIL-S-901D (17 Mar. 1989) setting forth the requirements for qualifying the design of shipboard equipment. MIL-S-901D also classifies shipboard equipment as a \u201cprinciple unit\u201d that is directly supported by the ship structure, a \u201csubsidiary component\u201d that is a major part of and affects the shock response of a principle unit, or a \u201csubassembly\u201d that is a part of but does not materially affect the shock response of either a principle unit or a subsidiary component. This Military Specification defines a \u201cheavyweight\u201d test category that mandates shock testing \u201con a standard or large floating shock platform\u201d that herein is denominated a \u201ctest barge.\u201d Acceptable testing for heavyweight shocks is quite challenging, usually requiring actual detonation of explosive devices near a floating barge containing the principle unit equipment. Some of the most devastating impulses are created by the aftershock concussions (secondary bubble pulses), which result in a decaying wave of compression and rarefaction that transmits even greater shock energy to the unit under test. In one test scenario, a specific explosive charge is detonated 24 feet below the surface and electronic equipment mounted on the hull of a floating barge is subjected to the impulse. The range of shock varies, but can approach 50 g. According to MIL-S-901D, the lighter test categories may be performed in the laboratory by using various shock machines but, to properly test for the effects of secondary bubble pulses, the heavyweight tests must be performed on a test barge subjected to an actual underwater detonation, which is intrinsically hazardous.","As used herein and in the art, a barge generally denominates a flat-bottom boat for carrying heavy loads in rivers or canals. The flat bottom and general absence of provisions for withstanding large wave-induced stresses distinguishes the barge from other marine vessels such as those intended for operation on the high seas.","The two conventional land-based Navy shock tests are the Lightweight Shock Machine and Medium Weight Shock Machine, adapted for testing no more than 550 lbs and 7,400 lbs of mounted equipment, respectively, according to MIL-S-109D. These two hammer tests do not properly stress equipment that is resiliently mounted because they provide neither a sufficient platform displacement nor a proper frequency response in the lower end of the shock response spectrum (SRS). Adding a spring-deck apparatus to the Medium Weight Shock Machine can adjust the SRS but does not achieve sufficient platform displacement. A high platform displacement at low frequencies with resonant characteristics similar to a ship deck is necessary to properly stress equipment protected with shock isolators because only this condition can properly bottom-out the shock isolators. When the isolators are bottomed-out, the equipment can be subjected to a more severe shock than seen without isolation (i.e., \u201chard-mounted\u201d). The heavyweight shock test on a barge subjected to underwater explosive detonation was until now the only test known to properly stress principle unit equipment resiliently mounted on ship decks. Such a barge test is considerably more expensive and hazardous and requires more lead time than a land-based laboratory test. The heavyweight barge test ensures that the principle unit and other items are subjected to a shock wave representing a realistic simulation of actual operational conditions aboard a Navy warship. Until now, such a shock wave could not be realistically simulated in the land-based laboratory.","Several practitioners in the art have proposed improved shock simulation systems for laboratory testing and qualification of electronic equipment. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,495 B1, Hansen discloses a test machine for simulating shock-wave induced motion adapted to be carried on marine vessels during sea travel. The equipment under test is mounted on the table of a test machine through which shock-wave induced motion to be experienced by such equipment during the sea travel is simulated and applied to the equipment carrying table by means of coil springs. Such simulated motion is initiated from a position of the table to which it is displaced and from which it is selectively released through a latch device. However, Hansen neither considers nor suggests solutions to the MIL-S-901D heavyweight secondary bubble pulse simulation problem. In a recent publication, Brooks et al. [Rick Brooks and Jack Berenholz, \u201cPart 1 Case Study: Testing High-Powered Signal Processing Systems for Harsh Environments,\u201d , October 2002, pp. 40\u201345] proposes using a finite-element analysis to mathematically analyze the system, the results of which are then validated with actual or simulated barge tests requiring much lower shock levels that can be performed in the laboratory. Only after testing and validating the equipment design using this approach do Brooks et al. complete the equipment fabrication and subject the final equipment to the actual MIL-S-901D testing. Brooks et al. are primarily concerned with validating the equipment design before final shock testing to avoid the time and expense of a complete redesign cycle in response to a shock test failure and neither suggest nor consider any solution to the MIL-S-901D heavyweight secondary bubble pulse simulation problem.","A traditional underwater detonation induces a complex dynamic ship response that results from several different loading mechanisms. The prominent loading events are the initial shockwave and one or more ensuing bubble pulses. Secondary loadings include bulk and local cavitation closure, reflected pulses from nearby boundaries, and flow effects. The significance of these various loading mechanisms vary greatly depending on the attack geometry.","There is a clearly-felt need in the art for testing methods that employ non-explosive energy sources that provide a useful alternative to conventional barge shock testing methods. A desirable solution is a low-cost and environmentally-friendly non-explosive testing method capable of replicating the dynamic response induced by the complex loading mechanisms presented by a variety of underwater explosive attack scenarios. These unresolved problems and deficiencies are clearly felt in the art and are solved by this invention in the manner described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 36"],"b":["20","22","24","22","24","26","22","28","30","28","30","30","32","34","36","30","34","20"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["22","24","38","26","22","40","22","40","42","26","20","22","40","26","22","40","44","22","38","24","46","40","22","26","48","40","38","50","50","52","54","34","40","36","34","32"]},"In operation, system  is set in motion by first deforming (e.g., compressing) in-series springs  and  with hydraulic cylinder , which serves as part of a \u201ccocking apparatus\u201d and which may include, for example, a plurality of such individual cylinders and their associated hydraulic power supplies (not shown). This process is slow but eventually accumulates a tremendous amount of potential energy in system  in the form of spring deformation, which is well-known in the art to be equal to U=kx\/2 in a spring having a linear spring constant k that is deformed by distance x from it's rest state (e.g., an initial separation distance  is the rest state value of x for spring  in ). The cocking apparatus may also be embodied as a group of screw drives with associated power supplies, or any other useful means for accumulating and storing energy Uin system  by deforming springs  and . The stored energy is then available for quick release to generate the desired shock pulse for coupling to equipment  under test. Hydraulic cylinder , connecting rod , pins A\u2013B and end attachment hardware  together form a \u2018load-train\u2019 through which, for example, a tensile force is developed to balance the opposing compressive force in springs  and .","System  is cocked to the degree necessary to develop the desired shock motion. The loaded system is then triggered to cause a quick release of the stored energy, which sets system  in motion to create the desired shock pulse. The quick release may be achieved by means of a triggering element that, for example, includes a frangible link somewhere within the load train of the cocking apparatus. For example, in , pin A may be a frangible pin that is replaced after each operation of system . Such a frangible link may be selected to trigger the shock pulse at a desired stress level, representing a predetermined level of stored energy, for example. Alternatively, with proper configuration of hydraulic cylinder , the triggering element may include fast-acting hydraulic valves that can be operated to zero the pressure in cylinder , thereby releasing all tension in the load train of the cocking apparatus so that the motion of mass  is no longer constrained thereby. No frangible link is required with such a triggering element embodiment. Thus, hydraulic cylinder  can perform both the cocking and triggering functions: first actively retracting system  into its cocked state; and then quickly releasing and passively floating with the motion of mass , providing a slight damping effect. The degree of damping may be controlled with the hydraulic system's in-line valving and any available pressurized accumulators.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["56","20","56","58","22","22","56","22","60","58","38","62","40","22","40","42","58","58"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["64","20","64","66","66","66","66","66","22","60","66","22","66","66","66","22","66","66","66","66","66","66","60","26","64"],"sub":["66 ","22 ","66 ","22 ","66 ","66 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 6"],"b":["68","20","32","75","30","75","70","72"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["68","68","20","70","72","74","70","40","76","70","48","72","70","72","34","68","22","40","40","70","40","70","34","68","36","70","40","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"],"b":["78","78","56","80","82","84","80","38","86","80","48","82"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["88","24","88","90","66","64","90","90","90","64"]},"The response of the simple mass-spring oscillator system (e.g., ) to any type of motion can be readily computed as a function of time. The maximum values of the response are of particular interest in the art. These maxima can be stated in terms of several different variables, including the maximum strain in the spring u=D, the maximum spring force, the maximum acceleration of the mass (which is related to the maximum spring force directly when there is no damping), and a quantity designated the pseudo velocity V, having the dimensions of velocity, that gives a measure of the maximum energy absorbed in the spring. Pseudo velocity V is defined in such a way that the energy absorption E in the spring is \u00bdm V. Thus, pseudo velocity V=(2E\/m). The relations among the maximum relative displacement of the spring D, the pseudo velocity V, and the pseudo acceleration A, which is a measure of the force in the spring, are\n\n\u2003\u2003[Eqn. 1]\n\n\u2003\u2003[Eqn. 2]\n","The pseudo velocity V is nearly equal to the maximum relative velocity for systems with moderate or high frequencies but may differ considerably from the maximum relative velocity for very low frequency systems. The pseudo acceleration A is exactly equal to the maximum acceleration for systems with no damping and is not greatly different from the maximum acceleration for systems with moderate amounts of damping, over the whole range of frequencies from very low to very high values.","SRS plots are typically used in the art to show the system response as a function of period or frequency. The SRS are often shown in the form of pseudo velocity versus cyclic frequency on tripartite paper. This useful plot, which indicates at one and the same time the values for D, V, and A, is well-known in the art and is used in . This plot has the virtue that it also indicates more clearly the extreme or limits of the various parameters defining the response. All parameters are plotted on a logarithmic scale. The pseudo velocity is plotted on a vertical scale. Then on diagonal scales along an axis that extends upward from right to left are plotted values of the acceleration, and along an axis that extends upward from left to right the displacement is plotted, in such a way that any one point defines for a given frequency the displacement D, the pseudo velocity V, and the acceleration A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10"],"b":["92","94","96","98"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 12","FIGS. 11\u201312"],"b":["100","102"]},"Clearly, other embodiments and modifications of this invention may occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings.
