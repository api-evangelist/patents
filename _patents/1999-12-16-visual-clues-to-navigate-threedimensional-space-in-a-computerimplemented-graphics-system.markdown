title: Visual clues to navigate three-dimensional space in a computer-implemented graphics system
abstract: A computer-implemented graphics system provides visual clues for navigating a three-dimensional space. The graphics system displays a two-dimensional viewport of the three-dimensional space on a monitor attached to the computer. A cursor is moved through the two-dimensional viewport of the three-dimensional space according to a position of the cursor control device attached to the computer. The graphics system determines a position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two-dimensional viewport, and generates a visual representation of the cursor to indicate the position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two-dimensional viewport. The visual representation of the cursor uses one or more human recognizable metaphors for three-dimensional distance cueing in order to provide an extra dimension of visual feedback to the operator navigating the cursor through the three-dimensional space related to the two dimensional viewport. This may include varying a composition, brightness, or reflectivity of the cursor to indicate the position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two-dimensional viewport.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to computer-implemented graphics systems, and in particular, to a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for providing visual clues for navigating a three-dimensional space in a computer-implemented graphics system","2. Description of the Related Art","Computer-implemented graphics systems have been widely used by designers, illustrators, drafters, and engineers for a number of years. Most such graphics systems use a two-dimensional (2D) graphical user interface (GUI) to display graphical images, such as 2D or three-dimensional (3D) models, schematic diagrams, photorealistic images, etc. When a 3D space is displayed in a 2D GUI, the operator is responsible for perceiving the third dimension, and is often aided by perspective views, rendering, shadows or other visual clues provided by the graphics systems.","A mouse is a typical input device used in graphics systems, wherein an associated cursor or other visual indicator is displayed on the 2D GUI to indicate a corresponding location. The difficulty for the operator is in perceiving the cursor location in a 3D space with only a 2D GUI for reference. Some graphics systems provide a mode of interaction where the system automatically suggests geometrically interesting points near the cursor for consideration in various operations. However, these systems work best in two dimensions where there is little ambiguity regarding the true location of the \u201cinteresting point\u201d displayed.","Consequently, there is a need in the art for improved techniques for providing visual clues to navigate 3D space in graphics systems. Specifically, there is a need in the art for improved techniques for employing recognizable metaphors for interesting points for distance cueing to provide an extra dimension of visual feedback to the operator navigating through a 3D space.","To address the requirements described above, the present invention discloses a method, apparatus, and article of manufacture for providing visual clues for navigating a three-dimensional space in a computer-implemented graphics system. The graphics system displays a two-dimensional viewport of the three-dimensional space on a monitor attached to the computer. A cursor is moved through the two-dimensional viewport of the three-dimensional space according to a position of the cursor control device attached to the computer. The graphics system determines a position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two dimensional viewport, and generates a visual representation of the cursor to indicate the position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two-dimensional viewport. The visual representation of the cursor uses one or more human recognizable metaphors for three-dimensional distance cueing in order to provide an extra dimension of visual feedback to the operator navigating the cursor through the three-dimensional space related to the two-dimensional viewport. This may include varying a composition, brightness, or reflectivity of the cursor to indicate the position of the cursor within the three-dimensional space relative to the two-dimensional viewport.","In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and which is shown, by way of illustration, several embodiments of the present invention. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Overview","The present invention is a computer-implemented graphics system that provides improved visual clues for navigating a three-dimensional world space using a two-dimensional viewport.","Hardware and Software Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","100"]},"The preferred embodiment of the present invention is implemented by a computer-implemented graphics program , wherein the graphics program  is represented by a window displayed on the monitor . Generally, the graphics program  comprises logic and\/or data embodied in or readable from a device, media, or carrier, e.g., one or more fixed and\/or removable data storage devices  connected directly or indirectly to the computer , one or more remote devices coupled to the computer  via a data communications devices, etc.","Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environment illustrated in  is not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative environments may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.","Computer-Implemented Graphics Program",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["108","108","200","202","204","206"]},"The Graphical User Interface  displays information to the operator and provides the functionality for the operator's interaction with the graphics program .","The Image Engine  processes the DWG files  and delivers the resulting graphics to the monitor  for display. In the preferred embodiment, the Image Engine  provides a complete application programming interface (API) that allows other computer programs to interface to the graphics program  as needed.","The Database  is comprised of two separate types of databases: (1) a 3D database  known as the \u201c3D world space\u201d that stores 3D information; and (2) one or more 2D databases  known as the \u201c2D viewports\u201d that stores 2D information derived from the 3D information.","Object List",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","208","300","302","304","306","300","208","304","300","208"]},"Operation of the Graphics Program","The graphics program  includes functions for assisting the operator in ascertaining a relative location of a cursor within a 3D world space  using visual clues suitable for a 2D viewport . In the preferred embodiment, these functions employ human recognizable metaphors as visual clues for distance cueing in order to provide an extra dimension of visual feedback to the operator navigating a cursor through the 3D world space  using the 2D viewport .","Specifically, the functions include:\n\n","All of these visual clues can be combined with specific mouse  motions or other cursor control sequences to provide navigable points of interest that are readily perceived by the operator. The present invention thus simplifies the process of the operator learning how to navigate the 3D world space  that is displayed in the 2D viewports . As a result, the present invention enhances the utility of the computer-implemented 3D modeling by allowing a wider audience to master heretofore complex techniques for navigating in 3D world space .","In the preferred embodiment, the present invention displays visual clues to represent the relative position of the cursor when no objects having reference geometries are nearby. Imagine a 2D viewport  into a 3D world space  with no current geometry in the 2D viewport , but an active cursor. Is the cursor near the operator's point of view or far away? In the present invention, the visual clues provide enhanced depth cues for cursor control where no other information is found. Specifically, the visual clues use recognizable metaphors to indicate the depth of the current position of the cursor, especially in the absence of any other geometries, i.e., in empty space.","In contrast, the operator can usually correctly place the cursor in systems that provide a \u201csnap points\u201d on object geometries, by virtue of seeing the cursor \u201cstick\u201d to the snap points. Moreover, a cursor depth cue is probably redundant at an \u201cinteresting point\u201d resulting from an intersection of existing object geometries. Only under certain circumstances, e.g., when multiple \u201cinteresting points\u201d are displayed coincident, would depth cueing be beneficial.","On the other hand, the present invention uses visual clues to indicate cursor position as an extension of object geometries, i.e., at the \u201ccorners\u201d bounded by existing nonintersecting object geometries. Consider, for example, use visual clues when the cursor is behind one object and to the right of another. On the other hand, these functions provide more of an indication of relative location of the cursor rather than an exact coordinate.","Exemplary Viewports",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A","b":["4","4","4","210","202"]},"In the example of , three cursors , ,  are shown in a manner similar to recticles on a gun sight, wherein concentric rings are added or subtracted from the cursors , ,  to indicate distance. As shown, cursor  is the closest, cursor  is a medium distance, and cursor  is the farthest away.","In the example of , three cursors , ,  are shown with projection lines emanating therefrom, in order to provide a perspective view to indicate distance. As shown, cursor  is the closest, cursor  is a medium distance, and cursor  is the farthest away.","In the example of , a single cursor  is shown with projection lines  emanating therefrom and \u201ctag along\u201d characters  (e.g., \u201crailroad ties\u201d) being used to enhance the perspective view provided by the projection lines .","In the example of , three cursors , ,  are shown with luminosity lines emanating therefrom, in order to indicate distance by the brightness of the cursor. As shown, cursor  is the closest, cursor  is a medium distance, and cursor  is the farthest away. Specifically, the cursors , ,  may be dimmed or brightened to provide visual clues as to distance.","In other embodiments, the composition, reflectivity, color, or other graphical aspect of the cursors may be varied to indicate distances or depth.","Logic of the Graphics Program","Flowcharts which illustrate the logic of the graphics program  according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention are shown in .

It should be appreciated that, during this time, other operating system  tasks, e.g., file, memory, and video tasks, etc., may also be carried out. When an event occurs, control passes to block  to identify the event. Based upon the event, as well as the current state of the graphics program  determined in block , a new state is determined in block . In block , the logic transitions to the new state and performs any actions required for the transition. In block , the current state is set to the previously determined new state, and control returns to block  to wait for more input events.","The specific operations that are performed by block  when transitioning between states will vary depending upon the current state and the event. The various operations required to implement and maintain the preferred embodiment of the present invention represent particular events handled by the logic. However, it should be appreciated that these operations represent merely a subset of all of the events handled by the computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"The logic begins at block  when the cursor is moved by the operator by means of the cursor control device  through the 2D viewport  of the 3D world space .","Block  represents the graphics program  determining the position of the cursor within the 3D world space  relative to the 2D viewport .","Block  represents the graphics program  processing the visual representation of the cursor to indicate the position of the cursor within the 3D world space  relative to the 2D viewport .

The following describes some alternative embodiments for accomplishing the present invention.","For example, any type of computer, such as a mainframe, minicomputer, work station or personal computer, could be used with the present invention.
