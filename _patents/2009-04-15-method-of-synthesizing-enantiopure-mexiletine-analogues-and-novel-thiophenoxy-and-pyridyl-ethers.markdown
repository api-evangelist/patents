title: Method of synthesizing enantiopure mexiletine analogues and novel β-thiophenoxy and pyridyl ethers
abstract: A practical and efficient procedure for the enantioselective synthesis of mexiletine analogues using 10% of a novel spiroborate ester as chirality transfer agent is presented. A variety of mexiletine analogues were prepared with excellent enantioselectivities (91-97% ee) in good yield from readily available starting materials. The developed methodology was also successfully applied for the synthesis of novel β-amino ethers containing thiophenyl and pyridyl fragments.

No. 11\/512,599, filed on Aug. 30, 2006, still pending. The entirety of this application is incorporated herein by reference.","The claimed invention was made with U.S. Government support under grant numbers MBRS GM 08216 and NIH-INBRE NC P20 RR-016470 awarded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). The government has certain rights in this invention.","Mexiletine () is an effective sodium channel blocker used as an antiarrhythmic and analgesic oral drug. Structure-activity studies in vivo and in vitro of pharmacologically active mexiletine indicate that its (\u2212)-(R) enantiomer binds preferentially to the cardiac sodium channels. In addition, (\u2212)-(R)-mexiletine is also more active than (+)-(S)-mexiletine on native skeletal muscular fibers. The use of mexiletine as a racemate in the treatment of neuromuscular disorders is limited due to its possible side effects. As shown in , the optically active mexiletine analogue (R)-2 is 27-fold more potent than (R)-mexiletine in producing a tonic block and 23-fold more potent in condition of high frequency of stimulation (phasic block). Recently, racemate (3) shown in was established as a novel potent blocker of voltage-gated K channels using structure-based virtual screening in conjunction with electrophysiological assays in rat hippocampal neurons.","The preparation of mexiletine enantiomers has been reported previously by several groups. Generally, the methods involved resolution of racemic intermediates, enzymatic hydrolysis of an N-acyl derivative, or using a stereospecific, four-step procedure, in 7.2% overall yield. Flippin, et al. reported a convenient procedure for the preparation of stereoisomers of mexiletine, but the scope of products was limited by the availability of chiral substrates and expensive chromium tricarbonyl complexes of aryl halides: hence, some amines were provided in the racemate form. Although Franchini et al. synthesized the stereoisomers of mexiletine analogues, the use of 2-phenyl-oxirane as chiral source restricted the range of mexiletine analogues. Furthermore, the procedure is also controlled by the regio-specificity of the ring-opening reaction, and the possible racemization of the benzylic carbon by the substitution of the alkoxy group by the amine. Hence, a practical and efficient route for the synthesis of highly enantiopure mexiletine analogues is highly desirable.","According to one aspect of the invention, a practical and efficient procedure for the enantioselective synthesis of mexiletine analogues using a novel spiroborate ester as chirality transfer agent is presented. Moreover, 10% of the spiroborate is used for the synthesis.","In another aspect of the invention, a variety of mexiletine analogues were prepared in good yield with excellent enantioselectivities (91%-97% ee) from readily available starting materials.","According to a further aspect of the invention, the developed methodology was applied for the synthesis of novel \u03b2-amino ethers containing thiophenyl and pyridyl fragments.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method of synthesizing enantiopure mexiletine analogues and novel \u03b2-thiophenoxy and pyridyl ethers is performed by reducing an O-benzyl oxime in the presence of a novel catalyst agent.","According to one aspect of the invention, the catalyst agent is able to reduce said oxime to obtain an enantioselectivity of at least 91%.","According to another aspect of the invention, the catalyst agent is able to reduce said oxime to obtain an enantioselectivity of from about 91% to about 97%.","Throughout the figures, the same reference numbers and characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like elements, components, portions or features of the illustrated embodiments. The subject invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying figures, in view of the illustrative embodiments.","The inventors of the present invention have been successful in the borane-mediated asymmetric reduction of O-benzyl oximes using a truly catalytic amount of air and moisture stable spiroborate esters as shown in  and disclosed in the above-referenced related application incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Thus, the present invention discloses its application for the enantioselective synthesis of \u03b2-amino ethers of biological interest.","The synthesis of Mexiletine analogue 12a, as outlined in , was selected as a model protocol. The aryloxy acetophenone 9a was prepared from the 2-chloro- or 2-bromoacetophenone using different bases (NaOH, NaH and KCO). After optimization, it was found that treatment of 2-bromoacetophenone with KCO(1.5 equiv) and 2,6-dimethylphenol (1.5 equiv) in DMF at room temperature for 24 h gave the desired ketone in 81% yield. The oxime was then prepared by addition of NHOH.HCl and pyridine at 0\u00b0 C. The mixture of (Z)- and (E)-isomers was easily separated by simple recrystallization. The main (Z)-benzyl oxime ether 11a was obtained in high yield from pure (Z)-oxime using NaH and benzyl bromide in DMF at \u221230\u00b0 C.","Initially, the spiroborates shown in  were screened for the reduction of the O-benzyl oxime 11a. The reactivity of catalysts 5, 7 and 8 was rather low at 0\u00b0 C. The complete conversion was achieved at room temperature (22\u00b0 C.) affording 57%, 81% and 82% ee, respectively. Spiroborate ester 6 provided the best enantioselectivities.

In the case of pyridylethers, 5 mL BH3.THF (1 M in THF) was added. After stirring the mixture for 1 h at room temperature, the clear solution was cooled at 0\u00b0 C. and the benzyl oxime (1 mmol) in 5 ml of dioxane was added drop-wise during 1 h using a syringe pump. The resulting mixture was stirred at 0\u00b0 C. until the conversion was complete in about 48 h. Then, the reaction was quenched with 6N HCl and then 6N NaOH until the solution was basic. It was extracted with ether and the combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSOand concentrated under reduced pressure.
