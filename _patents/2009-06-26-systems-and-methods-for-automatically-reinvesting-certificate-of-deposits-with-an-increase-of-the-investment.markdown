{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["For many average consumers, putting money in Certificates of Deposit (CD) is difficult and stressful. The consumer puts the money away and has no access to the entirety of that deposit until the CD matures. Thus, many people do not want to invest in CDs because they are afraid they will not be able to access their money when they need it. Many consumers would still like to have the security and interest rate of a CD, but would also like to have at least access to some of the money invested before the maturity date without giving up all the benefits of the CD. Currently, there exists no such processes or system for facilitating offering a single investment vehicle fulfilling these needs.","In this regard, there is a need for systems and methods that overcome the shortcomings described above and others.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

Thus, although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers, such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs, televisions, MP3 players, etc., software objects such as interfaces, COM objects and the like.","There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures, whether coupled to the Internet or not, may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.","A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client\/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The \u201cclient\u201d is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to \u201cknow\u201d any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client\/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the example of , any entity , , , , , ,  and  can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances.","A server is typically, though not necessarily, a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.","Client(s) and server(s) communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer(s). For example, HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web (WWW), or \u201cthe Web.\u201d Typically, a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator (URL) can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium, e.g., client(s) and server(s) may be coupled to one another via TCP\/IP connection(s) for high-capacity communication.","In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in  and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of , the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead, the embodiments should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","Referring next to  shown is a timeline chart illustrating an example operation of a process for automatic certificate of deposit investing over time. The process for automatic certificate of deposit investing over time described herein utilizes an automated certificate of deposit (CD) investing device that operates on a wheel concept. Thus, this device is referred to herein as a \u201cCD wheel\u201d. For example an investor would invest an amount of funds into this device, which would then distribute equally over time a portion of the total investment into longer term CD's (giving the investor the higher interest rate associated with a longer term CD). After the maturity date of the first CD purchased, every month (or whatever sub-period is set), a portion of the entire investment is available for liquidation as each underlying CD matures. For example, $6,000 invested in a 6 month CD wheel would result in automatically investing $1,000 every month, which would be available for liquidation every month after the first maturity date.","The timeline in , uses a 6-month CD wheel as an example. The underlying automatic investment process will purchase a 6-month CD in the amount of $X every month for 6 months. Each CD purchased every month is considered a \u201cspoke\u201d in the CD wheel and may be referred to as such hereinafter. Therefore, 6 months from the date of purchase of the first spoke, it will mature and the investor will have the option to liquidate (i.e., cash out) the spoke (receiving $X plus interest) or have it automatically extended (i.e., rolled over) into another CD of the same amount and term. Thus, as each spoke matures, this option will be available to the investor and the investor can, among other possible options, choose to liquidate the spoke or have it automatically extended and automatically reinvest the value of the spoke into another CD of the same term. The term, dollar amount, and sub-periods at which each spoke is purchased are variable and may be selected by the investor. Such variables may be automatically adjusted according to selections made by the investor when applying for or purchasing the CD wheel investment (e.g., through an online web interface).","If the investor chooses to liquidate a spoke, then the funds may be automatically transferred to an account of the investors choosing. Another option that may be available is that the investor may choose to reinvest only the principal balance of the spoke and withdraw the earned interest only. There also may be restrictions put on the initial investment (6*$X in the example provided in ). Such restrictions may include restricting the availability to withdraw the initial investment before the maturity date of the first spoke or imposing penalties for withdrawing the initial investment before the maturity date of the first spoke. Also, if the investor withdraws over a certain amount of the initial investment, the spokes of the CD wheel already purchased may be converted into traditional CDs and the CD wheel dissolved. Such restrictions or penalties, however, may result in a lower interest rate available to the investor for purchasing the CD wheel.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for automatic certificate of deposit investing. For example, first, a maturity date is reached  for a $X spoke of a CD wheel. It is then determined  whether the investor selects to increase the investment by $Y. The investor may select such options and variable increased investment amounts, for example, to be effectuated automatically based on selections made online when managing their account. If the investor selected to increase the investment by $Y, then the dollar amount invested for that particular spoke is automatically increased  by $Y. When the spoke matures on the next cycle, $X+$Y plus interest will be made available  for withdrawal to the investor. If the investor has not selected to increase the investment, then it is determined  whether the investor has selected to liquidate the spoke. If the investor has selected to liquidate the spoke, then the balance of the particular spoke ($X plus interest) may be automatically transferred  to a chosen account of the investor and the particular spoke is removed from the CD wheel. If the has not selected to liquidate the spoke, then the spoke is extended  (i.e., rolled over) into another CD of the same term as the spoke. The process above then repeats for the next spoke existing in the wheel as it matures.","Referring next to , shown is a timeline chart illustrating an example operation of a process for automatic certificate of deposit investing over time when an investor chooses to liquidate portions of the investment (i.e., liquidate a spoke of the CD wheel). In the example provided, the investor has chosen to liquidate spokes  and  when they matured, thus, on the next cycle those spokes will not exist and thus no funds will be available for liquidation or withdrawal on what would have been the maturity dates of those spokes had the investor chosen not to liquidate them previously. In one embodiment, if the investor chooses to liquidate too many spokes (e.g., over a predetermined number of spokes or liquidates over a particular amount of the investment), then the CD wheel may be automatically converted back into traditional CDs and dissolved.","Referring next to , shown is a flow chart illustrating an example process for automatically converting from automatic certificate of deposit investing into traditional certificate of deposit investing (e.g., when the investor chooses to liquidate too much of the CD wheel). When a maturity date is reached  for a spoke of the CD wheel, it is automatically determined  whether the investor previously withdrawn funds from CD wheel. If the investor has not previously withdrawn funds from CD wheel, then the interest rate and investment cycles for the CD wheel are automatically continued . If the investor has previously withdrawn funds from CD wheel, then it is automatically determined  whether the value of the CD wheel is below a predetermined percentage of initial value of the CD wheel. If the value of the CD wheel is below the predetermined percentage of initial value of the CD wheel, then the CD wheel is converted  into individual traditional CDs and\/or the CD wheel interest rate is lowered (i.e., discontinued). If the value of the CD wheel is not below the predetermined percentage of initial value of the CD wheel, then the interest rate and investment cycles for the CD wheel are automatically continued . The process above may then repeat for the next spoke existing in the wheel as it matures.","Referring next to , shown is a diagram of an example user interface facilitating automatic certificate of deposit investing. Shown on the interface is a view of an example CD wheel  as may be seen by the investor when they log into their account at a financial institution. In the example provided, shown are the spokes for a 6 month CD wheel with 6 spokes . Also shown is the total current value  of the CD wheel . This interface automatically updates with the values of each spoke and total CD wheel value as the values change and interest is calculated. Note also, that there are action menus  next to each spoke of the CD wheel for the investor to select various options that may be automatically implemented should the investor choose to do them using the interface menus . These options may include, but are not limited to: setting up a particular spoke to liquidate automatically after its maturity date is reached, electing to automatically increase by a certain dollar amount the investment into a particular spoke after its maturity date is reached, choosing to stop the initial purchase of the spoke, choosing to have the interest earned on the spoke automatically withdrawn after the maturity date, etc.","It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purposes of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention. While the invention has been described with reference to various embodiments, it is understood that the words which have been used herein are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitations.
