{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS"],"p":["This invention in general relates to processing data and specifically relates to deduplication and grouping of similar supplier names in a database.","When an organization procures a product or service, typically the entry is made into a table called a spend table. The spend table contains the product or service description, spend amount, date, supplier name etc. For the analysis of spend data, there is a need to identify a particular supplier or find the list of top \u2018n\u2019 suppliers. Since all entries in the table are normally entered manually; often the same supplier may inadvertently be entered in a different manner at different places in the table. Such duplicated entries result in aggregation of redundant data by having multiple accounts of the same supplier. Proportions of duplicative data and the associated problems increase with the increase in the number of entries in the spend table. Manual grouping is labor intensive and time consuming. Furthermore, once the grouping is finished, the table is outdated. When fresh entries are added to the table, they are not grouped during entry. Hence, even after all the effort put into manual grouping, the problems of duplicative data still prevail.","To ensure that duplication of a supplier's name does not occur, it is necessary to check the supplier's name against all the name entries in the spend table. If there are \u2018n\u2019 supplier names, then to ensure non-duplication of the \u2018n\u2019 names it maybe necessary to check each supplier's name with all the remaining supplier names. This checking technique requires considerable time because of the n squared matches.","Hence, there is a need for a computerized system that automatically handles the above stated problems and effectively groups similar supplier names. The system has to address all the inadvertent mistakes that are due to typing or spelling. The system, also, should not group the supplier names which seem to have small differences but are dissimilar in reality, for example KBC TV, NBC TV. The system has to improve the deduplication and achievable grouping performance in addition to reducing time taken for the same.","Disclosed herein is a method that addresses and provides solutions to the above stated problems by implementing an effective deduplication process.","Disclosed herein is a method for grouping similar supplier names in a plurality of supplier names in a database. The syntactical errors in the supplier names are corrected. The supplier names are grouped after correcting the syntactical errors. The abbreviations in the supplier names are captured. The ordering, pronunciation and stemming errors in the supplier names are corrected. A matching algorithm that matches and compares two supplier names is applied that comprises the steps of grouping supplier names based on first set of characters in the supplier names and calculating a matching score between the two supplier names using Levenshtein distance between the two supplier names, along with the supplier names' sound codes obtained from a modified metaphone algorithm, length of each word, position of matching and mismatching characters, and stem of words in the supplier names. The matching scores are compared with set thresholds in order to further group the supplier names into clusters. Many levels of hierarchical grouping are created. The first three levels do not require manual intervention for verification. An additional fourth level is employed that requires manual intervention for verification of accuracy in grouping.","In the present invention the supplier's names are arranged into small sub groups. In deduplication such grouping eliminates unnecessary matches, and thereby, the matching process becomes time-efficient. The time efficiency is achieved by eliminating the problem of n squared matches, previously mentioned.","Another advantage is that the present invention handles all the obvious errors that are due to typing or spelling. Also different suppliers whose names seem to have small differences, for example KBC TV, NBC TV, are not grouped together.","Another advantage of the present invention is that it makes the program extremely efficient by employing a super efficient data structure. While implementing the algorithms, a data structure is selected and implemented, at each step in the algorithms, that is theoretically or optimally the most efficient. Such careful selection of a data structure at each step in the algorithms gives a multifold increase in speed and performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","103","104","105","105","105"],"i":["a ","b "]},"Subgroups are created for suppliers to avoid the problems associated with squared n matching. Moreover, the matching process for determining supplier name matches among each group, involves the checking of consecutive matches and mismatches. This matching process significantly increases the speed of the execution of the deduplication algorithms. For example, the matching score for two abbreviations, two words and two sound codes is calculated by using entirely different equations for each of them.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","203","204","205"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["302","301"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"StopWordList: group, parking, inc, incorp, incorpor, incorporated, incorporation, llc, llp, ltee, liability, plc, international, tech, technology, srv, serv, srvc, service, corp, corporation, corporated, supp, supply, sply, pty, pvt, private, ltd, limited, co, comp, company, enter, enterprise, enterprize, assoc, association, indus, industry, of, the, and, for."}}}},"The second level  comprises the following steps: The first level IDs are assigned to the entries as second level Ids. Sorted sound codes for all the names after first level are determined. Sound Code for a word is the code that is generated by analyzing its pronunciation. A standard metaphone algorithm is modified during adaptation and the modified metaphone algorithm is used for finding sound code for the words. If a name has an abbreviation, then the word (as an abbreviation) is considered for the matching algorithm, otherwise the sound code for that word is determined. Similarly, the sound codes for all words in the supplier name are determined and considered. The sound codes of all the words are arranged in ascending order. The sound codes are then concatenated into a single string. The supplier names with the same sorted sound code are assigned the same second level ID; otherwise the first level ID is assigned as the second level ID for the supplier names.","The third level  comprises the following steps. The supplier names are sorted in alphabetical order and are grouped into subgroups. While creating a group at the third level, an empty group, i.e., a group with no elements is initiated. If at least the first three characters of two consecutive supplier names match, then those supplier names are grouped into the same subgroup. If no more matches are possible for a particular subgroup, that subgroup is processed and formation of another subgroup is initiated. Processing a subgroup implies executing the algorithm \u201cProcessingGroup\u201d.","The fourth level  comprises determining probable match which may require manual verification. In the fourth level, accuracy depends upon data and real life represented by the data. The threshold for matching scores of the third level data may be fixed based on manual verification of the data. For example, for the supplier names that have matching score between 0.5-0.7, the same fourth level ID are assigned. ID assignment based on such thresholds may be useful considering the following kind of examples:","\u201cAmerican Express\u201d, \u201cAmerican Air Lines\u201d and \u201cAmerican Petroleum\u201d in reality represent different entities, although a significant part of the names match. Contrastingly, \u201cMicrosoft SF\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft San Francisco\u201d represent the same entity in spite of the name difference. By keeping a low threshold, \u2018Microsoft SF\u2019 and \u2018Microsoft San Francisco\u2019 will become part of the same group or cluster, which in reality is true. But the low threshold would also lead to grouping of \u201cAmerican Express\u201d, \u201cAmerican Air Lines\u201d and \u201cAmerican Petroleum\u201d. A final decision in such contradictory cases may be taken by the user (human knowledge). This will ensure that the matching algorithm will capture almost all duplicate supplier names.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D"],"b":["306","306","307","307","308","309","310","311","307","313"]},"1.
