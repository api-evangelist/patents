title: Optical strain gage compatible with fiber optic systems
abstract: The structure of the device consists of a light transparent or light absorbing hollow tube having inside diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of an optical fiber that is threaded through the tube. The space between the fiber and the tube is filled with a low vapor pressure fluid selected for refractive index that will promote light leaking out of the fiber through the tube.

The gage factors for typical resistance strain gages are in the range of 5\u201310. The optical strain gage technique that has shown the most sensitivity is also highly sensitive to thermal expansion, which can be confused with strain sensitivity unless suitable reference\/compensation channels are provided. The hollow tube strain gages described here do not require temperature correction since the length change as the tube is strained length is insignificant.","Optical strain gages, and in particular an optical strain gage useful as a pressure transducer, are known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,664, Optical Pressure Transducer, issued on Apr. 7, 1992, to Hockaday, et al shows a micromachine silicon pressure transducer which employs a single vibrating bridge and pressure responsive diaphragm formed from a single silicone wafer. The initial wafer is micromachined by a combination of etching and laser techniques so as to result in a single strand of silicon supported at each end by blocks or other supports also cut from the initial silicon wafer. Other pertinent patented examples are disclosed in the following U.S. patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference:","U.S. Pat.

No. 4,815,855, Mar. 28, 1989, Interferometric load sensor and strain gage, Dixon, William P.","The present invention includes a new design for an optical strain gage that is usable with fiber optic systems.","The structure of the device consists of a light transparent or light absorbing hollow tube having inside diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of an optical fiber that is threaded through the tube. The space between the fiber and the tube is filled with a low vapor pressure fluid selected for refractive index that will promote light leaking out of the fiber through the tube. For example, the index that will maximize the transfer of light out of the fiber will be the square root of the product of the fiber clad index and the tube index. As the fiber is bent during straining, the amount of light lost increases as the bending radius increases. Thus the attenuation of the light that travels along the fiber can be used as a direct measure of the strain. The fluid can be chosen, with respect to index of refraction, so to tailor the \u2018gage factor\u2019 (the slope of the intensity versus strain curve) to specific strain ranges. This device can be installed on data carrying fibers as well as on fibers dedicated specifically to strain monitoring.","The present invention includes a new design for an optical strain gage for use with a fiber optic system.

The polyimide coating is present primarily to provide mechanical fracture resistance to the hollow micro-tube, a common structure in chromatography columns. End seals may or may not be required depending on the fluid, the required longevity of the gage and the application. The fluid can be a high viscosity liquid, such as an oil, a semi-solid such as a gel, or even gaseous (air). The appropriate fluid will be chosen based on the require index of refraction for the range of strain to be covered and for the operating conditions for the particular application. One end of the fiber is connected to a suitable narrow band light source, such as a laser, and the other is focused onto a suitable detector such as a solid state diode detector used in most optical fiber communications terminals. The gage is rigidly affixed to the element to be monitored via suitable adhesive or clamping mechanism. Any bending strains will be indicated in the attenuation of the light intensity passing through the fiber.","If the strain gage described herein is compared to the traditional resistance gage or the state of the art optical Bragg grating gage certain advantages can be identified. Resistance gages are cheap but with small gage factors and limited strain range per gage. They generally require temperature compensation as well. Bragg grating strain gages are very high in sensitive, but relatively expensive and strongly temperature dependent. The hollow tube gages described here are cheap, temperature independent and have gage factors in the 100 to 500 range with the possibility of adjusting the gage factor for the design application range.","In another embodiment, a second fiber could be laid along the gage containing fiber. One end of this second fiber could be bonded directly to the outer wall of the hollow tube and the other end brought directly to a detector. With this scheme, the detector would be monitoring a light level that increases (rather than decreases) as the strain deforms the gage to smaller radius of curvature. This configuration might have use in applications where space is limited and\/or increased sensitivity is required.","The system of  has been built and tested. The test was as follows: Components used in the test; 1) FIBER\u2014ESKA acrylic purchased from Edmund Industrial Optics catalogue number H02-532.Core OD=486 microns, index 1.492. Clad OD=500 microns, index 1.402. 2) TUBE\u201410 cm long section of polyimide coated silica glass from Inniva Quartz, Inc. catalogue #1246556, ID=530 microns. 3) Laser Uniphase model #1101P HeNe (polarized output). 4) Fleet pharmaceutical grade mineral oil purchased at local drug store, index unknown. The tube was filled with oil using a hypodermic syringe and needle. The fiber was then strung through the tube, cleaned of excess oil and the fiber ends were affixed in front of the laser and detector. The tube was placed in a four point bending rig (known from calculations to give uniform strain over the radius of bending between the inner pins. The tube was subjected to bending and unbending and showed reproducible intensity variations with strain. The signal decreased monotonically to 80% of maximum at approximately 10,000 microstrain.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"Commercial airlines could use such devices to reduce the cost of maintenance and the risk of structural failure. Any building, bridge, or public structure could be instrumented with a series of such devices to monitor for structural health after severe loadings that might occur, for example, as the result of an earth quake, wind storm, hurricane or tornado. The devices could be embedded in roadway surfaces to count traffic or monitor loading by heavy vehicles.","While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment it is understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than words of limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 2"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
