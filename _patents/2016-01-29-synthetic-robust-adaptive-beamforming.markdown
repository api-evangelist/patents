title: Synthetic robust adaptive beamforming
abstract: A method for beamforming digitized signals from a sensor array to enhance signals originating from a preselected angle of interest and a preselected range bin while suppressing interference signals from other angles of arrival. Snapshots of sensor data are acquired and used to estimate an autocorrelation function. An autoregressive model of power is determined over angles of arrival as polynomial coefficients and roots are calculated as associated with the interference signals. Roots are selected for suppression by providing nulls. Exponentials are constructed from the roots. The exponentials are used with variances from the autoregressive model to provide a synthetic covariance matrix having weights that suppress the interference signals.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","None.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to performing adaptive beamforming and, more particularly, to performing adaptive beamforming using a synthetic covariance matrix.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","Beamforming or spatial filtering is a signal processing technique used for directional signal transmission or reception. Beamforming increases the gain in a particular direction, and decreases gain in other directions. Beamforming may be used in sensor arrays, for examples, and can be utilized on electromagnetic arrays such as antennas and\/or acoustic arrays. These systems include active or passive radar or sonar. Arrays of sensors include linear, planar and volumetric arrays. Beamforming is also used in communications to limit reception to a particular cell phone tower. Beamforming operates with the understanding that the beam pattern resulting from beamforming has a main lobe, side lobes, and nulls. The main lobe has the greatest gain and is at the look angle. The side lobes are angular regions having lesser gain. Nulls are angular regions having gain theoretically reduced to zero. Beamforming is also range dependent. When the range is unknown, it is known to beamform for groups of ranges known as range bins. Different look angles and ranges can be obtained by using different delays on the outputs of the sensor elements.","Adaptive beamforming adapts to the data received from the sensor array by placing nulls at the angles of arrival of the largest amount of clutter. To accomplish this, adaptive beamformers estimate the data covariance matrix. The data covariance matrix is typically estimated by the sample covariance matrix (SCM). The data covariance matrix is an Ne by Ne positive definite (and therefor nonsingular) matrix, where Ne is the number of elements in the array. For the SCM to be a nonsingular matrix, it must be produced using at least the same number of snapshots, Ns, as number of elements, Ne. A snapshot is a measurement of the signal levels of all the array element outputs at a particular time. The interval between snap shots, called the sampling frequency, is chosen in accordance with sampling theory. It is acknowledged in the art that a good estimate of the SCM requires a minimum of 2*Ne snapshots. Collecting many snapshots in a non-stationary environment is a problem, since the actual covariance changes over time.","Adaptive beamforming to remove interference can require capturing multiple snapshots of the signal to determine where to reduce the interference. This can be problematic in a non-stationary environment. Development of improved techniques of beamforming is desirable for these environments.","One prior art example includes a correlation filter for target suppression, a weight calculation method, a weight calculation device, an adaptive array antenna, and a radar device. A beam forming unit is configured to form a received synthetic beam by performing weight control based on the adaptive weight on the received signal to nullify a gain in a direction other than an arrival direction of the target signal.","Another example generally discusses an apparatus and method for forming a forward link transmission beam of a smart antenna in a mobile communication system. Angle of arrival (AoA) and beamwidth are estimated from the transmission covariance matrix. For a forward link channel to a mobile station can be estimated by synthesizing a covariance matrix considering a difference between transmission and reception frequency bands from the estimated AoA and beamwidth.","However, the above attempts do not disclose, teach, or suggest the presently disclosed method of reducing the snapshots for adaptive beamforming or providing a method that can be used in a non-stationary environment. Thus, there is a need for improved adaptive beamforming.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide for improved adaptive beamforming that requires fewer snapshots of sensor data.","It is another object to provide a method of beamforming that can be used in a non-stationary environment.","Accordingly, there is provided a method for beamforming digitized signals from a sensor array to enhance signals originating from a preselected angle of interest and a preselected range bin while suppressing interference signals from other angles of arrival. Snapshots of sensor data are acquired and used to estimate an autocorrelation function. An autoregressive model of power is determined over angles of arrival as polynomial coefficients and roots are calculated as associated with the interference signals. Roots are selected for suppression by providing nulls. Exponentials are constructed from the roots. The exponentials are used with variances from the autoregressive model to provide a synthetic covariance matrix having weights that suppress the interference signals. Determining the synthetic covariance matrix may include determining a number of nulls needed to be placed at the AoA of the interference signals.","In other embodiments the method can include determining a number of nulls required based on the peak AoA of the interference signals. The method can operate with a single snapshot of sensor array data or fewer than twice the number of array elements. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art reading the instant specification, drawings, and appended claims.","Methods, systems, and devices are disclosed for beamforming a multi-sensor signal. Beamforming is spatially filtering data from an array of sensor elements where the gain for a signal is increased in a particular direction, and decreased in other directions. Signals from sensors in a multi-sensor array such as an antenna array or sonar array destructively interfere if the signals are naively added together. A beamformer delays signals from sensors nearer the source in accordance with the range from the sensor to the source. This allows constructive addition of signals from sensors.","Referring to , shown therein is a plot of an exemplary beamformed signal  in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. As illustrated in , a beamformed pattern gain can be plotted against angle of arrival and can include a main lobe, side lobes, and nulls. Typically, the largest gain is in the main lobe , side lobes  have less gain, and nulls  cancel the incoming signal. The direction of greatest gain is called the look angle. Different look angles can be obtained by using different delays on the outputs of the antenna elements or sensors.","On the receiving end, non-adaptive beamforming can be limited to a tradeoff between the main lobe width and side lobe suppression. As also illustrated in , some of the extraneous signals or clutter can have an angle of arrival (AoA) that is near a peak in the beam pattern. Because clutter is not at the main lobe, it can receive around 18 dB of suppression, for example. Also some of the clutter can have an AoA near a null  and, as a result, is suppressed to a much greater degree.","Adaptive beamforming adapts to the data by placing nulls at the AoAs of the largest amount of clutter. To accomplish this, adaptive beamformers estimate the data covariance matrix, which is typically estimated by the sample covariance matrix (SCM). The data covariance matrix is a Ne by Ne positive definite (and therefor nonsingular) matrix, where Ne is the total number of elements in the sensor array. For the SCM to be a nonsingular matrix (an important requirement) it must be produced using at least Ne snapshots (a snapshot is a measurement of all the array elements at a particular time). For a good estimate, the SCM requires a minimum of 2*Ne snapshots. In a large array (large Ne), many snapshots will be needed. However, collecting many snapshots in a non-stationary environment is a problem, since the true covariance changes over time.","In particular, reducing interference in a beamformed signal in the present disclosure can include performing adaptive beamforming without using the SCM. Since the present disclosure does not use SCM, the adaptive beamforming can be determined with less than 2*Ne snapshots. According to certain embodiments, the presently disclosed synthetic robust adaptive beamformer (S-RAB) can be performed with as few as one snapshot. When fewer snapshots are required, the S-RAB is robust to data non-stationaries, i.e., to objects that are mobile.","Generally, the S-RAB algorithm of the present disclosure can estimate the AoA(s) of the greatest clutter and synthesize a covariance matrix, that when used in adaptive beamforming, will place nulls in the AoAs of the greatest clutter.","This description provides examples, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention. Rather, the ensuing description will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing embodiments of the invention. Various changes can be made in the function and arrangement of elements.","Thus, various embodiments may omit, substitute, or add various procedures or components as appropriate. For instance, it should be appreciated that the methods can be performed in an order different than that described, and that various steps can be added, omitted or combined. Also, aspects and elements described with respect to certain embodiments can be combined in various other embodiments. It should also be appreciated that the following systems, methods, devices, and software may individually or collectively be components of a larger system, wherein other procedures may take precedence over or otherwise modify their application.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , shown therein is a block diagram of a beamformer  used to process signals from an array  of sensors, as shown typically at . Sensors  can be antenna elements, acoustic sensors or any other sensors of interest. Array  is joined to an receiver . Characteristics of the receiver  depend on the type of sensors  being utilized. Receiver  can perform analog signal conversion and conditioning. Output from receiver  is digitized by digitizer  to give separable streams of digital data with one separable stream being provided for each sensor . This data stream can be separate data lines or can be a multiplexed data line. Digitizer  is joined to beamformer  for processing the sensor data. Beamformer  can be implemented in a general purpose computer having the capability of handling Ne streams of data from array . Beamformer  includes a processor module  and a memory . Each of these components may be in communication, directly or indirectly. Beamformed data is provided to an output . This output  can be a display means or another processing system for processing the received signals.","The processor module  may be configured to execute computer-readable program code stored in the memory  to implement one or more aspects of beamformer . Processor  executes instructions to determine a bearing to or an angle of arrival (AoA) of one or more signals. These signals can be a signal of interest identified by a user or other system and various interference signals. Processor  executes instructions to determine the AoAs of the interference signals. Based on the determined AoAs, processor  computes a synthetic covariance matrix. Processor  can utilize the computed synthetic covariance matrix to perform adaptive beamforming to cancel at least a portion of the one or more interference signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["305","210","205","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"R","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["k","s"],"mo":","}}},{"mo":"{","mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"Ne"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":["Ne","k"],"mo":["-","-"],"mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mi":"x","mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["n","s"],"mo":","}}},{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":["n","k"],"mo":"+"},"mo":",","mi":"s"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":["for","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"mi":["\u2026","Ne"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"-","mn":"1"}],"mo":[",",","],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msup":{"mover":{"mi":"R","mo":"^"},"mo":"*"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":"-","mi":"k"},"mo":",","mi":"s"}}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":["for","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Ne","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}],"mo":"="},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"Ne","mo":"-","mn":"2"}},{"mi":"\u2026","mo":["\u2062","-"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mn":"1"}],"mo":[",",","]}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"r","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mi":"k"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"Ns"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"Ns"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"R","mo":"^"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["k","s"],"mo":","}}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":["for","k"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mo":["\u00b1","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"1"},{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["\u00b1","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"\u2026"},"mo":["\u2062","\u00b1","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"Ne"}],"mo":[",",","]}}]}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Processor  then determines an autoregressive model of the distribution of power over the AoAs in step .

Also, aspects of the present disclosure are robust to non-stationaries in the data. Further, more control of where the nulls are placed is also provided.","According to additional aspects of the present disclosure, adaptive beamformers (ABF) can place nulls at the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the greatest interferers. The optimal method to perform adaptive beamforming may include inverting the covariance matrix of the data. The covariance matrix R is an N by N matrix, where N is the number of elements in the array. In some situations, R can be unknown and it can be estimated from the data. The maximum likelihood estimator for R is the sample covariance matrix (SCM). For the SCM to be a good estimate of R, it should be estimated using at least 2N snapshots, where a snapshot is a measurement of all the array elements at a particular time. If the data is stationary (R not changing with time) then, collecting 2N snapshots is possible. Unfortunately, in some situations the data is not stationary, and collecting data over time is difficult or even impossible. A common method of overcoming the limit on data is to use one of the many reduced rank ABF algorithms.","The algorithm described in the present disclosure for the synthetic robust adaptive beamformer (S-RAB) can be considered a new type of reduced rank algorithm. It can be assumed that in certain situations there is a high interference to noise ratio (INR). This assumption is reasonable because in the low INR case there may not be a need for an ABF. The high INR enables the use of power spectral density (PSD) methods to estimate the interference DOA. Once the DOA of the interference is known, a synthetic covariance matrix (SyCM) can be constructed. The SyCM can be constructed so it will cancel the interference when used in place of the SCM. The S-RAB algorithm has two advantages, for example. First, the algorithm can operate with very few snapshots, making it robust to non-stationary data. Second, because the SyCM is synthesized it is easy to control the properties of the beam pattern.","It should be noted that the methods, systems and devices discussed above are intended merely to be examples.
