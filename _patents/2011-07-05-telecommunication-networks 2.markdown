{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application relates to a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio that wirelessly communicates with mobile terminals registered with the network, and to a method of operating such a mobile telecommunications network.","Recently, a dramatic rise in sales of both smart-phones and laptop data cards has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of data communications passing through mobile telecommunications networks. This volumetric increase can also be attributed to enhancements made to the capabilities of the networks. In fact it has been reported that mobile data growth grew 30 percent over the course of the second quarter of 2009. The most popular use for mobile data was HTTP browsing, although usage of HTTP streaming is growing considerably. Other mobile data uses include HTTP downloading and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) activities such as file sharing.","This ability to use the cellular networks for mobile data services, such as Internet browsing, is resulting in subscribers treating their mobile networks in much the same way as they treat their fixed networks. That is, users are tending to expect the same service from the Internet, irrespective of their access method. However, mobile networks have a more restricted capacity and are more costly to operate, as compared to fixed networks.","In this regard, from the network operator's viewpoint, as the mobile broadband traffic volume carried over 2G, 3G and HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) networks continues to grow, the cost of supporting this data volume is becoming more and more expensive based on the current network architecture and deployments. In fact, access and data volumes are likely to rise faster than the revenue used to build and maintain the networks. This cost differential is exacerbated by one of the current business models being utilised, whereby operators charge a flat rate for unlimited amounts of data.","The increased usage is also unfortunately likely to result in an increase of data traffic jams, and hence a degradation of service for mobile users if not properly managed.","It has been proposed to control data-heavy users by \u201cchoking\u201d the bandwidth available to them when a maximum data volume limit is exceeded. Whilst this addresses the problem on an individual level, it does not address the network capacity problem as a whole.","It is therefore apparent that mobile broadband is at a crossroads as networks and business models are strained by bandwidth demand that is unmatched by revenue generation.","These problems may only get worse with moves to position mobile data as a replacement for fixed DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) access and with the advent of higher radio access speeds with the proposed 4G LTE\/SAE (Long Term Evolution\/System Architecture Evolution) network. A large percentage of this traffic may consist of data which is destined for the public Internet, a significant proportion of which mobile operators may not be able to add value to, despite carrying the data on their own backhaul transport, core transport or cellular core infrastructure.","In addition to the problems discussed above, conventional mobile telephone communications networks have architectures that are hierarchical and expensive to scale. Many of the network elements, such as the BTS, routers, BSC\/RNC etc are proprietary: devices of one manufacturer often do not interface with devices from another manufacturer. This makes it difficult to introduce new capabilities into the network as a different interface may be required for devices from each manufacturer. Further, conventional base stations are not capable of intelligent local routing or processing. Furthermore, the capacity of existing networks is not always used effectively. For example, many cell sites are under used, whilst others are heavily used.","The current network architecture has the following disadvantages: \u2014\n\n","There is therefore a need to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the problems of the prior art. In particular there is a need to address the needs of both the network operators and the users in improving the provision of mobile broadband data services.","(P100936-GB-PSP)","According to the system described herein, there is provided a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with terminals registered with the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the mobile terminals, and wherein the controller is operable to detect the likely malfunctioning of at least one of the mobile terminals and to take action to reduce the affect of the malfunctioning on the network.","A malfunctioning mobile terminal may be one that is operating in an unexpected manner or that has abnormal behaviour.","The controller may be a virus detection entity provided on a \u201cplatform\u201d of the type described in detail below.","The controller may be provided at an access node site (where it is connected to the radio frequency part of a base station) or at a gateway site (where it is provided at the Radio Network Controller, RNC).","The controller may be operable to detect the likely malfunctioning of at least one of the mobile terminals that impacts or potentially impacts the ability of the network to control the mobile terminals (such as control plane data) and\/or the ability of the network to allow user data to be transmitted to or from the mobile terminals (such as user plane data).","The controller may be operable to detect uncharacteristic populations of specific mobile terminal models or model types that would potentially impact the ability of the network to control the mobile terminals (such as control plane data) and\/or the ability of the network to allow user data to be transmitted to or from the mobile terminals (such as user plane data).","The controller may be operable to compare measured characteristics relating to the at least one of the mobile terminals with reference characteristics (sets of definitions in the embodiment to be described) to detect the likely malfunctioning of the at least one of the mobile terminals.","The controller may be operable to compare measured characteristics relating to numbers of mobile terminal of specific types with historic trends in populations of mobile terminals accessing the network.","The definitions may describe how a malfunctioning or incorrectly operating terminal (or terminal\/application combination) might behave. The definitions may describe how a correctly operating mobile terminal or terminal\/application combination may operate. The definitions may include definitions of both types, and the controller may only refer to the definitions corresponding to malfunctioning or incorrectly operating terminals\/applications once it has been determined that the device or terminal\/application combination has deviated the definitions for a correctly operating terminal. If the controller identifies that a terminal or terminal\/application combination has deviated from the correct operational definitions and is operating in accordance with the incorrect or malfunctioning definitions, the controller may start recording the operation of the terminal or terminal\/application combination, for example for more detailed analysis such as manual evaluation.","The controller may be operable to obtain the reference characteristics by calculating them based on previously measured characteristics, or by receiving them from the core or a third party. In the embodiment, the reference characteristics may be obtained by receiving definitions from the core (from central network functions managed by the network operator), or the definitions may be provided by one or more third party applications (provided via the core by another route).","In the embodiment, if the controller calculates the reference characteristics based on previously measured characteristics, the controller may include artificial intelligence capability to perform such an analysis to derive appropriate definitions. In the embodiment the controller may push definitions that it creates to other controller in the radio access network (which may correspond to different base stations and\/or RNCs) or to distribution functions.","The measured characteristics and\/or the reference characteristics may relate to a specific one or the terminals, a specific terminal type or a specific application run by one of the terminals. In the embodiment the definitions may describe the usage patterns of a single terminal or terminal\/application combination or a group of terminal\/application combinations. That is, a separate set of definitions may be provided for each terminal or a group of terminals that might be linked by some common characteristic, such as having the same operating system, the same subscription type or the like.","The reference characteristics\/definitions may represent usage patterns of terminals\/applications over a period of time such as one hour or twenty four hours, and the measured characteristics of a terminal or a group of terminals over such a period of time may be compared to these reference characteristics\/definitions to determine whether the terminal is malfunctioning or whether a group of terminals are acting in an unexpected manner.","The controller may identify the need for new reference characteristics\/definitions and may retrieve these from the core (central network functions) or elsewhere, such as a third party application. The controller may identify the need for new reference characteristics\/definitions automatically. For example, it may receive information from a particular terminal type for which it has no appropriate reference characteristics\/definitions, and in response to this may attempt to obtain appropriate reference characteristics\/definitions from a suitable source.","In response to the detection of a likely malfunctioning of at least one of the mobile terminals, or the unusual behaviour of a group of mobile terminals, the controller may trigger a management event for reducing the impact on the network. For example, the controller may detect a misbehaving terminal that potentially impacts network control, user plane or customer resilience.","The management event may cause the controller to redirect\/hotline service requests from a terminal\/application to a managed webspace associated with the controller (controlled by the same \u201cplatform\u201d in the embodiment).","The management event may trigger the Radio Resource Management (RRM) of the controller to move the misbehaving terminal to a subset of available network resources where the terminal is quarantined.","The management event may trigger the limiting of radio resources to which the terminal is scheduled to the bare minimum to allow connectivity.","The management event may trigger the rejection of the misbehaving terminal from accessing the network and\/or barring future access to the network.","The management event may trigger the introduction or modification of specific firewall settings for the misbehaving terminal (reducing the effect of any virus, for example).","The management event may trigger an alarm or alert to a customer service person or engine, or technical engineering functions to disinfect or disconnect the misbehaving terminal.","The malfunctioning or misbehaving terminal may be one that has a virus but may also be a terminal that is malfunctioning in some other way\u2014such as having a corrupted or out-of-date operating system.","The system described herein also provides a method of operating a mobile telecommunications network as defined in the claims.","According to a further aspect of the system described herein, there is provided a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with terminals registered with the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the mobile terminals, and wherein the controller is operable to detect the likely presence of a misbehaving mobile terminal which is characterised by the network operator and to take action to reduce the impact on the network.","In another aspect the system described herein provides a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with mobile terminals registered with the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the mobile terminals, and wherein the controller is operable to detect the likely presence of a virus on one of the mobile terminals and to take action to reduce the affect of the virus on the network.","(P100940-GB-PSP)","According to a further aspect of the system described herein, there is provided a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communications with terminals using the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the terminals, and wherein the controller is operable to monitor data received from the terminals to identify interruption of the radio access network.","The data received from the terminals may be signals, such as control signalling, or data containing content.","The terminals may be terminals registered with the network, for example by having a subscription with the network. The terminals may also be terminals that are not registered with the network but which nevertheless are capable of interrupting the proper operation of the network. Such terminals may be jamming devices: devices configured to deliberately disrupt the network. The terminals may also be non-telecommunications devices which are sources of interference, causing disruption or performance implications to the operation of the network.","The controller may be provided on a novel \u201cplatform\u201d of the type described in detail below.","The controller may be operable to monitor and analyse data received from other controller relating to other terminals (terminals served by the other controller). The controller may communicate with neighbouring controller of neighbouring radio sites\/base stations to retrieve radio performance metrics measured at their geographic location. The neighbouring controller may retrieve performance measurements from terminals in the creation of radio performance metrics. The neighbouring controller may aggregate and analyse the distributed radio performance across the geographical area covered by the controller. Controller may aggregate and analyse the radio performance across the geographic areas covered by the controller and the neighbouring controller. The controller may use the data that itself gathers, and that obtained from other controllers to build the database of historical performance across the geographic area served by each controller (which area may overlap to a greater of lesser extent).","The controller may be operable to measure a characteristic radio link to\/from the terminals. For example, the controller may measure the network performance of the uplink in each of the cells. The network performance of the uplink may be assessed by measuring the receive interference, the transmit power of the terminals, the cell throughput, the aggregate cell\/site throughput, the dropped call rate and\/or the H-ARQ rate. The characteristic of the radio is advantageously an indication of radio quality between a mobile terminal and a base station associated with the controller.","The controller may be operable to compare the data with interruption criteria to identify the interruption of the radio access network. Interruption may be caused by a modified or malfunctioning terminal registered with the network. The interruption may be caused by a device that is not registered with the network but which is (deliberately) configured to jam or interrupt the network. The controller may also obtain information indicating the location of, of may calculate the location of, the mobile terminals providing data.","The controller may be operable to additionally use measurements from a fixed telecommunications network to identify interruption. For example, if it is detected that there is interruption\/jamming of the radio access network, the status of the fixed network at the same location may also be checked.","The location of the terminals providing the data may be compared to historic average radio performance at that location, as collected previously by the controller (or by any other mechanism). The controller may compare the measured performance against a predefined set of jamming criteria to identify attempts to interrupt the radio access network.","The controller may be operable to provisionally identify interruption of the radio access network and, in response thereto, to control the collection of further data from the terminals. For example, the controller may analyse the initially provided data for a particular geographic area against interruption\/jamming criteria to determine whether additional information is required. The initial analysis may indicate the likelihood (or otherwise) of interruption\/jamming occurring, and additional data may be determined to be required if it is indicated that interruption\/jamming is a possibility.","If additional information is determined to be required, then the controller may instruct terminals to provide further performance measurements. The controller may trigger a dummy paging procedure to wake up additional terminals from the idle\/inactive state to the active\/connected state, for example to allow further performance measurements to be provided by, these additional terminals. This dummy paging procedure may be triggered by the injection of dummy data packets into the system, or triggering data delivery or retrieval associated with other services for the terminal, or scheduling an SMS. The controller may trigger terminals to provide performance measurements at their geographic location. The terminals may be instructed to report performance measurements for a fixed duration or periodically. The controller may instruct neighbouring controller to increase the granularity of the performance measurements. The controller may instruct additional neighbouring controller to provide radio performance metrics measured at their geographical location.","The controller may be operable to identify the terminals in the location of the interruption source. The controller may contact these terminals. The controller may instruct these terminals to operate in a predefined manner for a period of time whilst a controller performs diagnostics. The predefined manner may be a reduction in data rate, a limitation on the maximum transmit power, a predefined scheduling pattern for the terminal and\/or predetermined times and durations when the terminal cannot transmit or receive. The identified terminals may simply be all the terminals in the location of the interruption source, or may be each terminal in turn which is thought to be the interruption source itself.","The controller may be operable to take action in response to any of the terminals causing the interruption. For example, the controller may include information identifying such a terminal on a network performance blacklist, such identification information being an IMSI and IMEI combination, for example. The network and\/or controller may restrict service for terminals that are on the blacklist. The controller may notify the service operator or customer service function of the offending terminal and its location. The controller may contact the offending terminal by SMS, email or any other suitable message to notify it or its user that its performance is being temporally compromised.","Controller may trigger an alarm when the controller identifies that the source of the degraded network performance is not a terminal connected to the operating network (that is, registered with the network or used with the network). An alarm may also be triggered when the controller identifies that the source of the degraded network performance is a terminal and is registered with a network (that is, a terminal with a legitimate subscription with a network). The criticality of the alarm may be dependent on the size of the impacted geographical region, dependent on the assessed impact on network performance and\/or dependent on the predicted number of the impacted terminals. The alarm may trigger the controller to modify the cell reselection and\/or handover criteria to change the mobility and selection process to preference another network technology or frequency layer. The terminal may be informed through system information or through the inability to connect to the operator network that it cannot use the network, and the terminal may be configured to automatically change the handover\/reselection parameters to prefer different network technology (e.g., switching from 3G to 2G, 3G to Wifi, or 3G to Ethernet), or frequency layer or network operator. The terminal may be configured to store network outage or performance degradation against it location locally, reporting this information to the network or application in the network at a later time when connectivity is restored.","The controller may use the information gathered from the terminals in conjunction with information received from other external sources; e.g., loss of DSL\/Fibre (i.e. Wireline technology) connectivity with the location or customer.","The controller may trigger communication with terminals with specific applications at specific geographic locations, when network performance issues have been resolved.","The detection of interrupting the network may be particularly advantageous when the network is being used to monitor a premises (or other entity). Interruption of the radio access network in the location of the monitored premises may be an indication that security at this premises is being breached. Identification of the interruption attempt can alert security personnel to take appropriate action.","The controller may be operable to identify the location of a device that interrupts the radio access network.","The controller may be operable to re-route communication from terminals if it detects interruption of the radio access network. The controller may also be operable to insert or change information that is broadcasted by the network to inform customers in the impacted area of consequences and any actions to be performed by the customers. The controller may also be operable to modify the properties or configuration of the network, e.g., increasing transmit power, or increasing coding protection.","In another aspect, the system described herein provides a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with terminals registered with the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the terminals, wherein some of the terminals are security terminals arranged to monitor security, and wherein the controller is operable to receive data from the security terminals, and to monitor signals received from the terminals, including the security terminals, to identify attempts to interrupt the radio access network. The controller may identify the location of a device that interrupts the radio access network. The controller may re-route communications from the security terminals if it detects interruption of the radio access network.","(P100934-GB-PSP)","The system described herein also provides a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with mobile terminals registered with the network, the radio including a plurality of radio frequency parts and a plurality of baseband parts, and wherein the network includes a controller operable to control the use of the baseband parts.","For example, a nodeB or Femto (base station) of the radio access network can be considered to comprise two main parts: a radio frequency part and a baseband part. The radio frequency part may handle the transmission of radio frequency signals between the antenna of the nodeB or Femto and the mobile terminal, and the converting of radio frequency signals into digital baseband signals (and vice versa). The baseband part may be responsible for controlling and managing the transmission of the baseband signals to other components of the mobile telecommunications network.","The controller may be operable to temporarily disable selected baseband parts that are underused and to enable equivalent functions of the disabled baseband parts to be provided by alternative ones of the baseband parts.","In the embodiment each of the baseband parts corresponds to a respective one of the radio frequency parts, and a respective one of the controller is provided in the radio access network for each of the baseband parts.","In the embodiment the controller may be provided in the novel \u201cplatform\u201d which is described in more detail below. Such a platform also provide the baseband part corresponding to the radio part which is provided by a base station associated with the platform.","In the embodiment the controller determines at least one efficiency characteristic of its associated baseband part. The efficiency characteristic may include, but is not limited to: (hardware) load, power consumption, (optical) bandwidth, cell outage, hardware resilience, heat production, power sources, spectrum efficiency, number of supported devices, number of connected devices and the location of devices. The controller may assess load and determine whether to power down a baseband part. The controller may assess whether to use pooled resources from a centralised baseband pool. The controller may assess whether to use resources from another neighbouring baseband part. The controller may temporarily enable selected baseband parts based on efficiency characteristics\/criteria within the controller.","In the embodiment each of the baseband parts provides a plurality of baseband functions. Respective baseband functions may include communication in different radio access technologies, such as 2G, 3G, 4G etc.","In the embodiment the controller temporarily disables selected baseband functions of its associated baseband part that are underused and enables equivalent baseband functions to the disabled baseband functions to be provided by alternative ones of the baseband parts that are associated with other controller. In this way, a baseband function that is operating inefficiently may be shut down, and instead equivalent functionality may be provided by another baseband function that is associated with another radio frequency part.","The controller may be operable to dynamically control the allocation of resources within a baseband part between radio access technologies such as 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) technologies. The controller may disable a radio access technology to reduce load in the baseband part. The controller may reconfigure the baseband part controlling a specific spectrum allocation to offer a different radio access technology on that spectrum.","The controller may be provided at a gateway node and\/or an access node.","In one arrangement a gateway node controls the sharing of baseband functions between respective baseband parts. Alternatively the controller may control the sharing of baseband functions between respective baseband parts. The controller and\/or gateway node may dynamically manage the routing of information\/optics between the access nodes to enable hosting of baseband parts on other nodes.","The gateway node or the controller may be operable to disable selective baseband functions, typically those baseband functions that are not operating efficiently and which can be performed by sharing the capacity of the baseband function provided elsewhere.","The gateway node or controller may be operable to share or disable baseband functions in dependence upon the efficiency characteristic thereof.","The system described herein also provides a method of operating a mobile telecommunications network as defined in the claims.","(P100941-GB-PSP)","According to a Another Aspect of the System Described Herein, there is Provided a mobile telecommunications network including a core and a radio access network having a radio for wireless communication with mobile terminals registered with the network, wherein the radio access network includes a controller operable to control the use of network resources by the mobile terminals, and wherein the controller is operable to collect information relating to the mobile terminals and to control the operation of an external resource in dependence on the information.","The information collected by the controller may provide an indication of the location of the mobile terminals. Such information might be the time it takes for a data packet sent to a mobile terminal to be acknowledged by that mobile terminal. It could be other timing information. For example, the location of the mobile terminal could be determined by cell triangulation or any other suitable technique. Information from a GPS receiver of the mobile terminal may also be used to determine the location of the mobile terminal.","The controller may be operable to instruct the mobile terminals to move from an idle communication state to an active or connected communication state in order to obtain the indication of the location of the mobile terminals. This may be performed if, for example, it is necessary to send a data packet to the mobile terminal, and wait for acknowledgement of receipt of the data packet from the mobile terminal, in order to identify its position. The terminal may be moved from the idle communication state to the active\/connected communication state my any suitable technique, including: modification of network measurement parameters (e.g., the measurement period); by the controller transmitting dummy paging messages to a paging group of mobile terminals; and by the controller modifying the cell identification parameters (e.g., tracking area identifier).","The controller may be operable to analyse the collected information to determine at least one of the speed, direction, velocity and indoor\/outdoor status of the mobile terminals.

This may be achieved by varying the handover and\/or reselection criteria, or by varying the system information broadcast by the or each access point.","In the embodiment the controller modifies handover parameters and cell reselection parameters for a mobile terminal based on a measured characteristic of the mobile terminal (e.g., radio conditions), in one example. The handover parameters and cell reselection parameters may alternatively or additionally be dependent upon the location and speed of the mobile terminal in relation to the known geographic location of an access point. The handover parameters and cell reselection of parameters may alternatively or additionally be dependent on user subscription information, historic measurements of a target access point quality and reliability, and predicted user experience on the macro base station or access point.","The handover procedure may be initiated and cell reselection parameters may be modified based on the service requirements of the services and applications used by the mobile terminals.","Advantageously, the controller configures the parameters of the or each access point in real time.","The controller may power up\/down the radio of an access point depending on the measured geographic position of devices in the macro base station coverage area.","The controller may manage the configuration of the access point based on detected power and interference at the macro base station or mobile terminals connected to the macro base station.","The controller may reconfigure the (frequency) spectrum allocation and (radio access) technology (e.g., between GSM, HSPA or LTE) of the access point depending on measured geographic position of mobile terminals served by the macro base station, the geographic coverage\/quality of the access point, and the respective capability of the mobile terminals.","The system information parameters broadcast by the access points may be modified based on interference measured on the macro base station and the mobile terminals connected through the macro base station and access point.","The controller may configure the broadcast system information parameters of the macro base station as a consequence of the access point performance within the coverage area of the macro base station.","The access point performance may be determined across a cluster of access points within the coverage area of the macro base station.","The system information parameters may be modified based on interference load of the macro cell on macro base station.","The controller may differentially charge the users of the mobile terminals for connectivity and service access from the controller whilst using the access points. For example, there may be a lower charge for communicating via an access point rather than via the macro base station.","Other optional and advantageous features of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.","The system described herein also provides a method of operating a mobile telecommunications network, as defined in the claims.","In the claims, the reference to features or steps in the alternative should not be interpreted as indicating that those alternatives are equivalent or provide similar functions or advantages.","Certain elements of a 3G mobile telecommunications network, and its operation, may now briefly be described with reference to .","Each base station (e.g., Node B  and Femto ) corresponds to a respective cell of the cellular or mobile telecommunications network and receives calls from and transmits calls to a mobile terminal (not shown) in that cell by wireless radio communication in one or both of the circuit switched or packet switched domains. The mobile terminal may be any portable telecommunications device, including a handheld mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop computer equipped with a network access datacard.","The nodeB  or Femto  can be considered to comprise two main parts: a radio frequency part and a baseband part. The radio frequency part handles the transmission of radio frequency signals between the antenna of the nodeB  or Femto  and the mobile terminal, and for converting radio frequency signals into digital baseband signals (and vice versa). The baseband part is responsible for controlling and managing the transmission of the baseband signals to other components of the mobile telecommunications network.","In a macro 3G network, the Radio Access Network (RAN) comprises Node Bs and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs). The Node B is the function within the 3G network that provides the physical and transport radio link between the mobile terminal (User Equipment, UE) and the network. The Node B performs the transmission and reception of data wirelessly across the radio interface, and also applies the codes that are necessary to describe channels in a CDMA system. The RNC is responsible for control the Node Bs that are connected to it. The RNC performs Radio Resource Management (RRM), some of the mobility management functions and is the point where encryption is done before user data is sent to and from a mobile terminal. The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through a Media Gateway (MGW) and to an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node)  in the Packet Switched Core Network. In , Node B  is controlled by RNC  across the Iub interface. An RNC may control more than one node B.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0149","num":"0155"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["2","2","4"]},"The radio link between the Femto  and the mobile terminal uses the same cellular telecommunication transport protocols as Node B  but with a smaller range\u2014for example 25 m. The Femto  appears to the mobile terminal as a conventional base station, so no modification to the mobile terminal is required for it to operate with the Femto . The Femto  performs a role corresponding to that of Node B  in the macro 3G RAN.","The Femto  would typically be configured to serve a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) located in a home or office, in addition to GSM\/UMTS\/LTE networks. The WLAN could belong to the subscriber of the mobile terminal, or be an independently operated WLAN. The owner of Femto  can prescribe whether it is open or closed, whereby an open AP is able to carry communications from any mobile device in the GSM\/UMTS\/LTE network, and a closed AP is only able to carry communications from specific pre-assigned mobile devices.","Conventionally, in a 3G network (macro or Femto), the RANs are controlled by a mobile switching centre (MSC) and an SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node)  of the core network. The MSC supports communications in the circuit switched domain, whilst the SGSN  supports communications in the packet switched domain\u2014such as GPRS data transmissions. The SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile terminals within its geographical service area. It performs packet routing and transfer, mobility management (attach\/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. A location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current VLR) and user profiles (e.g., IMSI, address(es) used in the packet data network) of all mobile terminals registered with this SGSN. In , since the embodiment is concerned with data transmission, only the SGSN is illustrated as being in communication with RNC  and AGW , across the Iu interface. The RNC  typically has a dedicated (not shared) connection to its SGSN , such as a cable connection.","Communications between the AGW  and the SGSN  are preferably IP based communications, and may be, for example, transmitted over a broadband IP network. Further, the connection between the Femto and the AGW  may use the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). Typically a DSL cable connects the AGW to the PSTN, and data is transmitted there-between by IP transport\/DSL transport. The Femto or AGW converts the cellular telecommunications transport protocols used between the mobile terminal and the Femto  to the appropriate IP based signalling.","The femto  may be connected to the AGW by means other than a DSL cable and the PSTN network. For example, the femto  may be connected to the AGW by a dedicated cable connection that is independent of the PSTN, or by a satellite connection.","The SGSN  is in communication with the GGSN  (Gateway GPRS Support Node) across the Gn interface. The GGSN is responsible for the interworking between the GPRS network and external packet switched networks, e.g., the Internet. The GGSN enables the mobility of mobile terminals in the networks. It maintains routing necessary to tunnel the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to the SGSN that service a particular mobile terminal. The GGSN converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the appropriate packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g., IP or X.25) and sends them out on the corresponding packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are converted to the mobile network address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the user and their profile in its location register. The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected mobile terminal. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions. Other functions include IP Pool management and address mapping, QoS and PDP context enforcement.","In turn the GGSN  may route data via any applicable Value Added Service (VAS) equipment , before data is forwarded towards its intended destination via the Internet . As an example of the functionality of the VAS equipment, the traffic may be inspected for adult content before reaching the end-user if this user is under 18 years of age.","For billing purposes in particular, a PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function) apparatus  is also provided, in communication with both the SGSN  and the GGSN .","The SGSN , GGSN , VAS  and PCRF apparatus  comprise the core network of the mobile telecommunications network.","Mobile telecommunications networks have an active state of communication with their mobile terminals and an inactive\/idle state of communication with their terminals. When in the active state, as the mobile terminals move between different cells of the network, the communication session is maintained by performing a \u201chandover\u201d operation between the cells. In the inactive\/idle state, as a mobile terminal moves between different cells of the network the mobile terminal performs \u201ccell reselection\u201d to select the most appropriate cell on which to \u201ccamp\u201d in order that the mobile terminal can be paged by the network when mobile terminating data is destined for that mobile terminal.","Conventionally, the mobile terminal or network determines whether a handover\/cell reselection procedure should be triggered in dependence upon measurements of the radio signals of the cells in the region of the mobile terminal. A filter is applied to the signals (either by the network or by the mobile terminal) which calculates an average (e.g., arithmetical mean) value of these signals over a particular time period. This filtered\/average values of the cells are then compared with each other or with a threshold value. In dependence upon these comparisons, cell reselection\/handover related procedures are triggered. This cell reselection\/handover process generally comprises taking radio signal measurements of neighbouring cells and comparing these to each other and to the radio signal of the current cell to determine which cell provides the best signal strength\/quality. Handover\/reselection to the best cell can then occur.","Generally calculations to determine whether to perform a handover from one base station to another base station are performed by the network, whereas calculations whether to perform cell reselection are performed by the mobile terminal.","Data in a mobile telecommunications network can be considered to be separated into \u201ccontrol plane\u201d and \u201cuser plane\u201d. The control plane performs the required signalling, and includes the relevant application protocol and signalling bearer, for transporting the application protocol messages. Among other things, the application protocol is used for setting up the radio access bearer and the radio network layer. The user plane transmits data traffic and includes data streams and data bearers for the data streams. The data streams are characterised by one or more frame protocols specific for a particular interface. Generally speaking, the user plane carries data for use by a receiving terminal\u2014such as data that allow a voice or picture to be reproduced\u2014and the control plane controls how data are transmitted.","In addition to the elements and functions described above, mobile telecommunications networks also include facilities for transmitting SMS messages. SMS messages are transmitted over the control plane only (and not the user plane).","This architecture is what currently is being used to carry all packet data to and from mobile terminals. That is, in today's implementation of the Packet data architecture, user plane traffic traverses across all the network elements shown between the Node B or Femto on which the user is camped and the Internet. That is, all data is directed from the applicable RAN through the core network components SGSN, GGSN and VAS before reaching the Internet. All PS traffic accordingly follows the same path and therefore has the same network costs. All applications are processed on the client (on the mobile device) or on the server (which is connected to the Internet), and the network core therefore acts like a bit-pipe in the current architecture. For data, where the mobile network operator cannot add any value by carrying it on its own backhaul transport, core transport or cellular core infrastructure (the core network), such as data destined for the public Internet without required intervention from the core network, there is no benefit to routing this data via the core network.","However, a large percentage of this traffic can be handled in a more intelligent manner for example through content optimisation (Video & Web), content caching, or locally routed or directly routing content to the public Internet. All these techniques reduce the investment required by a mobile operator to carry the data on its own backhaul and core transport or cellular core infrastructure.","In order to offer low cost packet data, to support new services and to manage customer expectation, a step-change reduction in the end-to-end cost per bit is required.","Mobile operators want to reduce their packet data handling costs through alternate network architectures based on commoditised IT platforms, breaking away from the traditional architecture based on their voice legacy. These new network architectures overcome the Access architecture issues of today","In order to successfully offer cheap packet data and be able to compete with the fixed broadband offers (flat fee) a solution is proposed which focuses on the reduction of the end-to-end cost per bit, especially for Internet access service.","This enables mobile operators to reduce packet data handling costs by means of an alternative network cost model architecture, which breaks out of the traditional network architecture and nodes and utilises lower cost transport networks to optimise the data flow.","In this regard,  shows a high level description of the architecture that may be adopted to deploy this on a 3G network.","According to this arrangement, novel \u201cplatforms\u201d , ,  for performing functions such as caching, routing, optimisation and offload\/return decision functionality are integrated into the network. This decision functionality may be incorporated in the radio architecture. In this regard, the platforms , ,  may be incorporated into the NodeBs  (), RNCs  () or exist as separate physical entities (). It is these platforms , ,  that, for example, determine the path of communications originating from the mobile terminals.","The exact placement of the platform , ,  is not essential, and, for a macro 3G network, it can be placed at or between the Node Bs and the RNCs, and also between the RNCs and the SGSNs (or any combination thereof). It would also be possible to place the platform , ,  at the GGSN (although not the SGSN as this does not control user data, only control data).","In the 3G Macro network, the aim is to offload a high percentage of the macro network traffic from the core and transport (IuPS, Gn, etc) by diverting specific traffic type for certain user(s) class directly to the Internet.","Where the platform ,  is located, in the Node Bs (or on the Iub interface), it may be possible to redirect the data from all the remaining mobile network elements (e.g., the RNC, SGSN, GGSN and VAS for macro 3G), and sending the data directly to the Internet . In a similar manner, where the platform  is located at the RNC (or on the Iu interface), it becomes possible to redirect the data from the SGSN , GGSN  and the VAS . The alternative data route is preferably a DSL using ADSL.","It is also preferable to aggregate the alternative data routes for each cell, where applicable. In this regard, each cell may have at least one RNC  and a plurality of Node Bs, so where the decision blocks are situated at or in the vicinity of the Node Bs, for instance, there may be a plurality of links which should ideally be aggregated before being passed to the Internet . At the point of this aggregation , there is preferably a further decision block which enables data to be returned to the legacy route. For instance, a new policy rule may have been implemented, which requires or enables previously offloaded data to be returned to the core network route. This new policy rule may be communicated to the return decision module by the core network policy module. In , this returning of data is only shown to the VAS , but the data may be returned to one or more of the other core network elements.","Each of the NodeBs  is connected to the mobile network core through a Point of Concentration (PoC) . All traffic from the NodeBs  which is to be routed through the core mobile network is routed to the PoC . This includes both user plane and control plane data. On the control plane level, the PoC  routes data to and from the SGSN  and the GGSN . Control data is also sent to and from other core network components, including the Lawful Interception Database (LI DB) , DNS Server , Policy Server  (including Charging rules and IT Network A) and Home Location Register\/Home Subscriber Server (HLR\/HSS)  (which contains subscriber and device profile and state information).","User plane data is transmitted by the PoC  to the SGSN  and the GGSN . From the GGSN , data is routed across a VAS  node to the Internet . In 3G this is the standard data path from the mobile terminals to the Internet.","To implement an advantageous feature, an alternative path on which to re-route certain data to the Internet  is provided, whereby, each NodeB  and Femto  may be connected to a fixed line connection  (e.g., xDSL) which is directly connected to the Internet . These xDSL connections may be made directly to the NodeB and\/or Femto or made to the NodeB\/Femto via other components, such as the PoC . In , the xDSL Network  may be a third party network or may be a network owned or controlled by the owner of the mobile telecommunications network. By using such an alternative path, radio capacity, backhaul transport resource, core transport resource, cellular core network resources can be saved as well as improving performance and enhancing revenue for the mobile network operator.","As each Node B  and\/or PoC  is associated with a platform , , , for each data packet request originating from a mobile terminal, a decision at the platform , ,  is made as to whether the traffic may bypass the core mobile network entirely or may be passed into the core mobile network. The location at which the traffic is routed towards the Internet is preferably at the platform , , ; however, it may alternatively be routed out from the core network towards the Internet at a different component. Traffic offloaded from the macro network is routed by the platform  to the xDSL network  by link  (the decision to offload this traffic may have been made at platform ,  or \u2014although the decision is implemented at platform )","Preferably the Offload\/Return decision is dependent upon the type of data or user. To exemplify this feature of the embodiment,  is a flow diagram showing the steps taken when deciding how to route the traffic in the architecture of . For instance, consider an NodeB receives a request to set up a data call from a user device which is camped on the NodeB at . Once the NodeB has identified the request as a data call and the type of traffic\/user, rather than automatically routing the data traffic to the core network, the data request is held at the NodeB at  until a decision has been made as to how to route the data, in particular whether to offload the traffic directly to the Internet or whether to return the data through the core mobile network. Typically, the signalling (control plane) for the connection may continue through the normal route but the user data traffic may be held at the NodeB, this is possible by virtue of the separate user and control planes, as shown in .","The decision as to whether or not to use the Core mobile Network to route the data traffic can be based on various aspects, particularly relating to the properties of the data being routed and\/or status of the user routing the data.","The Mobile Network may add value to traffic by providing a number of services, such as compressing the user data to speed-up the data transfer while downloading (if this functionality is not already supported by the platforms , , ). These different services can be broken up into groups and provided by different entities (e.g., this enables greater flexibility in the provision of the services, such as the mandated Internet Watch Foundation\u2014IWF\u2014requirement, which can only be supported by the mobile operator). The platforms , ,  therefore make a decision on whether to service the data locally through caching, fetch the data from other node or from the Internet via offload functionally or whether to route the traffic through the core network, based on the applicability of one or more of the services to the traffic. That is, platform , ,  decides when data traffic requires one or more of the services and when it can do without them.","It should also be noted that these services are ones that could be provided without using the core network. These are services that add value to the customer, and which subscribers may pay for (explicitly or implicitly).","Referring again to , the platform , ,  decides at  what to do with the traffic (from coming for the network\/Internet or orientated by the device). This decision may be made by interrogating certain servers or databases stored centrally within the core network which can compare the type of service, type of user etc with criteria which identifies the type of action shall be considered, e.g., whether the traffic is suitable for offloading directly to the Internet (at ) from the NodeB or whether the traffic should be routed through the core (at ). Examples of some of the considerations used in influencing the decision of whether to offload the traffic are discussed below in more detail. The implementation of this data offload technique needs to be carefully considered, as it places additional constraints on the network design.","The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of challenges that have to be considered when implementing the data offload technique:\n\n","Some specific examples of Customer Services that can be taken into account by the offload decision module include:\n\n","The Network Services that can be taken into account by the offload decision module are typically those that the network operator needs to manage its network. Some examples include:","i) Charging: The charging plan that a user subscribes to can be used to determine whether or not to offload that user's data. For instance, it is most easily avoided when the customer has a flat rate plan. That is, users on flat rate plans do not need their usage tracked for charging purposes in real time and so can be offloaded onto the alternative route. For users who are roaming or whose charging plan depends upon usage, then, the operator\/supplier needs to track their total usage in real-time, and so their data needs to be maintained on the core network route so that rate-limits and data usage can be accurately tracked and alarms\/alerts activated when usage exceeds allowances. This is because, if this is not avoidable then Call Data Records (CDRs) need to be generated by the module for the real time charging.\n\n","Regulatory Services are services that are mandated by legislation, and are typically provided to all traffic. Some specific examples of Regulatory Services that can be taken into consideration by the offload decision module include:\n\n","A further criterion that the platform (, , ) module may consider is the priority of the customer. In this regard, a network operator may wish to prioritise traffic across its network based on the priority level of the customer. For example, a high value customer (e.g., a corporate customer or a subscriber with on a high tariff contract) may be given priority over a low value customer. In this situation, a network may decide to offload lower value customers directly to the Internet. This is related to the QoS criterion mentioned above, although the QoS criterion is generally linked to traffic management to maintain a balanced network, whereas the priority referred to can be used to ensure subscribers get a level of service commensurate with their service agreement.","The embodiment of  is in relation to a 3G network. Embodiments of the invention are equally applicable to 4G (LTE\/SAE) networks.","The LTE\/SAE macro network includes eNode Bs which make up the RAN. The eNode Bs effectively combine the functionality of the node B and the RNC of the 3G network. These eNodeBs are the network components which communicate with the mobile communication devices. It is envisaged that the eNodeBs may be arranged in groups and each group controlled by a Mobility Management Entity (MME) and a User Plane Entity (UPE).","The MME performs many of the mobility functions traditionally provided by the SGSN. The MME terminates the control plane with the mobile device. It is responsible for terminating NAS (Non Access Stratum) Signalling such as MM (Mobility Management) and SM (Session Management) information as well as coordinating Idle Mode procedures. Other responsibilities of the MME include gateway selection inter MME Mobility and authentication of the mobile device.","The UPE manages protocols on the user plane such as, storing mobile terminal contexts, terminating the Idle Mode on the user plane, and PDP context encryption.","The platforms would operate in the same manner as described in relation to the 3G network. The platforms may be located at many different locations in the 4G network.","A more specific example of how the platform , ,  may be implemented is described in relation to .  is a flow diagram illustrating a preferred method for deciding whether to offload data traffic to the Internet. The decision structure is composed in a hierarchical form in order that certain types of user or data are always directed through the core network. The example of  is described for a 3G network but it will be clear to those skilled in the art that these decisions could be applied to any type of radio access technology.","Once a PS HSPA data call (or other connection) is made and received at the Node B at , a primary consideration by the platform , ,  at  is whether the device is operating on its home network or whether it is roaming. If the device is roaming then all traffic is automatically routed through the core network. The reason for this is that the home network would want to guarantee the security and accurate billing (due to different charging principle between home and visited operator) of the user's traffic. The platform , ,  at  may also consider other factors, such as what application types running on the mobile terminal require connections. If the mobile device is operating on its home network at , or if the applications do not require a connection to the core network, the platform , ,  considers secondary offloading criteria at . Examples of secondary criteria may include the functions required by the device, the radio bearer currently used by the device, the APN, or the priority level of the customer identified, for example, through IMSI, IMEI or the target subscriber. If the offloading criteria are met at , the decision moves to the tertiary criteria, otherwise, the traffic is not offloaded.","At , the system checks the mobility of the user. If the user is moving, he is considered not suitable for offload due to an expected interruption delay of the user data when moving between source and target cell.","Finally, at  the system conducts a contents and policy check to confirm whether the user is suitable for offload. If it is determined that the user is suitable for offload to the Internet, the eNodeB offloads the traffic to the Internet at . If it is determined that the user is not suitable for offloading to the Internet at  then the procedure returns \u201chome\u201d at . A connection is provided by a network core in a conventional way and the tests of the flowchart shown in  are repeated periodically to determine whether offloading directly to the Internet becomes possible subsequently.","If the device is determined to be roaming at step , then the device is not offloaded directly to the Internet, but remains connected via the network core in a conventional way at . Similarly, if the offloading criteria are not met at steps , the mobile device remains communicating via the network core in the conventional way, again at .","The hierarchical decision method is useful because it reduces the number of challenges across the network. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that different hierarchical structures may be appropriate for different networks, different conditions etc and that the example of  is just one way the decision could be made.","For instance, whilst arrangements have chiefly been described in relation to transmitting data traffic from a mobile terminal to a data network, the principles may also be applied to transmissions from a data network towards a mobile terminal.","In the arrangements described above the decision regarding the route is said to be made at call set-up. However, it should be appreciated that a decision to change the routing of data may be made at the beginning of a communication session (for example establishment of a PDP context), or during a communication session. The routing of data may change several times during a single communication session. For example, when a communication session is initiated it may be detected that the user is not moving, in which case a decision may be made to offload the data over the alternative data route. Subsequently it may be detected that the user is moving, and at this point a decision may be made to beginning routing data for the communication session via the mobile network. During the communication session, the mobile terminal may become stationary for a prolonged period of time again, and at this time a further decision may be made to send subsequent data during the communication session via the alternative data route. Subsequently again, the user may then attempt to access age-restricted content, and it may be detected that parental control is required. In response for the requirement for parental control, a decision may be made to redirect subsequent data during the Communication session via the core network so that core network parental controls can be applied.","It is to be appreciated that the present embodiments of the invention are to be distinguished from HSDPA offload, a technique used on the Iub interface between the Node B and the RNC. HSDPA offload which serves to separate data traffic from voice traffic, so that non-real time data traffic is sent down a less expensive backhaul to complement or replace the expensive E1\/T1 TDM backhaul link between the two. Once this diverted traffic reaches the RNC, however, it is returned to the cellular and transport core networks and there is no differentiation made based upon data traffic type.","In the arrangement described above the platform , ,  primarily handles data offload decisions. As described below, the platform can perform may other functions.","Embodiments of the invention in which the Radio Access Network controls the use of resources by mobile terminals will now be described.","Platform Architecture","As discussed above, a mobile telecommunication network is modified by the introduction of a \u201cplatform\u201d , , . Such a platform is shown in more detail at   and which includes three principal parts: soft nodes  (physical\/transport layer), network functions  and services  (application layer).","The platform  communicates with the radio frequency (RF) part of a base station, such as a NodeB . The soft nodes  of the platform  comprise components such as a soft NodeB , soft BTS , soft eNodeB  and soft RNC  and soft SGSN\/GGSN . The soft nodeB  provides functions equivalent to the baseband part of a conventional NodeB in a 3G telecommunications network. The soft BTS  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions of a BTS in a conventional 2G mobile telecommunications network. The soft enodeB  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions provided by a conventional enodeB in a 4G mobile telecommunications network. The platform  may therefore communicate with the radio frequency part of a 2G, 3G or 4G base station and provide appropriate baseband services for 2G, 3G or 4G technologies (or indeed for other technologies). A 3G mobile terminal that wishes to obtain telecommunication services from the mobile telecommunications networks connects wirelessly to the radio frequency part of a NodeB. Baseband functions may be provided either by a baseband part of the conventional NodeB or by the soft NodeB  forming an element of the soft node part of the platform . For example, the soft NodeB  may receive radio measurements from the radio frequency part of the NodeB to which it is connected, and may provide these radio measurements to other elements of the platform .","The network functions part  of the platform  includes modules for performing functions similar to those performed by the core network of a mobile telecommunications network, such as billing , location tracking  and the radio resource management (RRM) . The network functions may further comprise an offload decision module  that performs a function similar to the offload decision modules ,  and  described above. The network functions part  may further comprise a caching function  and Content Delivery Network function .","The network functions parts  of the platform  provides an Application Programming Interface (API) framework to the services part  of the platform . The services part  of the platform supports a plurality of applications ,  etc.","The network functions fall into three main categories, those that enable the network operation (e.g., charging, O&M), those that support service operation (e.g., Location) and those that optimise the usage of the network by certain applications and services (e.g., Caching, Video Optimisation).","The applications supported on the Platform  are the entities that supply or demand the flow of data on the network, akin to a server on the Internet, e.g., gaming server, navigation server.","The API is implemented by a software program running on the network function part  which presents a novel standardised interface for the applications ,  etc of the services part . The novel standardised API provides a consistent interface, defining communication protocols, ports etc. Full details of the API may be published to allow a multiplicity of applications to be developed for the platform  by multiple developers. This should be contrasted with prior art arrangements where each component of a mobile telecommunications network (such as BTS, BSC\/RNC, SGSN etc) is proprietary and tends to have a unique interface, meaning that a different application must be written for each node of a conventional network.","The applications ,  etc may provide services to users of the telecommunications network by co-operating with other parts of the platform .","The details of the use of each application used by the a user of the mobile telecommunications network is stored in an application context\/container. The Application context contains application names, protocol used to carry such application, their characteristics that are measured\/reported over period of time and some statistical information about these applications (volume, number of users using these applications, etc.).","As shown in , a platform  may be provided at each base station of the mobile network (where it is connected to the radio frequency part of the base station\u2014NodeB  in ), forming an access node . Platform  may also be provided at the RNC (item  in ) where it forms a gateway . The access node  and the gateway  are both configured to communicate directly with the network core  (for example, comprising the SGSN , GGSN  and VAS  (as shown in )). The access node  and gateway  may also be connected to the Internet  for direct Internet access via direct links  and , respectively, such that at least a portion of the core network  is bypassed in the manner described above.","The following are examples of access technologies that can be provided within the access node :","3GPP: GSM\/GPRS, UMTS\/HSPA & LTE","IEEE: 802.11 family & 802.16 family","ITU: DSL, ADSL, VDSL, VDSL2","Allocation of Functions to Platforms","The steps performed when a mobile terminal is activated at a NodeB, at the Femto or at the Access Point (AP) of the network which includes the novel platform  will now be described with reference to . At step A the mobile terminal (UE) is activated within the coverage area of a particular NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP. The access part of the NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP communicates information from the mobile terminal to the platform  associated with the NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP. At step B the platform  then allocates the baseband NodeB, at the Femto or at the AP function and the RNC or BRAS (Broadband Remote Access Server) function either at access node  at the NodeB at the Femto or at the AP site or at the gateway  at the RNC or BRAS site of the network or even from neighbouring nodes that have spare resources to pull. The decision as to whether the RNC or BRAS function is allocated at the platform  of access node  or the gateway node  may be made depending on various criteria, including:\n\n","Upon allocating the baseband NodeB at the Femto or at the AP and the RNC or BRAS function, the NodeB at the Femto or at the AP may allocate the mobile terminal to a particular carrier dedicated to the RNC or BRAS function.","Once the RNC or BRAS function is allocated to either the access node  or the gateway  at step C, other functions performed by the platform  at the access node  (or other access node) and the gateway  (or other gateway) are allocated to the mobile device. All other platform functions may be provided by the platform where the RNC or BRAS function is allocated to the mobile terminal. However, a platform at a different location to that which provides the RNC or BRAS function to the mobile terminal may provide some or all other functions.","At step D the platform which is allocated the RNC or BRAS function is provided with a Common ID message from the core network .","At step E, this message is used by the platform  to look up the complete subscription information for the mobile terminal, as well as the resource requirements (QoS) of the services required and negotiated PDP context, this information being provided by the core network .","The subscription information relating to the device that is obtained from the central nodes (e.g, core network)  is used to allocate the other functions at access node  and\/or the gateway  in dependence upon various factors, including:\n\n","As mentioned above, a single mobile terminal may have platform functions\/applications allocated on a plurality of platforms. Generally, when a mobile terminal is near-stationary it is most efficient for its functions\/applications to be served from an access node  (i.e. distributed), whereas mobile terminals with greater mobility (or lower anticipated cell hold times) may be most efficiently served by having fewer or no functions\/applications served from the access Node , and more or all functions\/applications served from a gateway  (i.e. centralised). The assignment of functions\/applications to a mobile terminal between an access node  and a gateway  may also depend upon the characteristics of the service type provided by the application (for example, the average IP session duration, the popularity of the particular application, the average mobility of mobile terminal using the service provided by the application etc).","Traffic management may be performed at the access node , where there is access to real-time radio information from the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile device.","Centralised Radio Resource Management (RRM) may be provided at the gateway , and maintains performance across different access modes , which may have different radio access technologies, frequency bands, coverage etc. The RRM function  of the platform  of the gateway  may obtain information regarding radio traffic management from each access node  to dynamically position subscribers to particular radio technology. This technique may be used to allocate network resources based on the resource availability, application used and user mobility, For example, the traffic management information may be provided by the soft NodeB , Femto or AP of the platform  at the access node . This soft NodeB  obtains radio information relating to the mobile terminal from the radio frequency part of the NodeB to which the mobile terminal is wirelessly connected.","For a particular mobile terminal, functions provided by an access node  and gateway  may be coordinated to work together in an advantageous manner (i.e. a hybrid or distributed arrangement). For example, the gateway  may set operating limits or ranges within which functions performed by the access node  may be performed, without reference to the gateway . When the functions move outside the ranges set, control of those functions may be passed to the gateway .","Further, the access node  and the gateway  may cooperate to advantageously optimise content delivery to a mobile terminal.","The optimisation of content delivery will now be described with reference to  of the drawings. Content may be optimised at gateway  and at an access node . The gateway  may serve multiple access nodes , and my distribute content to those multiple access nodes , for onward transmissions from each of those access nodes  to a mobile terminal via the radio frequency part of NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving that node. Radio quality measurements are reported by the mobile terminal to the access node  at regular intervals, such as 2 millisecond intervals. Radio quality measurement relating to that mobile terminal are transmitted between the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile terminal to the access node  at regular intervals, such as between 2 and 10 millisecond intervals. These radio measurements are received at the soft nodes  and are passed to functions  (e.g., to QoS function  for analysis). These radio frequency measurements from the mobile terminal and the NodeB are reported by the access node  to the gateway  (e.g., to QoS function  of the gateway  for analysis) at regular intervals, such as intervals of between 1 and 10 seconds. The gateway  may receive radio information from multiple access nodes . The radio measurements received by the gateway  may be analysed over a relatively long period, such as between 1 and 2 minutes. The radio quality measurements may be averaged (for example, the arithmetical mean of the radio quality may be determined) over this time period. The transmission of content from the gateway  may then be optimised according to this calculation. Where the content is distributed by the gateway  to a plurality of access nodes , the content distribution may be based on the analysis of the radio quality indicators from all of the access nodes . The analysis may consider the maximum or peak radio performance over the time period of between 1 and 2 minutes.","When the content is received by each access node , the access node  then distributes the content to each mobile terminal. This distribution is optimised based on real-time network mode and mobile terminal specific radio link quality, as determined over a period of, for example, between 1 and 10 milliseconds. That is, content delivered to a mobile terminal that has high radio link quality may be optimised in a different manner to a mobile terminal that had poor radio link quality.","The co-operation between access nodes  and gateways  may further enhance the distribution of content in a manner now to be described with reference to .","When a mobile terminal requests a particular content item, this request is transmitted to the access node  serving that mobile terminal, assuming that this is the first request for this content item to the access node , the access node  passes this request to the gateway  serving the access node . Assuming that this is the first request for this content item from the gateway , the gateway  retrieves the content from a content server. The content is then provided by the content server to the gateway , and from there is distributed to the access node , and onwardly to the requesting mobile terminal. Advantageously, the gateway  maintains a record of content items that are requested frequently. When a content item is determined by the gateway  to be requested frequently, this is stored in a cache  associated with the gateway  (which may be the cache  of the platform ). Subsequent requests for that content item from access nodes  to the gateway  can then be serviced by retrieving the content item from the cache  and distributing the content item to the requesting access node , and thus avoiding the need to request the content from the content server.","The gateway  may be further configured to identify popular content items that are likely to be requested by a large number of access nodes . When it is determined that a content item is popular, the gateway  may push these content items to each of the access nodes  associated therewith (so that this content is hosted at the access node , using Content Delivery Network (CDN) function  of the network functions  of the gateway  and the access node ). The content is then available at the access node  for transmission to any mobile terminal that requests it, without having to retrieve this content from the gateway  or the content server. Advantageously, the distribution of such content items is performed in a manner which takes into account the capacity or the congestion of the link between the mobile terminal and the gateway  and the nature of the content. For example, typically a link between a mobile terminal and the gateway  may experience very little usage and congestion in the early hours of the morning. The content item can be advantageously transmitted in between the gateway  and the access node  at this time, when there is spare capacity. The gateway  may determine whether the content item is suitable for transmission on this basis, for example, by taking into account a number of times that the content item has been requested, the size of the content item and the storage space at the access node . If a content item is relatively small and is time-critical, such as news headlines, then such a content item may be distributed frequently throughout the day, as such content is not suitable for transmission once a day at early hours of the morning, as it becomes quickly out of date.","Relocation of Mobile Terminal","The procedures performed when a mobile terminal moves between cells in the mobile telecommunications network will now be described with reference to . In the conventional manner at step A, when the mobile terminal moves to the edge of its current serving cell, the radio measurements reported from the mobile terminal and the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving that mobile terminal are used by the core network to determine when to perform a handover and to which target cell the handover should be performed. When the best target cell has been identified, handover to that target cell from the serving cell it is performed at B in a conventional manner.","At step C selected platform functions may be relocated from the source access node (that served the old cell) to the destination access node (that serves the new target cell).","When the source and destination access nodes are served by the same gateway, only base station function (such as soft NodeB functions ) may be relocated to the destination access node.","The relocation of functions of the access nodes is performed independently to the radio handover, so for some time after the radio handover, the source access node continues to serve content to the mobile terminal through the destination access node. The routing of data packets for the 3G network between the destination and the source access nodes may be performed using an Iu interface between the RNC or BRAS function  of the destination access node and the SGSN\/GGSN function  of the source access node. Alternatively, the routing of data packets between the destination and the source access nodes can be completed by the SGSN\/GGSN function  of the destination access node connecting directly to functions of the source access node through an IP interface.","After handover has been completed at step B, the access node controlling the mobile terminal may be relocated from the source access node to the destination access node in coordination with the gateway. the standardised handover decisions (mainly based on coverage, quality, power, interference, etc.) for 2G, 3G, LTE & fixed network are used to move the mobile from one node or system to another. However, the platform  introduces new opportunity to make the handover decision based on type or characteristics of the certain application, type of user and the QoS requirements.","The timing of the relocation of access node functions from the source to destination platform may be dependent on the following:\n\n","At step D, optionally, some functions may be reallocated from the access nodes to the gateway. For example, if the destination access node is heavily loaded and is congested, or has a lower capability then the source access node, or the mobile terminal is determined to be very mobile, it may be advantageous to transfer functions to the gateway. Functions are reallocated from the access node to the gateway by, for example, a Serving Radio Network Subsystem (SRNS) relocation between the RNC function  of the access node and the gateway. Alternatively the functions may be reallocated by performing a radio reconfiguration of user connection to the mobile terminal.","The reallocation of functions from an access node to the gateway may be performed at call\/communication sessions set-up. At call\/communication session set-up, further subscriber information may be provided, which may be used by the access node or gateway to be determine whether it would be advantageous to reallocate functions from the access node to the gateway. Reallocation of functions from the access node  to the gateway  may be performed during an active connection when a requirement of the communication sessions has been modified, or where the required resource is not available at the access node .","According to the same principles, applications may be (re)located (or distributed) between access nodes  and for gateways  to provide optimised application delivery\/best use of the communication resources.","As mentioned above, information about each application used by the user at the mobile terminal is stored in an application context. The application context is shared between each access node  and gateway  that control the user connection for that mobile terminal. One of the access nodes \/gateways  may be the \u201cmaster\u201d for that particular application, and that may also be the master of an application specific record in the application context. The application context is advantageously periodically synchronised between the access node  and the gateway .","The application information is the application context specific to a particular mobile terminal, and this is passed between access nodes and gateways during reallocation for a mobile terminal, enabling the application to be seamlessly passed access nodes\/gateways, avoiding impacts to the user experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0245","num":"0283"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},"Tailoring Bandwidth to Application","Radio measurements received from the radio frequency part of the NodeB, the Femto or the AP serving the mobile terminal are passed to the soft nodes  of the platform  (of the access node  or gateway  serving the mobile terminal), and are passed to the network functions  of the platform , which then distributes the measurements to where necessary within the platform . The platform  has access to the subscriber information from the core network, which allows the network functions  to deliver data traffic in a manner that is optimised for radio conditions as indicated by the radio measurements. The data traffic may also be optimised according to the subscription of the user of the mobile terminal available radio resource, mobile terminal capability, and\/or for the class of the terminal (e.g., access technologies used). This optimisation allows bandwidth usage to be balanced with customer experience. The subscriber information may include information about the price plan of the user of the mobile terminal. The mobile network operator may track the type of application used by the user, the total data usage of the user, and may differentially target radio resources the highest data value stream of users.","By hosting applications ,  in the services part  of the platform the access node  (or at least the gateway ), the point of the network that is aware of the application being used by the user of the mobile terminal closer in the link between the mobile terminal and the core network to the NodeB serving the mobile terminal. This enables the sharing of network resources to the most appropriate data streams, such as the most profitable data streams. Such awareness of the application to which a request for data transmission relates allows the use of low value data streams, such as peer-to-peer file sharing, to be allocated only limited bandwidth, so that remaining bandwidth can be targeted to particular users. In the uplink, transmission of data can be controlled by the access node  (or gateway ) hosting the application to control data flow appropriately before data is onwardly transmitted towards the core of the network (which was not possible with conventional arrangements).","Application Programming Interface (API)","As mentioned above, a novel API is provided which defines the language that each of the software modules ,  of the platform  use to communicate to coordinate to optimise application delivery to users. The platform  negotiates which each application ,  the specific resource and performance requirements based on the application characteristics, allowing the application to directly communicate the scheduling performance requirements, rather than using a predefined set of quality of service parameters. This negotiation between the platform  and the applications ,  is facilitated by the API.","The API may also facilitate the provision of radio link quality information (e.g., from QoS function ) to applications , .","The API may further enable the platform  to control use of the applications , \u2014e.g., to allow, disallow or adapt the applications.","By way of example, the application  may be a Voice over IP (VoIP) application. The nature of Voice over IP communications is that there is a virtually continuous succession of small data packets in which voice data is communicated. The voice data must be communicated with no or minimal latency in order that a two-way conversation can be performed successfully. The Voice over IP application  is able to compress voice data before transmission using a variety of techniques\/CODECs. The compression techniques\/CODECs may range from a relatively low compression technique, which provides high quality voice reproduction but requires a large bandwidth, to a much higher compression technique which provides reduced voice quality and which requires a much lower bandwidth.","The API is operable to provide details of the application characteristics to the network functions part  of the platform . This makes the network functions part  of the platform aware of the characteristics of the application. In the present example, as the application is a Voice over IP application, the network functions part  may be made aware that the application may tend to transmit continuous successions of small data packets that require transmission with no or low latency. The network function  may then be configured appropriately.","The API may further be operable to allow the network functions part  to communicate radio link quality information to the application . For example, when the network functions part  received information regarding the application characteristics (via the API), it may allocate radio link resources to that application . This allocation of radio link resources may be communicated by the network functions part  to the application  (via the API). The application  may then select an appropriate compression technique\/CODEC in dependence upon the radio link quality available. During a Voice over IP call, the available radio link quality may be communicated regularly from the network functions part  to the application  (via the API) to allow the application  to vary the compression technique\/CODEC used in accordance with changes to the radio link quality.","The network functions part  may control how the applications ,  work (via the API). The network functions part  may allow, disallow or adapt the applications ,  hosted in the services part  of the platform . For example, the network functions part  may require the Voice over IP application  to use a particular compression technique\/CODEC if radio link bandwidth is restricted.","Another example of how the network functions part  may advantageously provide radio link quality information to an application (via the API) is when the application  is a gaming application used by several users. If the radio link quality information received by the application  indicates that bandwidth is restricted, the application  may adapt is communications to the users such that latency of the communications is increased uniformly for all of the users (so that they all experience the same delay), in order that each of the users is provided with the same gaming experience.","In the embodiments described, the devices that connect to the platforms  are mobile devices that connect to the platforms via the radio access network of a mobile\/cellular telecommunications network. It should be appreciated that non-mobile (fixed) devices may be connected to the platforms , for example by a wired or cable connection.","Allocation of Services","The controller is responsible for allocating the service instance for each UE, based on the UE locations and the controller capacity, capability and available resources to host another instance of a service.","For certain low popularity services or where the available serving controller capacity or capability is limited, the service can be hosted from a central controller, or from a neighbouring distributed controller.","For some services\/functions, where the source and destination client applications are in the same geographical region, being served by the same site (e.g., BTS location) or site cluster (e.g., finite number of sites), the access node \/gateway  ensures that the server for the service is located close to both users, and the traffic is routed between the users within the site.","Virus Aware Edge (P100936-GB-PSP)","As mobile terminals become more and more complex and the application environments of the terminals become increasingly open to third party application developers, the barrier to development and spread of high impact viruses\/worms\/DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) applications on devices may diminish.","Such an attack could be used to disrupt a mobile network, by triggering infected devices to perform repetitive tasks at key sites and locations, to cause the great disruption to the network, and with enough devices it may cause the network (or that portion of the network) to collapse.","As discussed above, the platform  allows application environments to move closer to the radio site. This enables more complex functions to be moved to the Radio Access Network and for them to be hosted on the platform . That is, the services part  of the platform  may host applications (e.g.,  and ). The applications may be hosted by a platform  at access node  at the NodeB, or at the Femto or at the AP site, or at the gateway  at the RNC or BRAS site of the network","Also, as devices such as telephones and laptops become increasingly more advanced, additional functionality can be implemented in the application and operating system environment of these devices, allowing the devices to play a greater role in the end-to-end data pipe.","In the embodiment now to be described, the platform , in the services part , hosts the virus detection entity . The virus detection entity  has an associated electronic store (memory) .","The platform  may:\n\n","These and other measurements\/information may be received at the soft nodes  (e.g., eNodeB ) and passed to functions part  (e.g., QoS function ).

An example of the definitions is shown in . In this example, the store  stores a set of definitions which correspond to devices operating correctly, and devices operating in an erroneous manner or abnormal manner. This set includes a plurality of fields (C C, . . . , Cn) for the definitions of a correctly operating device and a plurality of fields (E E, . . . En) for an incorrectly operating terminal. Each field relates to a particular characteristic of the mobile terminals. For example, field C may indicate the range of frequencies with which (i.e. how often) a correctly operating device may attach to the network, and field E may indicate the range of frequencies with which (i.e. how often) an incorrectly operating device may attach to the network. These ranges may not be contiguous. For example, there may be a range of attach frequencies outside the normal correct range (C), but that is not so far removed from the correct range that it can be concluded with certainty that the terminal is operating incorrectly. In such an instance, the measured frequency of attaches may be outside the correct range defined in field C and the erroneous range defined in field E. Other fields, such as C and E may be a range of frequencies with which (i.e. how often) terminals transition from the idle to active state, or any other characteristic related to network control. Similarly, the fields may contain characteristics relating to the operation of the data network or user plane, such as the proportion of traffic of a particular type being transmitted\/requested by a terminal. Further, the fields may include ranges of frequencies with which a correctly operating terminal may send USSD messages, SMS messages etc, and a range of frequencies for such messages that an incorrectly operating terminal would use in order to detect an attack on the service network.","In an alternative arrangement, the store  may only include definition fields relating to either correctly operating mobile terminals or incorrectly operating mobile terminals, and not both.","The definitions may apply to all the mobile terminals registered with the network, in which case only one set of definitions may be required (the set in the primary embodiment including the \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cerroneous\u201d definitions). Alternatively, a plurality of sets definitions may be provided, which are for use with different terminals or groups of terminals. For example, each individual terminal may have its own set of definitions. A particular terminal model may have its own set of definitions. Each mobile terminal type may have its own set of definitions (for example, mobile terminals with an Android operating system may use one set of definitions and mobile terminals with a Windows operating system may have a different set of definitions). A set of definitions may be applied to a collection of mobile terminals in other ways\u2014such as, smart phones that have a contract with unlimited data usage may have a particular set of definitions, whereas smart phones which have a contract where data is paid for per megabyte may have a different set of definitions. Further, mobile terminals running a particular application may have a set of definitions applicable thereto\u2014for example, mobile terminals running a video streaming application may have a particular set of definitions, and mobile terminals running an email application may have a further set of definitions. More than one set of definitions may be applicable to a particular terminal\u2014for example, the terminal running both the video application and an email application.","The virus detection entity  is operable to receive and interpret data from the platform  to allow it to determine which set or sets of definitions are applicable to a particular terminal or group of terminals in respect of which measurements or information are received. For example, the virus detection entity  may be provided with the IMEI of a terminal. If necessary, the virus detection entity  may contact the core  to obtain information about the terminal represented by the IMEI in order to select the appropriate set or sets of definitions to apply to that terminal.","The sets of definitions may generally indicate the type of usage pattern over a predetermined period of time (such as one hour or twenty four hours) that a correctly operating terminal or group of terminals are expected to follow and an incorrectly operating terminal is expected to follow. The definitions may be created by the virus detection entity  based on measurements\/information gathered over a period of time (historical measurements), preferably when the network has been verified by the core  that the network operating correctly (for the \u201ccorrect\u201d definitions). For the incorrect\/\u201cerroneous\u201d definitions, these may be created by the virus detection entity  during intervals when it is determined that the network is not operating correctly. Alternatively, the \u201cerroneous\u201d definitions may be calculated by the virus detection entity , for example derived from the \u201ccorrect\u201d definitions. The sets of definitions may alternatively be provided by a virus detection entity  in another platform at another access node  or gateway node .

One example of this is processing and management of Home Security systems.","When a secure link is required the fixed infrastructure has the deficiency that the line can be severed; it would therefore in some situations be beneficial to use the mobile network as connection resiliency.","The mobile network relies on reception of radio communications between the two parties. This communication link could be severed by use of a jammer.","Jammers are illegal for use by the public, however, but are used by Government agencies to maintain national security. Use of jammers, in these cases, is typically in static locations or follow normal patterns.","The system of  may be used for the support of a Home security service, the principles of which will now be briefly described.","The \u2018Secured Home\u2019 1400 is managed by a Home Security Server  in the Network through both Fixed  and Mobile (wireless)  connections.","Identification that the Network has been Jammed","The probability that connectivity of both the radio and the fixed networks is lost at the same time for a home security system can be made small, as both systems are typically, and in future can be, designed to be independent.","The loss of connectivity of both the fixed and mobile network can be used to determine that there is a high probability that Home security is being compromised. Detection of loss of connectivity in a fixed network is relatively straightforward (e.g., by loss of \u201cheart-beat\u201d transmissions over the medium), and are not described further. Detection of suspicious loss of connectivity in a mobile network is more difficult as, due to variations in radio quality across the network, the quality and availability of connectivity may naturally vary.","As discussed above, the platform  allows application environments to move closer to the radio site. This enables more complex functions to be moved to the Radio Access Network and for them to be hosted on the platform . That is, the services part  of the platform  may host applications (e.g.,  and ). The applications may be hosted by a platform  at access node  at the NodeB, or at the Femto or at the AP site, or at the gateway  at the RNC or BRAS site of the network","Also, as devices such as telephones and laptops become increasingly more advanced, additional functionality can be implemented in the application and operating system environment of these devices, allowing the devices to play a greater role in the end-to-end data pipe.","The platform , in the services part , hosts the home security application . The home security application  has an associated electronic store (memory) .","The platform  may:\n\n","These measurements may be received at the soft nodes  (e.g., eNodeB ) and passed to functions part  (e.g., QoS function ).","The functions part  (e.g., QoS function ) may then pass required parts of this information to the home security application  hosted on the platform .","The home security application  is shown in  provided in the services part  of the platform  of an access node , but could also be provided in the platform  of a gateway .","Briefly, the home security application  records measurements of the interference experienced or dropped call rates on the cell it serves, to determine whether the network performance is diverging outside normal levels; and triggers an alarm to the Home Security Server , which may be located at the network core.","The following network performance metrics can be used by the application  to determine that it is being jammed:\n\n","The application  may capture information on radio and initiate radio procedures to improve statistical network measurements.","Identifying the Location of the Jammer","One advantage of a mobile network is that there are large numbers of devices that are connected through a single base station at any one time; these devices currently provide measurements to the network of the radio conditions they experience, and thereby act as an array of remote sensors. When an interference source is turned on, the power that the Jammer device is transmitting can be measured at a number of locations; using these measurements the network can triangulate to determine the location of the interference source.","When other devices are in calls and these fail, the location of these devices before their call drop can be used in the calculation, along with information on their power budget to determine the interference level that is needed to block this device from accessing the network.","In HSPA and LTE devices can remain in a sub-state of connected mode where they are idle but the location on a Cell or URA area basis is known by the radio network. When the network gauges that there may be an attack in progress the radio network can bring some of these devices back into active state to provide additional network measurements.","Such analysis may be performed by an application at gateway .","Use of other mobile technologies and operators during an attack","If an attack targets purely the uplink, the device may not know that its use of the network is being blocked by a third party. The current normal operating procedure for the device would be to repeat its attempt to access the cell it is currently camped on, and wait for ever extending periods until the network \u201cfault\u201d gets rectified.","It is proposed that these special Security devices would after attempting to access the camped cell and failing; move quickly onto different carriers of the same technology; before shifting to different frequency bands.","In this way the attacker would need to jam the network across a wide range of frequencies and technologies.","In most countries national roaming is prohibited in much of the network, and as such a device cannot just access another network when it falls off coverage of its own operator. In occasions where there is an attack, national roaming can be enabled. If the Home Security Application  indicates that there is a radio problem on this site then the national roaming is permitted.","Actions after Connectivity is Restored","When the Home Security server  restores connectivity to the premises , it initiates a procedure to pull all the buffered information at the sensors and video cameras at the premises  to the network for processing, such that they can be analysed.","An embodiment of the invention, useful for providing home security, will now be described in more detail. However, it should be appreciated that the embodiment is applicable to identify interruption of the radio access network in general. Identifying such interruption is particularly useful in security applications, such as the home security application described above, because it can indicate security has been compromised at a premises. However, it is also often useful to detect interruption of the radio access network for other reasons. For example, a person or organisation may try to interrupt the radio access network to cause general inconvenience to users or to help perpetrate a crime, such as a terrorist attack. Further, the network may be interrupted not by a special jamming device, but by a malfunctioning terminal. For example, a malfunctioning terminal may continuously transmit at very high power which interrupts the service available to other terminals.","As mentioned above, the platform  receives data from the terminals that it serves. This data is made available to the security application . The data may relate to the radio access network performance in the uplink between the terminals and the base station to which the platform  is connected. The network performance in the uplink may be assessed by determining the receive interference (the interference present in signals received from the terminals), the transmit power of the terminals (a high transmit power being an indication of high interference), the cell throughput (for example, the rate at which transmitted data packets are acknowledged as received by each of the terminals, the aggregated cell\/site throughput, the dropped call rate and\/or the H-ARQ rate).","The platform  is operable to communicate with other platforms associated with other base stations. This communication between platforms  may be used to retrieve from the other platforms the data relating to communications between those other platforms and the terminals that they serve.","The data obtained from the terminals may include an indication of the location of the terminals. For example, the location of the terminals may be provided directly by GPS information transmitted from the terminals. The location may also be calculated from other data received from the mobile terminals\u2014for example, by detecting how long it takes for a transmitted data packet to be acknowledged. Various methods of determining the location of mobile terminals in cellular networks are known to those skilled in the art, and any of these may be used. The radio quality information and the location information may be used to build a database which indicates the radio quality of different locations within the cell served by the base station associated with the platform . The radio quality may vary at different times, and this may also be represented in the database.","The information obtained from neighbouring platforms advantageously also includes location\/geographical information relating to the mobile terminals from which the performance data is derived. This allows the controller  to include in the database radio performance measurements for not only its own cell but also for neighbouring cells (and cells further afield). The area served by the cells of respective platforms may overlap, and this provides greater detail about the radio conditions in such an area. Further, one platform or multiple platforms, may provide multiple radio access technologies (e.g., 2G and 3G) in the same geographical area, and this information too is included in the database to provide more detailed radio performance information in such geographical areas.","The radio quality and geographical information from the platform  and the neighbouring platforms is passed to security application  to create the database, which is stored in the store . The application  may aggregate and analyse the radio performance across a geographical area. The database in store  may therefore give an indication of the historic radio quality over a geographical area. The database may indicate the historic radio quality over the geographical area at different times (such as at different times of day). Typically, the radio quality may follow a similar pattern over a particular time period (such as a day).","At any given time, the radio quality information (e.g., mobile terminal measurement of serving and neighbour cells, Network measurements of mobile terminals) currently being obtained from terminals served by the platform  may be passed to the security application  and analysed. The application  compares this current radio quality data with historical radio quality data taking into account the current time and the location of the mobile terminals making the current measurements. The security application  determines whether the current measurements are significantly different from those that would be expected based on the historical information in the database. If there is a significant difference, then this is an indication that an interruption of radio access network may be occurring.","The store  may also store details of radio quality patterns that indicate that an interruption is occurring, such as deliberate jamming of the radio access network (or part thereof). These criteria may be pre-stored in the store  and may be based on known interruption\/jamming patterns, and not based on the historical data mentioned above. The security application  is operable to compare the current radio quality measurements with these criteria to determine whether it is likely that interruption or jamming is being attempted.","Comparison by the security application  of the current radio quality measurements with the historical measurement and the interruption\/jamming criteria may be performed, or one other of those comparisons only may be performed.","When the security application  determines that it is likely that interruption or jamming of the radio access network is occurring, the application may then take steps to obtain further information in order to confirm that interruption\/jamming is indeed occurring by performing analysis of the further information. Whether or not this confirming step is performed may depend upon the result of the initial analysis step. Analysis of some radio quality data may indicate a very high probability that interruption\/jamming is occurring, whereas other radio quality data may indicate that there is a small possibility that interruption\/jamming is occurring.","If it is desired to perform the confirming step, then the application  may send commands to terminals served by the platform , for example via the soft eNodeB , to instruct the terminals to provide further performance measurements. These performance measurements may result in the gathering of further types of radio quality data (in addition to the types of radio quality data mentioned above). The terminals may be instructed to transmit the radio quality information of the types mentioned above, but with greater frequency. The application  may also instruct the platform  to trigger a dummy paging procedure which causes mobile terminals that are in the idle\/inactive state to move to the active\/connected state, so that radio quality information may be obtained from those terminals. Such a dummy paging procedure may \u201ctrick\u201d the terminals into expecting that a call or data session is to take place.","The application  may instruct terminals to provide performance measurements at their geographical location. For example, the terminals may be instructed to gather the information about the radio conditions at the geographical location similar to information that may be collected to determine whether to perform a handover to a different cell. This data is then transmitted to the platform  for analysis by the application .","The application  may contact further platforms  to obtain radio performance data from these platforms as part of the interruption\/jamming confirmation step, so that the radio quality is known over a larger geographical area.","The security application  may also instruct neighbouring platforms to acquire additional radio quality information like that mentioned above, for the terminals registered with those other platforms.","The additional information obtained by the confirmation step may be used to perform a further analysis so that the presence of an interruption\/jamming source can be verified with greater accuracy.","The gathering of additional information in the confirmation step may optionally be performed without the initial analysis step.","If it is determined by the application  that interruption\/jamming is occurring (whether using the confirmation step in addition to the initial analysis or not), then appropriate steps may be taken.","The application  is operable to interpret the radio quality data to determine the location of the interruption\/jamming source.","The application  may use the information provided about the geographical location of each of the mobile terminals for which it has radio quality data to determine which mobile terminals are in the location where the source of the interruption\/jamming is determined to be.","If the source of the interference\/jamming is determined to be in a location that is served by a different platform to the platform  which hosts the security application , then the data relating to the interruption\/jamming may be passed to the appropriate platform for processing by an associated security application on that platform.","The application  may instruct the platform , for example by soft eNodeB , to instruct the mobile terminals in the location that is the source of the interruption\/jamming to operate in a predetermined manner for a period of time.","The instruction to the terminal may be to reduce the data rate used, to limit the maximum transmit power, to adopt a predefined scheduling pattern, and\/or to set predetermined times and durations during which the terminal must not transmit or receive.","During the period of time when the identified terminals are operating in a manner specified by the application , diagnostic activities may be performed. Because the terminals in the location of the interruption\/jamming are operating in a predefined manner, the application  can calculate what radio quality measurements should be received during the period. If radio quality measurements actually received differ considerably from the expected results, then this is a further indication that interruption\/jamming is occurring.","The analysis performed by the security application  may identify a particular terminal or group of terminals that are likely to be the source of the interruption\/jamming. The security application  may then instruct the identified terminal (or terminals) to operate in a predetermined manner like that mentioned above for a predetermined time during which diagnostics can be performed to confirm whether or not that terminal (or terminals) are indeed the source of the interruption\/jamming.","If a particular terminal (or terminals) is identified as being the source (or likely source) of the interruption\/jamming, then details of that terminal may be put on a network performance \u201cblacklist\u201d. The details may be the IMSI and\/or the IMSI or a combination of these. The security application  may instruct that the service to the terminals included on the blacklist is restricted, or that no service is provided at all. The security application  may further notify the network operator or customer service function of the identity of the interrupting\/jamming terminal (or terminals) and its (or their) location. The network operator may restrict or stop services provided to the terminal. For example the terminal may be restricted to SMS messaging only.","The security application  may notify the terminal that is the source of the interrupting\/jamming by any suitable mechanism, such as SMS, email, that its services being restricted and\/or that it is a source of interruption\/jamming.","The interruption\/jamming source may be a terminal registered with the network\u2014for example that has been modified in an authorised manner or that is malfunctioning. Alternatively, the source of interruption\/jamming may be a device that is not registered with the network but which, nevertheless, affects the network operation.","If the interrupting\/jamming source is not a terminal that is registered with the network, then the security application  triggers an alarm to indicate that the source of the degraded network performance is not a terminal registered with the network. A different alarm may be triggered if the source of the interrupting\/jamming is a terminal registered with a network.","The alarm triggered may have a criticality dependent upon the size of the impacted geographical region, as determined by the analysis performed by the security application . The criticality of the alarm may be dependent upon the assessed impact by the application  to the network performance. The criticality of the alarm may additionally or alternatively be dependent upon the predicted number of terminals that may be impacted by the interrupting\/jamming, as determined by the application .","The alarm may instruct a network function part  of the platform  to modify the cell reselection and\/or handover criteria used by the mobile terminals served by the platform  to change the mobility and selection processes so that the terminals are more likely to move to a radio access technology or frequency layer that is unaffected or less affected by the interruption\/jamming. The cell reselection criteria may be modified by sending system information to the terminals.","Terminals may be configured to automatically change reselection parameters to a different radio access technology or frequency layer, or network operator, if the terminal cannot use the network.","As mentioned above, movement between network operators in the home country of a mobile terminal (national roaming) is not normally permitted. This restriction may be temporally removed when interruption\/jamming is detected.","The detection of interruption\/jamming discussed above has many applications. It is useful for performing network diagnostics and for identifying modified or malfunctioning terminals.","It is also useful, as discussed above, in security applications, where the security of a premises  (or other entity) is monitored by a device (such as a camera) which transmits data (such as images) to a home security server  via the cellular (wireless) network connection  and\/or a fixed (wired) network connection . If it is detected that interruption\/jamming is occurring at the secured location , then an alert may be given to security personnel so that the secured premises  can be visited and checked for a security breach. If it is detected that there is interruption\/jamming of the radio access network, the status of the fixed network  at the secured premises  may also be checked. If the fixed network  is operating correctly, it may be sufficient to review the security data provided via that network to verify whether or not a security breach is indeed occurring, without requiring to visit the secured premises . However, if the fixed network  at the secured premises  is also detected to be non-operational, then this is an indication that security breach is very likely to have occurred, making a visit from security personnel more urgent. The security application  may be provided with data relating to the status of a fixed network  by the home security server  (e.g., by a fixed (wired) connection), in addition to the radio quality information received from the base stations served by the platform  on which the security application  is hosted.","Dynamic Radio Resource Management (P100934-GB-PSP)","According to network statistics, utilisation in the \u201cBusy Hour\u201d (BH) is considerably higher than at other times of the day, which means that access nodes are over-dimensioned during a good part of the day to make sure that enough resources are available to handle the BH traffic.","Further, different access nodes are likely to experience the BH at different times, which indicates that it should be possible to share resources between different access nodes to make the best use of overall network resources.","A more efficient resource utilisation would allow the reduction of carbon footprint and achieve savings.","In the known implementation of the Access Network architecture there is no intelligence at the access edge (base station) to allow monitoring of local resources and a more dynamic allocation.","The novel architecture described above provides additional intelligence at the access edge and allows real-time monitoring of radio resource utilisation and radio resource sharing between different Access Nodes\/Gateways. This enables:\n\n","As discussed above, a nodeB or Femto can be considered to comprise two main parts; a radio frequency part and a baseband part. The radio frequency part may handle the transmission of radio frequency signals between the antenna of the nodeB or Femto and the mobile terminal, and for converting radio frequency signals into digital baseband signals (and vice versa). The baseband part may be responsible for controlling and managing the transmission of the baseband signals to other components of the mobile telecommunications network.","The platform  communicates with the radio frequency (RF) part of a base station, such as a NodeB . The soft nodes  of the platform  comprise components such as a soft NodeB , soft BTS , soft eNodeB  and soft RNC  and soft SGSN\/GGSN . The soft nodeB  provides functions equivalent to the baseband part of a conventional NodeB in a 3G telecommunications network. The soft BTS  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions of a BTS in a conventional 2G mobile telecommunications network. The soft enodeB  provides baseband functions equivalent to the baseband functions provided by a conventional enodeB in a 4G mobile telecommunications network. The platform  may therefore communicate with the radio frequency part of a 2G, 3G or 4G base station and provide appropriate baseband services for 2G, 3G or 4G technologies (or indeed for other technologies). A 3G mobile terminal that wishes to obtain telecommunication services from the mobile telecommunications networks connects wirelessly to the radio frequency part of a NodeB. Baseband functions may be provided either by a baseband part of the conventional NodeB or by the soft NodeB  forming an element of the soft node part of the platform . For example, the soft NodeB  may receive radio measurements from the radio frequency part of the NodeB to which it is connected, and may provide these radio measurements to other elements of the platform .","In this embodiment, the soft nodes  provide baseband resources (and the capability to manage these resources according to a set of rules), rather than the baseband parts of conventional base stations. The base stations provide radio frequency connections between the soft nodes  and the terminals.","The baseband resources include those provided by soft BTS  (2G), soft NodeB  (3G) and soft NodeB  (4G), referred to as the BaseBand Unit (BBU).","By enabling a more effective use of our radio resources energy savings may be realised, CO2 emissions may be decreased and over-dimensioning of access network resources may be prevented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0365","num":"0441"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0366","num":"0442"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},"The radio components of the architecture include the Access Node (AN)  and Gateway  which in turn contains a list of new capabilities with added intelligence.","A pool of baseband resources provided by soft nodes  from each of the connected Access Nodes  are made available in the Gateway . The Gateway  allows Access Nodes  to make use of this pool of resources in periods of low utilisation. This in turn allows switching off the baseband resources in selected Access Nodes, keeping only the RF part of the associated base station switched-on, with the consequent reduction in energy consumption. It is also possible to share baseband resources between different access nodes , without supervision of the gateway .","The embodiment may be implemented in the network architecture as follows:\n\n","In the above examples, the radio load is monitored, although other efficiency characteristics may alternatively or additionally be monitored.","The decision to activate\/de-activate local BBU or share external BBUs can be made at the Gateway  or at a Self Organised Network.","To recap, the access nodes  each include a platform . Each platform  includes a soft nodes part  which provides a baseband part that is used in conjunction with a radio frequency part of the base station associated with the access node  in order to provide cellular telecommunication services to terminals registered with the access node . The baseband part may perform a plurality of baseband functions.","The platform , for example by means of an application hosted by the services part  of the platform, is operable to determine at least one efficiency characteristic of the baseband part, and preferably determines an efficiency characteristic of each baseband function.","Such an efficiency characteristic may be the level of utilisation of 2G, 3G or 4 G communication capacity (load), as described above. 2 G communication, 3 G communication and 4 G communication may be considered to be respective baseband functions, for example. Additionally, or alternatively, the efficiency characteristic may be power consumption, bandwidth, radio outage, hardware resilience, heat production, power source type, radio spectrum efficiency, number of supported terminals, number of connected terminals or the location of the terminals, for the baseband part or for each of the baseband functions of the baseband part.","According to a feature of the embodiment, baseband parts\/functions may be shared between the different access nodes .","By way of a first example, if the efficiency characteristics of a baseband function indicate that it is operating inefficiently, then a decision may be made to shut down that baseband function and to instead use another platform  to provide that baseband function. In this way, the radio frequency part associated with the access node  does not have baseband functions provided by the associated access node , but rather by a different access node. For example, if one determined efficiency characteristic of a baseband function is the load or utilisation in 3G and another determined efficiency characteristic is the power consumption, a decision may be made to shut down the baseband function if it is determined that the load\/usage is below a threshold and the power consumption is above a threshold. Such a baseband function is inefficient because it has a low usage level and consumes a relatively large amount of power.","Each platform  shares the efficiency characteristics of its baseband functions with other platforms . This allows an informed decision to be made as to which other platforms  might be able to share one or more of their baseband functions with another platform in an efficient manner. The efficiency characteristics are transmitted between respective platforms . If a platform determines that one of its baseband functions has efficiency characteristics indicating that it is inefficient, then the efficiency characteristics corresponding baseband functions of other platforms  are compared. If the efficiency characteristics of one of the other platform  is such that the other platform can provide the baseband function more efficiently (and the communication utilisation\/load efficiency characteristic indicates that there is sufficient capacity), the baseband function of the platform  is disabled temporarily and instead requests for such baseband functionality are routed to the appropriate platform  that can provide the baseband function more efficiently.","Each platform is operable to receive such requests for sharing its baseband functions. The platform , on receipt of such a request, may verify from its efficiency characteristics that it does have the capacity to provide the requested baseband functions. If the platform  determines that it does not have the capability to provide the functions, then it may reject their request.","If the communication utilisation\/load efficiency characteristic of a platform  indicates that the platform  is being very heavily used and is at or near its maximum utilisation\/load, then the platform  may request that another platform provides baseband functions so that the handling of the communications may be shared between the platforms .","Respective access node platforms  may communicate efficiency characteristic data between themselves and may organise the sharing of baseband functions between themselves. In an alternative arrangement, a gateway node  platform  may receive efficiency characteristics from the platforms  of a plurality of access nodes , and may use these efficiency characteristics to determine which baseband functions of which platforms should be disabled and which baseband functions of the platforms should be shared. The platform  of the gateway node  instructs the relevant platforms  of the access nodes  to disable or share their baseband functions as appropriate.","Thus, the control of baseband functions can be performed in a distributed manner (by cooperation between the platform  of access nodes , or centrally, by the platform  of a gateway node .","If the platform  controls the allocation of communication resources within its baseband part between different radio access technologies, such as 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) technologies. The platform  may select\/disable a radio access technology. The platform  may reconfigure the baseband part controlling a specific spectrum allocation so that a different radio access technology is provided on that spectrum. Such actions may be taken in response to a decision being made to disable the baseband function of a platform  corresponding to a particular radio access technology.","The flow chart of  shows the steps taken to control efficient use of baseband resources in accordance with the embodiment.","For the sake of simplicity, the procedure of  is only concerned with communication utilisation level (load), but the principles could equally be applied to other of the efficiency characteristics described above. The procedure of  is performed by each platform , for example by an application hosted in the services part  of that platform .","At step A the load is monitored on a platform  (monitoring platform). This load may be the utilisation of a particular radio access technology (2G, 3G, 4G, etc).","At step B it is determined whether the load is below a low utilisation threshold.","If at step B it is determined that the load is below the low utilisation threshold, this indicates inefficient use of the relevant baseband function. The baseband function may be consuming power but only providing minimal radio resources. When this occurs, at step C, it is determined whether another platform  may be able to provide a corresponding baseband function.","If at step C it is determined that another platform  (assisting platform) cannot provide a corresponding baseband function, then at step D admission\/congestion control characteristics of the monitoring platform  may be adjusted so that greater use is likely to be made of the baseband function.","On the other hand, if at step C it is determined that another platform  (assisting platform) can provide the baseband function, then at step E the monitoring platform  arranges for the baseband function of the assisting platform  to provide the baseband function. At step F the monitoring platform  disables the baseband function and instead routes requests for the baseband function to the assisting platform .","After a baseband function is deactivated by the monitoring platform , the monitoring platform  may continue to monitor the load, and if this increases above the low usage threshold, the monitoring platform  may reactivate the baseband function and cease using the baseband function of the assisting platform .","Returning to step B, if at this step it is instead determined that the load is not below the low load threshold, step G is performed.","At step G it is determined if the load exceeds a high load threshold.","If at step G it is determined that the load does not exceed the high usage threshold, then it can be concluded that the load is within a normal range, so that the baseband function is operating efficiently. The procedure then returns to step A.","On the other hand, if at step G it is determined that the load exceeds a high usage threshold, then the procedure next performs step C. At step C it is determined whether any other platform (assisting platform)  can provide assistance with the baseband function. In this instance, the purpose of identifying a suitable assisting platform  is not to improve efficiency by disabling an underused baseband function in the monitoring platform  but is to improve service by maintaining the baseband function of the monitoring platform  whilst obtaining assistance in performing that baseband function from an assisting platform  due to the high usage of that baseband function at the monitoring platform .","If at step C it is determined that an assisting platform  cannot assist with the baseband function, then admission\/congestion control is performed at step D. In this instance, because the load is high, the assignment\/congestion control may take action that tends to reduce the load.","On the other hand, if at step C it is determined that a assisting platform  can provide the baseband function, then at step E the baseband function of the assisting platform  is used to assist in providing the baseband function for terminals registered with the monitoring platform.","After step E is performed in this circumstance, the monitoring platform  then uses the baseband function of the monitoring platform  and also the assisting platform  to provide a better service under the high load conditions.","After a baseband function is assisted by the assisting platform , the monitoring platform  may continue to monitor the load, and if this decreases below the high usage threshold, the monitoring platform  may cease using the baseband function of the assisting platform .","Smart Control (P100941-GB-PSP)","Mobile terminals are becoming increasingly common. In many developed countries nearly all adults carry with them and use a mobile terminal. Further, it is increasingly common to incorporate mobile terminals within other devices, such as vehicles and portable computers.","Information obtained from the mobile terminals or network measurements of mobile terminal transmissions allows their location, speed, direction of travel to be ascertained as well determining whether they are indoors\/outdoors and predicting future device density; these can be used in conjunction with customer information known by the network (e.g., subscription type, terminal type, ARPU, demographics, historic usage characteristics) for controlling external resources, such as street furniture, including street lights, display signs and CCTV cameras\u2014because, the presence of specific mobile terminals at a particular location is indicative of the presence of a person (and possibly an associated device) at the location. This potentially allows street furniture to be controlled in dependence upon the presence of a mobile terminal at a particular location.","There is a drive to improve energy efficiency and to decrease COemissions. The challenge to meet the COemission reduction target of 10 to 20% by 2020 may be difficult to meet without considerable changes in the way that energy is used. Currently, street lights are switched off only during the daylight, and are turned back on again (at maximum capacity of the illumination) during the hours of darkness regardless of the needs\/usefulness of the street lights. For example, in some areas during the late night or early hours of the morning, there may be no, or very few, people or vehicles using the illuminated area, and so street lighting is not required. A more dynamic energy management would allow the realisation of energy savings, decreasing COemissions and preventing over-dimensioning the power stations for winter\/night use.","In a conventional mobile telecommunications network, it is not practical to control external resources (such as street lights) based on information about the location of users of mobile terminals. In a conventional telecommunications network, access measurement data relating to individual mobile terminals is not available to the service environment without specific reporting from clients in terminals.","The novel platform  allows application environments to move closer to the network edge\/radio site\/base station, and also allows a proper interaction between applications and the network layers\/functions, due to the open APIs. This enables more complex functions to be moved closer to the network edge.","As shown in , in this embodiment a new application  is introduced into the services\/application\/network environment  of access node  platform, to monitor the speed and direction of mobile device(s)  and , to control street light  as well as street signs\/panels  according to the mobile device locations, densities and velocity.","The attained information may be used by the new application  in real time to control the:\n\n","Generally speaking, the radio measurements performed by the platform  and the moving devices ,  are used by the application  to build an underlying trend of control such that a moving vehicle  can active\/illuminate street light(s)  based on the device  speed and direction.

The application  on the platform  controls street lights  in the vicinity of the platform . The application  receives information relating to the mobile terminals served by the platform  from the network functions part  of the platform . The open API allows interaction between the application  and the network layers. For example, the application  may be provided with information about the location of each of the mobile terminals served by the platform . The application  may include a street map and may identify the position of the mobile terminals on the street map. The application  also includes details of the fixed locations of the street lights. The application  then detects which street lights require illumination based on the presence or absence of mobile terminals in the area illuminated by each street light. Control of the street lights (or other external resource) can be performed by the application  by any suitable mechanism. For example, the application  may use the base station function , ,  of the platform  to communication with the street light (or other external resource) by wireless communication via a base station (e.g., NodeB or femto). The street light (or other external resource) may be provided with a wireless receiver to receive such communications.","In addition to the application  of the platform  being aware of the location of mobile devices served by the platform  on which the application  is hosted, the application  may also be made aware of information regarding mobile devices that are served by other platforms , by signalling between the platforms.","If the location of a mobile terminal is known at two spaced apart time intervals, this information can be used to calculate the speed and direction of the terminal\u2014and this may be performed by SON (Self Organising Network) . This information from the SON  may be passed to the network functions part  of the platform , together with radio measurement data, cell load data, interference data etc. The network functions part  of the platform  may include a radio access network analyser\/prediction engine . This may predict future movement and speed of a mobile device based on historical location, speed and direction information.","An application scheduler and charging engine  may also be provided in the network functions part  of the platform  to schedule the transmission of information to the application  and to provide information that allows charging for provision of this information as appropriate. For example, a local authority responsible for street lighting may be charged for providing this information.","The information relating to mobile terminals that is collected by the platform may, as discussed above, be information which indicates the location of each mobile terminal. As mentioned above, if the location of a mobile terminal is measured at two spaced apart time intervals it is possible to determine the speed and direction (velocity) of the mobile terminals. The information about the mobile terminals may further include subscription information, the terminal type and the content and application that the terminals regularly use.","As mentioned above, mobile terminals have an idle state and an active\/connected state. When a mobile terminal is in the idle state, it may be difficult or impossible to determine its location. The platform  may therefore be operable to instruct selected mobile terminals to move from the idle to the active\/connected state. This advantageously may allow their location to be determined. A terminal that is in the idle state may be moved to the active\/connected state periodically so that its location may be determined periodically. This may be done to all or a selected proportion of the mobile terminals served by the platform . Movement of a mobile terminal from the idle to the active\/connected state may be performed through modification of network measurement parameters, for example, the measurement period. Alternatively, this may be performed by transmitting dummy paging messages to a paging group. Further alternatively, this may be performed by modification of cell identification parameters, for example location area identifier, routing area identifier or tracking area identifier. These techniques may also be used to in combination.","The location data of the mobile devices may be used to determine the density of mobile terminals at a particular location. For example, the number of mobile terminals in a particular street may be determined. The street lights (or other external resource) may be operated in dependence upon this density. For example, if the mobile terminal density in the street is very low, then the street lights in that street may be instructed by the application  to be extinguished. The platform  may further be operable to predict the future density of mobile terminals at a particular location, and to provide this information to application  for controlling street lights or other external resources based on the predicted mobile terminal density.","The platform  may further be operable to obtain information about selected characteristics associated with mobile terminals, such as the average ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), terminal price etc.","The platform  may further be operable to assess the future location of the mobile terminals.","The analysis performed by the platform  may be directed to a specific mobile terminal or selected mobile terminals.","The platform  may communicate with the external resource to provide statistical or analytical information to the external device. The external resources are known to the platform . The platform  may retrieve profile information specific to an external resource, and may filter or select relevant mobile terminal groups that meet criteria related to the specific profile information of the external resource. Using the location and other information of the mobile terminals served by the platform , the application  is operable to modify the operation characteristics of external resources. In the example given above of the external resource being street lights, the modified operation characteristic may include powering up or powering down the street lights or groups of street lights. Other external resources may be powered up or powered down by the application .","In a further example, the application  may modify the output characteristics of an electronic device. For example, the electronic device may be a street sign with an electronic display. The text size of this display may be changed. For example, if it is determined that a mobile terminal approaching the sign is travelling at inappropriately high speed (likely to be a fast travelling vehicle) then the text size of a street sign may be increased so that the user can read the street sign despite their high speed. The message display by the street sign may also be modified. In the example of the inappropriately fast vehicle, the street sign may display enlarged text the message \u201cslow down\u201d.","The application  may push new content to be displayed by the electronic device. For example if the electronic device is an advertising a display, an advertisement targeted at a particular mobile terminal or group of mobile terminals may be displayed. Information about the preferences of a mobile terminal user may be obtained from the core network by the platform . For example, if it is known to the core network that the user frequents a particular fast food restaurant, and the mobile terminal is approaching an outlet of that fast food restaurant, an appropriate advertisement may be displayed.","The application  may instruct the external resource to move to a new location. For example, the external resource may be a street cleaner or neighbourhood security patrol. If it is detected that there is a low density of mobile terminals at the current position of the external resource, and a high density of mobile terminals at a different location, then the street cleaner or neighbourhood security patrol may be instructed to move to the location with a higher density of mobile terminals as it is more likely that their services may be required.","The platform  may further be operable to instruct the external resource to alter its physical direction to focus on a specific geographic area or space. For example, the external resource may be a security camera or other monitoring apparatus, and the area monitored may be varied in dependence upon the location, density etc of mobile terminals.","An example of the processes performed at the platform  may now be given with reference to the flow chart of .","At step A the soft nodes part  of the platform  collects information from the mobile terminals served by the platform . This information includes signal strength measurements from base stations, time advance information, etc. The information may also include the time between a particular packet of data being sent to a mobile terminal and the acknowledgement of receipt of that packet from the terminal. The information may also include information such as GPS data from the mobile terminals.","At step B the platform  calculates the location of the mobile terminals served by the platform. This can be done using the information collected at step A. If necessary to calculate the location of a mobile terminal, that mobile terminal may be instructed to move from the idle communication state to the active\/connected communication state by one of the mechanisms mentioned above. When the mobile terminal is in the active\/connected communication state, the time that it takes for a particular packet of data to be sent and acknowledged can be determined, and this may be used to estimate the location of the mobile terminal.","At step C the platform may obtain subscriber data for the terminals served by the platform from the core network (or from a store within the platform  if this information has previously been obtained). This information may include the terminal type, ARPU, etc. For example, it may be indicated whether the terminal is a hand held mobile device, a terminal fixed to a vehicle or a terminal forming part of a portable computer.","At step D the speed, density and direction of travel of terminal served by the platform are calculated. If the location of a particular terminal is calculated at two spaced apart time intervals, then the speed and direction of travel can be calculated. If the location of each terminal (or a selection of the terminals) served by the platform  can be detected, then the density of mobile terminals at particular locations served by the platform  can be calculated.","At step E the platform may predict the future speed, density and direction of travel of terminals served by the platform.","At step F the application hosted by the platform  may control the external resource using the information connected to a calculated in steps A to E.","Mobile CCTV (P100939-GB-PSP)","Increasingly we live in a surveillance society where our safety is being monitored by the government through CCTV. In some deployments the cameras can be accessed in real time; in others the video is stored for use later in determining what happened or what caused an event.","This analysis after the event is useful for learning lessons and to try to stop a situation happening again by introducing safeguards\/guidelines; but it does not stop the situation happening in the first place. For this to happen all the information recorded needs to be analysed in real time; but when a CCTV camera is mobile; the information needs to be transmitted over a radio network.","If a mobile operator were to support this service from the buses in London: if each camera captures video at 512 kbps, each bus has 4 cameras; and there are approximately 7000 buses; which would mean that the mobile network would need to carry 14 Gbps of data for this service alone. If an operator has approximately 2000 cells in the area it would equate to 7 Mbps per cell. However, buses congregate in areas, e.g., bus stations or central locations, which would create much high congestion in areas of the network potentially impacting the experience of other network users.","This embodiment introduces functionality into the services\/application environment  of the platform  which enables the radio resources to be used more effectively. The new application controls when and where the recorded material is sent to the network, and what bandwidth should be used to transfer the information. Although the embodiment mainly refers to the transmission of video data, it should be appreciated that the invention is generally applicable to optimising the transmission of data.","Some examples will now be briefly described.","Infrared","The new application instructs the camera to periodically take images using infrared to understand whether there are any new heat sources within the picture; and these images are passed to the network for analysis.","Adaptation of Content","The content of the video can be analysed in the services\/application environment  at the platform; and if it is determined that there is risk then the quality of the images are increased, e.g., moving from IR to Visible light. If it is determined to be a lower risk then the quality is decreased.","The adaptation of the content may take into account cell specific information on load and information on the quality of the radio link between the mobile device and the network.","Storage at the Device","The camera stores the captured images at a high quality. If the application at the platform  determines there has been a change to a higher perceived risk, the application requests the camera send a higher quality version of the last minutes of content for further analysis.","Reference Library","When the perspective of the CCTV is fixed, the picture that the camera detects may vary dramatically dependent purely based on the lighting conditions, e.g., as a bus moves between areas in sunlight to areas of shade; to times when internal lighting provides the only luminance. The application at the platform  can understand this variance and indicate that the image is within normal error margins of one of reference images. When the application selects which images to return to the network, it selects the images which differ the most from the reference.","The use of face recognition information may be used by the application to determine which images are best to return to the network; if there is a big variation from the reference but no facial recognition was possible then this can be treated as a trigger to raise the risk, and therefore the application may recall higher quality information from the camera for analysis.","As discussed above, the platform  allows application environments to move closer to the radio site. This enables more complex functions to be moved to the Radio Access Network and for them to be hosted on the platform . That is, the services part  of the platform  may host applications (e.g.,  and ). The applications may be hosted by a platform  at access node  at the NodeB or at the Femto, or at the AP site or at the gateway  at the RNC or BRAS site of the network","Also, as devices such as telephones and laptops become increasingly more advanced, additional functionality can be implemented in the application and operating system environment of these devices, allowing the devices to play a greater role in the end-to-end data pipe.","The platform , in the services part , hosts data receiving and forwarding application  (). The data receiving and forwarding application  has an associated electronic store (memory ). The data receiving and forwarding application  forwards data to a data analyser .","The platform :\n\n","These measurements may be received at the soft nodes  (e.g., eNodeB ) and passed to functions part  (e.g., QoS function ).","The functions part  (e.g., QoS function ) may then pass this information to the data receiving and forwarding application  hosted on the platform .","The terminal  includes services part  (application layer) which hosts on-terminal application . The application  controls sensors ,  and  provided on the terminal , and also controls the electronic data store (memory) . A first sensor  may be a camera sensitive to visible light. The second sensor  may be a camera sensitive to infra red radiation. The third sensor  may be a location detection sensor, for example using GPS. Further sensors may be provided in dependence upon the circumstances. Also, any of the aforementioned sensors may be omitted, in dependence upon the circumstances.","The terminal  may be a conventional mobile terminal that is carried by a user and is hand-held. Alternatively, the terminal may be mounted on a vehicle, and so moves when the vehicle moves. Further alternatively, the terminal  may be substantially fixed in position. For example, the terminal  may be mounted on a building or on an item of street furniture such as a lamp post. If the terminal  is fixed, then the sensors may be large items and therefore capable of generally producing higher quality output (for example, generally larger cameras produce higher quality images). Further, if the terminal  is substantially fixed, it can be connected to the mains power supply, and so battery depletion is no longer a concern.","The application  on the platform  controls the on-terminal application  on the terminal . The on-terminal application  controls when outputs from the sensors ,  and  are recorded, and when they are stored in the store .","In general, the sensors ,  and  may measure the environment local to the terminal . The visible light camera  and infra red camera  capture images or sequences of images of the locality of the terminal . The images obtained from the cameras  and  may be used to detect movement. Movement may also be detected by any other suitable form of movement sensor. The cameras  and  may capture variations of lighting in the locality of the terminal . Other sensors for capturing variation in lighting in the locality of the terminal may also be provided. The infra red camera  may capture variations in temperature in the locality of the terminal . Other sensors for measuring temperature may be provided additionally or alternatively to the infra red camera .","If the terminal  is in a fixed position, then the location sensor  may be superfluous, as the location of the terminal  may be provided in a database accessible by the data analyser  and\/or platform .","The data analyser  receives data from various terminals (such as terminal ) and performs analysis of the data. For example, if image data is captured by the terminals, this image data may be analysed automatically by the data analyser , or may be displayed for manual review by an operator. The data analyser  works in a generally conventional way to allow surveillance to be performed.","Providing data to the data analyser  conventionally is problematical when the source of the data provides the data over a wireless network. As discussed above, this would require very significant bandwidth in the wireless network. This is particularly a problem because conventionally the wireless network acts as a bit-pipe and simply passes data (such as CCTV) images via the radio access network and the core network to the data analyser .","The novel platform  allows the data receiving and forwarding application  to be provided close to the radio site\/network edge. The data receiving and forwarding application  allows the control of the mobile terminal , via the on-terminal application , and the intelligent management of data transfer between the terminal  and the platform , and between the platform  and the data analyser  (via the core network or optionally via the off load path\u2014e.g., via direct links ,  to Internet ).","The on-terminal application  of the terminal  controls the transmission of data from the store  via the radio access network to the platform . The data in this store  is obtained from the sensors ,  and  under control of the on-terminal application .","When the data is received from the terminal  by the platform , it is passed to the data receiving and forwarding application . The data receiving and forwarding application  also receives data about the quality of the radio link to the terminal  (for example from the QoS function ) of the network functions part  of the platform . The data receiving and forwarding application  further receives information from the data analyser , such as the available resources of the data analyser . The data receiving and forwarding application  further receives information from the telecommunications network, such as subscription for information relating to the mobile terminal . For example, the terminal  (and other similar terminals) may be administered by an authority which has a subscription with the network operator to provide data from the terminals  to the data analyser . The network may provide to the data receiving and forwarding application  information such as the subscription priority, the charging rate and the associated Service Level Agreement between the network operator and the subscriber. Additionally, the data receiving and forwarding application  may receive information about the status of the store  (such as the spare capacity available).","Based on the various information provided to the data receiving and forwarding application , the application controls  the operation of the on-terminal application  on the terminal . For example, the data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to modify resolution of images transmitted in the data to the platform .","The cameras  and  generally capture images at high resolution. The high resolution images are stored in the store . The on-terminal application  is operable to modify the resolution (or other form) of the images from the store  before they are transmitted.","The data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to adjust the resolution of images transmitted in dependence upon the circumstances. For example, the data receiving and forwarding application  may determine from images previously delivered that there is a significant change to the images captured (indicating significant activity in the region of the terminal ). Also, the data receiving and forwarding application  may include face recognition software which may identify the presence of a known criminal (or other person that it is desired to detect). In response to an event of this type, the data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to transmit higher resolution images than would normally be transmitted. These higher resolution images may of course use greater bandwidth, but this may be justified because the images are likely to be highly relevant.","The data receiving and forwarding application  may also instruct the on-terminal application  to vary the resolution of images transmitted in dependence upon other factors (external resource availability), such as the radio quality\/capacity, spare capacity in the store  and resources of the data analyser . For example, if the radio quality\/capacity is poor, then the on-terminal application  may be instructed to transmit images at a lower resolution.","In addition to instructing a variation of the resolution of the image, the data receiving and forwarding application  may also instruct the on-terminal application  to change the form or format of the images transmitted. For example, the images may be transmitted with a higher or lower level of compression, in dependence upon the circumstances.","The data receiving and forwarding application  may also instruct the on-terminal application  to prioritise data from particular ones of the sensors ,  and . For example, the data receiving and forwarding application  may request that the on-terminal application  transmits images from the visible light camera  during day light hours and from the infra red camera  during night time (or in other special circumstances). The frequency with which data sensors is transmitted may be controlled by the application  sending an appropriate control command to the on-terminal application . The data receiving and forwarding application  may also instruct the on-terminal application  to control how frequently outputs from the sensors ,  and  are stored in the store  of the terminal . The data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to vary the quality and compression of data from the sensors ,  and  stored in the store . As mentioned above, generally the store  may store higher resolution and uncompressed data from the sensors ,  and . This is generally advantageous, even if the on-terminal application  is instructed by the data receiving and forwarding application  to transmit the data in a lower resolution or more compressed form, because, at a later time, it may be determined that such data is significant, and it may then be re-transmitted in a higher resolution, uncompress form for more detailed analysis.","The resolution\/compression of data transmission may also be varied by the data receiving and forwarding application  in dependence upon not just current factors, but also predicted future factors. For example, the congestion in the area of the cell served by the platform  may follow a particular pattern over a 24 hour period. The data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to reduce the resolution\/increase the compression of data at particular times on the basis of predicted congestion.","The on-terminal application  may provide the data receiving and forwarding application  with information about the available capacity of the store  of the terminal . If the store  is becoming full, the data receiving and forwarding application  instruct the on-terminal application  to reduce the resolution\/increase the compression of data from the sensors ,  and  stored in the store .","In addition to controlling the frequency with which the sensors ,  and  capture data and store this in the store , the data receiving and forwarding application  may also control the frequency with which the data is retrieved from the store  and transmitted by the on-terminal application  to the platform . The data receiving and forwarding application  may instruct the on-terminal application  to optimise the data before transmission to the platform . This optimisation may be performed by the on-terminal application  on the basis of information provided by the data receiving and forwarding application , or on the basis of other information available to the on-terminal application , such as radio measurements taken by the terminal .","Another input to the data receiving and forwarding application  is availability of resources on the backhaul connection between the data receiving and forwarding application  and the data analyser . If the data are transmitted through the core network, then the available resources may be less than if the offload path is used.","The data receiving and forwarding application  adjust the resolution\/quality\/compression of data sent to the data analyser  in dependence upon the backhaul quality.","The data receiving and forwarding application  may also adjust the quality\/resolution\/compression of data sent to the data analyser  in dependence upon the resources of the data analyser . For example, if the data analyser has low available processing power or low available memory, then a lower quality\/resolution\/higher compression of data may be implemented by the data receiving and forwarding application  before transmitting that data to the data analyser .","When the application  receives data from the on-terminal application  this is stored in the associated store . The data receiving and forwarding application  is operable to analyse the data to determine how important that data is. For example, the data receiving and forwarding application  may compare captured images to reference images for the location of the terminal . If there is a significant difference between the captured image and reference image, then the captured image may be determined to be important, and therefore it may be more important to deliver this data promptly to the data analyser . The data receiving and forwarding application  may also include facial recognition functionality and may have a database of faces of known criminals or other persons whose location is to be tracked. If the data receiving and forwarding application  determines that a wanted person is present in an image, then it is of high importance that this image is delivered promptly to the data analyser . The application  may detect other patterns, such as vehicle registration marks.","The data receiving and forwarding application  may also examine the data in the store  to determine whether this can be further optimised or subject to further transcoding before transmission to the data analyser .","The data receiving and forwarding application  may receive data from a plurality of terminals  which are served by the platform  (and possibly which are served by other platforms). The data receiving and forwarding application  may aggregate the data from the multiple terminals prior to transmitting this to the data analyser .","As mentioned above, this embodiment makes particular reference to the sensors capturing images. However, it should be appreciated that the invention is not restricted to imaging. The invention is concerned with managing when and how data from a terminal are transmitted. The platform allows data from the terminal to be transmitted in an intelligent manner and in real time but optimises use of network resources.","Evolved Femto Architecture (P100938-GB-PSP)","The current Femto Architecture (e.g., as shown in ) was designed in a manner to maintain the existing architecture of the mobile network whilst removing cost. This cost reduction was achieved by implementing a low power base station on consumer grade hardware.","The challenge this architecture introduces is that the femto architecture is difficult to integrate into the existing telecoms network; handovers between the femto and the operator's macro network are problematic to configure and it is a challenge to maintain quality.","The platform  allows application environments to move closer to the network edge\/radio site. This enables more complex functions to be moved to the network edge\/radio site and for them to be hosted at the site, i.e. within the Radio Access Network.","As discussed above, the platform  allows application environments to move closer to the radio site.

The location data may be calculated from GPS data provided by the terminal , or may be calculated by another suitable mechanism, such as cell triangulation or calculating the time that it takes for a transmitted data packet to be acknowledged by the terminal . Various other location determining the arrangements are known to those skilled in the art that may be suitable for implementation.","As mentioned above, mobile networks such as 2G (GSM), 3G (UMTS) and 4G (LTE) telecommunications networks have an active state of communication with their mobile terminals and an inactive\/idle state of communication with their terminals. When in the active state, as the mobile terminals move between different cells of the network, the communication session is maintained by performing a \u201chandover\u201d operation between the cells. In the inactive\/idle state, as a mobile terminal moves between different cells of the network the mobile terminal performs \u201ccell reselection\u201d to select the most appropriate cell on which to \u201ccamp\u201d in order that the mobile terminal can be paged by the network when mobile terminating data is destined for that mobile terminal.","Conventionally, the mobile terminal or network determines whether a handover\/cell reselection procedure should be triggered in dependence upon measurements of the radio signals of the cells in the region of the mobile terminal. A filter is applied to the signals (either by the network or by the mobile terminal), which calculates an average (mean) value of these signals over a particular time period. This filtered\/average values of the cells are then compared with each other or with a threshold value. In dependence upon these comparisons, cell reselection\/handover related procedures are triggered. This cell reselection\/handover process generally comprises taking radio signal measurements of neighbouring cells and comparing these to each other and to the radio signal of the current cell to determine which cell provides the best signal strength\/quality. Handover\/reselection to the best cell can then occur.","Handover and cell reselection are performed in the same way for APs. It is desirable for mobile terminals to provide continuous service when moving within an SAE\/LTE coverage area and between an SAE\/LTE and a UMTS coverage area\/2G coverage area, and to\/from APs.","In a mobile network operating in accordance with the 3G (UMTS) Standards, a mobile terminal device (UE) has a so-called \u201cRRC (Radio Resource Control) state\u201d which depends on its state of activity. In the respective RRC states different functions for mobility are executed. These functions are described in technical specification 3GPP TS 25.304\/25.331.","For 2G and 3G, a mobile terminal is in active communication when it has a CS (Circuit Switched) connection established.","In 2.5G, GPRS PS (Packet Switched), active communication can be defined as the GPRS Ready state. In 3G UMTS PS, active communication can be defined as the RRC connected mode state that is CELL-DCH.","In 3G UMTS PS, CELL\/URA_PCH and CELL_FACH can be defined as inactive states. In GPRS, the Standby state can be regarded as an inactive state.","Either one or both of the CS and PS active communications may occur in the mobile terminal.","For a 3G mobile terminal, in the active mode the terminal is in the RRC connected mode. The RRC connected mode includes the following states:","CELL_DCH state is characterized by:\n\n","CELL_FACH state is characterized by:\n\n","CELL_PCH state is characterized by:\n\n","URA_PCH state is characterized by:\n\n","In the CELL_DCH state a network-driven handover is performed when necessary, as described in 3GPP TS 25-331, which is incorporated by reference herein. In this state a mobile terminal scans the pilot channels of up to 32 intra-frequency cells neighbouring its current cell. The mobile terminal forms a list of the best cells for possible handover based on the received signal strength and\/or quality (i.e. the error rate in the received signal). The information in this list is passed to the UTRAN RNC on an event-driven basis, e.g., when the signal strength or signal-to-noise ratio of one of the cells exceeds a threshold. The information list is used by a handover algorithm implemented in the UTRAN RNC. The algorithm that determines when handover occurs is not specified in the GSM or UMTS Standards. The algorithms essentially trigger a handover when the mobile terminal provides a measurement of a neighbour cell received signal at the mobile terminal below a predetermined quality received threshold, which typically has a relation to the quality of the received signal from the serving cell (e.g., better quality by some margin).","In the \u201cCELL_FACH\u201d, \u201cCELL_PCH\u201d, \u201cURA_PCH\u201d or \u201cidle mode\u201d the mobile terminal controls its own mobility independently and starts a cell switch (reselection) when a neighbouring cell has a better quality than the current cell, as described in 3GPP TS 25.304, which is incorporated by reference herein. A similar procedure is also used in GSM\/GPRS mobile networks, as described in technical specification 3GPP TS 05.08 (UE-based cell reselection), which is incorporated by reference herein.","In general, a mobile terminal in \u201cidle mode\u201d states and in RRC connected mode (inactive) states \u201cCELL_FACH\u201d, \u201cCELL_PCH\u201d and \u201cURA_PCH\u201d performs periodic measurements of its own as well as of a series of neighbouring cells. Information from the neighbouring cells is broadcast in the system information block 11 (SIB11) or system information block 12 (SIB12) of the broadcast channel (BCH) as described in 3GPP TS 25.304 and 3GPP TS 25.331, which are both incorporated by reference herein.","In order to avoid a cell switch based on short-term changes in the radio field conditions, so-called \u201cfading\u201d, and the subsequent return to the original cell, a UMTS system mainly uses two parameters that are emitted in the Broadcast Channel (BCH) in the system information block 3 (SIB3) or system information block 4 (SIB4). Notably, these are the time interval \u201cTreselection\u201d and the hysteresis value \u201cQhyst\u201d. In order to avoid too fast a switch between cells based on quickly changing network conditions, a switch from the original cell to the neighbouring cell only takes place if the neighbouring cell was better than the original cell by the factor \u201cQhyst\u201d for the time \u201cTreselection\u201d. This behaviour of a mobile end device is described in detail on the technical specification 3GPP TS 25.304. Multiple frequency layers and mobility state determination are provided in a similar manner for LTE\/SAE networks.","If the power and\/or quality of the radio signal received at the mobile terminal  registered with an AP becomes relatively low then the cell reselection process is triggered. In this process the power and\/or quality of the neighbouring base stations (including base station ) is evaluated in the manner described above. If a neighbouring base station provides improved radio quality, then the reselection process can be completed in a conventional manner.","The following parameters used to control the reselection process may now be described in more detail:","Sintersearch","The Sintersearch information element is described in 3GPP TS 25.331 and 3GPP TS 25.304, and is sent in SIB3. Sintersearch controls whether the mobile device  must make measurements of inter-frequency cells while camped on a particular \u201cserving cell\u201d. If the quality of the serving cell is above Sintersearch, then the UE may not measure other inter-frequency cells while camped.","The Sintersearch value is conventionally the same for all base stations (including APs) in a network.","Sintrasearch","The Sintrasearch information element is described in 3GPP TS 25.331 and 3GPP TS 25.304, and is sent in SIB3. Sintrasearch controls whether the mobile terminal  must make measurements of intra-frequency cells while camped. If the quality of the serving cell is above Sintrasearch, then the UE may not measure other intra-frequency cells while camped.","The Sintrasearch value is conventionally the same for all base stations (including APs) in a network.","Quality Measure","The 3GPP TS 25.331, \u201cCell selection and reselection quality measure\u201d information element may be RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) and\/or the ratio Ec\/No (the ratio of the energy per chip, Ec, received by the mobile terminal to the spectral noise power density, No, received by the mobile terminal , with allowance made for non-orthognobility).","Hysteresis 1 (Qhyst1 or Qoffset1)","Qhyst1 (see 3GPP TS 25.331) specifies the hysteresis value to be used by the mobile device  if the Quality Measure is CPICH RSCP. Reselection of a neighbouring cell only takes place if the neighbouring cell is better in coverage than home AP by the factor Qoffset1 for a predetermined time (\u201cTreselection\u201d).","Hysteresis 2 (Qhyst2 or Qoffset 2)","Qhyst2 (see 3GPP TS 25.331) specifies the hysteresis value to be used by the mobile device  if the Quality Measure is CPICH Ec\/Io. Reselection of a neighbouring cell only takes place if the neighbouring cell is better in quality than the home AP20 by the factor Qoffset2 for a predetermined time (\u201cTreselection\u201d).","In accordance with a feature of the embodiment, Sintersearch, Sintrasearch, Qoffset 1 and Qoffset 2, or any other reselection parameter may be varied by the concentrator . These changes are communicated by the concentrator  to the mobile terminals.","The effect of varying these values is as follows: \u2014\n\n","Offset  and  are only used together with the Sintersearch parameter for the interfrequency mobility. The parameters Qoffset 1 and 2 are unchanged for the infrafrequency case. However, the concentrator  may choose to change these parameters to ease the idle mode mobility from the femto cell to neighbouring 3G macro base station on the different carrier in case of high interference.","The concentrator  includes a detector module for measuring RSCP and\/or Ec\/Io of the neighbouring base stations (including macro base stations and other APs) which use the same carrier or a different carrier when the Sintersearch and Sintrasearch parameters so indicated.","The concentrator  is also aware of the RSCP and\/or Ec\/Io between itself and mobile terminal . The concentrator  is therefore able to characterise its RSCP and\/or Ec\/Io with respect to the mobile terminal as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d. The concentrator  is also able to characterise the RSCP and\/or Ec\/Io of the neighbouring base stations on the same carrier and on a different carrier as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d (at the location of the AP). The concentrator  may include software that, in dependence upon the high or low characterization, provides instructions to the mobile terminal  to adjust the parameters Sintersearch, Sintrasearch, Qoffset1 and Qoffset2 (or any other reselection parameter).","The modification of reselection parameters has been described above. Handover parameters may be amended by the concentrator  to vary under what conditions a handover may occur.","In this embodiment, as shown in , the femto architecture is modified such that APs (femtos) connect to the services\/application environment  of the nearest platform  allowing them to be incorporated tighter into the network.","The services\/Application environment  of the platform  can then serve common applications to the mobile device independently of whether it is on the macro  or AP\/femto  cells, providing a more seamless experience across the accesses.","The platform  controls the movement of the mobile devices in a more seamless manner, using the femto site as a capacity layer; as the load information of the femto and macro networks are readily available at one location. When the DSL network used by the femto  becomes congested the mobile device can be pushed to the macro network to maintain user experience.","The services\/application environment  of the platform may include the AP\/femto concentrator . When the mobile device is creating too much interference to a neighbouring femto this can be managed by the femto concentrator  in the platform  as it is likely to also be controlling the adjacent AP\/femto.","When the AP\/femto is powered on it takes measurements of its radio environment to determine whether it can see any macro cells; these would be used with the registered address information to determine the most suitable platform  to use as a AP\/femto concentrator.","Typically the platform  providing these functions to femtos may be provided at an access node . In areas where there is no macro coverage a centralised femto concentrator  can be used, which may be provided at the gateway .","The embodiment may now be described in more detail. As discussed above, the services part  of the platform includes a concentrator , in addition to other applications ,. A platform of this type may be provided at an access node , at a gateway node  or at the base station or at the RNC.","The soft nodes part  of the platform  provides baseband functions. Corresponding radio frequency functions are provided by a macro base station  and one or more access points . The access points  may be connected to the platform  via a DSL connection and a fixed network  as shown in , or may be connected by a different arrangement. The platform  is connected to the core network  by an appropriate backhaul connection.","The access point  is connected to the core network via an IP link (such as the DSL connection) that links the access point  to the platform .","Macro base station  is generally associated with a particular platform in order to provide radio frequency functions for that platform. The relationship between an access point  and the platform  is not necessarily so predetermined. The access point  may potentially be connected to any platform within the network via an appropriate IP link. When the access point  is initiated it measures its radio environment to identify macro cells within its radio coverage area. The access point  obtains identification information from the macro base stations (such as macro base station ), and sends this to the core network  via the IP link. The core network  has a database of the location of each of the macro base stations and also a database of the location of each of the platforms . The core network uses the macro base station information provided by the femto  to determine the most appropriate platform for the access point  to register with. Once the access point  is registered with a platform , radio frequency communications received from mobile terminals such as terminal  are routed to the platform  via the IP link.","If the access point  is unable to identify any macro base station within its radio coverage area, then the access point  may register with the platform provided at a gateway location , rather than an access node location .","The concentrator  of the platform  controls and facilitates communication with one or more access points . The platform  provides a common interface for access points  and macro base stations  to the core network . Communications between the platform  and the core network  are in the same format irrespective of whether they originate from an access point  or a macro base station .","The concentrator  controls each of the access points  registered with the platform  and may control which mobile terminals  are registered with each access point .","The platform  provides service and network functions to mobile terminals  connected to the platform  via the access points . Services may be provided by one or more applications , hosted in the services part  of the platform .","The platform  is aware of whether the mobile terminal  is connected thereto via the macro base station  or the access point . The platform  is configured to provide service to the mobile terminal  irrespective of whether the mobile terminal  communicates via the macro base station  or one or more of the access points .","As discussed above, the platform  receives information relating to the radio conditions for each of the mobile terminals . The radio conditions may be radio conditions experienced by the mobile terminal  communicating with the macro base station  or with the access point . The platform  is also aware of the quality and capacity of the backhaul link to the core network . As discussed above, instead of this conventional backhaul link, data may be selectively offloaded from the core network where appropriate. The quality of this offloaded link is also monitored by the platform .","The platform  is operable to control the handover or reselection of the mobile terminal  between the macro base station  and one or more access points  in dependence upon the radio quality\/communication capacity information.","The platform  may modify the handover parameters and\/or cell reselection parameters for the mobile terminal  (as described above) based on the radio quality measurements received from mobile terminal (via its current link with the macro base station  or access point  with which it is currently registered). By modifying the handover parameters and\/or cell reselection parameters of the mobile terminal , the likelihood that the mobile terminal  hands over to or reselects a different macro base station  or access point  may be increased or decreased. The parameters that may be varied may include the \u201cSintersearch\u201d, \u201cSintrasearch\u201d, \u201cQuality measure\u201d, \u201chysteresis 1\u201d, \u201chysteresis 2\u201d etc discussed above. In this way the concentrator  of the platform  have make it more or less likely that the mobile terminal  moves from a macro base station  to an access point , from an access point  to a macro base station , or between an access points . By varying the parameters significantly, the concentrator  of the platform  can almost certainly cause the mobile terminal  to handover\/reselect.","The handover and\/or cell reselection parameters may be varied in dependence upon the location or speed of the mobile terminal , for example, as determined by the location function . The location or speed information may be used to determine the current or predicted future location of the mobile terminal, and to determine whether there is an appropriate access point  at that location. The handover\/reselection parameters may then be varied to favour handover to or reselection of that access point.","The platform  may also vary the handover parameters and\/or cell reselection parameters in dependence upon other factors, such as the type of subscription that the user of the mobile terminal  has with the network (which subscription information may be obtained by a platform  from the core network ). The parameters may also be varied in dependence upon historic measurements of the quality and reliability of a particular access point (with an access point  that has historically a low quality or low reliability being less favoured by the variation in the parameters, for example). The platform  may also be operable to predict the user experience that the user of the mobile terminal  is likely to receive from the access point  or the macro base station , and may vary the parameters to favour the one of these that may provide the best user experience.","The cell reselection and\/or handover parameters may be modified in dependence upon the service requirement of services and applications , being used by the mobile terminal .","The cell reselection and\/or handover parameters of each access point  may be varied in real time by the platform  so that the network can respond quickly to changes in radio conditions and the other criteria mentioned above.","The platform  may be aware of the location of each of the mobile terminals  that is served by means of the location function . The platform  may be operable to detect when there are no mobile terminals in the coverage area of a particular access point , and may power down the access point in dependence thereon. Likewise, the platform  may detect whether a mobile terminal  is (or is predicted to) enter the radio coverage area of an access point, and may power up\/activate that radio access point  in dependence thereon.","The platform may also control the powering up\/powering down of an access point , the handover\/reselection parameters, or other configuration aspect of an access point  based on detected power or interference at the macro base station  or at mobile terminals connected to the macro base station .","The platform  may reconfigure the spectrum allocation (frequency bands and\/or frequency bandwidth) and the radio access technology (such as GSM, HSPA, or LTE) of the access nodes  in dependence upon the measured location of the mobile terminals in the coverage area of the macro base station , the radio coverage\/quality of the access point  and\/or the capability of the mobile terminals.","The platform  may also be operable to adjust the system information parameters broadcast by the access points  in dependence upon interference measured on the macro base station  and\/or the mobile terminals connected through the macro base station  and\/or the access point .","The platform  may configure the broadcast system information parameters of the macro base station  in dependence upon the measured performance of the access point  within the radio coverage area of the macro base station .
