title: Conditional maximum likelihood estimation of naïve bayes probability models
abstract: A statistical classifier is constructed by estimating Naïve Bayes classifiers such that the conditional likelihood of class given word sequence is maximized. The classifier is constructed using a rational function growth transform implemented for Naïve Bayes classifiers. The estimation method tunes the model parameters jointly for all classes such that the classifier discriminates between the correct class and the incorrect ones for a given training sentence or utterance. Optional parameter smoothing and/or convergence speedup can be used to improve model performance. The classifier can be integrated into a speech utterance classification system or other natural language processing system.

In particular, the present invention relates to training classifiers to classify natural language text.","Speech utterance classification as well as text classification are well-defined problems in a growing trend of providing natural language user interfaces to automated systems. A few applications among many others are call-routing for automated call centers, natural language based help systems, or application interfaces.","For example, suppose a prospective traveler wishes to access a travel information system. Such a traveler provides a spoken or written query such as, \u201cShow me all the flights from Seattle to DC this month.\u201d The travel reservation system then attempts to classify the query into a finite number of possible classes such as flight information, ground transportation information, hotel information, special meal requests, etc. for routing to an appropriate customer service representative.","In another situation, a computerized help desk receives emails and\/or telephone calls from employees such as \u201cHow do I enable voting buttons on my email?\u201d or \u201cMy hard drive died.\u201d Such a computerized help desk classifies the incoming emails and\/or telephone calls into a number of possible classes such as email, operating systems, printer connectivity, web browsing, and remote access problems in order to route the communications to an appropriate technician.","A statistical classification approach (e.g. n-gram, Na\u00efve Bayes, and maximum entropy) to the problem is common and the most successful one used so far since it deals gracefully with the irregularities of natural language and can usually be estimated in a data-driven fashion, without expensive human authoring.","One such state-of-the-art statistical approach is the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier, whereby a sentence or sequence of words is classified as belonging to one of a number of classes. The model relies on parameters whose values need to be estimated from annotated training data in order to assign a probability to a given sequence of words or sentence. Standard methods of estimating Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers include using maximum likelihood techniques, which estimate the model parameters for each class independently.","In the speech utterance classification process, it is possible to use a two-pass system where, in a first pass, speech input is converted to text, such as with a conventional speech recognizer. Then in a second pass, the text is classified into a class or category. However, it is also possible to use a one-pass classification system where input speech is directly classified.","Generally, different approaches (e.g. n-gram, Na\u00efve Bayes, and maximum entropy) are used for one pass and two pass classification systems. Approaches used in one-pass systems can generally also be used in a two-pass system. However, the converse is not true: approaches that are used in a two-pass system do not necessarily work in a one-pass system. The Na\u00efve Bayes approach is generally used for two-pass systems.","An improved method of speech utterances and text classification in automated systems having natural language user interfaces would have significant utility.","The present invention relates to classifying speech and text input received on a natural language interface using a statistical classifier. The statistical classifier is constructed using an algorithm for iteratively estimating Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers such that the conditional likelihood of class given word sequence is maximized. The estimation method tunes the model parameters jointly for all classes such that the classifier discriminates between the correct class and the incorrect ones for a given training sentence or utterance. The method employs a rational function growth transform implemented for Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers. In some embodiments parameter smoothing is used to improve model performance. In other embodiments, a simple modification increases convergence speed (as measured by improvement in likelihood and classification accuracy per number of training iterations) over a straightforward implementation of the present algorithm. In still other embodiment, both smoothing and speed-up are used to improve model performance with faster convergence.","Before describing aspects of the present invention, it may be useful to provide a brief description of a suitable computing system environment  () on which the invention may be implemented. The computing system environment  is only one example of a suitable computing environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the invention. Neither should the computing environment  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary operating environment .","The invention is operational with numerous other general purposes or special purpose computing system environments or configurations.

Computer readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  and includes both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media includes both volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM)  and random access memory (RAM) . A basic input\/output system  (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer , such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM . RAM  typically contains data and\/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and\/or presently being operated on by processing unit .

Note that these components can either be the same as or different from operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data . Operating system , application programs , other program modules , and program data  are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.","A user may enter commands and information into the computer  through input devices such as a keyboard , a microphone  (which also can represent input provided through a telephone), and a pointing device , such as a mouse, trackball or touch pad. Other input devices (not shown) may include a joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit  through a user input interface  that is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port or a universal serial bus (USB).

It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","202","206","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["302","202","302","302","135","110","171","173","304","110","141","171","173"]},"At steps , classifier construction module  receives labeled training data , respectively, from any of the input devices described above as well as from any of the data storage devices described above. Training data  can comprise past queries received through an interface such as the travel information system or computer help desk discussed above. Training data  has been classified in selected classes each having a particular class label. For example, in an experiment performed using an Airline Travel Information System (ATIS), user queries were classified in the following 14 classes: FLIGHT; FARE; GROUND SERVICE; AIRLINE; AIRCRAFT; AIRPORT; FARE BASIS; AIRPORT SERVICE; CITY; FOOD SERVICE; CLASS OF SERVICE; RESTRICTION; DAYS; and FLIGHT STOP. At step , classifier construction module receives unlabeled test data  from any of the input devices or storage devices described above. Unlabeled test data  can comprise past queries received through an interface such as the ATIS system or computer help desk discussed above.","At step , the classes labels, which form a class vocabulary or lexicon, are extracted or identified. In other words, class vocabulary, Y, can be expressed as Y={y, y. . . y} where y, y, . . . , yare classes or class labels, and N is the number of classes. In some embodiments, class labels are obtained from Structured Query Language (SQL) queries that often accompany query sentences. It is noted that SQL is used in modern database architecture to define methods used to create and manipulate relational databases across platforms.","Classifier construction module  can optionally comprise pre-processing module . Pre-processing module  can process natural language data , , for example, by maintaining only high content words. In addition, pre-processing module  can perform word stemming, which is a process of removing morphological variations in words to obtain their root forms. Examples of morphological variations include inflectional changes (such as pluralization, verb tense, etc.) and derivational changes that alter a word's grammatical role (such as adjective versus adverb as in \u201cslow\u201d versus \u201cslowly,\u201d etc.). Pre-processing module  can comprise a word breaker, which identifies individual words in received text. For text in segmented languages such as English, word breaker  can distinguish words from other grammatical features such as commas. For text in unsegmented languages, such as Chinese or Japanese, word breaker  can comprise or be coupled to a parser (not shown) that segments the unsegmented language into words. Optional pre-processing module  processes sentences x, i=1, 2, . . . , T where T is the number of sentences in the training data or set .","In constructing statistical classifier , the conditional probability of a class y, given a sentence x is modeled, which can be expressed with the following equation:\n\nP(y|x),y\u2208Y,x\u2208X,\n\nwhere Y is the vocabulary or set of N classes and X is the set of sentences in the training data . A set of features, i.e. lexicon or vocabulary  of words deemed relevant to building the model is identified. Since the present conditional probability model relies on the Na\u00efve Bayes assumption, the features whose support is included in X are of primary focus. These features can be expressed as the binary valued indicator function \u0192(x):X\u2192{0,1}. Let F={\u0192,k=1, . . . ,F} be the set of features chosen for building a particular model P(y|x) where x indicates individual sentences, k indicates words in lexicon , and F indicates the total number of words in lexicon .\n","At step , for given events (x,y) in training data , binary decision module  accesses word lexicon  to determine whether words x(1), . . . x(L), where L is the number of words in sentence x, are in lexicon . Words not in lexicon are mapped to a special UNKNOWN word. Lexicon  can be an existing lexicon for a particular application. During processing, binary decision module  assigns a feature value of 1 for words in the lexicon that are present in sentence x, while binary decision module assigns a feature value of 0 for words in the lexicon that are absent from sentence x. Binary decision module  then constructs a set of binary valued feature vector  that lists the values of each feature, for any given sentence x:\n\n()=(\u0192(), . . . , \u0192()).\n\nAssuming a Na\u00efve Bayes model for the feature vector and the predicted variable ((x),y), the joint probability of (x) and y can be expressed as follows:\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"munder":{"mi":["f","_"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},"mo":",","mi":"y"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","y"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"F"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["\u03b8","ky"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}},{"mover":[{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},"mi":"_"}],"mi":"ky"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"o":"\u0192(x)","sub":"i"},"Conditional probability calculation module  calculates conditional probability of class y given a sentence x and set of parameters , which can be expressed as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"(","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["\uf603",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":";","munder":{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msup":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Z","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":";","munder":{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]}}}},{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u00b7","msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","y"]}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"F"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"msubsup":[{"mi":["\u03b8","ky"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}}},{"mover":[{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]},{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},"mi":"_"}],"mi":"ky"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}}],"mi":"where","msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","y"]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"},"mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"}],"mo":"="},{"mo":"\u2200","mrow":{"mi":["y","Y"],"mo":"\u2208"}},{"mrow":[{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":["y","Y"],"mo":"\u2208"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","y"]}},{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"msub":{"mi":["\u03b8","ky"]}},"mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"}],"mo":"="},{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]},"mi":"ky"},"mo":"\u2265","mn":"0"},{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03b8","ky"]},{"mover":{"mi":["\u03b8","_"]},"mi":"ky"}],"mo":"+"},"mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mrow":[{"mo":"\u2200","mi":"k"},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":[",",","],"mi":"F"},"mi":"_"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"y"},{"mi":"Y","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":{}},"msup":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Z","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["x","\u03b8"],"mo":";"}}},{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}}],"mo":"\u2208"},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"y"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"munder":{"mi":["f","_"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},"mo":",","mi":"y"}}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}],"mo":[",",",",",",",",","]}}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Eq","mo":[".","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"At step , initialization module  calculates an initial probability \u03b8for each class from training data .

Large values for \u03b5 will slow down convergence whereas small values may result in non-monotonic increase of the conditional likelihood. Second, assuming that \u03b2 is chosen such that Eq. 6 is satisfied for a small non-negative value of \u03b5, the value of \u03b2 can still be very small.","It has been observed that there exists a pair of (k,y) values that require a very small \u03b2 value, which makes the updates for other (k,y) pairs very small, and consequently, slows down convergence.
