title: Nonlinear optical CdSiP2 crystal and producing method and devices therefrom
abstract: CdSiPcrystals with sizes and optical quality suitable for use as nonlinear optical devices are disclosed, as well as NLO devices based thereupon. A method of growing the crystals by directional solidification from a stoichiometric melt is also disclosed. The disclosed NLO crystals have a higher nonlinear coefficient than prior art crystals that can be pumped by solid state lasers, and are particularly useful for frequency shifting 1.06 μm, 1.55 μm, and 2 μm lasers to wavelengths between 2 μm and 10 μm. Due to the high thermal conductivity and low losses of the claimed CdSiPcrystals, average output power can exceed 10 W without severe thermal lensing. A 6.45 μm laser source for use as a medical laser scalpel is also disclosed, in which a CdSiPcrystal is configured for non-critical phase matching, pumped by a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser, and temperature-tuned to produce output at 6.45 μm.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The invention relates to non-linear optics, and more particularly to the production and use of birefringent crystals in nonlinear optical devices.","Mid-infrared lasers are important for a growing number of applications, such as spectroscopy, remote chemical sensing, laser surgery, and infrared countermeasures. Typically, laser output at mid-infrared wavelengths is produced by using a nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal to shift the output wavelength of a solid state laser, such as a Nd:YAG (1.06-\u03bcm) laser or an erbium-doped fiber laser (1.55-\u03bcm), to a wavelength in the 2-12 \u03bcm range. Oxide-based crystals such as potassium titanyl phosphate, KTiOPO(KTP), and periodically-poled lithium niobate, LiNbO(PPLN) work well at the short end of this spectral range, but the output power from these materials falls off dramatically beyond 4 microns.","The I-III-VIchalcopyrite crystals AgGaSand AgGaSecan be pumped at 1.06 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm respectively so as to generate output much deeper into the infrared (up to 12 \u03bcm), but they are plagued by low damage thresholds and extremely poor thermal properties that preclude their use for high average power applications. Crystals of ZnGeP, a II-IV-Vchalcopyrite, have significantly higher nonlinear coefficients and much better thermo-mechanical properties for high power operation, but they must be pumped by less common sources such as Tm- or Tm,Ho-lasers operating at wavelengths greater than 1.9 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the output power and efficiency of 2-micron-laser-pumped ZnGePoptical parametric oscillators (OPOs) is limited by absorption losses at the pump wavelength.","II-IV-Vchalcopyrites like ZnGePare derived from III-V compound semiconductors (like GaP) by ordered substitution of group II (Zn) and group IV (Ge) atoms on the group III (Ga) site in the same way that I-III-VIchalcopyrites like AgGaSand AgGaSeare derived from II-VI compound semiconductors (like ZnSe). While the I-III-VIcompounds offer low absorption losses, they are usually plagued by scattering losses due to precipitates which form on cooling as a result of off-stoichiometry congruent melting and retrograde solubility of the IIIVI-rich phase. They tend to have larger band gaps than their II-IV-Vcounterparts, but are inferior in terms of hardness, thermal conductivity, anisotropic thermal expansion, and thermo-optic coefficients, all of which makes them prone to thermal lensing and laser-induced damage in both the surface and the bulk. They also have lower nonlinear coefficients than the II-IV-Vchalcopyrites.","The II-IV-Vcompounds, therefore, offer superior properties in almost every respect. They are generally free of scattering centers, and absorption losses (at least in the phosphides) can be very low in the center of their transparency range. While they can be plagued by defect-related absorption losses near the band edge when grown from the melt, these losses can often be eliminated by post-growth processing.","Of course, not all II-IV-Vcompounds are suitable for nonlinear optical applications. To be useful for nonlinear optical frequency conversion, a crystal must have sufficient birefringence for phase-matching. Because the speed of light (as determined by the refractive index, n) inside a crystal varies as a function of wavelength (a phenomenon known as \u201cdispersion\u201d), the input and output waves will normally remain in phase over a very short distance (\u02dc10-100 \u03bcm in the infrared), termed the \u201ccoherence length,\u201d beyond which frequency conversion ceases. A birefringent crystal exhibits two refractive indices: one for light polarized perpendicular to the optic axis (ordinary- or o-polarized) and another for light polarized parallel to the optic axis (extraordinary- or e-polarized). If the difference between the two refractive indices (i.e., the birefringence, n\u2212n) exceeds the difference in refractive index at the two wavelengths (i.e., the dispersion), then a direction inside the crystal can be chosen such that input and output waves of opposite polarization can experience the same refractive index. Under these conditions, the two waves remain in phase (i.e. are \u201cphase-matched\u201d), allowing the frequency conversion process to build to reasonable efficiencies over a long interaction length.","In addition to phase matching, a nonlinear optical crystal must be highly transparent at the input and output wavelengths of interest, and it must have a band edge that is near or below one-half of the shortest wavelength involved in the frequency conversion process, so as to avoid two-photon absorption. For down-conversion processes such as optical parametric oscillation (OPO), optical parametric amplification (OPA), and difference frequency generation (DFG), the input wave represents the shortest wavelength, whereas for up-conversion processes such as second harmonic generation (SHG) or sum frequency generation (SFG) the shortest wavelength(s) is\/are at the output. Pumping with a 1064 nm Nd:YAG solid state laser, for example, requires a band edge near or below 532 nm.","Finally, even if a candidate compound has adequate nonlinearity, transparency, and phase-matching properties, it will not be possible to use the compound as the basis of an optical device unless a method is found for growing crystals of sufficient size and optical quality so that devices with the required crystallographic orientation can be fabricated. Oriented crystals with dimensions of at least 3 mm\u00d73 mm\u00d710 mm are typically required for practical devices, and the crystals must be free of cracks, twins, voids, inclusions, grain-boundaries, and other macroscopic defects, at least within the aperture and propagating path of the interacting waves.","Although at the time the present invention was made, CdSiPwas known to be a II-IV-Vchalcopyrite compound with at least some properties consistent with use in NLO devices, CdSiPwas not generally considered by those skilled in the art to be a likely candidate for practical NLO devices. The crystal structure of CdSiPhad been reported by S. C. Abrahams and J. L. Bernstein, . Vol. 55, p. 796 (1971), incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Specifically, Abrahams and Bernstein had reported that CdSiPbelongs to the tetragonal space group 42m, that its lattice parameters are respectively 5.68 A and 10.431 A for a and c, and Z=4 in each unit cell, and that the mass density of CdSiPis 4.70 g\/cm.","The birefringence of tiny 2\u00d72\u00d70.2 mmCdSiPcrystals grown from a molten tin flux had been measured in the prior art and reported in N. Itoh, T. Fujinaga, and T. Nakau, \u201cBirefringence in CdSiP,\u201d Jap. J. Appl. Phys. 17, 951-2, (1978) (incorporated herein by reference for all purposes) to be \u22120.045 at 840 nm, but no measurements were made in the infrared.","Several other optically relevant properties of CdSiPwere either uncertain or unknown at the time the present invention was made. For example, values reported in the prior art for the band gap of CdSiPhad ranged from 2.2 eV (563 nm) to 2.45 eV (506 nm), causing it to be unclear if CdSiPwould exhibit two-photon absorption if pumped by a pulsed 1064 nm laser. The long-wavelength transparency limit of CdSiPhad not been measured in the prior art. And while tiny samples (up to 5\u00d72\u00d71 mm) had been grown in the prior art by halogen-assisted vapor transport, as reported for example in E. Buehler and J. H. Wernick, 8, 324 (1971), incorporated herein by reference for all purposes, the CdSiPcrystals produced thereby were far too small to be used for nonlinear optical devices. In fact, these prior art crystals were too small to enable measurement of the most relevant nonlinear optical properties, including the nonlinear coefficient, the transparency range, and the phase-matching characteristics. Furthermore, the methods used to grow these prior art crystals were not scalable to produce crystals having the required size and quality.","At the time the present invention was made, it therefore appeared doubtful to those of average skill in the art that CdSiPcrystals of optical device size and quality could be grown. Buehler and Wernick had reported an approximate melting point of 1120\u00b0 C. for CdSiPand a vapor pressure of 19.4 atm at 1100\u00b0 C. (which extrapolates to 20.4 atm at 1120\u00b0 C. and 23.9 atm at 1175\u00b0 C.). The present inventors had even attempted to grow CdSiPdirectly from a stoichiometric melt without success, finding that the quartz ampoules devitrified and reacted with CdSiP, and that the solidified melts were porous and polycrystalline. An equilibrium phase diagram for CdSiPsystem had not been determined in the prior art, and it was not known if the compound would melt congruently, which is a necessary condition for melt growth.","A method was known in the prior art (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,856, incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes) for producing single crystals of group II-IV-Vcompounds of sufficient size and optical quality for use in NLO devices by pre-synthesizing the compound material from its constituents and separately melting and re-crystallizing by directional solidification in sealed quartz ampoules using a two-zone horizontal transparent furnace. Crystals with melting points as high as 1027\u00b0 C. and vapor pressures as high as 7 atmospheres had been grown by this method. However, it did not appear at the time of the present invention that this method would tolerate the significantly higher temperatures (\u02dc1175\u00b0 C. in the hot zone) and pressures (\u02dc24 atm) required to produce a CdSiPcrystal. In addition, it was not known whether the compound itself would melt congruently, and whether the quartz ampoules could be used without devitrifying or reacting with the compound. Finally, it was not apparent that a crystal of CdSiPwould be transparent and phase-matchable for mid-infrared frequency conversion, even if a crystal of sufficient size and quality could somehow be grown.","For all of these reasons, at the time the present invention was made CdSiPwas not generally considered by those skilled in the art to be a likely candidate crystal for practical NLO device applications.","A need exists, therefore, for CdSiPsingle crystals of sufficient size and optical quality to be suitable for use in NLO devices, and for a method of producing such crystals. A need also exists for NLO devices that use such CdSiPcrystals to frequency-shift the output of 1.06 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm lasers to mid-infrared wavelengths ranging from 2-10 \u03bcm, and for frequency-shifting 2-\u03bcm lasers at high efficiencies and output powers into the 3-10 \u03bcm range. Furthermore, a need exists for a method of using such crystals of frequency-shifting the output of 1.06 \u03bcm, 1.55 \u03bcm, and 2-\u03bcm lasers to mid-infrared wavelengths ranging from 2-10 \u03bcm.","Large, high optical quality CdSiPcrystals suitable for use in nonlinear optical devices are claimed, as well as a method of producing such crystals by directional solidification from a stoichiometric melt. CdSiPcrystals of sufficient size and optical quality for use in NLO devices do not occur in nature, and could not be artificially produced before invention of the method claimed herein. The crystals of the present invention are therefore compositions of matter with essential differences in their properties as compared to naturally occurring and prior art manufactured crystals, wherein these essential differences include enhanced optical quality and size that enable the claimed crystals to be used as the basis of practical NLO devices, in contrast with CdSiPcrystals of the prior art that cannot be so used.","The claimed method of producing NLO-compatible CdSiPcrystals is similar to the prior art method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,856. However, it was unexpected at the time the present invention was made that large ingots of the compound CdSiPcould be successfully synthesized without explosion of the quartz ampoule due to the high temperatures and pressures required. Furthermore it was unexpected that large, high optical quality single crystals could be successfully grown in horizontal, transparent furnaces by directional solidification at the required temperatures and pressures.","Nonlinear optical devices are also claimed that use the CdSiPcrystals of the present invention to produce a shifted wavelength laser beam having a wavelength different from all incident beams. The claimed devices are capable of efficiently shifting laser wavelengths as short as 1 \u03bcm so as to produce electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the 2-10 \u03bcm wavelength range, and with average power levels in excess of 10 W, while avoiding severe thermal lensing due to the low absorption losses and high thermal conductivity of the claimed CdSiPcrystals.","One general aspect of the present invention is a nonlinear optical device comprising a negative uniaxial II-VI-Vcrystal belonging to the space point group 42m and having NLO properties, whereby at least one incident beam of electromagnetic radiation can be directed into said crystal so as to generate electromagnetic radiation emerging from said crystal that includes at least one output wavelength different from the wavelengths of all incident beams of radiation, and wherein said crystal is a single crystal of CdSiP. In various embodiments, the CdSiPcrystal includes an input surface capable of receiving the at least one incident beam of electromagnetic radiation and an output surface capable of transmitting an emerging beam of electromagnetic radiation.","In some embodiments, the single crystal of CdSiPis oriented relative to polarization and propagation directions of the incident radiation so as to allow phase-matched propagation of the incident and emerging radiation. And in certain embodiments, the single crystal of CdSiPhas a total volume of at least 20 mm.","In various embodiments, the single crystal of CdSiPis free of cracks, twins, voids, inclusions, grain-boundaries, and all other macroscopic defects throughout all apertures and propagating paths of all electromagnetic waves interacting therein. In certain embodiments all of the incident beams of electromagnetic radiation have wavelengths that fall in the range 0.5 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, and in other embodiments the electromagnetic radiation emerging from said crystal includes at least one output wavelength that falls in the range 0.5 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm. Some embodiments are configured for transmitting an emerging beam having an average power of at least 10 Watts.","Various embodiments further include an input coupler configured to enable the incident beams of electromagnetic radiation to be directed into the nonlinear optical crystal, and an output coupler configured to enable extraction of at least one emerging beam of electromagnetic radiation from the nonlinear optical crystal.","In some embodiments, the output coupler includes an optical filter configured to isolate the emerging beam from other beams of electromagnetic radiation. Certain embodiments further include an orientation adjustment mechanism configured to adjust an orientation of the nonlinear optical crystal relative to directions of propagation and polarization of the incident beam or beams. Other embodiments further include a temperature adjusting mechanism configured to adjust a temperature of the nonlinear optical crystal.","In certain embodiments the input coupler includes an input mirror that is at least partially transmissive of the incident beam or beams, and the output coupler includes an output mirror that is at least partially transmissive of the emerging beam.","In some embodiments the CdSiPsingle crystal is grown from a compound produced by a two-temperature method comprising vacuum sealing Cd, Si, and P in an ampoule in a molar ratio of nominally 1:1:2, not including any excess quantities added so as to account for a vapor phase above a melt, the Cd and Si being physically mixed at a first end of the ampoule and the P being located at a second end of the ampoule, and heating the Cd and Si at least near the melting point of the compound CdSiPwhile heating the P to a lower temperature sufficient to cause the P to volatilize and react with the molten Cd and Si, thereby forming CdSiPcompound. And in some embodiments the CdSiPsingle crystal is grown by directional solidification from a stoichiometric melt containing Cd, Si, and P in a molar ratio of nominally 1:1:2.","In various embodiments the nonlinear optical device is configured for frequency conversion by means of phase-matched sum frequency generation, second harmonic generation, phase-matched difference frequency generation, phase-matched optical parametric generation, phase-matched optical parametric amplification, and\/or phase-matched optical parametric oscillation.","In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation emerging from the CdSiPsingle crystal includes at least one output wavelength of substantially about 6.45 \u03bcm. In certain embodiments the nonlinear optical device is configured for non-critical phase matching and the electromagnetic radiation emerging from said crystal is temperature tuned so as to include a wavelength of substantially about 6.45 \u03bcm. And in various embodiments the nonlinear optical device is pumped by a solid-state laser having an output wavelength of 1064 nm.","Another general aspect of the present invention is an infrared laser surgery scalpel. The infrared laser surgery scalpel includes a single crystal of CdSiPhaving NLO properties, into which at least one incident beam of electromagnetic radiation can be directed so as to generate electromagnetic radiation emerging from the crystal that includes an output wavelength of substantially about 6.45 \u03bcm. In some embodiments the at least one incident beam is a single incident beam produced by a solid-state laser having a wavelength of substantially about 1064 nm. And in certain embodiments the nonlinear optical device is configured for non-critical phase matching and the electromagnetic radiation emerging from the crystal is temperature tuned so as to include a wavelength of substantially about 6.45 \u03bcm.","The features and advantages described herein are not all-inclusive and, in particular, many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings, specification, and claims. Moreover, it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes, and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.","With reference to , the method of the present invention for producing a single crystal of CdSiPsuitable for use in NLO devices includes the following steps:","a) placing red phosphorus (P) at one end of a quartz ampoule  and a PBN or PBN-coated graphite boat containing cadmium (Cd) and silicon (Si) at the other end  of the ampoule in a molar ratio of Cd:Si:P=1:1:2, and evacuating and sealing the ampoule ;","b) heating the sealed ampoule in a two-zone furnace so that the P end of the furnace is maintained at a cold zone temperature of 485\u00b0 C. and the Cd and Si end of the furnace is maintained at a hot zone temperature of 1180\u00b0 C.  and waiting until the P fully transports and reacts with Cd and Si to form CdSiP(4-24 hours)  and then cooling to room temperature ;","c) loading the resulting synthesized CdSiPingot into a PBN or PBN-coated graphite boat fitted with a well containing a seed crystal , and vacuum-encapsulating the boat in a fused silica ampoule ;","d) heating the encapsulated PBN or PBN-coated graphite boat in a furnace with an axial gradient of 1-5\u00b0 C.\/cm to about 1130\u00b0 C. and adjusting the temperature so as to fully melt the CdSiPingot and partially melt the seed crystal ;","e) cooling the encapsulated PBN or PBN-coated graphite boat at a rate of between 0.02\u00b0 C. per hour and 1\u00b0 C. per hour so as to achieve directional solidification of the CdSiPat a crystal growth rate of 0.2 to 2 mm\/hour 118; and","f) cooling the resultant CdSiPcrystal to room temperature at a rate of between 5\u00b0 C.\/hour and 100\u00b0 C.\/hour 120.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["10","14","13","19","13","14","10","13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 1C","b":["20","20","21","22","23","24","25","21","25","26","27","21","19","21","25","19","21","29","31","32","22","23","33","34"],"sub":"2 "},"The method described above has been used to produce single crystals of CdSiPsuitable for use in NLO devices with diameters up to 19 mm or more and lengths up to several centimeters. These crystals of the present invention have been used to measure the following NLO properties:","1. Wide Wavelength Transparency Range:","The inventors of the present invention have examined the transmission characteristics of CdSiPsingle crystals produced using the method disclosed above, and have found that the CdSiPsingle crystals are transparent in the wavelength range of 500 nm to 9500 nm. The measured transparency range of a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention, plotted as absorption coefficient versus wavelength, is shown in . The thick line ,  indicates the measured absorption spectrum for CdSiP, whereas the thin line ,  indicates the measured absorption spectrum for a nonlinear optical crystal of the prior art, ZnGeP. Note that the absorption losses between the band edge and 2 \u03bcm  are substantially lower in a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention than in the prior art ZnGePcrystal , allowing CdSiPcrystals to be pumped by 1 \u03bcm and 1.55 \u03bcm lasers, which are processes not phase-matchable using the prior art crystal ZnGeP.","In addition, CdSiPcrystals of the present invention exhibit a 2 \u03bcm absorption coefficient up to 20 times lower than that ZnGeP, making CdSiPa promising alternative to ZnGePfor powerful and efficient mid-infrared OPOs pumped by Tm and Ho lasers. The onset of multi-phonon absorption in a CdSiPcrystal of the present invention, with peaks at 7 \u03bcm and 7.6 \u03bcm , occurs at shorter wavelengths than in the prior art ZnGePcrystal, which has a peak at 9 \u03bcm . This limits the usefulness of CdSiPcrystals for frequency conversion processes involving wavelengths beyond 6.7 \u03bcm.","2. Large Nonlinear Coefficient:","The inventors have measured the nonlinear coefficient of a CdSiPsingle crystal produced using the method disclosed above, and have obtained a value of 84.5 pm\/V, which is 2.56 times that of AgGaSe(33 pm\/V) and 7 times larger than that of AgGaS(12 pm\/V). This was an unexpectedly high value for the nonlinear optical coefficient, since plotting the nonlinear coefficients of other II-VI-Vchalcopyrites as a function of band gap predicted a value closer to 53 pm\/V. This measured value of 84.5 pm\/V is, in fact, the highest nonlinear optical coefficient of any known phase-matchable nonlinear optical crystal that can be pumped by a solid state laser.","3. High Thermal Conductivity:","The inventors have measured the thermal conductivity of an 8 mm\u00d78 mm\u00d71.97 mm CdSiPsample using a NETZSCH LFA 447 Nanoflash instrument. The sample faces were coated with gold (\u02dc0.1 \u03bcm) and carbon paint (\u02dc5 \u03bcm) to block any transmitted light. Room-temperature (25\u00b0 C.) measurements of thermal diffusivity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity yielded values of 7.69 mm\/s, 0.446 J\/g\/K, and 13.6 W\/mK respectively. This thermal conductivity value is an order of magnitude higher than that of the prior art NLO crystals AgGaS(1.4 W\/mK) and AgGaSe(1.0 W\/mK) used in the prior art for shifting 1.06-\u03bcm and 1.55-\u03bclm lasers into the mid-IR. This high thermal conductivity, coupled with the low absorption losses illustrated in , enables the generation of mid-infrared laser radiation in excess of 10 W.","4. Refractive Indices and Phase Matching Conditions:","Employing the method of prism minimum deviation, the inventors of the present invention also measured the principal refractive indices of CdSiP.

Pumping with a 1550 nm laser (curve ) at internal phase matching angles between 45.5 and 60.5 degrees relative to the c-axis (optic axis) will generate output wavelengths from 1.71 \u03bcm to greater than 10.5 \u03bcm.

Temperature-Tunable Devices","The present inventors also measured the change in the ordinary and extra-ordinary refractive indices, and the consequent change in the corresponding Sellmeier equations, as a function of temperature. The resulting temperature-dependent Sellmeier coefficients are listed below in Table 1, and indicate that the CdSiPcrystals of the present invention are more temperature-tunable than most other nonlinear optical chalcopyrite crystals known in the prior art. The data indicate, for example, that a 2-\u03bcm pumped OPO based on CdSiPcan be tuned in wavelength between 3.4 and 4.8 \u03bcm by varying the temperature of the CdSiPcrystal between 10\u00b0 C. and 70\u00b0 C. Likewise, a 1.064-\u03bcm-pumped Type I CdSiPOPO will produce non-critically phase-matched output at 6.18 \u03bcm at 25\u00b0 C., but can be temperature tuned to produce non-critically phase-matched output at 6.45 \u03bcm at 99\u00b0 C. (a modest temperature increase that can easily be achieved in practical hardware).

The device is pumped by a conventional laser such as a Nd:YAG laser at 1.06 \u03bcm and produces an output laser beam of approximately 6.45 \u03bcm, which is a wavelength with high soft tissue absorbance and cutting efficiency. In various embodiments of this device, the CdSiPcrystal  is oriented for noncritical phase matching with no \u201cwalk-off\u201d of the emerging beam relative to the incident beam. The crystal  is heated by the heater  to a temperature of approximately 100\u00b0 C., so as to tune the output wavelength to approximately 6.45 \u03bcm. A specific medical laser scalpel embodiment is discussed in more detail in Example 3 below.","It can be seen from the discussion above that the claimed single crystals of CdSiPare novel NLO crystals having excellent NLO properties. The claimed NLO devices made using the claimed CdSiPcrystals have superior properties as compared to prior art NLO devices made using either AgGaSeor AgGaSecrystals. In particular, the claimed devices have a higher nonlinear coefficient and higher thermal conductivity than these prior art devices, making them more attractive for high average power laser frequency conversion in the mid-infrared.","22.0453 g of red phosphorus was loaded into one end of a heavy-walled, fused silica ampoule, and a PBN-coated graphite boat containing 9.9948 g silicon and 40.0034 g cadmium was loaded into the opposite end. The ampoule was evacuated, sealed, and loaded into a two-zone shunt-type tube furnace with a Hastelloy C-276 protective liner. The programmed heating cycle was as follows: zone 1 (hot zone, containing the boat with Cd and Si) was heated at 50\u00b0 C.\/hr to 1025\u00b0 C., 37.9-hr soak, 25\u00b0 C.\/hr to 1180\u00b0 C., 8-hr soak, cool at 100\u00b0 C.\/hr; zone 2 (containing P) was heated at 50\u00b0 C.\/hr to 485\u00b0 C., 28-hr soak, 25\u00b0 C.\/hr to 1180\u00b0 C., 8-hr soak, cool at 100\u00b0 C.\/hr.","The resulting single phase polycrystalline ingot was loaded into a PBN-coated graphite boat with a seed well containing a CdSiPsingle crystal seed oriented for horizontal growth along the (001) c-axis direction with the (110) axis normal to the top surface. The boat, charge, and seed were vacuum encapsulated in a heavy-walled, fused silica ampoule and heated in a two-zone transparent furnace at 16.7\u00b0 C.\/hour to set points of 1125\u00b0 C. and 1115\u00b0 C. respectively to establish an axial temperature gradient of 1.5\u00b0 C.\/cm. The set points were gradually raised to 1130\u00b0 C. and 1120\u00b0 C. to partially melt the seed crystal, followed by cooling at 0.15\u00b0 C.\/hr for 160 hours to induce directional solidification at a rate of 1 mm\/hour. Once fully solidified, the crystal was cooled at 5\u00b0 C.\/hour to room temperature. The resulting \u201cD\u201d-shaped crystal was 19 mm wide, 10 mm high and 140 mm long: the first 15 mm of growth were a clear, crack-free, single crystal grain that reproduced the orientation of the seed crystal.","A CdSiPcrystal obtained by using the procedure of Example 1 with excellent mechanical properties was cut and polished into a body of 3\u00d76\u00d712 mmafter determination of the crystallographic axes a and c at phase matching angles of \u03b8=42.5 degrees and \u03c6=45 degrees. The crystal was placed in the optical path shown in  without mirrors  and . The incident wave  was from a frequency-doubled, Q-switched COlaser of wavelength 4.64 microns. The emerging second harmonic wave ,  with a wavelength of 2.32 microns was obtained. The uncoated crystal achieved 30% optical-to-optical conversion efficiency.","A CdSiPcrystal obtained by using the procedure of Example 1 was cut into a body of 6\u00d76.75\u00d79.5 mmafter determination of the crystallographic axes a and c at phase matching angles of \u03b8=90 degrees and \u03c6=45 degrees.

Both faces were AR-coated for the three wavelengths (pump, signal, and idler) and the 8-layer coating resulted in averaged reflectivity per surface of \u02dc0.35% at 1064 nm, \u02dc0.4% at 1275 nm and \u02dc0.8% at 6400 nm. The crystal was placed in the optical path shown in . The incident wave  was from a Q-switched 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser: no two-photon absorption was observed. The internal crystal angle was approximately 0.67\u00b0 below the desired 90\u00b0 interaction angle, resulting in a signal wavelength  of 1.277 \u03bcm and an idler wavelength  of 6.398 \u03bcm, which was increased to 6.45 \u03bcm by heating the crystal  using a heater . This interaction is extremely useful for laser surgery applications at 6.45 \u03bcm, including minimally-invasive neurosurgery. An extremely effective laser scalpel for cutting soft tissue has been demonstrated at this wavelength using a free electron laser (see 371, 416-419, 29 Sep. 1994, incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes), which is an enormous and extremely expensive laser source.
