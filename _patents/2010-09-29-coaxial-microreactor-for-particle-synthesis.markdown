title: Coaxial microreactor for particle synthesis
abstract: A coaxial fluid flow microreactor system disposed on a microfluidic chip utilizing laminar flow for synthesizing particles from solution. Flow geometries produced by the mixing system make use of hydrodynamic focusing to confine a core flow to a small axially-symmetric, centrally positioned and spatially well-defined portion of a flow channel cross-section to provide highly uniform diffusional mixing between a reactant core and sheath flow streams. The microreactor is fabricated in such a way that a substantially planar two-dimensional arrangement of microfluidic channels will produce a three-dimensional core/sheath flow geometry. The microreactor system can comprise one or more coaxial mixing stages that can be arranged singly, in series, in parallel or nested concentrically in parallel.

While nanoparticles in particular appear to have been the subject of much published work in this area (S. Desportes, Z. Yatabe, S. Baumlin, V. Genot, J.-P. Lefevre, H. Ushiki, J. A. Delaire, R. B.

Tallant, C. M. Matzke, and T. A. Michalske, \u201cSpatially-resolved analysis of nanoparticle nucleation and growth in a microfluidic reactor\u201d, Lab-on-a-Chip, 2007, v.1: pp. 908-915) treatment of micron-sized and larger particles appears to be lacking, presumably due to the difficulties posed by clogging and surface nucleation. Moreover, these prior art examples typically rely on coaxial capillary arrangements external to the microfluidic chip (cf. S. Pabit, op. cit., and H. Nagasawa, op. cit.) or involve irregular flow patterns with chimney-like (H. Klank, G. Goranovic, J. P. Kutter, H. Gjelstrup, J. Michelsen, and C. H. Westergaard, \u201cPly measurements in a microfluidic 3D-sheathing structure with three-dimensional flow behavior,\u201d 2002, v.12: pp. 862-869) or piecewise-focused geometries (X. L. Mao, J. R. Waldeisen, and T. J. Huang, \u201c\u2018Microfluidic drifting\u2019\u2014implementing three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing with a single-layer planar microfluidic device,\u201d ---2007, v.2: pp. 1260-1262) poorly suited to uniform particle nucleation and growth.","Microreactors are particularly beneficial for reaction experiments or particle production processes in which either reactants or products are explosive, radioactive, acutely hazardous, extremely costly, particularly rare, or available in only very limited quantities (e.g., materials collected in forensic analysis, etc.) because small quantities of reagents are used and small quantities of waste are generated. Moreover, because reactions occur in an essentially closed system, these techniques may also be particularly applicable or adaptable for work with reagents and products which are reactive to atmospheric air, moisture, etc. Non-aqueous chemistries, organic chemistries, ionic liquid chemistries, etc., may all be adaptable to these reaction schemes.","Microreactors fabricated on-chip using techniques typical of micromachining or lithographic techniques like those employed for the fabrication of integrated circuits, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and lab-on-a-chip systems offer a number of advantages over comparable off-chip designs. While similar phenomena and geometries can be achieved in capillary-based systems, blown-glass assemblies, and devices produced by conventional small-scale machining, such systems typically lack the dimensional consistency and economies of scale made possible by the parallelized nature of microfabrication. Moreover, discretely fabricated components can prove problematic to integrate effectively, whereas multiple functionalities can be readily incorporated onto a single chip or micromachined substrate. As such, integrated on-chip designs avoid problems of component interconnection, minimize required sample amounts, decrease dead volumes and transport volumes, reduce sample dispersion, and minimize the number of discrete parts and connections which can potentially fail, clog, or leak.","Continuous, flow-through microfluidic chemical reactors, i.e., microreactors, offer a number of potential benefits over more conventional large-scale and batch processes for the production of particles (nanocrystals, nanoparticles, quantum dots, microparticles, etc.). Specifically, the ability to conduct reactions at scales comparable to the diffusion length with precise control over flow geometry and reaction conditions makes it possible to avoid significant deviations in microenvironment and residence times, which can occur in larger systems. Moreover, as will be shown below, the option to serially engage these microreactors makes it possible to effectively decouple and independently control the processes of nucleation, growth, and particle aggregation while offering options for integrating additional functionalities downstream such as particle sorting or separation, solvent or solute extraction, spectroscopic or light scattering analysis, thermal treatment, surface functionalization, etc.","For the purposes of particle generation, 2-dimensional focusing (or in fact any simple two-dimensional 2- or 3-stream laminar mixing) is less than ideal for two reasons. First, the planar (reacting) interface between the streams contacts the channel wall (i.e., floor and ceiling), tending to result in surface crystal nucleation that can lead a loss of particle uniformity or even clogging. Second, the parabolic velocity profile typical of pressure driven flow in a channel means that particles nucleating at different positions along the planar mixing interface will experience different velocities, residence times, and growth histories, tending to broaden the size distribution of resulting crystals. Alternatives which have previously been explored to improve residence time uniformity include a variety of rapid mixing schemes (S. Hardt, K. S. Drese, V. Hessel, and F. Schonfeld, \u201cPassive micromixers for applications in the microreactor and \u03bcTAS fields,\u201d Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, 2005, v.1: pp. 108-118) and a suggestion of relying on Taylor dispersion (lateral diffusion) to \u201caverage-out\u201d residence times in slow moving flows (S. Krishnadasan, J. Tovilla, R. Vilar, A. J. deMello, and J. C. deMello, \u201cOn-line analysis of CdSe nanoparticle formation in a continuous flow chip-based microreactor\u201d, 2004, v.14: pp. 2655-2660). Most mixing schemes presented suffer the aforementioned wall nucleation problems, limiting their usefulness for particle production. While the Taylor dispersion concept may work serviceably for nanoparticle production, larger particles will not have the same degree of lateral mobility, and will tend to settle out of the flow at the low velocities required for this approach to work.","Achieving highly symmetrical three-dimensionally-focusable coaxial core\/sheath flows on-chip has proven to be a significant challenge due to the largely planar, two-dimensional nature of typical chip fabrication techniques. While the prior art provides examples of coaxial and three-dimensional flow focusing devices, they are generally designed with little concern for end-to-end core\/sheath interface uniformity or surface interactions. One of the most common approaches to producing on-chip three-dimensionally focused and\/or coaxial flow is the use of piecewise focusing, where the core flow is focused first in the lateral dimension by one sheath flow, then in the vertical direction by another sheath flow, or vice versa (G. Hairer, G. S. Parr, P. Svasek, A. Jachimowicz, and M. J. Vellekoop, \u201cInvestigations of micrometer sample stream profiles in a three dimensional hydrodynamic focusing device,\u201d Sensors and Actuators B, 2008, v.132: pp. 518-524; R. Scott, P. Sethu, and C. K. Harnett, \u201cThree dimensional hydrodynamic focusing in a microfluidic Coulter counter,\u201d 2008, v.79: pp. 046104; X. L. Mao, J. R. Waldeisen, and T. J. Huang, (op. cit.); C.-C. Chang, Z.-X. Huang, and R-J Yang, \u201cThree-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing in two-layer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels,\u201d 2007, v.11: pp. 1479-1486). Unfortunately, piecewise focusing of reacting flows guarantees non-uniformity by providing not one but two sequential reacting interfaces. In two of these examples, three-dimensional focusing is further accomplished by forcing the core or sample stream against a wall of the system, producing a non-coaxial flow unsuitable for particle production due to the potential for surface nucleation and clogging (cf. Hairer, op. cit. and R. Scott, op. cit.). Chimney-like geometries have also been presented in which the core flow is introduced from the out-of-plane direction into a substantially two dimensional fluidic system, again yielding a significantly non-uniform reacting interface with distinct upstream and downstream microenvironments near the injection point (H. Klank, G. Goranovic, J. P. Kutter, H. Gjelstrup, J. Michelsen, and C. H. Westergaard, (op. cit.); A. Wolff, I. R. Perch-Nielsen, U. D. Larsen, P. Friis, G. Goranovic, C. R. Poulsen, J. P. Kutter, and P. Telleman, \u201cIntegrating advanced functionality in microfabricated high-throughput fluorescent-activated cell sorter,\u201d Lab-on-a-chip, 2003, v.3: pp. 22-27). Even more complex device geometries have been suggested, likely to yield even more broadly distributed reaction conditions if applied to the problem of particle generation (N. Sundararajan, M. S. Pio, L. P. Lee, and A. A. Berlin, \u201cThree-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels,\u201d 2004, v.13: pp. 559-567).","One of the more uniform coaxial flow geometries suggested for particle generation relies on a pulled capillary sandwiched between a blank coverslip and a molded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer patterned with microchannels (cf. S. Desportes, op. cit.). While the geometry of this device produces a uniform coaxial flow, the use of the soft PDMS elastomer makes the device more a disposable laboratory prototype than a true, durable, chip-based system. Many resort to PDMS and laminated PDMS structures to address the aforementioned difficulties of producing three-dimensional fluid flows with largely two-dimensional fabrication techniques (cf. R. Scott, op. cit.; C. C. Chang, op. cit.; and N. Sundararajan, op. cit.). The use of PDMS appears primarily to address the need to fabricate a channel of sufficient size to accommodate the capillary tube. The disadvantages of PDMS as an engineering material for micro fluidic systems are numerous and significant: lack of mechanical and dimensional stability, surface chemistry and reactivity, tendency to attract hydrophobic contaminants or particles, shrinkage or swelling due to absorption or interactions with common working fluids and reagents, and poor optical properties rendering PDMS-based systems unsuitable for many applications involving optical diagnostics.","As discussed above, prior art micro reactor and mixing schemes demonstrate a number of deficiencies when considered for the purpose of particle generation. Accordingly, we have developed a microreactor comprising a novel coaxial laminar flow fluid mixing system disposed on a microfluidic chip for synthesizing particles from solution and various embodiments thereof. The microreactor can comprise one or more coaxial mixing stages which can be arranged singly, in series, in parallel, or nested concentrically in parallel. We have developed a number of approaches, described below, for effectively implementing axially-symmetrical coaxial laminar flows in a microfluidic chip to provide highly uniform diffusional mixing between reacting core and sheath flow streams. These flow geometries are similar to those utilized in flow cytometry and use hydrodynamic focusing to confine a core flow to a small, axially-symmetric, centrally positioned, and spatially well-defined portion of a flow channel cross-section.","The novel microreactor or fluid mixer disclosed and described herein is fabricated in such a way that the substantially planar two-dimensional arrangement of microfluidic channels characteristic of chip-based devices can nevertheless produce three-dimensional coaxial core\/sheath flow geometry. Moreover, embodiments of the invention detailed below enable three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing of the coaxial flow, offering precise control over the geometry of the reacting core\/sheath interface. In the present invention, three-dimensional, coaxial, focused flow is made possible by fabricating mixer structures in which the core channel of a three-channel (sheath-core-sheath) mixer is substantially undercut by the sheath channels on either side. This undercut geometry allows fluid from both sheath channels to merge substantially above, below, and upstream of the core flow orifice. As a result, the present invention avoids many practical difficulties and limitations inherent in prior art microreactor particle synthesis systems while enabling advanced on-chip reactor functionality and improving performance. In particular, the highly symmetrical, consistent, and uniform interface between reacting core\/sheath species enabled by the present invention is conducive to the production of particles with homogeneous properties and very narrow size distributions, key figures of merit for particles in many applications. We also detail a variety of practical innovations designed to minimize clogging and enable meaningful scale-up of particle production, particularly for particles larger than the nanometer to 10 micron size range most commonly explored in the microreactor literature. In many cases, the approaches and device geometries presented here are also applicable to non-particle-producing reaction processes, the creation of uniform droplets and emulsions, and flow cytometry applications.","While the invention and its various embodiments described herein may be applied to a broad range of fluid flow regimes and schemes, the invention will be illustrated and described generally by means of crystallization processes associated with the precipitation of insoluble or sparingly soluble inorganic salt crystals from aqueous solutions. It is understood that these descriptions are regarded as illustrative of the invention and not as restrictive or limiting.","Beyond inorganic precipitation, however, the invention described herein, as well as its various embodiments, can be applied to particle generation occurring due to factors other than the formation of an insoluble compound, such as changes of state, temperature, etc. Even more generally, this invention is adaptable to compounds or particle production from gas-in-gas reactions, vapor-in-gas reactions, or gas-in-liquid reactions; to non-particle producing reactions occurring purely in the gas or liquid phases; or to the production of coaxial multi phase flow streams yielding droplets, micelles, bubbles, etc.","Here we concern ourselves primarily with control of microfluidic flows occurring \u201con-chip,\u201d which means on a device or substrate typically fabricated and patterned by means of micromachining or lithographic techniques analogous to those employed for the fabrication of integrated circuits, MEMS devices, and lab-on-a-chip systems. While similar phenomena and designs can be achieved in capillary-based systems and those produced by conventional small-scale machining, such systems typically lack the economies of scale made possible by the massively parallel nature of microfabrication. Moreover, discretely fabricated components can prove problematic to integrate effectively, whereas multiple functionalities can be readily incorporated onto a single chip or micromachined substrate, thereby avoiding problems of component interconnection, minimizing required sample quantities, decreasing dead volumes and transport volumes, reducing sample dispersion, and minimizing the number of system parts and connections which can potentially fail, clog, or leak. Thus, our invention is related generally to devices fabricated using \u201ctypical\u201d engineering materials\u2014those which are durable and dimensionally consistent enough for mass-production and widespread application. This includes standard micromachining substrates like silicon and semiconductor materials as well as glasses, quartz, and fused silica. We also include ceramics, metals, and durable polymer substrates.","The microreactor or fluid mixing devices disclosed herein can be readily fabricated in quartz, fused silica, or transparent polymer substrates amenable to particle diagnostic techniques such as light scattering, fluorescence imaging, laser-induced fluorescence, or spectroscopy, enabling real-time in-situ characterization, analysis, and quality control of particle generation processes. Silicon substrates can also be used (or silicon-glass hybrid), thereby allowing integration with silicon-based sensing, circuit elements, MEMS devices, etc.","Additional on-chip elements including heaters, thermometers, electrodes, pH sensors, optical components, insulative-dielectrophoresis arrays, sampling channels, inertial particle separation structures, dialysis and ion exchange membranes, magnets\/inductors, capacitive sensors, pressure sensors, etc., can be integrated into the coaxial mixers themselves or into upstream, intermediate, or downstream stages to provide added control and on-line monitoring of the particle production process.","Disclosed herein are:\n\n","The object of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art from the following description wherein there is shown and described, by way of illustration, one or more modes and embodiments best suited to carry out the invention. Accordingly, the descriptions and drawings provided herein are regarded as illustrative in nature and not to be construed as restrictive.","As used herein, \u201cchannel\u201d refers to a structure wherein a fluid may flow. A channel may be a capillary, tube, conduit, tunnel, or the like. \u201cMicrofluidic\u201d refers to a system or device having one or more fluidic channels, conduits or chambers that are generally fabricated at the centimeter to nanometer scale. Thus, \u201cmicrofluidic channels\u201d or \u201cmicrochannels\u201d typically have cross-sectional dimensions ranging from about 10 nm to about 1 mm.","As used herein, \u201cchip\u201d or \u201cmicrochip\u201d refers to a substantially planar substrate or a laminate of substantially planar layers onto or into which features, devices, or systems are patterned, machined, or otherwise fabricated, typically by additive or subtractive micromachining methods. \u201cOn-chip\u201d refers to features, devices, or systems fabricated on the surfaces or within the layers of such a microchip substrate. \u201cMicrofluidic chip\u201d refers to any such chip-based system incorporating one or more channels of microfluidic dimension. \u201cLab-on-a-chip\u201d refers to a microfluidic chip-based system incorporating one or more functionalities realized on-chip.","As used herein, \u201cmicrofabrication\u201d or \u201cmicromachining\u201d refers generally to a broad class of techniques, methods, and technologies for producing patterns, devices, or systems with minimum feature sizes ranging from nanometers to millimeters, particularly as applied to the fabrication of on-chip devices and systems. Examples include but are not limited to: photolithographic patterning and masking, electron beam lithography, ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet lithography, laser cutting and ablation, thin film deposition, focused ion beam milling, sputter or evaporative deposition, surface functionalization and self-assembly processes, chemical and plasma etching, chemical vapor deposition, nanoimprint lithography and pattern transfer, molecular beam epitaxy, casting and micromolding, substrate bonding, oxidation and annealing, ion implantation and doping, electroplating and electrodeposition, electrical discharge machining, powder blasting, ultrasonic drilling, precision micromilling, and the like.","As used herein, \u201cfocusing\u201d or \u201cflow focusing\u201d refers to the reduction in spatial extent or cross-section of one fluid stream in a channel or other confined space by the introduction of one or more additional fluid streams. \u201cHydrodynamic focusing\u201d refers more specifically to the focusing of liquid streams or fluids in a substantially laminar flow regime. In a planar (2D) fluidic device, flow focusing is typically accomplished by flowing three streams together into a fluidic junction in which three inlet channels intersect and flow into an outlet channel. Two high-velocity \u201csheath\u201d streams enter the junction on either side of a lower-velocity central \u201ccore\u201d stream. Viscous forces at the core-sheath interfaces rapidly accelerate the core fluid to the velocity of the sheath, effectively elongating or stretching the core flow in the axial direction. As a result, the core stream decreases in width, appearing to be squeezed (i.e. focused) between the two sheath streams in the lateral transverse (i.e. cross-channel) direction. \u201cTwo-dimensional focusing\u201d or \u201c2D-focusing\u201d refers to this squeezing of a central flow stream in only one transverse direction, either laterally (substantially in the plane of the substrate) or vertically (substantially normal to the plane of the substrate). \u201cThree-dimensional focusing\u201d or \u201c3D-focusing\u201d refers to the squeezing of a central flow stream in both lateral and vertical transverse directions. Properly implemented, three-dimensional focusing can enable the production of coaxial core-sheath flows having an axially symmetric core-sheath interface.","As used herein, \u201ccoaxial\u201d refers to two or more flow streams which are substantially concentric or centered about a shared axis in the direction of overall axial fluid motion. Considering the cross-section of a fluid flow channel, an inner core fluid stream positioned substantially at the center of the channel would be considered coaxial with an outer sheath fluid stream centered nominally about that same central point. Two or more flow streams can be coaxial without the interface between them exhibiting axial symmetry. We concern ourselves with axial symmetry only in relation to the interface(s) between flow lamina in core-sheath flow configurations and not in relation to the geometry of the fluid channel itself.","As used herein, a \u201cfluid\u201d refers to a continuous substance that tends to flow and to conform to the outline of a container such as a liquid or a gas. Fluids include aqueous and non-aqueous liquids, gases, and solutions including dissolved soluble constituents, mixtures, emulsions, suspensions including insoluble dispersed or entrained constituents, colloids, oils, solvents, ionic fluids or molten salts, air, energetic plasmas, and the like. Fluids also include biological and bodily fluids such as cytoplasm, saliva, mucus, blood, plasma, urine, bile, milk, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, and the like. Fluids can also exist in a thermodynamic state near the critical point, as in supercritical fluids.","As used herein, \u201cparticle\u201d refers to any discrete phase or material, chemical, or biological entity distinct and\/or distinguishable from the fluid in which it is suspended, dispersed, emulsified, mixed, entrained, or otherwise situated. Particles include but are not limited to powder, dust, soot, micro- and nanobeads, micro- and nanoparticles, micro- and nanocrystals, micro- and nanorods, micro- and nanofibers, micro- and nanospheres, micro- and nanotubes, colloids, quantum dots, droplets, bubbles, aerosols and mists, gels, micelles and reverse-micelles, aggregates and agglomerates of smaller subunits, and the like. Particles may be polymers, ceramics, glasses, oxides, oils, hydrocarbons, graphene, buckminsterfullerene, carbon nanotubes, organic or inorganic compounds or complexes, coordination or chelate complexes, salts, minerals, organometallic compounds, metal-organic frameworks, metals including aluminum, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iridium, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, platinum, selenium, scandium, silver, titanium, uranium, vanadium, and the like, alloys and multiphase solid mixtures, heterogeneous and composite materials, semiconductors including silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, silicon carbide, cadmium selenide, dielectric insulators, and the like. Particles can be macromolecules, amino acids, peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, nucleotides, nucleic acid molecules, carbohydrates, lipids, lectins, cells, viruses, viral particles, bacteria, organelles, liposomes, spores, protozoa, yeasts, molds, fungi, pollens, diatoms, synthetic or engineered biological assemblies, and the like, toxins, biotoxins, hormones, steroids, immunoglobulins, antibodies, supermolecular assemblies, ligands, and the like. Particles may be catalytic materials, zeolites, dyes, lubricants, chemical warfare agents, explosives, propellants, agents used in explosives and propellants, environmental pollutants, pesticides, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, and the like.","As used herein, \u201ccrystallization\u201d refers generally to the process and various sub-processes involved in the formation of a new solid phase from a fluid phase, or the modification of that solid phase after its initial nucleation. As such, crystallization is understood for our purposes to encompass all particle formation processes regardless of whether their product is crystalline in nature. Crystallization sub-processes principally consist of nucleation and growth, but can also depend upon concurrent and\/or competitive processes such as attrition, aggregation, agglomeration, dissolution, changes of state, etc. The interplay of these various factors in the crystallization process ultimately determines the character, morphology, and size distribution of resulting particles.","As used herein, \u201cnucleation\u201d refers to the initial stage of a crystallization or particle growth process in which molecules in a fluid phase coalesce to form a solid phase particle of sufficient size and persistence that it does not immediately re-dissolve. As used herein, \u201cgrowth\u201d refers generally to the process by which particle nuclei increase in size as additional material from the fluid phase coalesces around the existing nuclei causing them to increase in physical extent, typically from the nanometer scale to micrometer size or larger.","As used herein, \u201cmicroreactor\u201d, \u201cmicrofluidic reactor\u201d, \u201cflow mixer\u201d or \u201cfluid flow mixer\u201d singly or in some combination thereof will be used interchangeably and synonymously.","As used herein, \u201chydraulic diameter\u201d refers approximately to the cross-sectional dimensions of a fluid channel which is not necessarily circular in cross-section. Hydraulic diameter is conventionally defined as four times the cross sectional area of a channel divided by the wetted perimeter of the cross section. For filled circular channels, the diameter and hydraulic diameter are identical. For our purposes, hydraulic diameter will be used when comparing relative channel sizes when terms like diameter, depth, width, or height are ambiguous or not readily applicable due to channel geometry.","The invention disclosed herein consists of a laminar flow mixer on a microfluidic chip that can produce a coaxial flow arrangement suitable for use in particle synthesis microreactor applications, flow cytometry, or chemical analysis applications.","Providing context for the discussion of the embodiments of the invention to follow,  depicts a general and non-restrictive, representative schematic overview of a planar three-stream microfluidic system  typical of chip-based microreactor and flow cytometry applications. Said microfluidic system consists of a bonded assembly of a top substrate  and a bottom substrate . Fluidic channels and features are patterned or fabricated onto one or both substrates so that enclosed microfluidic channels are formed between them. Microfluidic system  further comprises a system of such channels including a central core channel  and two sheath channels , all of which meet at a fluidic junction, confluence, or mixer . Flow entering said mixer from said core and sheath channels proceeds into a downstream channel . Fluid is introduced into core channel  through a core inlet , while fluid is introduced into sheath channels  through sheath inlets . Flow in downstream channel  leaves the microfluidic system through downstream outlet . In , core inlet  and sheath inlets  are depicted as holes, vias, ports, or surface fluidic connections otherwise made through top substrate  and\/or bottom substrate  to the underlying microchannels. Downstream outlet  is depicted as an opening, port, orifice, or fluidic edge connection otherwise made on the peripheral surface of microfluidic system , where downstream channel  emerges between top substrate  and bottom substrate . Any combination of top or bottom surface or edge connections is appropriate for said inlets and said outlet in such a microfluidic system, and such connections to external fluid handling devices or systems may be readily implemented by techniques common to the art.","While  presents a very simple microfluidic design for illustrative purposes, mixer elements  can be incorporated into much more complex microfluidic systems with very different channel layouts, multiple inlets or outlets, inlets or outlets shared by multiple channels or coupled to external manifolds, branching or intersecting channels, or fluidic junctions delivering the output of the mixer to multiple downstream channels , and the like. In a real-world implementation, for example, it could be beneficial for fluid entering sheath channels  to be delivered through a single, common, or shared sheath inlet  to assure that sheath flow is delivered to mixer  in symmetrical fashion.","Providing further context for the discussion to follow,  depict close-up generalized plan-view configurations possible for fluidic junction or mixer . Sheath channels  are assumed to intersect core channel  in substantially symmetrical fashion before merging at mixer  into downstream channel . A flanking wall  to either side of core channel  defines the geometry around which fluid from core channel  and sheath channels  must flow before interacting.  shows sheath channels  meeting core channel  at right angles.  shows sheath channels  meeting core channel  at an acute angle.  shows sheath channels  meeting core channel  at a highly acute angle in which flanking wall  is tapered to a point and both core and sheath channels are substantially parallel before meeting in mixer .  shows an alternative configuration in which core channel  and sheath channels  are parallel as they enter mixer , but flanking wall  is not tapered. In practice, the minimum width of flanking wall  as depicted in  and  is determined largely by the surface area required to successfully bond or seal the flanking wall feature when top and bottom substrates are joined to form combined microfluidic system.","The concept of hydrodynamic focusing is illustrated schematically in  for representative parallel (, B, C) and orthogonal (, E, F) mixing junctions. In , core and sheath flow streams enter mixer  with equal velocities, yielding an unfocused core stream  with core\/sheath interface dimensions comparable to those of core channel . In , the flow velocity in sheath channels  is much larger than the velocity of core channel . In this case, viscous drag rapidly accelerates the core flow stream, effectively squeezing it in the lateral transverse dimension and elongating it in the axial direction to produce a hydrodynamically focused core stream . In this simplified example, focused core stream  is said to be two-dimensionally focused (i.e. only focused in the lateral and axial dimensions). A core stream focused in the vertical dimension (i.e. out-of-plane) as well as laterally and axially is said to be three-dimensionally focused. In , flow in core channel  initially has a higher velocity than that in sheath channels . As a result, viscous drag between core and sheath rapidly decelerates the core flow, causing it to expand in the lateral dimension and producing a defocused core stream .","The embodiment of  provides a first representation of an on-chip coaxial mixer section, with  showing the geometry of a single half mixer section  and  illustrating the joining of two substantially identical copies of said half mixer section in mirror image to create a complete mixer , as previously referenced in the discussion of .

As such, following the discussion of the embodiment of , only half mixer sections  are presented explicitly.","Full mixer  in , and by inference any full\/complete mixer assembled from half mixer sections  depicted in the various embodiments of , , , , , , or , is assumed to be fabricated and to function in the context of a microfluidic system functionally resembling the system  depicted in .

This kind of mixing-point crystallization is most pronounced for particles precipitated at relatively high super-saturations (i.e., high reagent concentrations relative to the final solubility of the precipitated compound), compounds with relatively fast reaction\/precipitation kinetics, and materials that preferentially nucleate on surfaces. Rapid particle nucleation at the mixing point is highly undesirable as it almost invariably results in clogging of the system, disruption of downstream flow uniformity, and dramatic variations in the morphology and size distribution of any crystals recovered. These complications also affect the operation of the coaxial mixing embodiments described above.","In order to overcome the problem of mixing-point crystallization, the inventors have developed a sequential staged coaxial mixer depicted in . The sequential staged coaxial mixer comprises a plurality of coaxial mixers arranged in serial fluidic communication such that the coaxial core\/sheath outflow of each upstream mixer becomes the core flow input of the next mixer downstream, and so forth.

Introduction of additional reactants to an otherwise fully-reacted stream bearing particles offers one approach for growing those particles to a larger size. Downstream coaxial mixers can also provide sequential surface treatments or functionalization of particles in the central flow stream. Alternately, staged serial mixers can enable the production of heterogeneous composite particles, where seed crystals of one material are precipitated in an upstream mixer, providing a substrate for the nucleation and growth of a different material in downstream reactor\/mixer stages.","A further benefit of sequential staged coaxial mixers arises from the observation that particles in some pressure driven flow regimes will naturally tend to congregate due to hydrodynamic forces into a narrow annular region as a function of their size and flow conditions (G. Segre and A. Silberberg, \u201cRadial particle displacements in Poseiulle flow of suspensions,\u201d 1961, v.189 (no. 4760): pp. 209-210). This fact may be exploited in a system using sequentially staged mixers. By matching the dimensions of the core\/sheath interface to this annular region, uniformity may be enhanced by assuring that growing particles remain localized at the reacting interface to serve as seeds on which subsequent growth due to diffusion of the reacting species can occur. Alternately, it may be desirable to position the reacting interface either inside or outside this annular congregation region to allow new nuclei to form independent of older crystals and migrate inward or outward as they grow to some final size. The interplay between reacting interface, hydrodynamic particle segregation, and the tendency of non-axially-symmetric particles to align themselves with respect to a flow stream also provides opportunities for synthesis of novel elongated or composite structures, particularly in cases where multiple staged sheath flows are employed. Alternately, these influences may be used to promote the growth of highly axially-symmetric particles.","The spatial arrangement of particle-laden flow lamina and subsequently added sheath flows can be altered or even inverted by varying mixer orifice geometry and microchannel design progressively from stage to stage. For example, as a centrally positioned particle-laden flow emerges from a mixer core into a sheath of Reactant A, particles will gradually distribute themselves radially toward their preferred position on outlying streamlines. When a second sheath is introduced (perhaps inert) and a second flow expansion provided, particles will again redistribute themselves outward, effectively migrating by stages from their original positions in the core (now dominated by Reactant A) to their final positions in the sheath. When a final sheath flow of Reactant B is introduced, the particles will already be positioned optimally at the interface to seed the reaction between Reactant A in the core and Reactant B in the outer sheath. The relative rates of diffusion versus particle migration in these successively sheathed and re-sheathed particle-bearing flows as they undergo radial contraction and expansion will determine in which flow regimes this approach is likely to be most successful.","Sequentially staged coaxial microreactors or fluid mixers offer other options for manipulating the particle growth and development process. Once focused at the centerline by passage through a coaxial mixing structure like the embodiments of , , , , or , the expansion or contraction of a sheath flow around this centralized particle stream offers two notable opportunities to influence particle development. First, in the same way that hydrodynamic focusing of a particle-laden core flow stream elongates it axially, increases axial inter-particle spacing, and reduces its radial extent, rapidly expanding or defocusing such a flow will tend to compress it axially and decrease inter-particle spacing, potentially promoting particle-particle interactions, aggregation, and\/or agglomeration. The effect of rapidly focusing or defocusing particle laden flows either hydrodynamically or through manipulations of channel geometry may also be enhanced depending on particle size and density. Smaller, heavier particles may be less likely to disperse radially in a rapidly dilating flow, whereas larger, low density particles dominated by viscous drag are more likely to track a rapidly diverging streamline in a flow dilation.","Expanding or contracting the sheath flow around a centrally focused particle-laden stream in a serial reactor provides a means to control the rate at which sheath reactants arrive at the core-bound particle stream, effectively moderating the crystal growth process. In a wide channel, growth may occur in a transport-limited regime as reactants in the outer reaches of the sheath take longer to reach the central particle stream. When the channel narrows, the furthest extent of the outer reactant stream may fall within the effective diffusion length of the stream under those conditions, corresponding to a much more rapid arrival of reacting species at the crystal stream and crystal growth which is kinetically limited rather than transport limited. Modulation of the flow between these transport regimes provides opportunities to construct novel heterostructured particles possessing alternating concentric layers of material characteristic of transport- and kinetically-limited growth, in addition to those composite structures made possible through the more general serialization of mixing operations described above.","In addition to the sequential staged coaxial mixer described above, multi-layered concentric coaxial flow arrangements can also be produced through parallelization of basic on-chip coaxial flow embodiments like those of , , , , or . Because these designs enable the production of coaxial flows from a substantially planar arrangement of fluidic channels, it is possible to nest these designs in concentric parallel fashion by disposing progressively larger pairs of outer sheath channels about the basic sheath\/core\/sheath mixer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0087","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 14A","FIG. 1","FIG. 5A","FIG. 12B"],"b":["1500","105","107","110","115","150","120","1520","125","1525","150","140","145","1500","110","150","120","1520","1560"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 12C","b":["150","150","110","120","1520","1520","1410","310","120","140","150","310","1410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 8A","FIG. 4"],"b":["155","5","6","8","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0094"},"figref":["FIG. 13A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["155","500","110","120","1640","520","200","700","710","510","1620","1640","1620","140","110","120","1600","120","1620","1670","1640","1610"]},"Another aspect of the invention is shown in  comprising a nested coaxial mixer in which core channel  and sheath channels  flow into downstream channel  at the same axial plane, without first merging into an intermediate downstream channel  like that depicted in .

In general, on-chip mixer embodiments described herein operate with flow rates in the laminar regime corresponding to Reynolds numbers substantially in the range 0.001 to 100. Substantially above this range, vorticity and mixing due to flow recirculation begin to compromise the uniformity of the reacting interface in the mixers. As noted above, smoothing the geometry of core and sheath confluence and minimizing the area of core face  where practical can delay the onset of vorticity until higher Reynolds numbers are reached.","Typical feature dimensions of the embodiments of the invention described herein are constrained primarily by fabrication process limitations. General-purpose lithographic processes yield minimum feature sizes substantially on the order of 1 micron. Anisotropic plasma etching processes (e.g., deep reactive ion etching of silicon) can readily create features hundreds of microns deep, while etching structures substantially deeper than a few tens of microns with wet isotropic etching (e.g., etching quartz with hydrofluoric acid) can prove challenging. Accordingly, a typical example of the embodiment of  might have core channel  diameter of 20 microns, sheath channels  with typical width and depth of 70 microns, flanking walls  of 20 micron width, and flanking wall undercuts  and face undercut  of 20 microns radius. For such a mixer geometry, a typical operating regime for three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing might include a core flow rate of 1 \u03bcL\/min and combined sheath flow rates of 150 \u03bcL\/min, yielding a roughly 8:1 sheath:core velocity ratio. In general design terms, for a given implementation of a particular mixer embodiment, sheath channels  are currently preferred to be substantially at least twice as deep in the direction normal to the substrate surface as core channel . For embodiments with undercut features that enable true three-dimensional core\/sheath focusing the relative degree of lateral and vertical focusing depends on sheath channel , flanking wall undercut , and face undercut  geometries. Deeper, narrower sheath channels tend to enhance vertical focusing, while wider, shallower sheath channels yield greater lateral focusing. Similarly, larger flanking wall undercuts  and\/or face undercuts  enhance vertical focusing. In general, the greater the extent of flanking wall and face undercuts, the more closely the on-chip mixer will approximate nearly ideal coaxial flow and 3D hydrodynamic focusing. The depth and\/or lateral extent of each flanking wall undercut  is currently preferred to be substantially one-quarter or more of the maximum width of core channel face .","Modeling suggests that geometries substantially minimizing the angle of the core\/sheath channel intersection like those depicted in  are generally preferred to geometries with larger angle intersections like those depicted in . As noted above, it is also preferable to minimize the area of core channel face  by tapering lateral flanking walls  and\/or increasing the extent of face undercut . In general, provided that it is substantially symmetrical, the particular geometry of core orifice  (e.g., circular, oblong, rectangular, etc.) in any of the embodiments considered has only an incidental effect on final core\/sheath interface geometry and flow focusing. As such, orifice geometries depicted for each embodiment of the invention should not be construed as restrictive.","One limitation to the practicality of micro fluidic particle generating reactors is imposed by transient operational states occurring at start-up and especially shutdown. When the reacting flow through the system stagnates (as at shutdown), crystal precipitation is no longer confined to an isolated interface in the middle of the flow stream; and crystals will accordingly nucleate and grow in uncontrolled ways on the internal surfaces of the system. Fouling of the channels with particles under these conditions can potentially result in clogging or other undesirable conditions when operation is later resumed. Relative to large-scale reactors, this problem is particularly pronounced in micro scale systems where the surface-to-volume ratio inside the device is much higher.","The most obvious way to avoid crystallization at shutdown is to immediately flush reacting species from the system with an inert liquid (e.g., water) to dilute and sweep out any residual reactants. Complicating this approach is the desirability of transitioning as smoothly as possible from delivery of reactants to delivery of flushing liquid to minimize perturbation of the reacting interface and avoid flow stagnation. By maintaining uninterrupted flow during this transition, the last of the reacting species (and resulting particles) to traverse the system as flushing begins would substantially experience the same reaction history and residence time as the crystals produced during steady-state operation, minimizing particle variability due to the end-of-run flush.","In practice, seamless flow switching between reacting and flushing liquid streams proves very challenging to achieve. Even a fast acting selector valve produces some brief stagnation as it transitions between reacting and flushing fluid lines, and attempts to either synchronize pumps to that transition or pre-pressurize the flushing line ahead of the transition also result in flow disturbances. Delivering reactant and flushing liquids into a common line (e.g., through a tee) and ramping down reactant flow as flushing flow is ramped up to maintain constant flow rate is another option. In this case, however, the average concentration of reactant in the channel will decline gradually during the transition, and its spatial distribution relative to the flushing liquid may be nonuniform, yielding non-ideal reaction conditions when that volume or bolus of reactant reaches the reactor\/mixer. Dual-valve arrangements in which flushing flow is initiated and the flushing valve is opened before the reacting flow is stopped and the reacting valve closed also suffer from finite valving transients and the possibility of \u201coverlapping\u201d reactant and flushing flows. Again, if no steps are taken to segregate particles resulting from these transient periods from the rest of the steady-state product, average particle quality and size distribution of the batch will suffer.","To address these complications, we have conceived and reduced to practice a fluid-queuing technique in which sequential batches of liquid are loaded into a holding volume (typically a high-aspect ratio length\/width channel, capillary, or length of tubing) prior to the start of the particle production run. When the run is started, the contents of each holding volume (one for each reactant flow entering the mixer) are delivered in continuous fashion through the microreactor system. In this way, a bolus of reactant can be followed immediately (with or without a separating bubble or intervening immiscible liquid droplet) by an inert flushing liquid such as water or some other solvent. Virtually any sequence of compatible neighboring fluids can be delivered in this manner, and the degree of mixing at the interface between each bolus, depending on fluid velocity and channel geometry, can be readily predicted using Taylor dispersion calculations familiar in the art. In the preferred embodiment of this method, no bubbles or immiscible liquid separators are required between fluid boluses, as this approach will produce the most uniform reaction and flow conditions during the course of the particle production run.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0105","num":"0109"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A through 15D","FIG. 1"],"b":["1800","1870","1870","115","125","1800"]},"Referring again to , the queued-injection subsystem  comprises a collection of elements interconnected by fluidic channels, capillary, or tubing.

Pump  continues to push the serial arrangement of reagent and flushing fluid boluses through the downstream micro reactor system until no reacting species remain in the microreactor and sufficient flushing fluid has passed to adequately dilute or rinse away any residual reactants.","Referring now to , flushing valve  is activated to make a fluid connection between flushing fluid reservoir  and pump  and activating reagent valve  to make a fluidic connection between holding loop  and reagent reservoir . Pump  is then activated to draw in a volume of flushing fluid corresponding to the sum of both flushing and reagent fluids delivered to the microreactor system, restoring the initial configuration of queued-injection subsystem  prior to the actuation depicted in . If another microreactor run is to be conducted immediately, pump  need only draw in a volume of flushing fluid equal to the volume of flushing fluid delivered to the micro reactor (i.e., not including the reagent delivery volume) before proceeding to the step depicted in .","While depicted in largely conceptual, schematic terms, the components of queued-injection subsystem  could be implemented in a variety of ways providing that the basic operation of the continuous queued-injection approach is retained. Fluid aspiration and injection functionality attributed to pump  could be furnished by any suitable positive displacement pump coupled serially to a fluidic accumulation reservoir, or by other pumps operated in closed-loop fashion with flow and\/or pressure sensors. Suitable fluid delivery means include any pumps capable of generating adequate suction and injection pressures and include syringe or metering pumps, peristaltic pumps, electroosmotic pumps, diaphragm pumps, and the like. Eliminating the need for a separate fluid delivery pump, flushing and reagent fluids could be delivered directly from their respective reservoirs by pressurizing the reservoir head-space. Valve functionality like that described for flushing valve  and reagent valve  could be furnished by manual or automated fluid routing means including three-way valves as described or combinations of two-way valves, check valves, pinch valves, and the like, any of which may be implemented at tubing scale, capillary scale, or on-chip. Fluid storage functionality furnished by flushing fluid reservoir  and reagent reservoir  could be provided by various fluid containment means including vials, bottles, bags, bladders, test- or centrifuge tubes, lengths of tubing or capillary, on-chip channels or chambers, manifolds, elastic envelopes, free-piston syringes, and the like. As noted, fluid containment and delivery functionalities may be combined in some implementations, as in the case of a reservoir with pressurized headspace. Fluid staging functionality like that provided by holding volume  can be provided by any serial queuing means including a fully-swept tube, capillary, or channel of adequate total volume and substantially large length-to-width ratio. Materials should be selected for the serial queuing means such that its inner surfaces are readily rinsed by the flushing fluid of choice, and do not substantially retain reactant species or other impurities which could affect the consistency of microreactor operation.","Discussion of the various embodiments of the invention has focused largely on conventional micromachining substrates, techniques, and materials (e.g. silicon, silicon-on-insulator, glass, quartz, fused-silica, etc.). More generally, however, the embodiments of the present invention may be realized using a variety of inorganic or organic materials, including ceramics, insulators, metals, polymers (e.g. cyclo-olefins, acrylic and poly-methyl methacrylates, fluoropolymers, polyoxymethylenes, polyimides, polyxylylenes, and the like) photo-patternable materials and epoxies (e.g. photoresists, SU-8 resist, spin-on and photo-patternable glasses, and the like), semiconductors, biomaterials, and the like.","As noted, the mixing devices disclosed herein can be readily fabricated in transparent materials like quartz, fused silica, polymers, and the like which are amenable to various optical and spectroscopic particle or fluid diagnostic techniques including elastic, inelastic, quasi-elastic, or dynamic light scattering; multi-angle laser light scattering; microscopic image or video analysis; fluorescence microscopy; hyperspectral imaging; ultraviolet-, visible-, or laser-induced fluorescence; optical absorbance, transmittance, or reflectance; refractive index measurement; absorption, emission, fluorescence, ultraviolet\/visible, x-ray, gamma-ray, infrared, near-infrared, Fourier transform infrared, plasma-emission, Raman, coherent anti-Stokes Raman, surface enhanced Raman, resonance Raman, or photoemission spectroscopy techniques; nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy; or the like. These techniques offer the potential for real-time in-situ characterization, analysis, and quality control of particle generation or reaction processes. Additional diagnostic functionalities applicable to the mixing devices of the present invention could include measurements of electrical impedance, voltage, electrochemical potential, electromagnetic permittivity, dielectric constant, electromagnetic permeability, electrical conductivity, electrical resistance, inductance, capacitance, electric field strength, or magnetic field strength, temperature, thermal conductivity, thermal resistance, heat flux, heat capacity, latent heat, heat of reaction, chemical concentration, particle inertia or mass properties, density, specific gravity, viscosity, particle sedimentation rates, acoustic impedance, or the like.","Additional on-chip elements may be advantageously integrated with the coaxial mixing embodiments described herein, including but not limited to heating and cooling elements, electrodes, optical components, insulative-dielectrophoresis arrays, sampling channels, inertial particle separation structures, dialysis and ion exchange membranes, filters, packed beds, gels, catalytic structures and surfaces, magnets and inductive elements, capacitive sensors, pressure sensors, and the like. Such elements may be integrated into the coaxial mixers themselves or into upstream, intermediate, or downstream stages to provide added control over particle production, reaction, or sample handling processes. Moreover, microreactor elements can be integrated with various means of fluid control, routing, handling, and disposition including pumps, valves, manifolds, mixers, vanes, pillar arrays, junctions, constrictions, dilations, nozzles, diffusers, wicking structures, capillaries, reservoirs, and the like, including arbitrary microchannel configurations substantially different from and more complex than those suggested by the basic representative examples of , A, A, or A.","Particulate materials which may be readily and\/or advantageously produced using the coaxial diffusional mixing microreactor architectures described herein include but are not limited to insoluble or sparingly soluble organic and inorganic salts, other inorganic compounds, metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, catalyst materials, thermoelectric materials, metal-organic frameworks, nanoparticles, quantum dots, organometallic compounds, hydrogen storage materials, organic compounds, biological materials, energetic materials, explosives, fuels, oxidizers, and the like. Particle production from fluid solutions or mixtures due to changes in reaction parameters including but are not limited to physical state, temperature, concentration, activity, solubility, oxidation state, ionization, pH, and the like imposed on chip or by the coaxial mixers themselves is also possible. Coaxial reactors may be adapted for homogeneously catalyzed reactions or catalytic reactions occurring on particles or the interior surfaces of the system.","While primarily targeted at the production of particles to some final size specification (nanometers to tens or hundreds of microns), the systems described here can also be used to generate highly uniform seed crystals for growth to a final desired size by subsequent processes on or off chip, including traditional large-scale continuous or batch processes. Production of larger particles can also be achieved by increasing the fluidic channel size of the microreactor and adjusting the flow rates of reactants to maintain laminar flow conditions. The microreactor and fluidic channels may also be oriented with respect to gravity (e.g. vertically) to avoid difficulties associated with particle settling or buoyancy as particle size increases.","The coaxial reactor designs described herein also provide favorable means for producing various multi-phase coaxial flows, either in the form of continuous streams of different fluid phases or streams of serially produced discrete fluidic volumes. These multiphase streams can take the form of immiscible liquid droplets produced by the core flow channel in a liquid sheath flow, liquid aerosol droplets in a gaseous sheath flow, gas bubbles in a liquid sheath flow, or liquid-encapsulated gas bubbles in a gaseous sheath flow, and the like. The coaxial mixer geometry can also enable the serial production of lamellar structures based on amphiphilic or hydrophobic\/hydrophilic molecules such as micelles, reverse micelles, liposomes, multi-wall vesicles, and the like. Multiphase streams can be generated either by pulsing or otherwise relatively modulating the core and sheath flows, by forming thin elongated streams which collapse into individual droplets due to surface tension effects (Rayleigh instability) or vortex shear, by using actively controlled means such as local heating\/cooling, electrowetting, intermittent laser illumination, electromagnetic fields, and the like, or by local surface treatment of the core flow orifice, core channel face, flanking walls, or sheath channels to yield a flow resistance which will be overcome periodically by accumulated upstream channel pressure (e.g. a hydrophobic zone past which an aqueous droplet will move only when the pressure exceeds some threshold, etc.), and the like.","Beyond particle and droplet production, the coaxial mixing architecture presented herein can also be applied to the manufacture of elongated threads or rods of well-defined geometry produced by continuous crystallization, polymerization, or multi-stage precipitation-aggregation processes in the reacting stream. Coaxial reaction schemes may also offer benefits to non-precipitation or non-particle producing reactions, gas generating reactions, reacting gas-gas laminar flows, reacting plasmas, or purely liquid-liquid reactions due to the symmetry and uniformity of the reacting interface and the independence of free-stream reactions from wall interactions and surface chemistry. As such, these structures can further be adapted for use in combustion or thrust-production applications, combining streams of fuel and oxidizer or other energetically-reacting species.","The ability of the coaxial flow mixer described here to produce three-dimensional hydrodynamically focused flow in a chip-based format also offers advantages for non-reacting flow systems in which it is desirable for one flow component and its constituents to be introduced into another in a very well-defined and spatially constrained manner. Such applications include flow cytometry and related techniques for cell and particle counting, detection, analysis, manipulation, measurement, sorting, or separation. Sample particles entrained\/suspended in the fluid are introduced through the core channel, focused by the core\/sheath mixer into a very thin, centrally positioned stream, and interrogated as they pass in single-file serial fashion through the focus of a laser spot or other detection, analysis, or sorting means.","While smooth, steady, laminar flow is assumed as the preferred operating regime for producing particles with the coaxial flow designs presented herein, benefits may be realized in some applications for operating such a system at higher Reynolds numbers, particularly in regimes where stable laminar vortices or recirculations can be established. These conditions offer the ability to furnish enhanced advective mixing which offers benefits for system flushing\/cleaning and applications where rapid mixing is preferable to slower but more uniform diffusive mixing. The ability to transition readily from recirculating to non-recirculating flow by simply adjusting microreactor flow rates or channel geometries potentially enables novel modes of operation and offers an opportunity to measurably distinguish or partition different segments of a continuous flow or to modulate mixing conditions to smooth\/delineate the transition between operating states."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 2A through 2D","FIG. 1"],"b":"150"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 3A through 3F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A through 7N","FIG. 6A"],"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A through 8C","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A through 9N","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A and 10B","FIG. 8A","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A and 11B","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A through 12C","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A and 13B","FIG. 8A","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 14A through 14C","FIG. 14A","FIG. 14B","FIG. 14C","FIG. 8A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIGS. 15A through 15D","FIG. 15A","FIG. 15B","FIG. 15C","FIG. 15D","FIG. 15A"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
