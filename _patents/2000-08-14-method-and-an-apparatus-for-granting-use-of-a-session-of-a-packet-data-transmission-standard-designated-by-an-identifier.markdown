{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["I. Field of the Invention","The current invention relates to communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method, an apparatus, and an article of manufacture for granting a terminal, which is establishing a communication with a network access server via a non-trusted access network, use of a previously established session of a packet data transmission standard.","II. Description of the Related Art","With an increasing popularity of both wireless communications and network\u2014especially Internet\u2014applications, various methods and systems are under development to allow a user of a wireless device to access email, web pages, and other network resources. Because information on the Internet is organized into discrete \u201cpackets\u201d of data, these services are often referred to as \u201cpacket data services.\u201d","Several multiple-access communication system techniques are considered to provide wireless packet data services. Among the different types of wireless communication systems are time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), AM modulation schemes such as amplitude companded single sideband (ACSSB) modulation, and code division multiple access (CDMA). These communication systems have been standardized to facilitate interoperation between equipment manufactured by different companies. In particular, CDMA communications systems have been standardized in the United States in Telecommunications Industry Association TIA\/EIA\/IS-95-B, entitled \u201cMOBILE STATION-BASE STATION COMPATIBILITY STANDARD FOR DUAL-MODE WIDEBAND SPREAD SPECTRUM CELLULAR SYSTEM,\u201d hereinafter referred to as IS-95.","The International Telecommunications Union recently requested a submission of proposed methods for providing high-rate data and high-quality speech services over wireless communication channels. A first proposal was issued by the Telecommunications Industry Association, entitled \u201cThe cdma2000 ITU-R RTT Candidate Submission.\u201d The proposal issued as an Industry Standard 2000 (IS-2000). A second proposal was issued by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), entitled \u201cThe ETSI UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) ITU-R RTT Candidate Submission,\u201d also known as \u201cwideband CDMA,\u201d and hereinafter referred to as W-CDMA. A third proposal was submitted by U.S. task group (TG) 8\/1, entitled \u201cThe UWC-136 Candidate Submission,\u201d hereinafter referred to as EDGE. The contents of these submissions are of public record and are well known in the art.","In wireless communication systems, there are significant differences between the requirements for providing voice and data services. Such differences, well known in the art, result in compromises in design of hybrid high-rate data and high-quality speech wireless communication systems. Consequently, where only data services are required, (e.g., Internet or fax transmissions) a wireless communication system optimized for transmission of high data rates (HDR) may be used. An exemplary HDR system defines a set of data rates at which data are transmitted and received by a wireless station, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps. Such a system is disclosed in a co-pending application Ser. No. 08\/963,386, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION,\u201d filed Nov. 3, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,211, issued Jun. 3, 2003, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.","Several Internet Protocol (IP) standards have been developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to facilitate mobile packet data services for Internet. Mobile IP is one such standard, and was designed to allow a device having an IP address to exchange data with the Internet while physically traveling throughout a network (or networks). Mobile IP is described in detail in IETF request for comments (RFC), entitled \u201cIP Mobility Support,\u201d and incorporated herein by reference.","The framing and transmission of IP data through a CDMA wireless network is well known in the art and has been described in TIA\/EIA\/IS-707-A standard, entitled \u201cDATA SERVICE OPTIONS FOR SPREAD SPECTRUM SYSTEM,\u201d hereinafter referred to as IS-707.","Several other IETF standards set forth techniques referred to in the above-named references. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is well known in the art and is described in IETF RFC 1661, entitled \u201cThe Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)\u201d and published in July 1994, hereinafter referred to as PPP. PPP includes a Link Control Protocol (LCP) and several Network Control Protocols (NCP) used for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols over a PPP link.","One such NCP is the Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP), well known in the art and described in IETF RFC 1332, entitled \u201cThe PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP),\u201d published in May of 1992, and hereinafter referred to as IPCP. Extensions to the LCP are well known in the art and described in IETF RFC 1570, entitled \u201cPPP LCP Extensions,\u201d published in January 1994, and hereinafter referred to as LCP.","Access terminals, e.g., cellular or personal communication systems (PCS) telephones with Internet connections, typically transmit packet data over a network by establishing a session of a packet data transmission standard with a packet network access server (NAS), e.g., a packet data service node (PDSN). The session of a packet data transmission standard is usually a PPP connection (or PPP instance, or PPP session). The access terminal (T) sends packets across an RF (radio frequency) interface, e.g., a CDMA interface, to a radio access network (RAN). The RAN establishes the PPP instance with the PDSN. More than one such PPP instance may be established contemporaneously (e.g., if a telephone and a laptop each require a connection). IP data packets are routed between the PDSN and the Internet.","When an access terminal changes from one RAN (e.g., an HDR system) to another RAN (e.g., an IS-2000 system) connected to the same NAS, the new RAN establishes a new session of a packet data transmission standard. This action is time consuming because the T must go through the session initiation, and non-transparent to the T because the T must obtain a new IP address.","A method, an apparatus, and an article of manufacture are disclosed to grant a terminal, which is establishing a communication with a network access server via a non-trusted access network, use of a session of a packet data transmission standard designated by an identifier, when a previously established security association between the terminal and the access network can be verified.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method and an apparatus that allow a terminal, to request a communication with a network access server using a session of the standard for packet data transmission designated by an identifier, and use of the requested session when a security association between the access terminal and the network access server is verified.","In another aspect of the invention, a terminal establishes a communication with a network access server via a first access network using a session of the standard for packet data transmission, which is designated by an identifier. A security association between the terminal and the network access server is then established. When a communication is requested between the network access server and the terminal via a second access network using the session of the standard for packet data transmission designated by the identifier, use of the designated session is allowed when the security association is verified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"100"},"In one embodiment, an access terminal (\u201cAT\u201d or \u201cT\u201d)  is a wireless device, mobile or stationary, advantageously capable of performing one or more wireless packet data protocols. In one embodiment, the T  is not connected to any external device, such as a laptop, and the T  runs a protocol for packet data transmission, such as PPP. In an alternative embodiment, the T  is connected to an external device, wherein a protocol for packet data transmission is run on the external device. The protocol may comprise a Network Layer RInterface Protocol Option described in IS-707, a Relay Layer RInterface Protocol Option described in the aforementioned IS-707, or any other applicable protocols known to one skilled in the art.","When a communication between the T  and a radio access network (RAN)  over a communication channel  is requested, the RAN  authenticates the T . The authentication may be carried out in accordance with a method as described in a U.S. Application filed Dec. 3, 1999, Ser. No. 09\/453,612, entitled \u201cMETHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTHENTICATION IN A WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,785,823, issued Aug. 31, 2004, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. In a particular embodiment, the RAN  is a HDR system. However, other alternate multiple access modulation techniques, including TDMA, IS-2000, W-CDMA, and EDGE may be used as will be explained.","The RAN  then activates a packet control function (PCF) (not shown), which requests a network access server (NAS)  to initiate a session of the standard for packet data transmission, and to grant the T  a use of an IP address. In one embodiment, the NAS  is a Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The NAS  then sets up an interface  between the RAN  and the NAS . In one embodiment, the interface between the RAN  and the NAS  comprises an A10\/A11 protocol.","A security association between the NAS  and the T  is established. In a particular embodiment, the NAS  creates a session key (NASKey). The NAS  also creates an identifier (TID) for identification of the session of the packet data transmission standard associated with the T . The NAS  then binds the interface  and the IP address with the TID and the NASKey. The NAS  and the T  then exchange the NASKey. In one embodiment the NASkey exchange is performed in accordance with the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,770, entitled \u201cCRYPTOGRAPHIC APPARATUS AND METHOD,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. The T  then binds the received TID to the NASKey, and stores the TID and the NASKey.","The T  then communicates with the IP network  by encapsulating the IP packets for the IP network  into frames destined for a NAS , and delivers the IP packets to the NAS  via the RAN . In one embodiment the IP packets are encapsulated using a point-to-point protocol (PPP) and the resultant PPP byte stream is transmitted to the RAN  using a modulation scheme employed by the RAN . The RAN  sends the received frames to the NAS . The NAS  extracts the IP packets from the received frames using the same protocol for packet data transmission that was used by the T  for encapsulation. After the NAS  extracts the IP packets from the data stream, the NAS  routes the IP packets to the IP network . Conversely, the NAS  can receive IP packets from the IP network , encapsulate the IP packets into frames, and deliver the frames via the RAN  to the T .","When a user (not shown) of a public switched telephone network (PSTN)  desires to communicate with the T , the PSTN  notifies a mobile switch center (MSC) . The MSC  sends a paging request to a RAN  via an interface . In a particular embodiment, the RAN  comprises a system in accordance with IS-2000. Consequently, the data is wirelessly transmitted using CDMA multiple access techniques, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,459, entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM\u201d, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307, entitled \u201cSPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS,\u201d both assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. However, one skilled in the art recognizes that the invention is equally applicable when the RAN  and the RAN  do not have a common means for authentication of the T . Therefore, other alternate multiple access modulation techniques, including HDR, TDMA, W-CDMA, and EDGE might be used.","Upon receiving the paging request, the RAN  sends a page to the T  over the communication channel , and the T  changes its communication mode to the communication mode of the RAN . The T  then sends a page response to the RAN . Upon receiving the page response, the RAN  and the MSC  establish communication in accordance with the appropriate protocol. In one embodiment, the protocol comprises the Inter-operability Specification (IOS) for IS-2000 Access Network Interfaces. The T  and the RAN  then setup a voice call. In one embodiment, the voice call is setup in accordance with IS-2000.","When the voice call ends, the T  and the NAS  may initiate a data call via the RAN . The T  identifies the session of the packet data transmission standard that the T  wishes to use by sending the TID to the RAN . The RAN  requests the NAS  to connect an A10\/A11 interface  to the session of the standard for packet data transmission associated with the T  designated by the TID.","The NAS  may challenge the T  to ensure that a rogue T (not shown) is not attempting to redirect the traffic that is destined to the T  to another HDR RAN. The NAS  has discretion to initiate the challenge that is performed, in general, when a new A10\/A11 interface is being set-up. For example, a NAS and a T do not have to carry out the challenge\/response each time the T establishes a traffic channel. The challenge-response is carried out using the NASKey, which has been exchanged between the NAS  and the T  when the T  initiated communication via the RAN . If the T  successfully passes the challenge, the NAS  establishes the A10\/A11 interface  from the RAN  to the session of the standard for packet data transmission designated by TID. If the challenge fails, the NAS  responds in accordance with security measures established in the network. For example, the NAS  may treat the challenged T (rogue T or T ) as a new T trying to access the network. The NAS  then initiates a new session of the standard for packet data transmission, and creates a mechanism for authentication of the challenged T and for identification of the session. The NAS  may also treat the challenged T as a rogue T and refuse any communication.","The T  then communicates with the IP network  by encapsulating the IP packets for the IP network  into frames destined for a NAS , and delivers the IP packets to the NAS  via the RAN .","One skilled in the art recognizes that the T  change from the RAN  to the RAN  may be caused by circumstances other than an incoming voice call as described. For example, the T  can move from a coverage area of the RAN  to a coverage area of the RAN .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"In block , a communication between a T and a NAS via a first RAN is established by initiating a session of a packet data transmission standard. The session is designated by an identifier associated with the T (TID or ATID). The method then proceeds to block .","In block , a security association between the NAS and the T is established by exchanging a session key (NASKey) between the NAS and the T. The T and the NAS then exchange data. The method then proceeds to block .","In block , a determination whether change of RAN is required is made. If change of RAN is not required, the method returns to block . If change of RAN is required, the method proceeds in block .","In block , the T requests the NAS to establish a communication by identifying the session of the packet data transmission standard the T wishes to use.","The T identifies the session by sending the TID to the NAS via the second RAN. The method then proceeds to block .","In block , the NAS determines whether to challenge the T to verify that the T is the owner of the requested session of the packet data transmission standard. If the NAS determines that no challenge is necessary, the method proceeds to block . If the NAS decides to challenge the T, the method continues in block .","In block , the T responds to the challenge using the NASKey. The NAS determines whether the response was satisfactory. If the response was satisfactory, the method proceeds to block . If the response was unsatisfactory the method proceeds to block .","In block , the NAS establishes the A10\/A11 interface from the second RAN to the session of the standard for packet data transmission designated by TID, if the access terminal successfully passes the challenge. The T and the NAS then exchange data.","In block , the NAS responds in accordance with security measures established in the network.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"300"},"The apparatus  comprises a processor  and storage medium  accessible by the processor and containing a set of instructions readable and executable by the processor .","Although particular protocols were used when describing the above-mentioned embodiments, one skilled in the art recognizes that other protocols may be used without departing form a scope of this invention. Thus, for example, in one embodiment the T  generates IP packets, and the NAS  is coupled to the IP network . One skilled in the art recognizes that alternate embodiments could use formats and protocols other than IP. In addition, the NAS  may be coupled to a network capable of employing protocols other than IP. Likewise, in one embodiment the T  has the ability to perform RLP (Radio Link Protocol), PPP, Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and Mobile IP. In a particular embodiment, the RAN  communicates with the T  using RLP. In one embodiment, the NAS  supports PPP functionality, including Link Control Protocol (LCP), CHAP, and the PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP).","Furthermore, although a wireless communication system comprising a T and a RAN was used to communicate with the NAS, one skilled in the art would recognize that other communication systems (whether wireless or not) may be used. In particular, when a T attempts to communicate with a NAS via a non-trusted access network, the scope of the invention, as disclosed in the described embodiments, is applicable.","Those of skill in the art would understand that the various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both.
