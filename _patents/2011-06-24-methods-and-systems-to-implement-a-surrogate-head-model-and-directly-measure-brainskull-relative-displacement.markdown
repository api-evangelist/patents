title: Methods and systems to implement a surrogate head model and directly measure brain/skull relative displacement
abstract: A human surrogate head model (HSHM) to measure brain/skull displacement due to a physical force, such as due to an explosive, ballistic, or automotive crash type of event. A HSHM may include a plurality of magnetic field generators positioned stationary relative to a HSHM skull, each to generate a magnetic field oriented with respect to a corresponding one of multiple directions. The HSHM may include one or more electromagnetic force (EMF)-based displacement sensors, each of which may include three inductive coils oriented orthogonally with respect to one another and co-aligned about a central point. A signal processor may be implemented to separate signals generated by each coil of each EMF-based displacement sensor into a plurality of component magnitudes, each attributable to a corresponding one of the magnetic fields. A computer-implemented model may be implemented to correlate between the component magnitudes and a corresponding position and orientation of the displacement sensor.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Technical Field","Disclosed herein are methods and systems to implement a physical model, including housing and a gelatinous material therein, and to measure displacements of the gelatinous material in response to a physical force experienced by the model. The model may be used as a surrogate head model to measure brain\/skull displacement due to a physical force, such as due to an explosive, ballistic, or automotive crash type of event.","2. Related Art","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) defines a traumatic brain injury as a blow, jolt or penetrating impact to the head that disrupts normal brain function. According to a 2006 CDC study, over 1.4 million people sustain a TBI in the U.S. each year. Of those, 235,000 are hospitalized, and 50,000 die.","While leading causes of TBI are falls and motor vehicle accidents, military-related blast injuries are an increasingly important etiology for TBI. According to a 2008 RAND study, approximately 320,000 U.S. individuals involved in U.S. military deployments over the past decade experienced a probable TBI.","Improved interceptive properties of helmets have contributed to increased soldier survivability through the prevention of penetrating injuries. However, the number of casualties exhibiting signs of non-penetrating head injury due to blast exposure has also increased.","Physical models of the human head have been developed to gain insight into blast exposure.","Nahum, et al. (1968), and Trosseille, et al. (1992), performed experiments with post mortem human subjects (PMHS), by attaching pressure transducers and neutral density accelerometers to the skull to measure acceleration of the head and pressures in the brain.","General Motors Corporation developed a device, referred to a Hybrid III anthropomorphic test device (AID), around 1973, to evaluate automotive occupant safety. The device includes a headform having a cast aluminum skull and vinyl rubber exterior skin. The exterior anthropometry of the Hybrid III headform is reasonably accurate from a basic plane upward. Mass characteristics of the headform are similar to those of a human, with replication of rigid body head kinematics. The headform may include instrumentation to measure of linear and angular accelerations in three orthogonal directions. Physical properties of the aluminum skull are not, however, representative of those of a human skull. In addition, the headform does not include a brain stimulant material. Transmission and reflection of a blast wave is thus likely to be dissimilar to that of a human head.","Margulies, (1987), Thibault, et al. (1987), and Thibault, et al. (1990), studied a test fixture having cranial sections filled with silicone gel, and an orthogonal grid placed between layers of the gel. In the studies, the test fixture was subjected to an acceleration pulse. High speed photography was used to capture deformation of the grid, from which displacements and strains could be computed. This technique was also used by Meaney, et al. (1995), in a study to correlate in-vitro tissue modeling with histologic and radiologic evidence of axonal injury to predict regions of injury from experimental and analytical analysis, and (Meaney, et al., 1995).","Hardy, et al. (1996), and Hardy, et al. (1997), used neutral density targets (NDTs), placed within PMHS brains, and a speed bi-planar x-ray system to measure local brain displacement, from which strains could be computed.","Hardy, et al. (2001), used an array of NDTs arranged in two columns in a severed head. The first column contained five or six NDTs and was located in the occipitoparietal region and the temporoparietal region of the brain. A suspension test fixture was used for testing the inverted perfused, human cadaver heads and the test fixture.","Ivarsson, et al. (2006), Bradshaw, et al. (2001), and Ivarsson, et al. (2002), used a technique similar to that of Margulies (1997), by designing a parasaggital model of a human skull made of aluminum and filled with a silicone gel. Within the gel were white markers in a grid-form that, when used with high speed photography, would allow determination of displacements and strains.","Makris, et al. (September, 2000), and Chichester, et al. (May, 2001), used anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs), outfitted with pressure transducers on a head skin surface and accelerometers in the head, as well as pressure transducers and accelerometers on other body parts, to study the effects of blast. The ATDs were in a kneeling position while exposed to different charge sizes.","Bayley, et al. (2004), Bayley, et al. (2005), and Bayley, et al. (2006), used harmonic phase (HARP) analysis of tagged magnetic resonance images (MRI) to determine strains in a gel model, human volunteers, and animal models.","Defense Research and Development Canada, Vulcartier (DRDC Valcartier), developed a device referred to as a Manikin for Assessing Blast Incapacitation and Lethality (MABIL), to evaluate personal protection concepts developed for the protection against blast threats. The device includes a headform formed of solid urethane based on anthropometric data, and includes a pressure sensors in an ear, a pressure sensor in the mouth, and a photodiode in an eye to measure light intensity. The MABIL headform does not include a brain stimulant material and thus does not support measurement of brain-skull displacement.","The United Kingdom, Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), developed a device known as a Dynamic Event Response Analysis Man (DERAMan). The device includes a head, with a skull and soft gel brain stimulant, mounted to a compliant neck. 40 piezoelectric polymer pressure sensors located within the brain section, 45 piezoelectric ceramic pressure sensors mounted to an inside surface of the skull, two accelerometers, and a three-dimensional force gauge.","Synthetic cortical bone is addressed in Caruso, et al., , Journal of Advanced Materials, 38 (3), pages 27-36, 2006.","Disclosed herein are methods and systems to implement a physical model, including a housing and a gelatinous material therein, and to measure displacements of the gelatinous material in response to a physical force experienced by the model.","The physical model may be used as a surrogate head model to measure brain\/skull displacement due to a physical force, such as due to an explosive, ballistic, or automotive crash type of event. The surrogate head model may be implemented as a human surrogate head model (HSHM). For illustrative purposes, methods and systems disclosed herein may be described with reference to a HSHM. Methods and systems disclosed herein are not, however, limited to a surrogate head model.","A HSHM may include one or more biosimulant materials to represent skin, face, skull, and\/or brain tissue.","A HSHM may be mounted to a neck device, such as a Hybrid III Anthropomorphic test device, to permit head motion during loading.","A HSHM may include one or more displacement sensors and\/or pressure sensors embedded within a gelatinous brain stimulant, which may populate the brain stimulant in one or more of a variety of fashions. Displacement sensors may be positioned, for example, within anterior and posterior areas of the brain along a saggital plane.","A HSHM may include one or more displacement sensors, each in a stationary position relative to the HSHM housing and oriented with respect to a corresponding one of multiple directions.","A HSHM may include a plurality of magnetic field generators positioned stationary relative to a cranium portion of the HSHM, and may further include one or more electromagnetic force (EMF)-based displacement sensors, each including a plurality of inductive coils oriented with respect to a corresponding one of multiple directions, each coil to generate an electric signal in response to the magnetic fields of the plurality of generators. An EMF-based displacement sensor may include 3 coils, oriented orthogonally with respect to one another and co-aligned about a central point, referred to herein interchangeably as a co-aligned triad displacement sensor, and a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) displacement sensor.","A signal processor may be implemented to separate signals generated by each coil of each EMF-based displacement sensor into a plurality of component magnitudes, each attributable to a corresponding one of the magnetic fields.","A computer-implemented model may be implemented to correlate between the component magnitudes and a corresponding position and orientation of the displacement sensor.","In the drawings, the leftmost digit(s) of a reference number identifies the drawing in which the reference number first appears.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","106"]},"Housing  may be fabricated from one or more materials suitable to hold gelatinous material .","In , housing  is illustrated with a spherical shape.

The gross head kinematics may be used to characterize a response of HSHM  to blast loading.  is a table  of features of the pressure sensors and components of the inertial sensor.","Sensor positions are described below with reference to a coordinate system having an origin at a posterior surface of the skull, at the geometric center of the rear EMF generator coil.

A driver section of the shock tube was pressurized with approximately 100 psi of helium at burst, which generated a shock wave traveling the length of the tube until impacting the HSHM at the tube opening. When the pressure wave impacted the HSHM, the HSHM began to rotate backward into a neck extension (i.e., biofidelic neck  in , A, and B, and ).","Displacement results from anterior and posterior displacement sensors indicate combined translation and rotation of the brain simulant relative to the skull. Displacement results further indicate that magnitudes of the translations and rotations increased with driver pressure, as expected.","Displacement results further indicate that in the first 25 milliseconds of the blast events, as the shock front propagates through the HSHM, the displacement sensors are forced to move backward with respect to the skull. Simultaneously, inertial forces act to keep the brain simulant stationary while the head and neck begin to rotate into extension. When the displacement sensors are positions below a center of rotation of the brain, displacement results indicate a translation downward with respect to the skull in the anterior region and upward relative motion in the posterior region.","As the neck begins to decelerate and as the shock wave dissipates approximately 50 ms after the onset of the blast event, a reverse phenomenon occurs, in which the anterior displacement sensor moves in the anterior-superior direction, and the posterior displacement sensor moves in the anterior-inferior direction. In both locations, the displacement sensors overshoot their initial rest or baseline positions before settling begins.","After approximately 50 ms subsequent to the onset of the blast event, the displacement sensors settle back to their initial positions as the brain simulant material restores itself to its rest shape over the next 150 ms.","A characteristic pressure-time plot of intracranial pressure was recorded by the anterior pressure sensor during an exposure to load case 2. The pressure signature showed an initial dominant peak followed by oscillation until the pressure reaches nearly zero approximately 15 ms after impact. The peak pressures in the anterior region of the brain were found to be greater than those measured in the posterior region.","Local brain displacements with respect to the skull in the anterior portion of the head were typically slightly greater than the posterior displacements for a given loading condition. Directional displacement response varied with displacement sensor location. For a given location, the shape of the displacement pattern remained similar, while the magnitude of displacement increased with increased loading conditions. Measured brain displacement, primarily due to head kinematics, often continued for more than 50 ms after the HSHM was impacted by the incident pressure wave.","Methods and systems are disclosed herein with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the functions, features, and relationships thereof.
