{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","This disclosure generally relates to software. More particularly, the disclosure relates to queries.","2. General Background","A query based system is typically utilized in an Enterprise Information System (\u201cEIS\u201d) or a relational database to retrieve of specific information. Query based systems are generally very different depending on the EIS. For example, the features, the query interface, and\/or or query language may be different.","While a relational database utilizes Structured Query Language (\u201cSQL\u201d) to query the tables in the database for information, an EIS may use a similar query system, but with different keywords. The EIS may even utilize an English centric query system. Enterprise adapters utilize the application specific application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) or mechanisms to perform queries within the EIS.","As the query based systems vary for different EISs, enterprise adapters or systems that access the EISs may have to deal with different structured or unstructured queries prior to transforming these queries into the enterprise specific query system. These enterprise adapters or systems that access the EISs have to parse multiple and different query languages, and perform a translation into an enterprise specific query request. The need for knowledge of multiple query languages and their structure can be overwhelming and difficult to perform, which generally results in multiple systems and different data formats per query language.","In one aspect of the disclosure, a computer program product is provided. The computer program product includes a computer useable medium having a computer readable program. The computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to receive a query. Further, the computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to generate a common metadata based query object that includes metadata for the query and data associated with the query. In addition, the computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to extract the metadata from the common metadata based query object. Finally, the computer readable program when executed on a computer causes the computer to generate an application specific query based on the metadata and an application to which the query is intended.","In another aspect of the disclosure, a process is provided. The process receives a query. Further, the process generates a common metadata based query object that includes metadata for the query and data associated with the query. In addition, the process extracts the metadata from the common metadata based query object. Finally, the process generates an application specific query based on the metadata and an application to which the query is intended.","In yet another aspect of the disclosure, a system is provided. The system includes a query-to-data format converter that receives a query and generates a common metadata based query object that includes metadata for the query and data associated with the query. Further, the system includes a query executor that extracts the metadata from the common metadata based query object and generates an application specific query based on the metadata and an application to which the query is intended.","A method and system provide a metadata driven query. In one embodiment, a metadata driven query interface is provided to alleviate the need for different query data formats for each EIS. As a result, general query conversion may be utilized for an existing data format to an enterprise specific query request.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","108","110","102","104","104","106","108","108","106","110"]},"The incoming query  could be SQL, XML Query Language (\u201cXQuery\u201d), Query String, or any number of forms of various queries. Further, the query object , which is the output of the query-to-data format converter, includes the data and the query embedded as metadata in the common metadata based query object . In alternative embodiment, the data and the query may be provided as metadata that goes along with the common metadata based query object . The query executor  reads the values from the query object  and\/or additional metadata, depending on whether the metadata is provided along with the query object  or embedded as a value in the common metadata based query object  itself, and constructs query execution artifacts needed to make a call on the underlying EIS .","One form of the data and the metadata can be XML with annotations denoting the query keywords and actions. Another form of the data and metadata can be an object with embedded metadata at each property level within the object.","In one embodiment, rules are specified and followed for keywords and action identifiers based on what they represent and how many exist in the incoming common metadata based query object . For example, when the keyword IN is specified on a property, it is treated as an equality for that query search. If more than one keyword is specified for the same property type, those keywords are treated as a list of values.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["106","106"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"168pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<complexType name = \u201cCustomer\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<query Info> <\/queryInfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryPart> <\/queryPart>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryTarget> <\/queryTarget>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<element>name<\/element>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryInfo> <\/queryInfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryRole> <\/queryRole>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<element>Age<\/element>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryInfo> <\/queryInfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryRole> <\/queryRole>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<\/annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<element>ID<\/element>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryInfo> <queryInfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryRole> <\/queryRole>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<element>Status<\/element>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryInfo> <queryInfo>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003<queryRole> <\/queryRole>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003<annotation>"]},{"entry":[{},"<complexType>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["106","104","104","104","102","106"]},"As can be seen from the example of the customer query data object above, the customer is the data of interest.

Similarly, on the fly dynamic wrapper objects can be created for two or more data objects to represent a query. An example is a query  that includes a customer and an address.","The query-to-data format converter  performs the following tasks to create or enter the query metadata into this common metadata based query object . If the query object  already exists as a collection, the query-to-data format converter  would just provide the query metadata values as shown in . Otherwise, the query-to-data format converter  would dynamically create a common metadata based query object  as shown in  and enter the values.","Building the query object involves a series of tasks. The query  is parsed to determine the querying target component or object. The query  is also parsed to determine the return types that are necessary for the target component. The type of query  is also discerned from the query . The values required to specify a condition are mapped to the condition types and their values.
