Related Inventions","The present invention is related to the following commonly-assigned inventions, which were filed concurrently herewith: U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/733,985, titled \u201cCustomized Subscription Builder\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/734,043, titled \u201cIntelligent Data Query Builder\u201d. These co-pending applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.","2. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to computer software, and deals more particularly with techniques for enabling end users to subscribe to information content, without requiring the end user to initiate the subscription process. User patterns are observed, and subscriptions are recommended based on these observations.","3. Description of the Related Art","In today's networked world, a user can be notified of events in a number of ways, including via their instant messaging client, e-mail client, or personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d). Unfortunately, however, users are limited to what they can be notified about because they are restricted to predetermined data feeds which are defined by other parties such as a software vendor or Web portal. Well-known examples of such data feeds include delivery of current weather, stock prices, and news to subscribers. Currently, the provider of the content is required to deploy a subscription interface that enables users to subscribe to content. Using the subscription interface, users indicate that they would like a particular data feed delivered to a client application over a communications network.","There are several drawbacks to existing techniques. If a content provider has not provided a subscription interface, then users are unable to subscribe to the content. Instead, they have to repeatedly take explicit action to continue viewing the content, such as returning to the content provider's Web page periodically. Another drawback of existing techniques is that, even if a subscription interface has been provided, it often does not have sufficient granularity to meet the needs or desires of end users. As a result, the user effectively gets no say as to what data feed is important to him\/her. Furthermore, users may be unaware that they might benefit from a subscription to content. For example, novice users may not realize that a subscription-type function exists. As another example, users may not take time to notice that they repeatedly visit a particular content location to explicitly request updated content. Disadvantages are therefore realized not only by end users, but also by the content providers, who thereby fail to maximize exposure of their provided content (and as a result, may miss out on potential revenue).","The present invention provides novel techniques for enabling end users to subscribe to data feeds, without requiring the end user to initiate the subscription process.","An object of the present invention is to enable end users to subscribe to data feeds, without requiring the end user to initiate the subscription process.","Another object of the present invention is to provide techniques with which subscriptions to content can be easily provided for end users, while allowing the end users to have ultimate control over the conditions under which the content is delivered.","A further object of the present invention is to define techniques which allow content providers to selectively notify end users that the end users may benefit from receiving the provider's content.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide techniques with which content providers can locate end users who are candidates for subscribing to the provider's content, and provide those users with an easy-to-use subscription interface.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description and in the drawings which follow and, in part, will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.","To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the purpose of the invention as broadly described herein, the present invention may be provided as methods, systems, and computer program products. In one aspect of preferred embodiments, the present invention provides techniques for enabling end users to subscribe to content in a computing environment without requiring them to initiate a subscription process, comprising: identifying behavior patterns of a user; using the identified behavior patterns to identify content which may be of interest to the user; and offering, to the user, a subscription to the identified content, without requiring the user to initiate a request for the subscription. Preferably, the offered subscription is registered, upon acceptance thereof by the user, and the registered subscription is then used to deliver the identified content to the user. The user may be allowed to customize the offered subscription such that at least one condition is placed on at least one portion of the identified content (where the portion may comprise the identified content in its entirety), and in this case, the offered subscription, as customized by the user, is preferably registered upon acceptance thereof by the user. The registered subscription may be used to deliver the identified content to the user, and\/or to carry out other action(s). If the user selected one or more conditions when customizing the subscription, then the content must match the condition(s). Behavior patterns may be identified for a plurality of users, and content may be identified that is interest to more than one user (and this content may vary among the users), such that subscriptions may be offered to more than one user.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the following drawings, in which like reference numbers denote the same element throughout.","The present invention provides techniques that enable a content provider to use programmatically-discovered\/observed behavior patterns of users, and then automatically query the users to determine whether they would like to subscribe to content which is offered by the provider and which is relevant to the behavior patterns. The disclosed techniques can be used effectively to allows users to subscribe to any data on the Internet (or other network; references herein to \u201cInternet\u201d or \u201cWeb\u201d are by way of illustration but not of limitation). Users can therefore receive content aligned with their particular behavior patterns, without requiring the user to initiate the subscription process.","The users who are identified as candidate subscribers via the present invention may include those who interact with a provider's content, but do not subscribe on their own initiative. The failure to subscribe may, for example, be due to the user's failure to understand that a subscription interface is available. Or, it may be due to the user's failure to notice that he\/she views the content repeatedly. The identified candidates may also include users who do not necessarily interact with the provider's content at present, but whose behavior indicates that the content might be of interest to the user.","Use of the present invention enables content providers, such as Web shopping sites, advertisers, and so forth, to locate potential viewers or customers and to pro-actively offer content subscriptions to them. End users also benefit from this \u201ctargeting\u201d of potential subscribers by saving time, becoming informed of relevant content of which they might otherwise be unaware, and so forth. Hereinafter, these end users are referred to as \u201cviewing\u201d the subscribed content, although this is by way of illustration and not of limitation. For example, embodiments of the present invention may be used with content that is to be delivered in an audible form, rather than a viewable form, and such embodiments are within the scope of the present invention.","Suppose, for example, that a particular user drives his global positioning satellite (\u201cGPS\u201d) enabled vehicle past a certain fast food outlet every day during the lunch hour. The fast food outlet may use an implementation of the present invention to detect this user's pattern, and may then offer him a subscription to the Web page where their menu and current special offerings are provided, or perhaps a subscription to a specialized Web page where discount coupons are offered as customer incentives.","As another example, a merchant that provides an online shopping service might use an implementation of the present invention to detect shopping habits of its customers. Suppose that a user purchases airline tickets to an international destination from an online travel service. The travel service might then automatically offer that user a subscription to content pertaining to hotels at the international destination and\/or to other types of content such as local weather forecasts.","As yet another example, driving patterns of a user with a GPS-enabled vehicle might be observed, and an implementation of the present invention using this information might offer a subscription to a traffic-reporting Web page to this user. Many other examples may be envisaged, once the teachings disclosed herein are known.","The related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/733,985, titled \u201cCustomized Subscription Builder\u201d, referred to hereinafter as \u201cthe first related invention\u201d, discloses techniques whereby a user may subscribe to content even though the content provider has not deployed a subscription interface. Embodiments of the present invention may be used to offer subscriptions to users for content which does have an existing subscription interface, or for content which does not. In cases where a subscription interface does already exist, the interface disclosed in the first related invention is preferably used instead. Thus, references hereinafter are in terms of that interface.","As with the first related invention, another advantage offered to users by the present invention is that the users do not need to subscribe to fee-based subscription services in order to receive content in which they are interested. Another advantage offered to businesses by the present invention is that their content can now be readily available to users, preferably in a user-customizable manner where customizations can be selected by each individual user, thereby improving timeliness and value of the content as well as increasing end-user satisfaction.","Preferred embodiments will now be described in more detail with reference to .","The sample Web page  depicted in  is used herein to illustrate how an end user's behavior patterns may be observed and used to offer that user a content subscription, according to the present invention. As shown therein, the sample Web page  corresponds to a Web site  on which featured computing devices and peripherals are offered for sale. In this example, the computing devices are presented in \u201cMobile Computing Devices\u201d and \u201cDesktop Computing Devices\u201d categories, each of which is currently featuring two different models, and the featured peripherals include \u201cMonitors\u201d and \u201cDisk Drives\u201d.","An implementation of the present invention may be adapted for behavior patterns that reflect various levels of detail. Suppose that a particular user John visits this Web site  regularly, perhaps trying to decide whether he would like to purchase a \u201cModel \u201d in the Mobile Computing Devices category or a \u201cModel ABC\u201d in the Desktop Computing Devices category. John may also peruse the monitors within the Peripherals category. In one approach, an implementation of the present invention may recognize simply that John is a repeat visitor to Web site , and may therefore offer him a subscription to the content of Web page . In another approach, an implementation of the present invention may offer John a selective content subscription, whereby John's subscription can be tailored to portions of the content such as those portions which he repeatedly uses or those portions which are deemed to be of interest based on his observed behaviors.","The latter approach is illustrated in . The content portions from the above example are highlighted therein, for reference, using dashed rectangles. When using this selective approach, John might choose to subscribe to only the highlighted content portions. Note that the result of using this selective approach is similar to scenarios which are enabled through use of the first related invention; however, end users themselves initiate the subscription process in that related invention. When using embodiments of the present invention, in contrast, a content provider typically initiates the search for candidate subscribers, based on user behaviors that are observed. Embodiments of the present invention may also be adapted for locating candidate subscriptions in response to an end user's request, if desired. For example, an end user may request that his\/her behavior be tracked (such as, by way of example, viewing of Web content) over some time period, such that one or more candidate subscriptions can then be offered to the user based on the observed behavior.","Hereinafter, discussions of preferred embodiments presume that the user is not only presented with an offer to subscribe to content, but is also allowed to customize that subscription. The user-customizable subscriptions may allow a user to specify conditions under which he\/she would like to receive an updated version of the content, for example, and\/or one or more events that should be invoked when specified conditions are met (where these events may or may not include content delivery). Discussions hereinafter also presume that the user is allowed to selectively subscribe to content. That is, rather than providing the user with an option either to subscribe to all of the content located at a particular Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d), or not to subscribe to any of the content, preferred embodiments allow the user to subscribe to specified portions of the content. The user can thereby be notified of updates to the content, and can choose to receive only the data that is of interest to this user. For example, with reference to the scenario described above, John can be offered a subscription that includes a subset of the computing devices and a subset of the peripherals which are featured on Web page .","Referring briefly to , which shows components and flows used in preferred embodiments of the present invention, an inference engine component  is preferably leveraged for identifying user behavior patterns and then deducing, from those observations, what content the user might be interested in. One manner in which behaviors may be observed is to track Web pages viewed by users, as discussed above. This is illustrated in  at reference number . Another way of identifying behavior patterns includes tracking signals from GPS-enabled vehicles, as has been described earlier. These examples are provided by way of illustration and not of limitation. The particular manner in which the behavior patterns are observed does not form part of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. Preferably, a commercially-available inference engine is leveraged by embodiments of the present invention. The inference engine may be augmented for also determining which content subscriptions to offer to candidate subscribers. Or, as another approach, the inference engine may provide its observations to the CP2XML component of the present invention, as discussed below, and this CP2XML may (for example) consult a mapping that associates selected behavior patterns with content subscriptions, thereby determining the subscriptions to be offered. As an example of this mapping, an online toy seller might provide a set of behavior patterns that it believes are common to potential customers, and this set of behavior patterns might then be associated with the toy seller's Web page. As yet another approach, a separate code component may be used with embodiments of the present invention for making this comparison, and the manner in which a code component of this type may be used with embodiments discussed herein will be readily understandable to those of ordinary skill in the art.","The inference engine may be directed to search for predetermined behavior patterns, where those patterns may be supplied by an enterprise wishing to locate users potentially interested in content subscriptions. Or, the inference engine may operate without this type of guidance, without deviating from the scope of the present invention.","Preferred embodiments also leverage a Web clipper component or \u201cclipping engine\u201d , which clips (i.e., extracts) content according to subscriptions that are offered to, and accepted by, users. Web clippers are known in the art. As one example, WebSphere Portal Server Version 4.1, a commercially-available product of International Business Machines Corporation (\u201cIBM\u201d) provides a Web clipper, referred to herein as the \u201cWSPS Web clipper\u201d. The manner in which this WSPS Web clipper (or another Web clipper) may be used with embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail.","Preferably, the inference engine  provides content from a particular URL, according to a user's observed behavior, to the clipping engine . The clipping engine then clips out selected content, and preferably creates therefrom a markup language document which is then passed to a \u201cCP2XML\u201d component .","(Note, however, that it is not strictly necessary that a Web clipper component be provided. Alternatives include writing code that extracts the pertinent content from a Web page, and manually creating a representation of content selection that adheres to formats used by an implementation of the present invention.)","When using the WSPS Web clipper, XPath syntax is generated when the inference engine identifies content to which a subscription will be offered. Preferred embodiments parse the underlying content of the Web page and the XPath is applied to indicate how this underlying content should be clipped, or extracted, if the user accepts this subscription. The source content is typically encoded in the Hypertext Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d), and thus the output file created by processing the XPath specification is preferably an HTML document. XPath notation is well known in the art, and a detailed description thereof is therefore not presented herein. For more information, reference may be made to the XPath specification, which is titled \u201cXML Path Language (XPath)\u201d and which is available from the World Wide Web Consortium.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","100","310","320","330","340","350","330","340","350"]},"Referring again to , reference number indicates that the candidate subscription information is forwarded to a component referred to herein as CP2XML , as stated above. The CP2XML component receives the forwarded serialized information, along with an indication of the source (e.g., the URL) from which the content was originally clipped. The CP2XML component then transcodes the serialized information. Preferably, the output of the transcoding operation is an Extensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d) document. (Note that if a clipping component is not used in a particular implementation of the present invention, the HTML content to be transcoded may be created using other means, including a simple text editor, and forwarded to the CP2XML component for transcoding. As another alternative, the XPath statements illustrated by the example in  may be written using other means, including a text editor or other tool, and the XPath statements can then be executed against the source file to generate the HTML content to be delivered to the CP2XML component.)","Operation of the CP2XML component will now be described in more detail with reference to  and .  provides a sample subscription page  that may be offered to the candidate user for establishing a content subscription. See the welcome message at reference number , which includes a description of the candidate content (in this case, by specifying the content's URL at ; alternatively, a description may be provided in another form, such as by using a graphical image or icon). In this example, the sample page  also enables the user to customize his\/her subscription by specifying conditions that must occur before the user is interested in receiving a content update. In preferred embodiments, this page is built from the HTML input provided by the clipping engine at . Reference number  of  represents the CP2XML component  creating and rendering this candidate subscription page  to the user.","As indicated by the flowchart in , one aspect of the CP2XML component of preferred embodiments listens on a socket (referred to in  as \u201csocket X\u201d, for illustrative purposes), where it receives the HTML input in tabular format (Block ) specifying the suggested subscription. The location URL associated with this suggested data, which is also provided, is saved by the CP2XML component (Block ). For example, as indicated at reference number , a location URL of \u201chttp:\/\/xyz.com\u201d may be associated with candidate subscription information identified as \u201csubscription00\u201d. The CP2XML component then parses the provided HTML table, extracting its column headings (Block ), and generates an XML file (Block ) containing that information. Preferably, the XML file uses the column names as tag values. This generated XML file is represented in  at reference number . See also the example XML file in , which may be created by the CP2XML component to correspond to the selective version of the candidate content, where this selective version is based on the portions with which this user interacts (as discussed above with reference to ). The XML file created at Block  is then used to generate (Block ) the candidate subscription page for presentation to the user, an example of which is depicted in . Note that the manner in which an address usable for contacting the candidate user is determined does not form part of the inventive concepts of the present invention. Techniques for mapping user information to a network-accessible address are well known in the art, and a mapping of this type may be consulted. (For example, if the observed user behavior is interaction with Web pages, then the user's log-in identifier may be available and can be used to access a mapping. As another example, if the observed behavior pertains to a GPS tracking device, a serial number or other identifier of that tracking device may be usable as an index into a mapping for contacting the device owner.) It should also be noted that the initial notification to the user does not necessarily require notification over a network connection, and other types of notifications are within the scope of the present invention. For example, a letter might be printed and mailed to the user, informing the user that he\/she has been identified as a candidate subscriber, and providing a URL where the user can choose to view information about, and\/or accept, the candidate subscription (and also customize that subscription, when supported by an implementation of the present invention).","Reference numbers  and  in  indicate that the user interacts with this subscription page. For example, if the user decides to accept the suggested subscription, then he\/she may proceed to customize that subscription, and submit the customization when ready (as discussed below with reference to ). The CP2XML component then receives the customization input (Block ), and passes (Block ) the URL of the source Web page and the customization information to a trigger handler component.","Turning again to , the manner in which a candidate subscription may be offered to users, and in which they may choose to customize the subscription according to preferred embodiments, will now be described in more detail. (In the example of , a \u201cNo Thanks\u201d button  has been depicted, indicating that preferred embodiments preferably provide an easy-to-use mechanism for the user to decline a candidate subscription.) In this example, reference number  illustrates that a name is preferably associated with the subscription (and its customization). This name may be programmatically generated, or an implementation of the present invention may enable the user to select the name. The candidate subscription content determined by the inference engine is presented, in this example, using a category-style approach as shown at , , . Preferably, when using this approach, an implementation of the present invention then populates the drop-down lists , ,  with the observed values (e.g., \u201cModel \u201d, \u201cModel ABC\u201d, and \u201cMonitors\u201d, referring to the sample values in ) and allows the user to accept or modify those populated values. In alternative embodiments, a multi-tiered display may be used, for example by presenting values for each observed category, along with check boxes or other graphical means with which the user can indicate whether those are the desired values to use as subscription conditions.","Examples hereinafter assume the user accepts the subscription offered in . The user may wish to limit his\/her subscription to models of mobile computing devices, for example. In this case, the user preferably types one or more model names into text entry field . An appropriate delimiter, such as a comma or semicolon, is preferably used when multiple model names are supplied. Wild cards may be supported, if desired. In addition, preferred embodiments preferably use a drop-down list  that enables the user to easily specify a wider range of values. For example, the user might select the \u201cLIKE\u201d choice depicted in list  and then type select \u201cModel \u201d as the value of text entry field  to indicate that he\/she wishes to see mobile computing devices having model names which are similar to Model . \u201cSimilar\u201d, in this context, may be interpreted as all model numbers containing the string \u201cModel \u201d, such as a \u201cModel  Enhanced\u201d and a \u201cModel  Express\u201d, for example. Or, an implementation of the present invention may be adapted for determining factors such as particular characteristics of the Model  (including processor speed, functionality, and so forth), and using mobile computing devices of similar characteristics for those model names which are \u201clike\u201d Model . An another example, an implementation may perform a string pattern-matching operation to determine whether one value is \u201clike\u201d another.","A database or other repository of terms, indexed by keywords such as \u201cModel \u201d, may be used with an implementation of the present invention to enable making a programmatic determination of which values are similar to those selected by the user. For example, the database might use \u201cModel \u201d as a keyword to retrieve a set of comparison criteria that define how to determine whether one model of mobile computing device is similar to another. As another example, \u201cMonitors\u201d might be used as a keyword that will retrieve a set of criteria indicating how to tell if one computer monitor is similar to another. In this latter case, sets of monitor identifiers\/descriptors that are to be considered as matching, such as \u201cMonitor M1B2A\u201d and \u201cMonitor model number M1B2A\u201d, might be specified.","Preferred embodiments leverage a commercially-available component for performing the subsequent comparisons between patterns as customized by the user on display  and the content displayed in the actual Web page to which the user is accepting a candidate subscription. The component responsible for these comparisons is referred to herein as a \u201ccontent matching engine\u201d, and is discussed in more detail below.","Drop-down list  may contain other entries such as \u201cEQUAL\u201d, indicating that the user wants an exact match on values of the mobile computing device identifier, or \u201cIN\u201d, indicating that the user has specified some string (such as a device series code) that must be found in the device identifier before a mobile computing device is of interest to this user. Preferably, when the value being customized is numeric rather than textual, other choices are provided. For example, symbols such as \u201c=\u201d, \u201c<\u201d, and \u201c>\u201d may be provided for use with numeric choices.","The approach shown in  enables the user to refine what type of information he\/she wishes to see if a candidate subscription is accepted. Once the subscription information has been defined and processed, the source Web page will subsequently be queried (as discussed in more detail below) to determine whether any content matching the user's filter is currently rendered in that Web page. (The term \u201cfilter\u201d, as used herein, refers to customization parameters or conditions which are selected using a customization display such as that shown in .) Thus, in the mobile computing device example, the user might choose to be notified every time a new mobile computing device in the Model  series appears on shopping site . Once the user has provided values to be used in customizing this subscription, he\/she preferably presses a \u201cSubmit\u201d button  or otherwise indicates that the customization is ready for submission.","As will be obvious, a candidate subscription may offer many different kinds of content, and the conditions to be specified may vary widely. A user might be observed as frequently checking a company's stock price which is located somewhere on the company's home page, for example, and might then be asked if he\/she is interested in subscribing to updates on this stock price. Or, the user might be allowed to specify an interest in receiving updates only when the stock price exceeds some configured amount or percentage of increase (where the amount or percentage is preferably selected by the user during customization).","The user may also be allowed to select one or more events (referred to equivalently herein as \u201cactions\u201d) that should be invoked when the source Web page contains content matching the user's subscription filter, and the choices to be presented to the user may be determined in a number of ways without deviating from the scope of the present invention. A sample display  that may used for this purpose is provided in , as will now be described. (Note that the choices depicted in  are merely representative, and an implementation of the present invention may provide additional or different choices.)","As one example of an applicable event, the user may select to have content delivered to a particular device (which may be identified, for example, using a network address or device address). Or, the user might select to have some particular process executed when the filter locates matching content.","In the example of , the user is provided with a first selection  with which he\/she can indicate that the matching content should be sent to a device. In one approach, a drop-down list  may be configured to provide a set of standard, predetermined selections for the target device. In another approach, the choices may be retrieved from an external source such as a configuration file or directory entry. As yet another approach, a database or other repository which uses keywords as an index may be queried to determine which action choices are applicable, given the terms (such as \u201cmobile computing device\u201d, \u201cdesktop computing device\u201d, and \u201cperipherals\u201d) being used in a particular customization. As still another approach, the CP2XML component may be adapted for consulting a user profile or similar source to provide choices which are specifically adapted to the user who is specifying this customization, and then presenting these choices in drop-down list . As will be obvious, in this latter approach, a user identifier is preferably obtained by the inference engine component and communicated to the CP2XML component. Or, the CP2XML component may provide an input means for obtaining the user identifier directly from the user, such as by adding another field to display . The user may optionally be authenticated, using authentication techniques which are outside the scope of the present invention.","An optional \u201cwhen\u201d parameter is also shown in , and preferably uses a drop-down list as shown at . This parameter may be set to (and may default to) \u201calways\u201d, indicating that the user wants the \u201csend to\u201d action  to be carried out every time the subscription filter is matched.","Another use of the \u201cwhen\u201d parameter is shown, by way of illustration, in the second selection . This action can be selected if the user wants time scheduled on his\/her electronic calendar when the subscription filter is matched. For example, the user might like to take some time to review details of a new mobile computing device offering that has been detected using his\/her subscription filter. As shown in drop-down list , a time period such as 30 minutes might be selected for this \u201cschedule calendar\u201d action , and the user might further specify that this automated scheduling is only to happen on week days, as indicated in the \u201cwhen\u201d drop-down list .","A number of different approaches to determining the actions to be presented to a user were described above. In still another approach, embodiments of the present invention may be adapted for providing one or more actions without user input. For example, a default action might be taken when a user's subscription filter matches, without deviating from the inventive concepts disclosed herein. One example of such a default action is to always send the matching content to a user's computer, and a user-to-device mapping might be consulted to determine how to connect to a particular user's computer for content delivery. (Preferred embodiments leverage a commercially-available mechanism for the actual delivery of the content, as discussed in more detail below.)","As stated previously with reference to Block  of , the customization information is sent by the CP2XML component to a trigger handler component. This passing of information is also depicted at reference number  of , and the trigger handler is shown at reference number . In preferred embodiments, the information passed to the trigger handler by the CP2XML component is encoded as an XML document. A sample document for the online shopping scenario, corresponding to the customizations illustrated in , is presented in .","The trigger handler  of preferred embodiments transforms the XML document received from the CP2XML component into a trigger that a content matching engine understands. Preferably, a commercially-available content matching engine which operates in a publish\/subscribe mode is leveraged, and the transformation performed by the trigger handler component comprises adapting the XML document to the application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) used by that content matching engine. The content matching engine is depicted in  at reference number , and the passing of the adapted XML document from the trigger handler to the content matching engine is shown at . (The format of the XML document passed to the content matching engine will vary, depending on the API of the particular content matching engine which is deployed with an implementation of the present invention, and this document has therefore not been illustrated.)","The flowchart in  depicts logic which may be used when implementing this transformation aspect of the trigger handler. As shown therein at Block , the trigger handler receives the XML document specifying customization information (e.g., XML document  of ) from the CP2XML component. The information is then formatted (Block ), preferably into key-value pairs (or another format, as appropriate to the content matching engine's API), specifying conditions that are to be considered as a match when the content matching engine evaluates content. (This set of formatted conditions may alternatively be referred to as a \u201ctrigger\u201d.) Block  indicates that the trigger handler stores information about which method(s) should be executed when a particular match occurs. For example, with reference to the sample customization depicted in , a method that sends content to a mobile device and (if selected by the user) a method that schedules events on electronic calendars would be recorded by Block  when processing this customization. The formatted information is then sent (Block ) to the content matching engine.","Upon receiving information from the trigger handler, the content matching engine  registers that information (using techniques which are outside the scope of the present invention) for use when subsequently evaluating Web page content.","At this point, a subscription has been dynamically created and registered. A description of how this subscription is used to deliver content to the user (and\/or to perform other actions desired by the user) will now be provided, referring to .","Preferred embodiments use a content adapter component, shown at reference number  of , to periodically initiate a content evaluation operation. A timer-driven approach may be used, whereby the content adapter initiates the evaluation at some predetermined or configurable interval(s). Or, an event-driven approach may be used. Discussions hereinafter are in terms of using a timer-driven approach, by way of illustration.","The content adapter of preferred embodiments initiates a content evaluation by querying the CP2XML component, as shown at reference number  of , which in turn causes a second aspect of the CP2XML component to retrieve data from the source Web page, as shown at reference number . The flowchart in  depicts logic that may be used when implementing the content adapter functionality, as will now be described.","When the periodic interval is triggered, the content adapter sends a request to the CP2XML component (Block ). The flowchart in  depicts logic that may be used for this second (i.e., content retrieval) aspect of the CP2XML component. As indicated at Block  of , the CP2XML component preferably listens on a socket (referred to in  as \u201csocket Y\u201d, for illustrative purposes) for incoming requests from the content adapter, and in preferred embodiments, each request specifies the URL of the content to be evaluated. (In alternative embodiments, the CP2XML component may use information it saved at Block  of , illustrated by association , to determine the URL of interest. In this approach, the content adapter preferably passes the subscription identifier, such as \u201csubscription00\u201d or \u201cMyIBMShopping\u201d, rather than the URL.) The CP2XML component then requests that the Web clipping engine clip content from a current version of the Web page associated with that URL, and this clipped content is preferably returned to the CP2XML component as a table formatted in HTML (Block ). Preferably, the same XPath code used when sending the subscription information to the CP2XML component at reference number  is used for creating this HTML table. Upon receiving the table data (Block ) from the Web clipping component, this aspect of the CP2XML component transcodes and re-formats the items, preferably by column header (Block ), to create a markup language document (which is preferably encoded in XML). See, for example, reference number  of , which depicts a sample XML document that includes at least one \u201citem\u201d element having \u201cname\u201d sub-elements for each column header and \u201cvalue\u201d sub-elements for each of those columns.","A sample XML document , created at Block  after the CP2XML engine has received results of a fresh query to the Web page illustrated in , is depicted in . As shown therein, a number of new product offerings meeting the user's interest have been created (referring to the previous Web page content shown in ). This new XML document is then returned to the content adapter (Block ). This passing of the revised content in an XML document is illustrated in  at reference numbers , ","Returning now to the discussion of content adapter functionality in , when the content adapter receives content from the CP2XML component (Block ), it parses and formats that returned content (Block ) for delivery to the content matching engine. Preferably, this comprises formatting the returned XML document (as illustrated by example document  in ) into a form suitable for the content matching engine. This content is then published (i.e., submitted) to the content matching engine (Block ), as shown at reference number  of , where it will be evaluated using triggers sent from the trigger handler component (as described above with reference to  of ). This comparison of content to triggers (i.e., conditions) preferably uses prior art techniques which are outside the scope of the present invention, as stated earlier.","If a match is detected by the content matching engine, then Block  notifies a second aspect of the trigger handler. The notification preferably comprises sending a message to this aspect of the trigger handler, indicating which trigger has matched. The notification is also shown by reference number  of , and  provides a flowchart depicting logic with which the second aspect of the trigger handler may be implemented. As shown therein, when this aspect of the trigger handler is notified of a match (Block ), it retrieves previously-stored information (Block ) about how to handle this match. For example, one or more method names are preferably stored for each potential match, as has been described above with reference to Block  of . Upon locating this stored information, Block  kicks off the associated process or method. For example, with reference to the customization shown in , the content received by the content adapter at Block  is delivered to the user's mobile phone if it matches the Mobile Computing Device, Desktop Computing Device, and\/or Peripherals, parameters, as selected by this user (according to the user's selection at reference number  of ). In the general case, one or more actions may be taken by the trigger handler at Block , depending on the actions defined in the subscription for which the trigger matches the updated content published at .","Preferably, the trigger handler requests an intelligent delivery engine  to carry out delivery to devices, when delivery of content is indicated as an action. This request is shown at reference number  in , and the intelligent delivery engine is preferably a commercially-available component whose functionality is beyond the scope of the present invention. As shown in the sample configuration in , the intelligent delivery engine may be adapted for routing messages  to devices including mobile phones , pagers , and\/or portable computing devices . The intelligent delivery engine functionality may be provided, for example, by the Intelligent Notification Service, or \u201cINS\u201d, product of IBM. (Note that, in contrast to the present invention, users of the existing INS product must explicitly request a subscription. Furthermore, the existing INS product allows users to subscribe only to content having a deployed subscription interface for content updates. The subscription interface is sometimes referred to in the prior art as a \u201cnotification service\u201d, \u201cnotification application\u201d, or \u201csubscriber delivery channel\u201d.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 14"]},"Returning now to the content adapter and trigger handler, these components are preferably deployed as paired, customized components. For example, one content adapter may be customized for processing information about offerings on computing products (e.g., receiving this information and delivering it to the content matching engine), while another content adapter may be customized for processing information about stock prices. A trigger is defined by type (e.g., stock, weather, news, etc.) and when the content matching engine determines a match, it passes the type to the trigger handler. The trigger handler then knows how to handle the match, according to the type.","As has been described, embodiments of the present invention provide a number of advantages to end users and to companies. An implementation of the present invention may be offered as a stand-alone product or as a service, or it may be coupled or integrated with another software product such as IBM's WebSphere\u00ae Everyplace\u00ae Access or IBM's INS product.
