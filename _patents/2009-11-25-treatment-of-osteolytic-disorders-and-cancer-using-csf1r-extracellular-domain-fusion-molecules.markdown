{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/118,427, filed on Nov. 26, 2008, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to methods of treating osteolytic bone loss, cancer metastasis, cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss, and tumor growth using colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) extracellular domains (ECDs) that have been engineered to contain a fusion partner. The invention further provides specific CSF1R ECD fusion molecules that exhibit improved therapeutic properties. The invention also relates to polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences, vectors, host cells, and compositions comprising or encoding such molecules. The invention also relates to methods of making and using CSF1R ECD fusion molecules.","Bone remodeling is a continuous process that maintains skeletal integrity through the coordinated activities of two cell populations: osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption (osteolysis), and osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation. In order to maintain bone homeostasis, the activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts must be tightly regulated. Dysregulation of osteoclast activity is associated with several forms of human disease, including osteolytic bone loss due to increased osteoclast activity and osteopetrosis (excessive bone accumulation) due to decreased osteoclast activity. Osteolytic bone loss may also be caused by cancer metastasis to bone. Breast, lung, and prostate cancer are the most common malignancies in adults, and they are also the most common tumor types to metastasize to bone. Kidney, thyroid, and melanoma are other common forms of cancer that metastasize to bone. Tumor cells often secrete osteoclast-activating factors, including the colony stimulating factor 1 ligand (referred to herein as CSF1; also referred to in the art as MCSF and MGC31930) and the receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), that stimulate osteoclast activity and induce osteolytic bone loss. As a result, bone metastasis is associated with fractures, pain, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Therefore, therapeutic agents that treat osteolytic bone loss, inhibit metastasis, and\/or prevent metastasis-induced osteoclast activation would be expected to offer significant clinical benefits to patients.","The colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (referred to herein as CSF1R; also referred to in the art as FMS, FIM2, C-FMS, and CD115) is a single-pass transmembrane receptor with an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a C-terminal intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand binding of CSF1 or the interleukin 34 ligand (referred to herein as IL34; also referred to in the art as C16orf77 and MGC34647) to CSF1R leads to receptor dimerization, upregulation of CSF1R protein tyrosine kinase activity, phosphorylation of CSF1R tyrosine residues, and downstream signaling events. Both CSF1 and IL34 stimulate monocyte survival, proliferation, and differentiation into macrophages. However, IL34 was discovered recently, and its overall functions have not been fully established.","Dysregulation of CSF1R activity may result in an imbalance in the levels and\/or activities of macrophage and osteoclast cell populations, which may lead to disease-associated pathology. Based on their known and suspected contributions to human disease, both CSF1R and CSF1 have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for osteolytic bone loss and cancer. Indeed, CSF1R and CSF1 antagonists such as antibodies directed against CSF1R or CSF1 (see e.g., WO 2007\/081879), antisense- and siRNA-mediated silencing of CSF1R or CSF1 expression (see e.g., WO 2007\/081879), soluble forms of the CSF1R (see e.g., WO 2007\/081879), and small molecule inhibitors of CSF1R tyrosine kinase activity (see e.g., Ohno et al., 5(11): 2634-2643 (2006); Murray et al., & 20:757-766 (2003); and Conway et al., 102(44):16078-16083 (2005)), have been proposed for targeting osteolytic bone loss. Despite the proposed utility of such CSF1R and CSF1 antagonists, there remains a need in the art for the identification of additional agents with a demonstrated ability to inhibit disease pathology in vivo, such as osteolytic bone loss, cancer metastasis, cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss, and tumor growth.","To date, we are not aware of any demonstration of a CSF1R ECD fusion molecule shown to be effective at treating osteolytic bone loss, cancer metastasis, cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss, or tumor growth in vivo. As described herein, the inventors have found that CSF1R ECD fusion molecules of the invention inhibit osteolytic bone loss in vivo models, including osteolytic bone loss resulting from cancer metastasis to bone (See Examples 8 and 10). Furthermore, the inventors have also shown that CSF1R ECD fusion molecules inhibit cancer metastasis in vivo (See Example 9). In certain cancers, the inventors have found that CSF1R ECD fusion molecules directly inhibit primary tumor growth in vivo (See Example 9).","In addition, the inventors have found that certain of the CSF1R ECD fusion molecules of the invention exhibit improved properties, including improvements to therapeutically relevant properties. For example, the inventors have found that expression of CSF1R ECD fusion molecules in CHO cells results in more highly sialylated CSF1R ECD fusion molecules, which are more stable than such fusion molecules produced in 293-6E cells. Also, the inventors have found that a CSF1R ECD fusion molecule wherein the CSF1R ECD has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.:2 (amino acids 20-506 of the human CSF1R protein) binds the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34 more tightly and more effectively inhibits monocyte growth in an in vitro assay than a full-length CSF1R ECD fusion molecule wherein the CSF1R ECD has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.:1 (amino acids 20-512 of the human CSF1R protein). Thus, this CSF1R ECD fusion molecule provides a particularly attractive therapeutic molecule.","Accordingly, the present invention provides methods and compositions for treating osteolytic disorders, including but not limited to, osteolytic bone loss. Osteolytic bone loss may include cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss. The present invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting cancer metastasis and inhibiting CSF1R-dependent tumor growth.","The invention includes a method of treating osteolytic bone loss in a patient comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a CSF1R ECD fusion molecule, wherein the CSF1R ECD fusion molecule comprises a CSF1R ECD and one or more fusion partners.

Polymers employed in the invention will be pharmaceutically acceptable for the preparation of a therapeutic product or composition.","Suitable, clinically acceptable, water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, copolymers of ethylene glycol\/propylene glycol, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1,3,6-trioxane, ethylene\/maleic anhydride copolymer, poly (\u03b2-amino acids) (either homopolymers or random copolymers), poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone) polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol homopolymers (PPG) and other polyakylene oxides, polypropylene oxide\/ethylene oxide copolymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (POG) (e.g., glycerol) and other polyoxyethylated polyols, polyoxyethylated sorbitol, or polyoxyethylated glucose, colonic acids or other carbohydrate polymers, Ficoll, or dextran and mixtures thereof.","As used herein, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is meant to encompass any of the forms that have been used to derivatize other proteins, such as mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water.","Polymers used herein, for example water soluble polymers, may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. In certain embodiments, the polymers each typically have an average molecular weight of between about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa (the term \u201cabout\u201d indicating that in preparations of a polymer, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the stated molecular weight). The average molecular weight of each polymer may be between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa, or between about 12 kDa and about 25 kDa. Generally, the higher the molecular weight or the more branches, the higher the polymer:protein ratio. Other sizes may also be used, depending on the desired therapeutic profile; for example, the duration of sustained release; the effects, if any, on biological activity; the ease in handling; the degree or lack of antigenicity; and other known effects of a polymer on a CSF1R ECD of the invention.","Polymers employed in the present invention are typically attached to a CSF1R ECD with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the polypeptide. In general, chemical derivatization may be performed under any suitable condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Activating groups which can be used to link the polymer to the active moieties include sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane, and 5-pyridyl.","Polymers of the invention are typically attached to a heterologous polypeptide at the alpha (\u03b1) or epsilon (\u03b5) amino groups of amino acids or a reactive thiol group, but it is also contemplated that a polymer group could be attached to any reactive group of the protein that is sufficiently reactive to become attached to a polymer group under suitable reaction conditions. Thus, a polymer may be covalently bound to a CSF1R ECD via a reactive group, such as a free amino or carboxyl group. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N-terminal amino acid residue. Those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues, glutamic acid residues, and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Those having a reactive thiol group include cysteine residues.","Methods for preparing fusion molecules conjugated with polymers, such as water soluble polymers, will each generally involve (a) reacting a CSF1R ECD with a polymer under conditions whereby the polypeptide becomes attached to one or more polymers and (b) obtaining the reaction product. Reaction conditions for each conjugation may be selected from any of those known in the art or those subsequently developed, but should be selected to avoid or limit exposure to reaction conditions such as temperatures, solvents, and pH levels that would inactivate the protein to be modified. In general, the optimal reaction conditions for the reactions will be determined case-by-case based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of polymer:polypeptide conjugate, the greater the percentage of conjugated product. The optimum ratio (in terms of efficiency of reaction in that there is no excess unreacted polypeptide or polymer) may be determined by factors such as the desired degree of derivatization (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-, etc.), the molecular weight of the polymer selected, whether the polymer is branched or unbranched, and the reaction conditions used. The ratio of polymer (for example, PEG) to a polypeptide will generally range from 1:1 to 100:1. One or more purified conjugates may be prepared from each mixture by standard purification techniques, including among others, dialysis, salting-out, ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and electrophoresis.","One may specifically desire an N-terminal chemically modified CSF1R ECD. One may select a polymer by molecular weight, branching, etc., the proportion of polymers to CSF1R ECD molecules in the reaction mix, the type of reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected N-terminal chemically modified CSF1R ECD. The method of obtaining the N-terminal chemically modified CSF1R ECD preparation (separating this moiety from other monoderivatized moieties if necessary) may be by purification of the N-terminal chemically modified CSF1R ECD material from a population of chemically modified protein molecules.","Selective N-terminal chemical modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the N-terminal) available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group-containing polymer is achieved. For example, one may selectively attach a polymer to the N terminus of the protein by performing the reaction at a pH that allows one to take advantage of the pKa differences between the s-amino group of the lysine residues and that of the \u03b1-amino group of the N-terminal residue of the protein. By such selective derivatization, attachment of a polymer to a protein is controlled: the conjugation with the polymer takes place predominantly at the N terminus of the protein and no significant modification of other reactive groups, such as the lysine side chain amino groups, occurs. Using reductive alkylation, the polymer may be of the type described above and should have a single reactive aldehyde for coupling to the protein. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, containing a single reactive aldehyde, may also be used.","In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates the chemically derivatized CSF1R ECD to include mono- or poly- (e.g., 2-4) PEG moieties. Pegylation may be carried out by any of the pegylation reactions available. Methods for preparing a pegylated protein product will generally include (a) reacting a polypeptide with polyethylene glycol (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG) under conditions whereby the protein becomes attached to one or more PEG groups; and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). In general, the optimal reaction conditions will be determined case by case based on known parameters and the desired result.","There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art. See, for example, EP 0 401 384; Malik et al., 20:1028-1035 (1992); Francis, 3(2):4-10 (1992); EP 0 154 316; EP 0 401 384; WO 92\/16221; WO 95\/34326; and the other publications cited herein that relate to pegylation.","The step of pegylation as described herein may be carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule. Thus, protein products according to the present invention include pegylated proteins wherein the PEG group(s) is (are) attached via acyl or alkyl groups. Such products may be mono-pegylated or poly-pegylated (for example, those containing 2-6 or 2-5 PEG groups). The PEG groups are generally attached to the protein at the \u03b1- or \u03b5-amino groups of amino acids, but it is also contemplated that the PEG groups could be attached to any amino group attached to the protein that is sufficiently reactive to become attached to a PEG group under suitable reaction conditions.","Pegylation by acylation generally involves reacting an active ester derivative of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a CSF1R ECD of the invention. For acylation reactions, the polymer(s) selected typically have a single reactive ester group. Any known or subsequently discovered reactive PEG molecule may be used to carry out the pegylation reaction. An example of a suitable activated PEG ester is PEG esterified to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). As used herein, acylation is contemplated to include, without limitation, the following types of linkages between the therapeutic protein and a polymer such as PEG: amide, carbamate, urethane, and the like, see for example, Chamow, 5:133-140 (1994). Reaction conditions may be selected from any of those currently known or those subsequently developed, but should avoid conditions such as temperature, solvent, and pH that would inactivate the polypeptide to be modified.","Pegylation by acylation will generally result in a poly-pegylated protein. The connecting linkage may be an amide. The resulting product may be substantially only (e.g., >95%) mono-, di-, or tri-pegylated. However, some species with higher degrees of pegylation may be formed in amounts depending on the specific reaction conditions used. If desired, more purified pegylated species may be separated from the mixture (particularly unreacted species) by standard purification techniques, including among others, dialysis, salting-out, ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and electrophoresis.","Pegylation by alkylation generally involves reacting a terminal aldehyde derivative of PEG with a polypeptide in the presence of a reducing agent. For the reductive alkylation reaction, the polymer(s) selected should have a single reactive aldehyde group. An exemplary reactive PEG aldehyde is polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono C1-C10 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,714.","Markers","Moreover, CSF1R ECDs of the present invention may be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. The marker amino acid sequence may be a hexa-histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification, the hemagglutinin (HA) tag, corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza HA protein. (Wilson et al., 37:767 (1984)). Any of these above fusions may be engineered using the CSF1R ECDs of the present invention.","Oligomerization Domain Fusion Partners","In various embodiments, oligomerization offers certain functional advantages to a fusion protein, including, but not limited to, multivalency, increased binding strength, and the combined function of different domains. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a fusion partner comprises an oligomerization domain, for example, a dimerization domain. Exemplary oligomerization domains include, but are not limited to, coiled-coil domains, including alpha-helical coiled-coil domains; collagen domains; collagen-like domains; and certain immunoglobulin domains. Certain exemplary coiled-coil polypeptide fusion partners include the tetranectin coiled-coil domain; the coiled-coil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; angiopoietin coiled-coil domains; and leucine zipper domains. Certain exemplary collagen or collagen-like oligomerization domains include, but are not limited to, those found in collagens, mannose binding lectin, lung surfactant proteins A and D, adiponectin, ficolin, conglutinin, macrophage scavenger receptor, and emilin.","Antibody Fc Immunoglobulin Domain Fusion Partners","Many Fc domains that may be used as fusion partners are known in the art. In certain embodiments, a fusion partner is an Fc immunoglobulin domain. An Fc fusion partner may be a wild-type Fc found in a naturally occurring antibody, a variant thereof, or a fragment thereof. Non-limiting exemplary Fc fusion partners include Fcs comprising a hinge and the CH2 and CH3 constant domains of a human IgG, for example, human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. Certain additional Fc fusion partners include, but are not limited to, human IgA and IgM. In certain embodiments, an Fc fusion partner comprises a C237S mutation. In certain embodiments, an Fc fusion partner comprises a hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of human IgG2 with a P331S mutation, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,900,292. Certain exemplary Fc domain fusion partners are shown in SEQ ID NOs.:19 to 21.","Albumin Fusion Partners and Albumin-binding Molecule Fusion Partners","In certain embodiments, a fusion partner is an albumin. Certain exemplary albumins include, but are not limited to, human serum album (HSA) and fragments of HSA that are capable of increasing the serum half-life or bioavailability of the polypeptide to which they are fused. In certain embodiments, a fusion partner is an albumin-binding molecule, such as, for example, a peptide that binds albumin or a molecule that conjugates with a lipid or other molecule that binds albumin. In certain embodiments, a fusion molecule comprising HSA is prepared as described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,179.","Exemplary Attachment of Fusion Partners","The fusion partner may be attached, either covalently or non-covalently, to the N terminus or the C terminus of the CSF1R ECD. The attachment may also occur at a location within the CSF1R ECD other than the N terminus or the C terminus, for example, through an amino acid side chain (such as, for example, the side chain of cysteine, lysine, serine, or threonine).","In either covalent or non-covalent attachment embodiments, a linker may be included between the fusion partner and the CSF1R ECD. Such linkers may be comprised of at least one amino acid or chemical moiety. Exemplary methods of covalently attaching a fusion partner to a CSF1R ECD include, but are not limited to, translation of the fusion partner and the CSF1R ECD as a single amino acid sequence and chemical attachment of the fusion partner to the CSF1R ECD. When the fusion partner and a CSF1R ECD are translated as single amino acid sequence, additional amino acids may be included between the fusion partner and the CSF1R ECD as a linker. In certain embodiments, the linker is glycine-serine (\u201cGS\u201d). In certain embodiments, the linker is selected based on the polynucleotide sequence that encodes it, to facilitate cloning the fusion partner and\/or CSF1R ECD into a single expression construct (for example, a polynucleotide containing a particular restriction site may be placed between the polynucleotide encoding the fusion partner and the polynucleotide encoding the CSF1R ECD, wherein the polynucleotide containing the restriction site encodes a short amino acid linker sequence). When the fusion partner and the CSF1R ECD are covalently coupled by chemical means, linkers of various sizes may typically be included during the coupling reaction.","Exemplary methods of non-covalently attaching a fusion partner to a CSF1R ECD include, but are not limited to, attachment through a binding pair. Exemplary binding pairs include, but are not limited to, biotin and avidin or streptavidin, an antibody and its antigen, etc.","In embodiments wherein the FGFR1 ECD sequence comprises SEQ ID NO:2 (which terminates at residue 506 of the human full length FGFR1 ECD), the FGFR1 ECD fusion molecule amino acid sequence excludes the last six C-terminal residues of SEQ ID NO:1 (which correspond to residues 507-512 of the human FGFR1 ECD). This phrase means that any additional amino acid residues that immediately follow the C-terminal amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO:2, such as from a polypeptide fusion partner or peptide linker, do not begin with the amino acid sequence of 507-512 of the human FGFR1 ECD, which is THPPDE. Although, of course, the amino acid sequence THPPDE may appear elsewhere in the amino acid sequence of the inventive proteins.","Signal Peptide","In order for some secreted proteins to express and secrete in large quantities, a signal peptide from a heterologous protein may be desirable. Employing heterologous signal peptides may be advantageous in that a resulting mature polypeptide may remain unaltered as the signal peptide is removed in the ER during the secretion process. The addition of a heterologous signal peptide may be required to express and secrete some proteins.","Certain exemplary signal peptide sequences are described, e.g., in the online Signal Peptide Database maintained by the Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore. See Choo et al., 6: 249 (2005); and PCT Publication No. WO 2006\/081430.","Co-Translational and Post-Translational Modifications","The invention encompasses CSF1R ECDs and CSF1R ECD fusion molecules that are differentially modified during or after translation, for example by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, or linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, V8 protease; NABH; acetylation; formylation; oxidation; reduction; and\/or metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin.","Additional post-translational modifications encompassed by the invention include, for example, for example, N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, processing of N-terminal or C-terminal ends), attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone, chemical modifications of N-linked or O-linked carbohydrate chains, and addition or deletion of an N-terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression","Nucleic Acid Molecules Encoding CSF1R ECDs and Nucleic Acid Molecules Encoding CSF1R ECD Fusion Molecules","Nucleic acid molecules comprising polynucleotides that encode CSF1R ECDs or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules are provided. Nucleic acid molecules comprising polynucleotides that encode CSF1R ECD fusion molecules in which the CSF1R ECD and the fusion partner are translated as a single polypeptide are also provided. Such nucleic acid molecules may be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques conventional in the art.","In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding a CSF1R ECD comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes a signal peptide, which, when translated, will be fused to the N terminus of the CSF1R ECD. As discussed above, the signal peptide may be the native CSF1R signal peptide, or may be another heterologous signal peptide. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule comprising the polynucleotide encoding the gene of interest is an expression vector that is suitable for expression in a selected host cell.","CSF1R ECD and CSF1R ECD Fusion Molecule Expression and Production","Vectors","Vectors comprising polynucleotides that encode CSF1R ECDs are provided. Vectors comprising polynucleotides that encode CSF1R ECD fusion molecules are also provided. Such vectors include, but are not limited to, DNA vectors, phage vectors, viral vectors, retroviral vectors, etc.","In certain embodiments, a vector is selected that is optimized for expression of polypeptides in CHO or CHO-derived cells. Exemplary such vectors are described, e.g., in Running Deer et al., 20:880-889 (2004).","In certain embodiments, a vector is chosen for in vivo expression of CSF1R ECDs and\/or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules in animals, including humans. In certain such embodiments, expression of the polypeptide is under the control of a promoter that functions in a tissue-specific manner. For example, liver-specific promoters are described, e.g., in PCT Publication No. WO 2006\/076288.","Host Cells","In various embodiments, CSF1R ECDs or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules may be expressed in prokaryotic cells, such as bacterial cells; or in eukaryotic cells, such as fungal cells, plant cells, insect cells, and mammalian cells. Such expression may be carried out, for example, according to procedures known in the art. Certain exemplary eukaryotic cells that may be used to express polypeptides include, but are not limited to, COS cells, including COS 7 cells; 293 cells, including 293-6E cells; CHO cells, including CHO-S and DG44 cells; and NSO cells. In certain embodiments, a particular eukaryotic host cell is selected based on its ability to make certain desired post-translational modifications to the CSF1R ECDs or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules. For example, in certain embodiments, CHO cells produce CSF1R ECD fusion molecules that have a higher level of sialylation than the same polypeptide produced in 293 cells.","Introduction of a nucleic acid into a desired host cell may be accomplished by any method known in the art, including but not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, etc. Certain exemplary methods are described, e.g., in Sambrook et al., 3ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001). Nucleic acids may be transiently or stably transfected in the desired host cells, according to methods known in the art.","In certain embodiments, a polypeptide may be produced in vivo in an animal that has been engineered or transfected with a nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide, according to methods known in the art.","Purification of CSF1R ECD Polypeptides","CSF1R ECDs or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules may be purified by various methods known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, the use of affinity matrices or hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Suitable affinity ligands include any ligands of the CSF1R ECD or of the fusion partner, or antibodies thereto. For example, a Protein A, Protein G, Protein A\/G, or an antibody affinity column may be used to bind to an Fc fusion partner to purify a CSF1R ECD fusion molecule. Antibodies to CSF1R ECD may also be used to purify CSF1R ECD or CSF1R ECD fusion molecules. Hydrophobic interactive chromatography, for example, a butyl or phenyl column, may also suitable for purifying certain polypeptides. Many methods of purifying polypeptides are known in the art.","Therapeutic Compositions and Methods","Routes of Administration and Carriers","In various embodiments, CSF1R ECD fusion molecules may be administered in vivo by various routes, including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, parenteral, intranasal, intramuscular, intracardiac, intraventricular, intratracheal, buccal, rectal, intraperitoneal, intradermal, topical, transdermal, and intrathecal, or otherwise by implantation or inhalation.

Clones of the CSF1R ECD fusion proteins were generated using PCR and conventional subcloning techniques. The GenBank accession numbers for the human CSF1R and mouse CSF1R genes and their encoded proteins are as follows: human CSF1R (NM005221 and NP005202) and mouse CSF1R (NM001037859 and NP001032948). For use in transient transfection of 293-6E cells, the hCSF1R.506, hCSF1R.512, mCSF1R.506, and mCSF1R.511 cDNAs are cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning site of the pTT5-J vector. The pTT5-J vector is a modified version of the pTT5 vector (provided by Yves Durocher, Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada) that contains a cDNA encoding the Fc region of a human IgG1 protein (amino acid residues 233-464 of GenBank accession number AAH19337) in which the cysteine residue at position 237 is replaced with a serine residue (Fc C237S; SEQ ID NO.:19) inserted into the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site. This initial cloning step introduces a glycine-serine (GS) linker between the CSF and the Fc due to the nucleic acids introduced by the BamHI restriction enzyme site. The nucleotides encoding the GS linker may be subsequently removed using standard molecular biology techniques. The sequences of the resulting clones were verified, and the constructs (fused to the Fc alone (Fc) or to the GS linker followed by the Fc (GS-Fc)) were used for subcloning into other vectors.","For use in stable transfection of CHO cells, the hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506-Fc cDNAs were subcloned into the pDEF38 vector (ICOS Corporation, Bothell, Wash.). The hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pTT5-J and mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pTT5-J clones were used for subcloning into the pDEF38 vector using standard molecular biology techniques. The hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506 cDNAs were inserted into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the pDEF38 vector, and the sequences of the resulting clones were verified.","For experiments using minicircle DNA, the mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc cDNAs are subcloned into the p2xC31MasterSfi vector, which is a modified version of the p\u00d8C31.hFIX vector (Chen et al., 16:126-131 (2005)) in which an SfiI site was introduced after the intron for the purpose of cloning. The mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J clones are used for subcloning into the p2xC31MasterSfi vector using standard molecular biology techniques. The mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc cDNAs are inserted into the SfiI site of the p2xC31MasterSfi vector, and the sequences of the resulting clones were verified.","The primary sequence and domain structure of the full-length human CSF1R extracellular domain, which consists of 512 amino acid residues, are shown in . The five IgG domains are denoted from N terminus to C terminus as IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, IgG-4, and IgG-5. Two human CSF1R ECD clones were constructed and are fused to either an Fc alone or to a GS linker followed by an Fc at their C terminus: the full-length CSF1R ECD (hCSF1R.512-Fc or hCSF1R.512-GS-Fc, respectively) and a CSF1R ECD that excludes the last six C-terminal amino acid residues of the full-length human CSF1R ECD (referred to herein as hCSF1R.506-Fc or hCSF1R.506-GS-Fc).

The hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pTT5-J, hCSF1R.506-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J, hCSF1R.512-Fc\/pTT5-J, and hCSF1R.512-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J plasmid constructs described in Example 1 were designed to provide transient expression in 293-6E host cells. The hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 and mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 plasmid constructs described in Example 1 were designed to provide stable expression in CHO cells (or its derivatives, such as DG44 cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.)).","Small scale production of CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins was achieved by transient transfection of 293-6E cells grown in polycarbonate Erlenmeyer flasks fitted with a vented screw cap, rotated on a table top shaker at 130 RPM, and grown in Freestyle medium (Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% COat cell densities ranging from 0.5\u00d710to 3\u00d710cells\/ml. Typically, 50 ml of cell culture was grown in a 250 ml flask. One day before the transfection, the cells were diluted to 0.6\u00d710cells\/ml in fresh Freestyle medium. On the day of transfection, the cells were in log phase (0.8\u00d710to 1.5\u00d710cells\/ml), and the cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d710cells\/ml. The transfection mix was prepared by adding 2.5 ml sterile PBS to two 15 ml tubes; 50 ug of DNA was added to one tube, and 100 ul of PEI solution (sterile stock solution of 1 mg\/ml polyethylenimine, linear, 25 kDa, pH 7.0 (Polysciences, Warrington, Wis.)) was added to the second tube; the contents of the two tubes were combined and allowed to incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature in order to form the transfection complex. The transfection complex was transferred to the 293-6E cell suspension culture, which was allowed to grow for 6-7 days at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO. At 24 hours post-transfection, the supplement tryptone N1 (Catalog #19 553, OrganoTechnie S.A., (La Courneuve, France)) was added to 0.5% (v\/v) to the cells to feed the cells and stimulate protein production. The tryptone N1 was made up as a 20% (w\/v) stock solution in water, filter sterilized using a 0.2 um filter, and stored at 4\u00b0 C. until use.","The 293-6E cultures expressing the CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins were harvested on either day 6 or 7 post-transfection when the cell viability was above 60%. The culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 5,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C., and then loaded onto a 5 ml HiTrap Protein A HP column (GE Catalog #17-0403-01) that was equilibrated in Buffer A (0.5 M NaCl, 1\u00d7PBS). The column was washed using 10 column volumes of Buffer A, and the protein was eluted using a mix linear-step gradient over 15 column volumes of Buffer B (0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.7). The flow rate was 3 ml\/min, and 1 ml fractions were collected into 100 ul of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.5, in a 96-well deep well block to neutralize the glycine. After purification, the fractions were pooled based on their purity (>95%) as determined by Coomassie staining of an SDS-PAGE gel, and their endotoxin level was determined (1-2 EU\/mg). The CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion protein was then dialyzed overnight in 1\u00d7PBS and filter sterilized.","Large scale production of CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins was achieved by stable transfection of CHO-derived DG44 cells, which are negative for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) expression. The expression vectors comprising hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 and mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 described in Example 1 were used for transfection of the DG44 cells for stable production of the hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion proteins, respectively. In this process, untransfected DHFR-negative DG44 cells were cultured in CHO-CD serum-free medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, Calif.) supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine, 1\u00d7 Hypoxanthine\/Thymidine (HT; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), and 18 ml\/L of Pluronic-68 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). About 50 ug of plasmid DNA comprising hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 or mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 was first linearized by digestion with the PvuI restriction enzyme, ethanol precipitated, briefly air-dried, and subsequently resuspended in 400 ul of sterile, distilled water. Cultured DG44 host cells were seeded into a shaker flask at about 5\u00d710cells\/ml the day before transfection, which reached about 1\u00d710cells\/ml on the day of transfection. The cells were harvested, and about 1\u00d710cells per transfection were pelleted by centrifugation.","For transfection, each cell pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of Nucleofector V solution and transferred to an Amaxa Nucleofector cuvette (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). About 5 ug of the resuspended linearized plasmid DNA was added and mixed with the suspended DG44 cells in the cuvette. The cells were then electroporated using an Amaxa Nucleofector Device II using program U-024. Electroporated cells were cultured in CHO-CD medium for two days and were then transferred into selective medium (CHO-CD serum free medium supplemented with 8 mM L-Glutamine, and 18 ml\/L Pluronic-68). The selective medium was changed once every week. After about 12 days, 1 ug\/ml R3 Long IGF-1 growth factor (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to the medium and the culture was continued for another week until confluent. The supernatants from pools of stably transfected cell lines were assayed using a sandwich ELISA assay with an anti-Fc antibody to determine the protein titer. This transfection method generated an expression level of about 30 ug\/ml of the hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion proteins from the pools of stably transfected cells.","For stable cell line development, a total of one hundred 96-well plates and twenty-two 96-well plates, each seeded with a calculated density of three cells per well, were screened for hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506-Fc overexpression, respectively, using an anti-Fc antibody in an ELISA-based assay. Microscopic inspection of the top 500 hCSF1R.506-Fc-expressing wells showed that 250 of the wells had single colonies, which were expanded from 96-well plates to 6-well plates. Similarly, the top 24 mCSF1R.506-Fc-expressing wells were expanded from 96-well plates to 6-well plates. Titers were re-analyzed in a 6-well production model, and the top 48 hCSF1R.506-Fc clones and the top 12 mCSF1R.506-Fc clones were further expanded into T75 flasks in serum-free medium. Six of the hCSF1R.506-Fc clones were discarded due to a failure to grow during this process. Based on titer re-analysis, the top 25 hCSF1R.506-Fc clones and one mCSF1R.506-Fc clone were transferred into shaker flasks to begin the process of adapting the clones to suspension culture in CHO-CD medium. Titers were re-analyzed for the suspension cultures by seeding the cells at 0.5\u00d710cells\/ml in 50 ml of culture medium in a 250 ml shaker flask. The cultures were fed on day 3 with 10% feeding medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, Calif.), and the culture temperature was shifted to 32\u00b0 C. on the same day. On day 12, the spent medium was harvested, and the hCSF1R.506-Fc and mCSF1R.506-Fc protein levels were determined by ELISA. One of the hCSF1R.506-Fc clones and the mCSF1R.506-Fc clone were selected for process development based on high production levels and sialic acid content, and a research cell bank was prepared for each clone. The hCSF1R.506-Fc clone had a titer of 250 mg\/l, and the mCSF1R.506-Fc clone had a titer of 100 mg\/l when grown in shaker flasks.","Following expression and secretion of CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins from DG44 cells, Protein A affinity chromatography and SP cation exchange chromatography were used to purify the fusion proteins. The Protein A step served as an enrichment step, and the cation exchange step was both a secondary purification step and an endotoxin removal step. The cell supernatant was substantially purified by initial capture using mAbSelect Protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare #17-5199), which is an affinity matrix used to bind to the Fc. Prior to loading, the column was equilibrated with five column volumes of sterile buffer A (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mM NaCl). The cell supernatant was applied at a linear velocity of 152.9 cm\/h on an XK50 column with a bed dimension of 5 cm\u00d75 cm. Bound CSF1R-ECD-Fc was then washed with five column volumes of sterile buffer A. Elution was then carried out by applying a step gradient of sterile buffer B (100 mM glycine, pH 2.7, 20 mM NaCl) at a linear velocity of 305.7 cm\/h for five column volumes. Two 250 ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 25 ml of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0 (Cellgro #46-031-CM) to neutralize the eluate. All bound CSF1R-ECD-Fc was completely eluted by 2.5 column volumes as judged by the A280 chromatographic trace and by SDS-PAGE.","The Protein A column eluate comprising the CSF1R-ECD-Fc was then diluted 10-fold with buffer C (50 mM MES, pH 5.5) and subjected to further purification by SP Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare #17-1087) cation exchange chromatography that was packed into an XK50 column with 200 ml of resin with a bed dimension of 5 cm\u00d710 cm. The Protein A material was applied at a linear velocity of 79.1 cm\/h. The bound protein was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer D (20 mM MES, pH 5.5, 20 mM NaCl). A 20 column volume linear gradient was applied from 0% to 100% buffer F (20 mM MES, pH 5.5, 300 mM NaCl), followed by five column volumes of buffer F. Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the CSF1R-ECD-Fc-containing fractions were pooled.","Following the purification, endotoxin levels were determined by the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) using the Endosafe PTS assay system (Charles River Laboratories). Endotoxin levels were typically below 0.1 EU\/mg at this step. The highly purified material from the cation exchange column was then concentrated to the desired concentration and dialyzed against a 10-fold volume of 1\u00d7PBS with one change of buffer of 10-fold volume after more than 3 hours at 4\u00b0 C. The dialyzed material was collected after an additional 20 hours of dialysis. The purified samples were aliquotted and flash frozen by liquid nitrogen for long-term storage at \u221280\u00b0 C.","Experiments were carried out to examine glycosylation and sialylation of the hCSF1R.506-Fc fusion protein expressed in 293-6E cells and in the CHO-derived DG44 cells. These experiments showed that the CHO- and 293-6E-produced CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins exhibited a similar overall level of glycosylation. However, the level of sialylation was higher in the CHO expression system relative to the 293-6E expression system. CHO-produced CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins exhibited a 10-fold higher level of tetra-sialylated glycans, a six-fold higher level of tri-sialylated glycans, a two-fold higher level of di-sialylated glycans, and a 2-fold reduction in the level of neutral glycans, which are involved in liver clearance.  shows the percentages of neutral, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-sialylation in CHO- and 293-6E-produced hCSF1R.506-Fc (corresponding values are shown below the graph).","Long-term storage of the purified CHO-produced fusion proteins at 4\u00b0 C. (up to 5 weeks) showed little evidence of the laddering pattern observed with the 293-6E-produced fusion proteins. The CHO-produced CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion protein has been concentrated to 90 mg\/ml without any evidence of aggregation. Therefore, the increased level of sialylation associated with CHO-produced CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins leads to enhanced in vitro stability of the protein and also offers new routes of administration.","In order to determine whether the human CSF1R-ECD-Fc fusion proteins bind to the CSF1 and IL34 ligands, the hCSF1R.506-GS-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:32) and hCSF1R.512-GS-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:31) fusion proteins were expressed and purified from the culture media of 293-6E cells transiently transfected with the hCSF1R.506-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J plasmid vector or the hCSF1R.512-GS-Fc\/pTT5-J plasmid vector, respectively, as described in Example 2.","The CSF1 and IL34 ligand binding affinity and kinetics of the hCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and hCSF1R.512-GS-Fc fusion proteins were determined using Biacore\u00ae X surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology (Uppsala, Sweden). CSF1 and IL34 are the only two ligands known to interact with the CSF1R ECD.

A comparison between Group 3 (Albumin+Vitamin D3) and Group 4 (mCSF1R.506-Fc+Vitamin D3) showed that mCSF1R.506-Fc treatment resulted in a 44% reduction in ionized calcium levels in peripheral blood (Turkey test, Group 3 vs. Group 4: p<0.001). As shown in , administration of vitamin D3 significantly increased the level of PYD, a biomarker of bone degradation. Treatment with mCSF1R.506-Fc at 20 mg\/kg once a day for two weeks also resulted in a reduction in PYD levels in peripheral blood. A comparison between Group 3 (Albumin+Vitamin D3) and Group 4 (mCSF1R.506-Fc+Vitamin D3) showed that mCSF1R.506-Fc treatment resulted in a 91% reduction in PYD levels in peripheral blood (Turkey test, Group 3 vs. Group 4: p<0.001).","Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that the mCSF1R.506-Fc ECD fusion protein effectively protected against vitamin D3-induced hypercalcemia and osteolytic bone loss.","The CSF1R ECD fusion proteins were tested in an established mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 model for their ability to inhibit tumor growth and\/or metastasis. The 4T1 model is an aggressive mammary carcinoma cell line that spontaneously metastasizes to remote organs, including lung, spleen, and lymph node following subcutaneous implantation. The mouse CSF1R ECD fusion proteins were tested to determine whether they could inhibit the growth of the primary tumor and\/or the spontaneous lung metastasis. For these experiments, the minicircle DNA vectors (mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc\/p2xC31MasterSfi and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc\/p2xC31MasterSfi) containing the polynucleotides encoding the mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:34) and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:33) fusion proteins, described in Example 1, were employed. The mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion protein (SEQ ID NO.:8) was expressed and purified from the culture media of CHO cells stably transfected with the mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 plasmid vector as described in Example 2. For these experiments, six week old female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used.","In the experiment to study anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity following treatment by hydrodynamic transfection with minicircle DNA, the mice were weighed, ear tagged, and divided randomly into one of three treatment groups:\n\n","The 4T1 cells were cultured for two passages in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% L-glutamine at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO. One day after hydrodynamic transfection with the minicircle DNA, the 4T1 cells were harvested and implanted subcutaneously over the right flank of the mice at 1.25\u00d710cells\/100 ul\/mouse. Primary tumor volume and body weight were measured two times per week. When the primary tumor volume in the saline control group was equal to 2,500 mm, the mice were euthanized, and the lungs were collected and fixed in Bouin's solution. Metastatic lung nodules were counted manually.","In the experiment to study anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity following treatment with purified mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion protein (m506 protein), the mice were weighed, ear tagged, and divided randomly into one of three treatment groups:\n\n","The results of these experiments to examine anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities associated with CSF1R ECD fusion proteins are shown in , respectively. As shown in , hydrodynamic transfection of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA resulted in 34% primary tumor growth inhibition on day 19 (Tukey test, p<0.05). Hydrodynamic transfection of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA showed a trend of tumor growth inhibition (24%, Tukey test, p>0.05) on day 19. Administration of the purified mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion protein did not inhibit tumor growth using the dose and schedule employed. As shown in , hydrodynamic transfection of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA or mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA, and administration of purified mCSF1R.506-Fc protein all showed a reduction of spontaneous lung metastasis. Hydrodynamic transfection with mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA or mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules by 61% and 60%, respectively (Tukey test, p<0.001). See . Administration of purified mCSF1R.506-Fc fusion protein at a dose of 10 mg\/kg or 20 mg\/kg reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules by 42% or 38%, respectively (Tukey test, p<0.001). See ","For the experiments involving hydrodynamic transfection of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA and mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA, corresponding serum protein levels of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc were determined in control mice that were hydrodynamically transfected but were not enrolled in the study. In this drug exposure monitoring study, 200 ul of whole blood were collected by retroorbital bleeding on days 3, 7, 14, and 25. The whole blood was transferred into EDTA-coated tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and was spun down at 5000 rpm using a benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf North America, Westbury, N.Y.). The plasma was collected and transferred into 1 ml eppendorf sample tubes. The levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc proteins were analyzed using an Fc sandwich ELISA assay. In this assay, a Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plate (# 439-454, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, N.Y.) was coated with goat anti-human Fc polyclonal antibody (#A80-104A, Bethyl Labs, Montgomery, Tex.) at a concentration of 2 ug\/ml overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The wells were then blocked with 1% BSA (fraction V; Sigma #A3059) in PBS at room temperature for 2 hours. Purified mCSF1R-506-Fc was used as a standard and was added into plasma from na\u00efve SCID mice at a starting concentration of 10 ug\/ml. The purified mCSF1R-506-Fc standard was then serially diluted seven times at a ratio of 1:2 in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (the dilution buffer), and was added to the wells in duplicates. The plasma samples from the study were diluted 20-fold in the dilution buffer and were added to the wells in duplicates. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes with agitation. After washing, the HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgG-Fc antibody was added at a 1:60000 dilution for 1 hour to detect the captured mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc or mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc fusion proteins. The TMB substrate (#TMBW-0100-01 BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.) was added at a concentration of 10 ug\/ml and was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The optical density of the tested samples was read at 450 nm using a Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.).","The average serum protein levels of mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc in mice hydrodynamically transfected with the mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA were 1706, 1037, 714, and 536 ug\/ml on days 3, 7, 14, and 25, respectively. The average serum protein levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc in mice hydrodynamically transfected with the mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc-encoding minicircle DNA were 1197, 775, 525, and 311 ug\/ml on days 3, 7, 14, and 25, respectively. The serum protein levels of mCSF1R.506-GS-Fc and mCSF1R.511-GS-Fc in hydrodynamically transfected animals were much higher than in the animals dosed 3 times a week with purified mCSF1R-506-Fc protein at 10 mg\/kg or 20 mg\/kg, in which the trough levels were 144 or 256 ug\/ml, respectively. This may explain why the inhibition of tumor growth was not observed in animals dosed with purified mCSF1R-506-Fc protein.","These experiments suggested that CSF1R ECD fusion proteins inhibit tumor growth and are capable of inhibiting spontaneous tumor metastasis in an aggressive tumor model.","The CSF1R ECD fusion proteins were also tested for their ability to inhibit cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss. These experiments were performed by vivoPharm Pty Ltd (Level 9, 195 North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia) in the established human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 intratibial bone metastasis model. This study examined the efficacy of mCSF1R.506-Fc (m506) and hCSF1R.506-Fc (h506) fusion proteins as monotherapies and in combination against the development and bone lytic activity of MDA-MB-468 tumors. The mCSF1R.506-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:8) and hCSF1R.506-Fc (SEQ ID NO.:6) fusion proteins were expressed and purified from the culture media of CHO cells stably transfected with the mCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 plasmid vector or the hCSF1R.506-Fc\/pDEF38 plasmid vector as described in Example 2.","For the MDA-MB-468 experiments, 60 female C.B-17-Igh-1-Prkdc SCID mice were inoculated intra-tibially with MDA-MB-468 human breast tumor cells. One day later (Day 0), the mice were implanted with a uniquely identified microchip and were then randomly divided into one of five groups:\n\n","Treatment for each group was initiated 24 hours post-inoculation with the MDA-MB-468 tumor cells. Body weight was monitored twice a week. On the last day of the experiment (Day 41), the animals were anesthetized and X-ray images of the right and left tibiae was recorded. The X-ray images were analyzed for osteolytic bone damage using a ranking system in which the bone lysis scores ranged from 0 to 4, with a score of 4 indicating a high degree of bone lysis. Four individuals evaluated the bone lysis score in a blinded manner. The averages of the four individual bone lysis scores were determined and are shown in . Whole blood was collected after X-ray imaging from all mice under anesthesia via cardiac puncture, and plasma samples were prepared for biomarker analysis. All excised tibiae were preserved and sent to SCANCO Medical AG (Switzerland) for assessment of bone density of the tumor implated tibiae using MicroCT scanning.","The results are shown in . As shown in , relative to the albumin negative control, mCSF1R.506-Fc treatment reduced the bone lysis score by 73% (Tukey test: p <0.01), hCSF1R.506-Fc treatment reduced the bone lysis score by 29% (Turkey test: p>0.05), and the combination of mCSF1R.506-Fc plus hCSF1R.506-Fc reduced the bone lysis score by 59% (Tukey test: p<0.05); the positive control ZOMETA\u00ae reduced the bone lysis score by 82% (Tukey test: P<0.001). shows the bone density of the tumor-implanted tibiae by microCT scanning, which demonstrated that the hCSF1R.506-Fc treatment group had lower mean bone volumes (BV) and relative bone volumes (BV\/TV), which were similar to the albumin-treated group. The mCSF1R.506-Fc, mCSF1R.506-Fc plus hCSF1R.506-Fc, and ZOMETA\u00ae treatment groups preserved the relative bone volume by 2.2-, 1.7-, and 9.1-fold, respectively.","These experiments demonstrated that the mCSF1R.506-Fc treatment and the mCSF1R.506-Fc plus hCSF1R.506-Fc combination treatment inhibited cancer metastasis-induced osteolytic bone loss.","Table 4 provides certain sequences discussed herein.
