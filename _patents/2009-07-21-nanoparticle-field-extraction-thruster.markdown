This section also provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.","The Nano-particle Field Extraction Thruster (nanoFET) concept is an approach for nano-particle acceleration to high speeds. According to the present teachings, nano-particles can be delivered without being suspended in a liquid. Particles can be completely dry, lightly lubricated, or treated to minimize particle cohesion. Sieve-like structures and mechanical vibration are used to overcome particle cohesion and adhesion effects to move particles from storage to the nanoFET charging and extraction grid. In addition to aerospace propulsion applications, nanoFET acceleration of nano-particles can be utilized in materials processing, nanoprinting, and biomedical applications, to name a few.","Sieve-like structures can be placed between the extraction and acceleration grids in the nanoFET and its particle reservoir with characteristics dimensions close to that of the nano-particles and larger. Multiple sieve grids can be used. The smallest structures can be based on MEMS\/NEMS technology. The mechanical vibrations are accomplished via a combination of one or more external vibrating sources and integrated sources that are part of the MEMS\/NEMS structures.","Using high speed nano-particles, it is possible to modify material surface properties for improved performance in materials processing. By this method, sputtering, deposition, and implantation are feasible. An important subcategory of this includes enabling improved semiconductor performance through use of nano-particles in fabrication.","Nanometer and micron-scale printing on a wide variety of materials (e.g., paper, plastics, semiconductors, and other targets) are possible for applications such as high security printing, high resolution marking, and direct circuit fabrication including for semiconductor devices. Using the nanoFET architecture of the present teachings, it is possible to consider precise, nanometer placement of particles and control of the energy of deposition.","Furthermore, biomedical applications will benefit from the ability to energetically inject nano-particles in-vivo. This allows the opportunity for treatments through the skin and drug placement at a cellular level. It will be a tool for both treatment and research.","Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

No. 7,516,610, issued on Apr. 14, 2009, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference. A principal focus of the '610 patent was the extraction of nano-particles suspended in insulating and conducting liquids.","With reference to , the present teachings provide a method and apparatus for the transporting, charging, and extracting of micro or nano-particles stored primarily dry or with little or no liquid, to be referred to as the liquidless nanoFET system . Liquidless nanoFET system  provides a system for the delivery, charging, and acceleration of nano-particles generally using a method of transporting dry particles  through one or more ultra-fine conducting sieve electrode system  that serves as a source electrode to separate the clumped nano-particle powder into individually isolated particles  prior to charging and acceleration. It should be understood that a plurality of sieve electrode systems can be used in series if desired.","In some embodiments, liquidless nanoFET system  consists of a particle storage reservoir  directly against sieve electrode system  with a biasing member , such as a spring or control piston, that supplies pressure to help urge particles  through sieve electrode system . It should be understood, however, that biasing member  can be replaced with other urging devices and, in some cases, gravitational forces can be used in place of a dedicated biasing member.","In some embodiments, liquidless nanoFET system  can comprise a vibrational source . Vibrational source  can be a vibrating member or, in some cases, can be other mechanical or acoustical devices capable of imparting a mechanical or other force to disrupt the bond between adjacent particles, surfaces, or other matter.","Sieve electrode system  comprises at least one, but preferably a plurality, of through-hole openings or orifices  extending from a first side of sieve electrode system  to a second side thereof. The first side is adjacent particle storage reservoir  and receives particle  therefrom. The second side is in communication with a volume  discussed below. In some embodiments, the through-hole openings  of sieve electrode system  are sized slightly larger than the size of particle  so that only one particle is capable of passing through each sieve orifice  at a time. This assists in breaking the clumped nano-particle powder within particle storage reservoir  into individually isolated particles . However, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments where extraction of individual particles is not required, openings  can be sized such that two or more particles  can pass therethrough simultaneously.","Liquidless nanoFET system  further comprises a charging grid  and an acceleration grid , stacked above sieve electrode system  and in communication with volume , which can collectively be referred to as grid . It should be appreciated, however, that in some embodiments acceleration grid  can be eliminated and in some embodiments a plurality of acceleration grids  can be used. The construction and operation of charging grid  and acceleration grid  are similar to that described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,516,610. Briefly, an electrical potential (i.e., V, V, etc.) can be applied between adjacent electrodes to define electric field therebetween (i.e., E, E, etc.) acting upon the associated particle. In other words, electric potentials are applied across the conducting sieve electrode system  and the charging grid  and acceleration grid  to generate the charging and accelerating electric fields used to charge and accelerate the individual particles  that pass through sieve electrode system . Once a particle  has charged and lifted off from sieve electrode system , the applied electric field accelerates particle  to high speeds through vias ,  formed in charging grid  and accelerating grid , respectively.","As briefly described above, in some embodiments, a variety of vibrational sources  can be used to overcome particle cohesion and adhesion effects to move particles from storage to the nanoFET charging grid  and accelerating grid . These vibrational sources can, in some embodiments, move the entire nanoFET structure, sieve electrode system  structure only (as shown), and\/or use surface acoustic devices that launch surface waves on the charging side of sieve electrode system  (opposite side from particle reservoir ). One specific example is an axial ring piezoelectric device to vibrate the interface between particle  and sieve electrode system . When a vibration and backpressure are applied, particles  that come in contact with sieve electrode system  pass through orifice  of sieve electrode system  and the vibration motion force acts in combination with the applied charging electric field to extract individual particles and launch them through the acceleration grids . As the frequency of an oscillating piezoelectric device is increased, the resulting inertial force is amplified. Therefore, as the vibration frequency and\/or amplitude is varied, the mass flow rate of particles  can be effected.","As an example, the inertial force that facilitates particle passage through sieve electrode system  and particle liftoff after charging may be provided by a piezoelectric stack, as illustrated in . In this configuration (which can be adjusted to include piezoelectrics providing lateral and bending modes of motion as well as piezoelectrics imbedded in the NanoFET NEMS\/MEMS structure), a ring piezo provides axial vibrations to the particle sieve (electrically biased via a conductive washer in this case, though other connectors are possible) mounted above it. The piezoelectric is electrically insulated from the sieve and particle reservoir by dielectric material (e.g., alumina in this case). By adjusting the piezoelectric's driving waveform, amplitude, and frequency, NanoFET's flow rate can be tuned.","The nanosieve that typically require micron to nanometer scale sized 3-dimensional structures are fabricated using micro and nano electromechanical system (MEMS\/NEMS) manufacturing technologies. Specific sieve substrate materials depend on specific applications, but include semiconductor, conductors, as well as silicon nitride, ceramics, and other insulators and conductors. The second side of the sieve electrode system  must be conducting as defined by the bulk material of sieve electrode system  or by metal coatings such as gold or platinum or others. The nanosieve through-holes can be defined using similar techniques as for charging grid  and acceleration grids . Examples include semiconductor fabrication techniques to define structures using etching based on photons (photolithography) or electron beams (E-beam lithography), or direct surface milling using focused ion beams (FIB) to define the structures. Sieve electrode system  as shown in  is of single thickness, but a hierarchical architecture (greater thickness away from the through-hole regions) can be used combining small openings with the macro-level mechanical properties of liquidless nanoFET system . The width of the nanosieve through-hole regions in sieve electrode system  and the thickness of the supporting regions are optimized to maximize mechanical properties while meeting the specifications of hole size and coverage depending on particular applications. There may be as few as one or many distinct through-hole regions forming a particular realization of sieve electrode system .","Adhesion and Cohesion Forces","Previous studies working with nanometer and micron sized particles explain that particles on this size scale have a strong tendency to adhere to each other (cohesion) and to other objects that they contact (adhesion). Therefore, an understanding of the adhesion and cohesion forces and how to overcome them is extremely important to the development of the liquidless nanoFET system  to assure that most particles  do not clump together through cohesion or stick to sieve electrode system  through adhesion. The present disclosure presents a theoretical analysis of the adhesion and cohesion forces. In addition, the electric force arising from the charging electric field acting on the charged particles is investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, as a method to overcome the adhesion force and achieve particle removal from the source electrode . Finally a proof-of-concept experiment with the goal of demonstrating the feasibility of overcoming the cohesion force with liquidless nanoFET system  is presented.","There are four primary forces generally credited for the adhesion and cohesion of small particles. The relative magnitude of these forces is dependent on the size of particles , the materials involved, and the environmental conditions. The most dominant of these forces when considering dry, conducting particles smaller than several hundred microns is the van der Waals force.","The van der Waals force between atoms arises when an apolar atom momentarily has a dipole moment due to the movement of its electrons with respect to its nucleus. This momentary dipole creates an electric field, which induces dipole moments in neighboring atoms. The resulting dipoles attract each other as the positive end of one atom aligns with the negative end of another.","The van der Waals force between macroscopic bodies is calculated by taking the summation of the van der Waals forces between the atoms of the different bodies. The van der Waals force density between two infinite parallel planar surfaces is calculated to be dependent on the Lifshitz-van der Waals constant, h, and the separation between the surfaces, z.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msub":{"mi":["F","vdw"]},"mi":"A"},{"mi":"h","mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":[{"mi":"\u03c0","mn":"2"},{"mi":"z","mn":"3"}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Using the van der Waals force density between two parallel planar surfaces given in Equation (1), the adhesion force between a spherical particle and an infinite planar surface (Equation (2)) and the cohesion force between two spherical particles (Equation (3)) are approximately calculated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"F","mrow":{"mi":["vdw","ad"],"mo":"-"}},"mo":"\u2248","mfrac":{"mi":"hr","mrow":{"mn":"8","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"\u03c0","msup":{"mi":"z","mn":"2"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"F","mrow":{"mi":["vdw","co"],"mo":"-"}},"mo":"\u2248","mfrac":{"mi":"hr","mrow":{"mn":"16","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"mi":"\u03c0","msup":{"mi":"z","mn":"2"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"3"}}]}]}}}},"The simple expressions for the adhesion and cohesion van der Waals forces scale directly with particles' radii and inversely with the square of the minimum separation.","A comparison of the van der Waals forces reveals that the adhesion and cohesion forces scale the same with particle  size, but the adhesion force is approximately twice the cohesion force when using particles of the same size.  is a plot of the adhesion and cohesion forces as a function of particle diameter when using a Lifshitz-van der Waals constant of 9 eV. For comparison purposes, the weight of particle  is included in the plot when particle  is made from aluminum.","The plot in  shows that as particle  size decreases, the adhesion and cohesion forces decrease. This is somewhat misleading because, by comparison to the gravitational force, both the adhesion and cohesion forces become more significant for smaller particles.","Overcoming the Adhesion Force Using High Strength Electric Fields","The removal of micro- and nano-particles from surfaces is important to many applications, particularly in the MEMS and pharmaceutical industries. A few techniques currently used for particle removal are ultrasonic vibration, mechanical vibration, and laser irradiation. These techniques work by accelerating particles relative to the surface. This section investigates an alternative method of particle removal using high strength electric fields, which lends itself nicely to the design of micro- and nano-particle thrusters, which use high strength electric fields to charge particles  when they are in contact with the source electrode. This section presents the electric force on a spherical conducting particle when in contact with an infinite planar electrode and applies this force to determine the required electric field to overcome the van der Waals adhesion force.","The model for spherical particle removal from a planar electrode is shown in  and consists of two infinite parallel electrodes ,  with a conducting spherical particle  in contact with the upper surface  of the bottom electrode . An electric potential bias, V, is applied across the electrodes ,  to generate an electric field  within the gap  formed between electrodes , .","The complete derivation of the electric force on the spherical particle  when in contact with the source electrode is beyond the scope of these teachings.

Particles much larger than the centimeter range lie within the gravitational regime and particles much smaller than millimeter range lie within the adhesion regime. Both forces affect particles between these two ranges significantly. According to the plot, it may be possible to remove spherical particles with diameters as small as tens of nanometers when keeping the background electric field less than approximately 100 MV\/m, which is below the level required for electron emission.","A. Experimental Setup","To experimentally investigate the van der Waals adhesion force and to overcome this force by way of an electric force, the system depicted in  was constructed, which is very similar to the model in  with the addition of the thin strip of Kapton\u00ae tape  over the surface of the upper electrode . It is important to note that the Kapton\u00ae tape does modify the background electric field slightly, which is taken into account in the results section, but is only present to help capture particles that are lifted off of surface .","The goals of the experiment are to measure the threshold electric field required for removing conducting spherical particles from the electrode surface for various particles in the adhesion dominant regime, investigate the effects of particle size on the adhesion force, and investigate the effects of particle  and electrode materials on the adhesion force.","The experiment is performed by depositing approximately 100 conducting spherical micro-particles () on the surface of the bottom electrode. To prevent these particles from clumping together through cohesion, particles  are passed through a micro-sieve to separate the clumps into individual particles prior to placement onto the electrode surface. In some embodiments, it is desirable to have particles  separated by a distance of at least ten times their diameter to ensure that neighboring particles do not affect the electric field profile at their surfaces. Once particles  are deposited, the upper electrode  is secured in place to provide the correct uniform electrode gap, which can be defined through the use of a spacer, such as 1.0 mm or 4.0 mm thick. Next, the voltage across the electrodes ,  is increased incrementally to generate the strong electric field within the gap . At each voltage increment, a photograph of the particles remaining in contact with the source electrode  is taken to provide visual evidence of the number of particles removed. The process is repeated until all of the particles have been removed. Finally, the number of particles removed from the electrode surface  at each voltage increment is counted, providing an experimental measurement of the threshold electric field required for particle removal.","The particles removed from the source electrode  during testing are accelerated across the electrode gap  towards the upper electrode and onto the Kapton\u00ae tape , where they remain trapped. The Kapton\u00ae tape  serves to collect the removed particles so that they do not oscillate between the electrodes ,  and disrupt the particles still adhered to the bottom electrode . The Kapton\u00ae tape  used for this experiment had a thickness of approximately 25 \u03bcm and typically has a relative dielectric constant of approximately 2.7.","The experiment was performed with four different spherical particle sizes, ranging in diameter from 53 microns to 305 microns, which are all in the adhesion dominant regime.

But, it should be noted that the surfaces of particles  are not perfectly smooth, which is assumed in the model. The silver coated glass particles appear to have much rougher surfaces than the 95Sn\/5Sb particles. The effects of the rough particle surfaces are addressed in more detail in a later section.","The experiment was performed with two different electrode materials-gold and platinum. These materials were chosen because they do not oxidize when exposed to the atmosphere unlike most other metals. When manufacturing the electrodes, the two biggest concerns were controlling the surface flatness and the surface roughness. Controlling surface flatness is important for reducing the error in the applied electric field since a warped surface can lead to varying electric field strengths at the electrode surface. The surface roughness is important because the model for the van der Waals adhesion force assumes that the surface of the electrode is perfectly smooth.","To minimize the surface roughness and control the flatness, the electrodes were fabricated using plasma vapor deposition of the metals onto glass wafers. All depositions were performed using the EnerJet Evaporator at the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility (LNF) located at the University of Michigan. The gold electrodes were fabricated by depositing 300 nm of gold on top of a 30 nm adhesion layer of chromium, and the platinum electrodes were fabricated by depositing 100 nm of platinum on top of a 10 nm adhesion layer of titanium.  is a picture of one of the gold electrodes.","The electrodes are circular with 50 mm diameters and were deposited onto 100 mm glass wafers. A thin tail of metal stretches from the electrode and wraps around the wafer to provide an electrical connection on the reverse side.","An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure the surface roughness of both the gold and platinum electrodes, and both were found to have a surface roughness on the order of 20 nm. The effects of the electrode surface roughness are presented in an upcoming section.","The experiment was performed in the Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) chamber at the Space Electrodynamics and Tether Systems (SETS) laboratory at the University of Michigan, which is pumped by a mechanical roughing pump and a turbo pump and has an ultimate pressure on the order of 10Torr.

For conducting particles in a dry environment, the dominant adhesion and cohesion force is the van der Waals force, which scales directly with the size of particle .

The electric force responsible for particle removal scales directly with the square of the size of particle  while the adhesion force scales directly with the size of particle . This suggests that as the size of particle  decreases, the required electric field for removal increases. The models developed predict that particles with diameters down to hundreds or even tens of nanometers can be removed from a planar electrode. It should be appreciated that methods of reducing the required electrical force, such as the use of mechanical vibration, are also anticipated and discussed herein.","To investigate the particle removal model, eight test cases, involving 4 particle sizes and 2 electrode materials, were studied. The tests agreed reasonably well with the model when using values of the Lifshitz-van der Waals constants close to the expected ranges for all materials.
