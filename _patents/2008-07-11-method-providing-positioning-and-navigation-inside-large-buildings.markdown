title: Method providing positioning and navigation inside large buildings
abstract: Positioning and/or navigation of an electronic device within a building when GPS signals are unavailable is provided. The electronic device scans for available Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Access Points (APs) upon, e.g., entering a building. The electronic device detects a signal (e.g., beacon) from at least one available WLAN AP, whereupon the electronic device retrieves the indoor location of the available WLAN AP. The location information can be directly downloaded from the WLAN AP while in state-1 via, e.g., a Native Query Protocol which includes an extension to currently defined Native Query info elements that returns location information. Alternatively, the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the WLAN AP can be read from the beacon signal, which is then used to retrieve the location of the WLAN AP from an associated database. Additionally, various embodiments may be implemented with or via a mapping application or service, where the mapping application is able to display any floor's floor plan of a building and determine/obtain the position of the electronic device inside the building relative to the floor plan.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to positioning and navigation systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of Wireless Local Area Network Access Point (WLAN AP) locations in conjunction with maps, building floor plans, and specification standards for positioning and navigation purposes inside structures such as large buildings where Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are generally unavailable.","This section is intended to provide a background or context to the invention that is recited in the claims. The description herein may include concepts that could be pursued, but are not necessarily ones that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Various methods have been developed for determining the location of the mobile terminal. For example, some mobile terminals may include GPS as part of the device. GPS systems\/services utilize satellites to triangulate to the location of a GPS-enabled device. Alternatively, other methods utilize a ground based network of antennas or base stations to determine the mobile terminal location. For example, an application program might make a request to a wireless carrier network. The wireless carrier would then use one of several methods to determine a user's location on the wireless network and return the latitude and longitude coordinates to the application program. One method involves identifying the cell or base station closest to the mobile terminal. The antenna in communications with the mobile terminal may then be used to determine the relative direction of the mobile terminal. Using the round trip time, the distance from the base station can be determined providing an location with an accuracy approaching 100 meters. Another method using multiple base stations may be used in some circumstances. The location of the mobile terminal can be determined using typically three base stations capable of communicating with the mobile terminal and triangulating the estimated location of the mobile terminal from each individual base station. More precise location estimates approaching 30 meters can be achieved using this method.","It is currently not possible for an electronic device, such as a mobile device, to position itself and to navigate within large buildings, e.g., malls, large office buildings, public buildings (museums, city halls, conference centers, etc.), covered parking lots, etc. Structures and buildings such as these can be up to 1 mile long, for example, with multiple entrances, multiple floors, multiple sections, wings, and in the case of malls, an abundance of shops.","Certain location and navigation systems utilize signals from at least one WLAN AP when such signals are available. For example, Skyhook (skyhookwireless.com) uses a technology for outdoor positioning and navigation (based on WLAN AP locations). However, such technology operates by mapping a WLAN AP beacon (that is found by driving around and scanning) to geolocation coordinates, where the signal was detected, thus still necessitating GPS signal availability. U.S. Pat. No. 7,228,136 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007\/0149215 describe using WLAN for location using triangulation of signals on multi channel mobile devices, while U.S. Pat. No. 6,807,478 described in-building navigation using light sources. Additionally, a report entitled \u201cThe Integration of Positioning Technologies for Precise Location Identification\u201d by T. Y. Chew, available at http:\/\/ro.uow.edu.au\/thesesinfo\/5\/, describes the integration of multiple positioning technologies, e.g., combining GPS and Third Generation (3G) networks.","Various embodiments allow for positioning and\/or navigation of an electronic device within a building when, e.g., GPS signals, are unavailable. The electronic device scans for available WLAN APs upon entering or coming within close proximity to a building or structure. If at least one available WLAN AP exists, the electronic device detects a signal from the at least one available WLAN AP. The detected signal can be a beacon signal, for example, whereupon the electronic device retrieves the location of the at least one available WLAN AP. Retrieving the location of the WLAN AP can include directly downloading the location information from the WLAN AP via a Native Query Protocol which in accordance with various embodiments, includes an extension to currently defined Native Query info elements that returns location information. Alternatively, the electronic device may read the at least one available WLAN AP's Media Access Control (MAC) address from, e.g., the beacon signal, and use that to retrieve the location of the WLAN AP from an associated database, where the location of the WLAN AP is associated with\/derived from, e.g., extension elements describing indoor location. Additionally, various embodiments may be implemented with or via a mapping application or service.","These and other advantages and features of various embodiments of the present invention, together with the organization and manner of operation thereof, will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements have like numerals throughout the several drawings described below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10"]},"For exemplification, the system  shown in  includes a mobile telephone network  and the Internet . Connectivity to the Internet  may include, but is not limited to, long range wireless connections, short range wireless connections, and various wired connections including, but not limited to, telephone lines, cable lines, power lines, and the like.","The exemplary communication devices of the system  may include, but are not limited to, an electronic device  in the form of a mobile telephone, a combination personal digital assistant (PDA) and mobile telephone , a PDA , an integrated messaging device (IMD) , a desktop computer , a notebook computer , etc. The communication devices may be stationary or mobile as when carried by an individual who is moving. The communication devices may also be located in a mode of transportation including, but not limited to, an automobile, a truck, a taxi, a bus, a train, a boat, an airplane, a bicycle, a motorcycle, indoor electric transport devices, etc. Some or all of the communication devices may send and receive calls and messages and communicate with service providers through a wireless connection  to a base station . The base station  may be connected to a network server  that allows communication between the mobile telephone network  and the Internet , where the network server  may be located in a building or structure (not shown). It should be noted that the network server  may not be needed to allow communication between the Internet and an electronic device, and the network server  may act as a database for storing WLAN AP location information. The system  may include additional communication devices and communication devices of different types.","Communication devices may communicate using various transmission technologies including, but not limited to, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP), Short Messaging Service (SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), e-mail, Instant Messaging Service (IMS), Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax), LTE, etc. A communication device involved in implementing various embodiments of the present invention may communicate using various media including, but not limited to, radio, infrared, laser, cable connection, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIGS. 2 and 3","FIGS. 2 and 3"],"b":["12","12","30","32","34","36","38","40","42","44","46","48","52","54","56","58"]},"In accordance with various embodiments, an application\/system is provided that allows for the positioning a device inside, e.g., a building, whenever a signal from at least one WLAN AP is available. Additionally, various embodiments offer the ability to provide navigation to one or more desired destinations inside the building (e.g., a specific shop in case of malls or a cubicle number in the case of office buildings). In contrast to conventional systems, WLAN location can be utilized in accordance with various embodiments for positioning and\/or navigation even when GPS signals are not available by acquiring WLAN location information from APs themselves. Moreover, various embodiments enable positioning relative to\/against a building's floor plan, which enables navigation capabilities and provide directory information (e.g., in the case of malls) which enables locating a specific store by its name.","The need\/desire to provide wireless Internet connection in, e.g., offices and public buildings is apparent, while nowadays more and more shops have wireless Internet connection inside the store either for conducting more efficient business or for the benefit of employees, for resale of Internet access on the go, etc. Conventionally, access to such wireless Internet connections are often restricted to authorized users only. However, the nature of WLAN technology (where the MAC address of an AP is broadcasted and can be read by any WLAN station scanning for the beacon) enables exploitation of the presence of WLAN signals for use with indoor positioning and navigation systems in accordance with various embodiments.","The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.11v standard Working Group (WG) has defined a method which allows WLAN stations associated with a WLAN AP to download the location of the AP. However, certain issue exist with using this feature in a public building as currently proposed. For example, retrieving the location of the WLAN AP involves an association with the WLAN AP which can be time consuming. Also, as described above, association to WLAN APs may be restricted to authorized users, and thus the location of a WLAN AP is also only available for those authorized users. If the WLAN AP provides free access (e.g., wireless \u201chotspots\u201d such as Starbucks, airports, etc.), then location can be retrieved for free as well. However and again, free access is not always the case. Furthermore, issues arise with regards to the type of location that can be configured for a WLAN AP inside, e.g., a building","There are currently two location formats which are widely supported: civic location (e.g., postal address) and geolocation (e.g., location coordinates, WGS 84). In the case of a building, the civic location usually points to\/is representative of the main entrance of the building, although in certain cases, secondary entrances may also have a separate civic address. Current standards for civic address format as presented in RFC3825, RFC4119 and extended by RFC4776 and RFC5139, do not allow for a hierarchical or detailed indoor addressing that would allow for further address-specific locations inside a building. For example, conference centers may have wings or sections as well as multiple floors etc. Large malls may have store numbers or even their own streets and street numbers (which only have local significance within the mall), etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["400","410","410","410","415","415","415","500","510","510","515"],"i":["a","b","c","a","b","c","a","b","c "]},"Current civic address formats do include, e.g., street address, number, floor number, room number, seat number, etc., but this information cannot always be \u201creused\u201d for positioning and\/or navigation purposes inside structures as the internal structure and addressing of a building may conflict with the external one. Moreover, in most cases it is not accurate enough. Hence, a hierarchical description or indoor addressing is needed or, at least, current civic address types should be extended with locally significant fields relative to the civic address of the building.","Geolocation on the other hand is often times not available inside a building because GPS signals from satellites generally cannot be received within structures such as buildings, and thus do not provide assistance in determining a WLAN AP location. Even if an operator of a WLAN AP is willing to manually configure the geo-coordinates of a WLAN AP located inside a building, there are no automatic mechanisms for determining what those geo-coordinates would be.","Even considering that by using, e.g., an advanced GPS device, altitude information associated with a WLAN AP location can be determined, due to the nature of GPS signals, altitude accuracy is likely at only half of the accuracy which can be achieved for longitude and latitude coordinates. That is, the best accuracy that can be achieved for altitude utilizing geolocation is on the order of \u02dc10 m, which in certain instances would cover 3 floors in some buildings. T geolocation format is not suitable for positioning and navigation inside large buildings, except for some cases where a building's structure may, for example, be only one floor. In this case, manual configuration would be required.","Given the aforementioned issues, extensions to existing positioning and\/or navigation standards are provided in accordance with various embodiments so as to allow for the use of WLAN location in an automatic way for positioning and\/or navigation inside buildings.","In accordance with various embodiments, extensions are provided for use with regard to certain standards. For example, the IEEE 802.11u standard WG defines a mechanism which allows WLAN devices to retrieve some data from a WLAN AP before association. In accordance with various embodiments, it is specified in the IEEE 802.11u standard that one type\/piece of information to be retrieved without association, is the location of the WLAN AP. Therefore, such information is freely available for all WLAN devices (not only to authorized users), without requiring them to associate with the WLAN AP. It should be noted that bypassing the need for association can provide time savings as conventional association with a WLAN AP by itself can be time consuming, even if the WLAN AP provides free access. Moreover, freely providing the location of a WLAN AP is not harmful as anyone can with a WLAN device may freely perform scanning to determine available access points, read an associated MAC address, and save the location where the signal was seen\/scanned.","Furthermore, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) GEOPRIV civic location data format can also be extended to include civic address types which have local significance (e.g., wing, sector, tower, exhibition hall number, store name, store number, street name, street address, building facilities, internal floor number, airport name, terminal number, gate number, etc.) The location of a WLAN AP can either be natively configured into the management information base (MIB) of the WLAN AP, or a separate database can be configured to list the MAC address of the WLAN AP and its location inside the building.","In accordance with various embodiments, a mapping application (or other application\/service with mapping\/positioning functionality) may also be extended by creating and loading the floor plan of various buildings of interest (e.g., airports, public buildings, offices) into the mapping application. This can be accomplished using scalable vector graphics (SVG) for example. Thus, when a user places a cursor\/pointer over a representation of a building on a display of the mapping application, the building representation being displayed switches to an \u201cindoor view\u201d to display the floor plan of that building to the user. If multiple floors exists in the building's floor plan, one floor plan representative of, e.g., the ground floor, may be displayed by default. Moreover, floor plans of additional floors of the building may be displayed upon the user choosing an option to display the floor plan of an additional floor.","It should be noted that extending the mapping application to include such floor plans for public buildings can be accomplished with relative ease because public building floor plans are generally available online and may be linked to a database utilized by the mapping application. Thus, a user, for example, may download a picture of a desired public building floor plan (e.g., a jpg file of the floor plan) to the mapping application. Alternatively, the floor plan may already be linked to a digital map, and thus a user may navigate and the mapping application displays the floor plan when the user\/cursor is near or in the building). The mapping application may then display that floor plan picture to the user when the user places a cursor\/pointer on the building, without positioning and navigation capabilities. A floor plan which enables positioning and navigation would utilize a floor plan in a map format using, e.g., an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based map such as one utilizing SVG), although other formats are contemplated herein. Additionally, locations inside of a building are tagged and associated with either indoor civic locations or calculated coordinates (either relative to the building or WGS).","It should further be noted that various embodiments may be utilized with GPS-capable devices. That is, when a user with a GPS capable device comes within close proximity of a building, the mapping application described above (operating on the user's electronic\/mobile device), automatically displays an \u201cindoor view\u201d option for that building to the user. The user may then switch to the indoor view and view the floor plan of the building, if the user chooses to, by selecting the indoor view option. How close a user is to a building or structure before the indoor view option is presented to the user may be configured within the electronic device at some prior time or may be configured by the user.","Once a user enters a building or structure, various processes are performed to effectuate positioning and navigation.  is a flow chart illustrating various processes in accordance with various embodiments. An electronic\/mobile device of the user scans for available WLAN APs within a structure at  upon entering or coming within close proximity to a building or the structure. At , if available WLAN APs exist, the electronic\/mobile device detects a signal from the at least one of the available WLAN APs. At , the electronic\/mobile device retrieves the location inside the building or structure of the at least one of the available WLAN APs.","In accordance with one embodiment, once the electronic\/mobile device detects a signal from the at least one WLAN AP, the electronic\/mobile device downloads the location of the WLAN AP. Downloading of the WLAN AP location is made possible by the extensions described above to the IEEE 802.11u standard and\/or the WLAN AP is \u201copen access.\u201d In this embodiment, a new info ID definition is added to the existing Native Query protocol info ID definitions table, which would permit downloading the APs location even while in state-1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Native Query protocol info ID definitions"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Info Name","Info ID","Native Info Element (clause)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Capability List Information","1","7.3.3.1"]},{"entry":["Venue Name Information","3","7.3.3.2"]},{"entry":["Emergency Call Number","4","7.3.3.3"]},{"entry":"Information"},{"entry":["Emergency Public Network","5","7.3.3.4"]},{"entry":"Access Information"},{"entry":["Network Authentication Type","6","7.3.3.5"]},{"entry":"Information"},{"entry":["Roaming Consortium List","7","7.3.3.6"]},{"entry":["Reserved","\u20038-220","n\/a"]},{"entry":["Vendor Specific Information","221\u2003","n\/a"]},{"entry":["Reserved","222-255","n\/a"]},{"entry":["AP Location Information","8","7.3.3.7"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The Native Query Protocol is a mechanism specified in the IEEE 802.11u standard that allows a non-AP STA (electronic\/mobile device) to query an AP for locally configured data. Hence the AP can directly respond to queries without proxying the query to a server or external network, and the querying device need not associate with the WLAN AP. It should be noted that that other query protocols may be utilized to achieve various embodiments. In accordance with one embodiment and as described above, WLAN AP location information may be queried and downloaded. Using the WLAN AP location information downloaded from the WLAN AP, a position of the electronic\/mobile device can be determined inside the building. Moreover, the mapping application described above may also be configured to display the name of the building the user is in.","If the extension to the IEEE 802.11u standard described above is not supported, (e.g., the user is denied access to the WLAN AP while in state-1 or the WLAN AP does not have its location configured), positioning and navigation inside the building is still possible via indirect methods such as using an external database. It should be noted that state-1 refers to an unauthenticated state.","Extensions to the IETF GEOPRIV civic location data format may be implemented. That is, additional civic address (CA) type (CAtype) elements are added to the Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) format and\/or Location Configuration Information (LCI) (RFC3825&RFC4776) that can more precisely refer to\/label position reference points. Thus, when determining positioning through use of the IEFT GEOPRIV civic location data, more precise positioning can be accomplished. The PIDF-LO and LCI formats conventionally support CAtype elements such as CAtype 28 indicative of room, CAtype 33 indicate of seat, etc. Table 2 below lists additional CAtype elements in accordance with one embodiment. It should be noted that more (e.g., reference points such as waterfalls, statues, etc. located within a building) or fewer CAtype elements may be added to the PIDF-LO and\/or LCI formats in accordance with various embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Exemplary list of additional\/extension CAtype elements"},{"entry":"to PIDF-LO and\/or LCI formats"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["New Civic Field","CAtype","Description","Example"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Building section","401","Section of a building","Sector-4"]},{"entry":["Building wing","402","Wing of a building","Conf. wing"]},{"entry":["Building tower","403","Tower of a building","Tapa tower"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(e.g., in resort)"]},{"entry":["Internal street","404","Internal street name","19Ave."]},{"entry":["Internal street number","405","Internal street number","255"]},{"entry":["Store name","410","Name of store","Gucci"]},{"entry":["Store number","411","Store number","463"]},{"entry":["Exhibition hall","406","Exhibition hall","22-4"]},{"entry":[{},{},"name\/number"]},{"entry":["Building facilities","408","Building facility","Cafeteria"]},{"entry":["Internal floor number","407","Internal floor number","2"]},{"entry":["Airport name","420","Name of airport","O'Hare"]},{"entry":["Terminal number","421","Terminal number","5"]},{"entry":["Gate number","422","Terminal gate number","8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"It should be noted that the extensions to the IETF GEOPRIV civic address format do not necessarily need to be standardized for positioning inside the building to work. That is, if all of the requisite location data is always stored in a database associated with the mapping application or within the mapping application described above (as opposed to in the actual WLAN APs), positioning would still be possible through the use of the mapping application. In this case, the CAtype elements would then be specific to a particular service or application, e.g., the mapping application.","In accordance with another embodiment, upon scanning for available APs and detecting a WLAN AP signal (e.g., a beacon of a WLAN AP), the electronic\/mobile device reads the MAC address of the WLAN AP from the beacon. Subsequently, the location of the WLAN AP is retrieved from a database, using the MAC address to identify the correct location information associated beforehand with the particular WLAN AP in the database. That is, the MAC address is utilized as, e.g., a pointer, to the location information associated with the WLAN AP that is stored in the database, where the location comprises the IETF GEOPRIV CAtype extension elements described above. The building's management may provide a database of the installed WLAN APs in that building along with their location relative to the floor plan. This data can be uploaded into a mapping application as described above. If such a database is not available, a database can be constructed by simply walking through the building with a WLAN device and recording the MAC addresses in the beacons found while scanning, together with the civic location fields\/CAtype extension elements described above relative to the floor plan. Again, this data can then be uploaded to a database accessible to the mapping application.","Additionally, the mapping application can provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for users to populate such a database by specifying the location of the WLAN AP inside the building using CAtype extension elements described above. For example, when a user finds a WLAN AP with a MAC address not yet in the database, the user could request that the WLAN AP be added to the database. After the request is verified and found legitimate, the user may get an incentive for his\/her contribution. Alternatively still, different locations within a building may be identified by geocoordinates instead of civic addresses. For example, a building corner may have coordinates (a,b), where the position of reference points\/places inside the building can be calculated relative to that corner. The coordinates of the corner can be \u201ctrue\u201d geolocation (latitude, altitude) coordinates, but it could well be (0,0) and the position of the rest of the places could be calculated, e.g., in a Cartesian coordinate system. However, labels\/names for the reference points\/places inside the building need to be identified (e.g., store  has coordinates (c,d), or gate  in terminal  has coordinates (e,f)) which can be assigned coordinates.","Various embodiments described above can determine the location of an electronic\/mobile device by determining a location of a WLAN AP. That is, for positioning and\/or navigation purposes, the location of the electronic\/mobile device can be assumed to be that of the WLAN AP when it is in sufficient proximity to the WLAN AP to, e.g., detect a signal from the WLAN AP. However, if more than one WLAN AP signal is detected, triangulation or simple geometric \u201cshaping\u201d can be used by the device to calculate a more precise position\/location. The accuracy of a determined position\/location can also be calculated and displayed on a display of the floor plan with the mapping application, e.g. in the form of shadow around the calculated position.","Navigation can be provided by connecting or relating a determined or calculated position\/location of an electronic\/mobile device with a desired destination. The desired destination may be specified by a user of the electronic\/mobile device by, e.g., scrolling through a display of a particular floor plan, and pointing a cursor at\/indicating a location inside the building. Alternatively, the user may specify a civic address with local significance (e.g., building wing, tower, store number, store name, hall, building facility, airport name, terminal or gate number, internal street name and number, etc.) Furthermore, the reference point\/location may be labeled, tagged and\/or linked to a building directory to provide navigation capability.","Various embodiments described herein are described in the general context of method steps or processes, which may be implemented in one embodiment by a computer program product, embodied in a computer-readable medium, including computer-executable instructions, such as program code, executed by computers in networked environments.
