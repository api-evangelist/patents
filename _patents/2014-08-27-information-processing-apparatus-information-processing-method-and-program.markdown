No. 12\/905,997, filed Oct. 15,2010, which claims the benefit of and priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-250921, filed Oct. 30, 2009, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a program.","2. Description of the Related Art","A peripheral apparatus control system enables a personal computer (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cPC\u201d) user to access a peripheral apparatus via an appropriate interface, such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Ethernet (registered trademark), or wireless local area network (LAN). PC users can effectively use this kind of control system for various purposes in their houses and offices. An example of the peripheral apparatus is, for example, a printer, a copying machine, a facsimile machine, a scanner, a digital camera, or combinations of these devices or functions thereof.","Windows (registered trademark) 7, which is provided by Microsoft Corporation, includes newly introduced functions to manage peripheral apparatuses connected to a PC. For example, \u201cDevices and Printers\u201d is a window that displays a peripheral apparatus (or a plurality of apparatuses) connected to the PC. \u201cDevice Stage (registered trademark)\u201d is a visual screen that displays a link to a unique application or service provided by each apparatus. Therefore, PC users can easily access and use various functions and services relating to respective peripheral apparatuses.","Conventionally, transmission of a print instruction from a Windows (registered trademark) application to a peripheral apparatus, e.g., a printer, a scanner, a copying machine, or a multifunction peripheral, has been performed according to the following procedure. More specifically, as discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-85132, the procedure includes enabling a user to select an apparatus as an output destination after launching an application and perform input and output operations for the selected peripheral apparatus.","For example, there is an application (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201crecovery application\u201d) capable of recovering settings of an information processing apparatus that relate to an output destination apparatus. If there is a plurality of printer icons created for a single output destination apparatus, the recovery application can delete unnecessary printer icon (s) other than a target printer icon that a user wants to use. However, in a case where various applications are launched from the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d, it is doubtless that a user wants to use a printer icon associated with the \u201cDevice Stage.\u201d Therefore, when a user uses a print application launched from the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d, it is rare that the user operates a wrong printer icon. Accordingly, the recovery application launched from the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d is not required to perform processing for deleting other printer icons.","The present invention is directed to a technique capable of preventing processing of each application from being uselessly performed.","According to an aspect of the present invention, an information processing apparatus having a display device includes a display control unit and a launching unit. The display control unit may cause the display device to display a device management screen corresponding to an image processing apparatus. The launching unit may input identification information indicating launching in response to an instruction via the device management screen to an application associated with the image processing apparatus. In addition, the launching unit may launch the application associated with the device management screen according to the instruction input via the device management screen displayed on the display device by the display control unit.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention can prevent the processing of each application from being uselessly performed.","Further features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","Various exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.","In the following exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that a \u201cDevices and Printers\u201d screen (see ) can be displayed when it is selected from a \u201cstart menu\u201d screen of the Windows.

The information \u201calbum\u201d and \u201cphotoprint\u201d correspond to the elements  and  of the device management control file  illustrated in , respectively.","Then, in step S, the application control unit  terminates the print application processing.","On the other hand, if the user presses a \u201cNO\u201d button  on the button registration confirmation message  illustrated in , the application control unit  immediately terminates the print application processing without executing the processing in step S (i.e., without updating the registry).","If in step S the launching source determination unit  determines that the launching source is not the device management , the application control unit  skips the sequential processing in step S to step S and immediately terminates the print application processing.","Subsequently, an example of an operation that can be performed when the screen of the device management  is opened again after the print application  is launched from the device management  is described below with reference to , , and .  illustrates an example UI display screen of the device management.  illustrates an example UI display screen of the print application.","In the present exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that the \u201cYES\u201d button  is pressed by a user on the message screen illustrated in  to terminate the print application  after the \u201calbum\u201d creation is completed. In this case, in step S, information indicating \u201calbum\u201d is recorded in the application control information storing unit .","If the device management  resumes from this condition, the device management control file reading unit  of the device management  reads the device management control file  from the device management control file storage unit . Further, the device management control unit  acquires the information recorded in the application control information storing unit . When the display unit  is controlled based on the acquired information, a device management screen  illustrated in  can be displayed.","The element <dm:request>  included in the device management control file  indicates that a button display condition is satisfied when the information indicting \u201calbum\u201d is present in the application control information storing unit . In a case where the device management  is opened in the above described state, the condition described in the element  can be satisfied. Therefore, a button  accompanied by a character string \u201cCreate Album\u201d described in the element  is displayed.","On the other hand, information indicating \u201cphotoprint\u201d described in the element <dm:request>  as a display condition is not present. Therefore, a button accompanied by a character string \u201cPrint Photos\u201d described in the element  does not appear. Further, a button  accompanied by a character string \u201cLaunch Application A\u201d described in the element  does not have any preceding <dm:request> element. Therefore, the button  can be constantly displayed, as described above.","If the newly added button  is pressed, the link execution unit  launches the print application  according to the element  corresponding to the button  in the device management control file . Thus, the print application launch processing illustrated in  is executed. In this case, in step S it is determined that the acquired content includes the launching function designation information.","In step S, the \u201calbum\u201d creation is acquired as the launching function designation information based on the second command line option \u201c\/album\u201d included in a command line character string of the element . Then, the application control unit  terminates the print application launch processing without executing the processing in step S to display the menu screen . The processing directly proceeds to the first stage of the \u201calbum\u201d creation (see screen ).","On the other hand, if the button  is pressed on the device management screen  of the device management , the link execution unit  launches the print application  according to the element  corresponding to the button  in the device management control file . Thus, the print application launch processing illustrated in  is executed. In this case, in step S it is determined that the acquired content does not include the launching function designation information. And, in step S it is determined that the launching source is the device management screen. Thus, the processing proceeds to step S.","Then, the number of menu items to be displayed is reduced based on the information stored in the application control information storing unit . More specifically, the information indicating \u201calbum\u201d is present in the application control information storing unit . Therefore, the \u201calbum\u201d button corresponding to the information indicating \u201calbum\u201d is deleted from the menu screen. As a result, in step S, a menu screen  illustrated in  is displayed. The menu screen  does not include the \u201calbum\u201d button , which is present on the menu screen illustrated in .","Processing operations to be performed in response to selection of respective buttons , , and  on the menu screen  are similar to the processing operations performed in response to selection of the buttons , , and  on the menu screen  illustrated in .","As described above, the button  enabling a user to directly launch the function having been actually executed in the print application  is additionally displayed on the device management screen  of the device management . Therefore, the present exemplary embodiment can reduce the number of operations required to launch the function that may be reused by the user. Further, the present exemplary embodiment dynamically updates a button to be displayed to enable a user to directly launch a function when the print application  is operated. Therefore, processing for calling a different function is feasible when the device management screen is opened next. In other words, the operability of the software group illustrated in  can be improved for the user.","When an application is launched from the device management , the function additionally displayed on the device management screen  of the device management  is deleted from the menu screen  of the print application . Thus, the present exemplary embodiment can delete unnecessary options to be displayed from an application UI, without reducing the number of functions that can be executed by the print application . The deletion of display items on the menu screen  is performed only when it is determined that the launching source is the device management  (YES in step S of ). Accordingly, the present exemplary embodiment can prevent UI processing of the print application  from being uselessly executed in an environment in which the device management  is present. Further, the present exemplary embodiment can improve the operability for a user. In this case, no adverse effect is given to functions of the print application  in an environment in which the device management  is not present or in a case where a launching method not using the device management  is employed.","According to the above described embodiment, in the initial state, the application control information storing unit  does not store any information relating to the display of each function button, such as \u201cphotoprint\u201d or \u201calbum.\u201d However, it may be useful to display a predetermined function button in the initial state if the function button is frequently used.","Further, the button registration confirmation message  is displayed to inquire a user about registration of an additional button when the application control information is updated in the print application termination processing. However, to reduce the number of user operations, it may be useful to cancel the inquiry and constantly update the application control information.","Further, in the above described exemplary embodiment, the device management  displays the button corresponding to the latest function having been executed by the print application  when the application control information is updated. Alternatively, it may be useful to count the frequency of use of each function after the print application  is installed on the information processing apparatus and display a particular button on a screen of the device management , based on a comparison between recorded data, to indicate a function that has been most frequently used in a specific period. Further, the device management  may be controlled to simultaneously add and display a plurality of function buttons.","According to the above described exemplary embodiments, launching of an application from the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d is recognized by the application, so that useless processing of the application can be prevented. Further, according to the above described exemplary embodiments, if it is determined that the application is required to provide different processing, the display of the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d can be changed to an appropriate one. Subsequently, when the application is launched next time, processing for calling a different function from the \u201cDevice Stage\u201d can be performed. Thus, the operability can be improved for apparatus users.","Aspects of the present invention can also be realized by a computer of a system or apparatus (or devices such as a CPU or MPU) that reads out and executes a program recorded on a memory device to perform the functions of the above-described embodiment (s), and by a method, the steps of which are performed by a computer of a system or apparatus by, for example, reading out and executing a program recorded on a memory device to perform the functions of the above-described embodiment (s).
