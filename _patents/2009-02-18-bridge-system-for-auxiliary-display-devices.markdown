{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE DESCRIPTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The field of the present invention is electronic devices that are coupled together in a multi-source system.","A standalone device (SAD) is generally fully operative by itself, and can be selectively configured by a user. The SAD may or may not have its own user interface for setting its configuration. When the SAD does not have its own user interface, an external host, such as a PC computer, is used to configure the SAD. Selection of a configuration generally affects functionality of the SAD, since different configurations correspond to different features.","For systems that include combinations of two or more inter-connected SADs, setting of their respective configurations is complicated. Such systems are common in consumer electronics and include inter alia, an MP3 player connected to a PC, a digital camera connected to a PC, a digital camera connected to a printer, and a router connected to a PC. Generally, when two SADs are inter-connected, either:\n\n","Conventional client-host systems of inter-connected SADs use one of two methods for configuration; namely, a \u201cdriver method\u201d and a \u201cscreen method\u201d.","The driver method is used in cases where a user runs an application that controls the client behavior from a PC host, such as an MP3 player connected to a PC computer. According to the driver method, the host SAD is loaded at the time of connecting the host with the client, or pre-loaded beforehand, with a software stack referred to as a \u201cdriver\u201d. The driver instructs the host how to send commands to the client. Drivers may be implemented at different software levels, from low level operating system (OS) drivers to application level drivers with user interfaces. A host SAD loaded with a driver is able to control the client SAD, and to configure operations of the client SAD using a communication channel between the host and the client.","Drivers are generally customized for specific operating systems, but are not customized for specific client device original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).","The screen method is used in cases where a user browses a configuration screen at a designated IP address, such as a router or a printer connected to a PC computer. According to the screen method, the host SAD displays a graphics screen that includes information transferred from the client SAD. The host itself is unaware of the content displayed on its screen to the user, or of the actions performed by the user. The screen method generally uses internal browsers that are installed in host SADs, and obviates the need for OEMs to develop their own dedicated OS drivers.","For a given client SAD, the same configuration screen is displayed for any host SAD connected therewith, since the screen corresponds to the client SAD, which not need be aware of the specific host that is being used to configure it.","Both the driver method and the screen method are client-specific and, as such, are unable to provide a uniform \u201clook & feel\u201d for a user. A look & feel refers to visual elements that are presented in a user interface, and include inter alia font, background color, menu design, position and shape of buttons and other controls, and arrangement of various options. As a result of this drawback, the user experiences different interfaces when he switches from a host configuration screen to a client configuration screen.","Aspects of the present invention overcome drawbacks of conventional multi-source systems, and provide methods and systems for inter-connecting two or more SADs that communicate with one another, in such a way as to maintain a unified user interface look & feel. Using the present invention, a user experiences the same-looking interface when he switches from a host configuration screen to a client configuration screen. Both screens have the same look & feel, and a client SAD appears transparent to the user and does not appear as a foreign device.","Using the present invention, a client SAD is aware of the specific host SAD connected thereto, and adapts its screen graphics to the host's user interface. As such, the same user interface displays both host and client configurations and a unified look & feel is maintained.","The present invention is of particular advantage with multi-source systems where a client SAD is connected to one of multiple host SAD's. Methods of the present invention ensure that the user experiences a homogenous look & feel in each host SAD source, when he navigates from the host configuration screen to the client configuration screen.","The present invention provides methods and systems for on-line configuration of controlled software, which flexibly support a client connected to one of multiple hosts yet retain the same operational control over the client, and which adapt the look & feel so as to integrate the client control software in the host software environment in a homogeneous way. A host SAD is used to configure the multi-source system, and the host user interface is maintained as a fixed point of reference for the user. Adaptation to the host user interface is carried out in each client SAD.","The present invention is advantageous for a network of auxiliary display devices connected to a computer. The present invention introduces a bridge device that displays information on the bridge device screen according to the look & feel of auxiliary display devices connected thereto. As such, the present invention enhances the SideShow\u2122 architecture of Microsoft, by enabling a bridge device to display a plurality of display device's information, and by enabling one display device to display another display device's information, with the look & feel of the other display device.","There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a bridge system for auxiliary display devices connected to a computer, including a computer running a plurality of mini-programs, each mini-program sending information of a specific nature from the computer to a corresponding auxiliary display device, for presentation to a user, a plurality of auxiliary display devices, each auxiliary display device including an auxiliary screen and each auxiliary display device having look & feel display parameters, for receiving information from the corresponding plurality of mini-programs, and for displaying the received information on the auxiliary screens according to the corresponding look & feel parameters, and at least one bridge device coupled to the computer, each bridge device coupled to at least one of the auxiliary display devices, each bridge device including a bridge screen, and each bridge device receiving information from a corresponding at least one of the mini-programs, forwarding the received information to the at least one of the auxiliary display devices, and displaying the received information on the bridge screen according to the look & feel display parameters of the at least one of the auxiliary display devices.","There is further provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method for managing auxiliary display devices connected to a computer, including receiving XML information of a specific nature from a mini-program running on a computer, and receiving look & feel parameters from an auxiliary display device that displays information in a display format conforming to the look & feel parameters, for presentation to a user, transforming the XML information to a BMP image conforming to the look & feel parameters of the auxiliary display device, transmitting the BMP image to the auxiliary display device for presentation to the user, receiving an indication of an action performed by the user on the auxiliary display device in response to viewing the BMP image, generating a second BMP image based on the received indication, conforming to the look & feel parameters of the auxiliary display device, and further transmitting the second BMP image to the auxiliary display device for further presentation to the user.","There is yet further provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a method for managing auxiliary display devices connected to a computer, including receiving XML information of a specific nature from a mini-program running on a computer, and receiving look & feel parameters from an auxiliary display device that displays information in a display format conforming to the look & feel parameters, for presentation to a user, transforming the XML information to a BMP image conforming to the look & feel parameters of the auxiliary display device, transmitting the BMP image to the auxiliary display device for presentation to the user, receiving additional XML information from the mini-program, generating a second BMP image based on the additional XML information, conforming to the look & feel parameters of the auxiliary display device, and further transmitting the second BMP image to the auxiliary display device for further presentation to the user.","Aspects of the present invention relate to multi-source systems with inter-connected standalone devices (SADs), where one of the SADs serves as a host device, and is used to configure itself and to configure the client devices in the system. Using the present invention, the client devices adapt the look & feel of their configuration screens so as to conform to the look & feel of the host configuration screen. The host interface look & feel thereby serves as a fixed and familiar point of reference for a user of the multi-source system.","The look & feel of an interface relates to visual elements that a user experiences when he interacts with the interface. The look & feel includes inter alia:\n\n","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, look & feel parameters may be defined in an XML document. Such an XML document make, for example, take the form provided below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0040"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Sample XML document with look & feel parameters"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<definitions>"]},{"entry":[{},"<screen>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<size=800*600>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<touch=yes>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<layout=portrait>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<color quality=32 bit>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.... ."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/screen>"]},{"entry":[{},"<background>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<color = black>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<pattern = none>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003.... ."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/background>"]},{"entry":[{},"<fonts>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<font1>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<color=yellow>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<size=16>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<type=bold italic>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003......"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/font1>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<font2>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<color=blue>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<size=12>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<type=regular>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003......"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/font2>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003..."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/fonts>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"<buttons>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<button1>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<location=bottom left>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<icon=\u201dleft_arrow.jpg\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/button1>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<button2>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<location=bottom right>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<icon=\u201dright_arrow. jpg\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003<\/button2>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/buttons>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]},{"entry":[{},"<\/definitions>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"Reference is now made to , , and , which are displays of various configuration screens for a host SAD and a client SAD connected together within a multi-source system, wherein the host and client screens are controlled so as to have the same look & feel, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The host shown in  is a media player, such as an MP3 player, and the client shown in  is a cell phone. Shown in  is a sample interface for the host. The screen shown in  corresponds to the host configuration screen, before the client is connected to the host, and the screen shown in  corresponds to the client configuration screen, after the client is connected to the host. It is noted that both screens have the same look & feel. Specifically, when the client SAD is attached to the host SAD, the font size, type and color remain the same, and the screen size and background color remain the same.","In addition, the screen template is preserved for two \u201csoft-keys\u201d  and  and a bar  above them that includes their corresponding function names. Soft keys are multi-function keys that use part of a display to identify their function at any moment. Soft-keys are generally located directly below the display. In  soft keys  and  correspond respectively to Vol. Up and Vol. Down functions, as indicated by bar ; and in  soft keys  and  correspond respectively to Call and End functions, respectively, as indicated by bar .","The host shown in  is a digital camera, and the client shown in  is another electronic device. Shown in  is a sample interface for the host. Again, in accordance with the present invention, the look & feel of  (client configuration) is the same as that of  (host configuration). As may be seen in , the look & feel of the configuration interface includes a left panel  a right panel . The left panel  is created by the host. When the client is attached to the host, the left panel may be altered by the host. Thus in  the left panel includes a control element  in the shape of a star, for toggling between host mode and client mode.","The right panel  is controlled by the host when the host mode is running, and controlled by the client when the client mode is running. In either case, the content displayed in the right panel conforms to the look & feel parameters for the host. The \u201clook parameters\u201d of the right panel, including inter alia the dimensions of the right panel, its background color, its font type, size and color, and its menu header and location, are the same in . Similarly, the \u201cfeel\u201d parameters of the right panel, including inter alia assignment of client options ,  and  to corresponding host buttons and the jog dial options, are also the same in .","The host shown in  is a GPS navigator, and the client shown in  is another electronic device. Shown in  is a sample interface for the host. Again, in accordance with the present invention, the look & feel of  (client configuration) is the same as that of  (host configuration). For example, it is noted that the \u201cX\u201d remains in the top right corner when the client is attached to the host.","More generally, reference is now made to , which is a simplified block diagram of a multi-source system with a uniform interface for configuring a host and a client, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a host SAD , which includes a CPU , a display  and an optional power source . Host SAD  has its own look & feel parameters  stored therein. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, requisite font files are also stored with look & feel parameters .","Also shown in  is a client SAD . Client SAD includes a CPU , an optional display  and an optional power source . Client SAD also includes a configuration program , which enables a user to select configuration settings for client SAD .","Host SAD  and client SAD  communicate via respective communication modules  and  over a communication channel . Communication channel  may be a physical or a wireless channel. Host look & feel parameters  are transmitted by communication module  over communication channel , and received by communication module . In turn, the look & feel parameters are transmitted to configuration program .","Configuration program  has a default screen look & feel. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, configuration program  adapts its look & feel accordingly, so as to conform to look & feel parameters  of host SAD . Configuration program  generates a graphics screen image that conforms to look & feel parameters . The graphics screen image is transmitted to communication module , which transmits it further to communication module  over communication channel . The graphics image is then transmitted to host display , for display to a user.","As the user interacts with the displayed graphics image and issues successive commands, the commands are transmitted via communication channel  back to configuration program , which generates successive graphics screen images in response to the user commands. The successive graphics screen images, based again on look & feel parameters , are transmitted to display  for further display to the user.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a first embodiment of a method for controlling a configuration interface for a client SAD so as to conform to the look & feel of a configuration interface for a host SAD, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into three columns. The leftmost column indicates steps performed by a user who is operating a multi-source system including the host SAD and the client SAD. The middle column indicates steps performed by the host SAD, and the rightmost column indicates steps performed by the client SAD.","At step  the client device is attached to the host device. At step  the host transfers its own look & feel parameters to the client. As described hereinabove, the host look & feel parameters may be specified in an XML document. The host may also transfer requisite font files, for fonts specified in the look & feel parameters.","At step  the client adapts the look & feel of its configuration program according to the host look & feel parameters. At step  the client configuration program generates a configuration screen, in the form of a bitmap image, that conforms to the look & feel of the host configuration screen.","At step  the host receives the bitmap image of the configuration screen from the client, and at step  the host displays the bitmap image, which conforms to the host look & feel. As such, the user interface displayed by the host preserves a unified look & feel, even when being used to configure the client.","It may thus be appreciated that the host displays its own configuration options and the client configuration options on the same screen, and with a common look & feel. The host may display both configurations at the same time, or may switch between host options and client options, but in each case the same visual user interface is presented to the user.","At step  the user interacts with the system and issues a command, the response to which may require a change in the display screen. At step  the host sends the client notification of the user command. At step  the client configuration program generates a new bitmap image for a configuration screen, in response to the user command, as appropriate. At step  the host receives the new configuration screen, in the form of the new bitmap image, from the client. Finally, at step  the host displays the altered screen, which again conforms to the look & feel of the host. The method then returns to step , as the user continues to interact with the system.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a second embodiment of a method for controlling a configuration interface for a client SAD so as to conform to the look & feel of a configuration interface for a host SAD, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into three columns. The leftmost column indicates steps performed by a user who is operating a multi-source system including the host SAD and the client SAD. The middle column indicates steps performed by the host SAD, and the rightmost column indicates steps performed by the client SAD. The method of  uses a web interface for a user to configure the client device.","At step  the client device is attached to the host device. At step  the host device transfers its look & feel parameters to the client device. The host may also transfer requisite font files, for fonts specified in the look & feel parameters. At step  the client configuration program sets it parameters according to the host look & feel parameters.","At step  the client configuration program generates a web page, which conforms to the host look & feel parameters. At step  the client device uploads the web page to a URL on a web server. At step  the host, using a web browser installed therein, browses the URL and renders and displays the web page.","Referring back to , in this second embodiment host device  includes a web browser , which browses and renders web pages stored in a web server . The web pages are generated by configuration program  so as to comply with host look & feel parameters , and are uploaded to web server .","Proceeding now with , at step  a user who is viewing the web page displayed at step  issues a user command. At step  the host sends the user command to the client. At step  the client configuration program generates a new web page, in response to the user command, as appropriate. At step  the client uploads the web page to a URL on the web server. At step  the host browses the URL and renders and displays the new web page. The method then returns to step , as the user continues to interact with the system.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified flowchart of a third embodiment of a method for controlling a configuration interface for a client SAD so as to conform to the look & feel of a configuration interface for a host SAD, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart of  is divided into three columns. The leftmost column indicates steps performed by a user who is operating a multi-source system including the host SAD and the client SAD. The middle column indicates steps performed by the host SAD, and the rightmost column indicates steps performed by the client SAD.","At step  the client device is attached to the host device. At step  the client transfers its configuration program to the host, thus enabling the host to generate the appropriate user interfaces.","At step  the host sets parameters of the client's configuration program corresponding to the host look & feel parameters. At step  the host by itself generates a screen image for client configuration, running the client's configuration program. At step  the host displays the screen image.","At step  a user who is viewing and interacting with the user interface issues a command. At step  the host generates a new screen image, in response to the user command, as appropriate, running the client's configuration program. At step  the host displays the new screen image. The method then returns to step , as the user continues to interact with the system.","It will thus be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the methods of  enable a host SAD in a multi-source system to display both host configuration settings and client configuration settings on the host screen, simultaneously, with a uniform look & feel. As such, a user of the system experiences a homogeneous interface, and it is transparent to the user that two different SADs are operating.","Implementation Details","Shown in TABLES IA and IB are example button key assignments for a host mode and a client mode, respectively, within a multi-source system. TABLES IA and IB correspond to , respectively, where the host is an MP3 player running in media player mode, and the client is a cell phone running in dialer mode. The buttons of the system are labeled B-B, together with a TOUCH button on the touch screen displayed with a question mark. The buttons have one assignment of functions in host mode and another assignment of functions in client mode. Button B, for example, is assigned a play function in TABLE IA, and is assigned a function to enter the numeral \u201c8\u201d in TABLE IB.","Reference is now made to , which is an illustration of button keys for a multi-source system that have different key assignments for host mode and client mode, but a common look & feel user interface for setting host and client configuration parameters, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , buttons B-B correspond to the four rows of three buttons on the keypad, in the order from top left to bottom right. Buttons B and B correspond to the soft keys  and  in . Button B corresponds to the speaker button.","It is also noted that buttons B, B, B and B have dual functions, corresponding to a short duration press and a long duration press.

When the user presses a button, the button press event is sent to the client, and translated by the client according to the key assignment for that button. If the user presses a touch screen, then the X-Y coordinates of the press location are send to the client. In response, the client generates a new graphic image, conforming to the look & feel parameters that the client received from the host. The new graphic image is transmitted to the host for display, thus completing a cycle of user input and screen display in response to the input. Generally, several such cycles are performed in an interactive session.","When the key assignments distinguish between short and long duration presses, as in TABLE IB, the host may do the analysis to make the distinction and pass the result (long press or short press) to the client.

In this regard, reference is now made to , which is a prior art block diagram of auxiliary display devices connected to a computer. Shown in  is a computer  with an input device  such as a keyboard or mouse. Computer  is connected to multiple auxiliary display devices -. Each auxiliary display device is used to display information stored on computer , such as e-mail messages, calendar reminders, or such other notifications. Auxiliary display devices - include inter alia mobile phones, GPS navigators, remote controls with built-in screens, keyboards with built-in screens, wearable display devices, music players, digital picture frames, game stations, home entertainment systems, and such other consumer electronic (CE) devices.","An auxiliary display device may be embedded within computer , such as an in-lid attached laptop display. An auxiliary display device may be a separate peripheral device connected to computer  by a wired or wireless connection, including inter alia USB, Bluetooth, TCP\/IP or other such data communication protocols, existing now or to be developed in the future. An auxiliary display device may also be a designated area within a main screen of computer .","Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., recently introduced its SideShow\u2122 technology into Windows Vista\u00ae, which enables developers to write mini-applications on computer  that send appropriate data from computer  to auxiliary display devices -, as required by the display devices. These mini-applications, referred to as \u201cgadgets\u201d, communicate with Windows SideShow application programming interfaces (APIs), and are independent of the software layers below them. Examples of such gadgets include (i) a calendar gadget that periodically retrieves data from a calendar application such as Microsoft Outlook\u00ae, sends the data to an auxiliary display device, (ii) a weather gadget that retrieves data from a web service and updates an auxiliary display device with weather information in designated locales, and (iii) an instant messaging gadget that provides presence information regarding a user's buddies on an auxiliary display device.","Microsoft SideShow requires that auxiliary display devices - be able to interpret the Simple Content Format (SCF) and, optionally the iCalendar data format. SCF defines a set of XML elements and attributes that allow content, dialog and menu pages to be sent to auxiliary devices -. In addition, SCF enables extended custom content types to be defined.","Auxiliary display devices - may be powered even when computer  is in a low-power mode such as standby mode or hibernate mode.","Auxiliary display devices - behave as client devices, which receive their data from their corresponding gadgets running on computer , which behaves as a host. This is indicated in  by referring to display devices - as client #-client #, respectively, and by referring to computer  as host computer. The designation of a device as host or client in  relates to the display of information. A host device sends display information to a client device, which the client device displays on its screen. Display devices - do not manipulate data that they display, and such data remains within the auxiliary display devices and is not transmitted elsewhere. Moreover, if an auxiliary display device has an internal application, then such application is not shared with other devices. As such, display devices - are dumb terminals.","Reference is now made to , which is a simplified block diagram of auxiliary display devices and bridge devices connected to a computer, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Shown in  is a computer  with an input device  such as a keyboard or mouse, and auxiliary display devices -.  also includes two devices  and , referred to as bridges, with respective input devices  and . Bridges  and  are connected directly to computer  and connected directly to one another. Auxiliary display devices are arranged so that devices - are connected to bridge , devices - are connected to bridge , and devices - are connected directly to computer .","Bridges own two types of gadgets; namely, (i) gadgets generated from their own internal running applications, and (ii) gadgets inherited from other devices. For example, bridge  owns its own gadgets, as well as gadgets inherited from host computer  and from bridge . Auxiliary display devices generally do not own gadgets, and can only display information from gadgets that are presented to them.","Bridge devices  and  combine capabilities of host computer  and client devices -. As clients, bridge devices  and  receive display information from other devices and present the display information on their own screens. As hosts, bridge devices  and  act as sources of display information for display on client device screens. For example, bridge  may receive display information from computer  or from clients  and  - and display such information on its own screen; and conversely, bridge  may transmit display information to computer  or to clients  and  - for display on their screens. Display information transmitted by bridge  may be generated by bridge  from internal applications running on device , or may be information received from other devices. Moreover, bridge  can combine display information that it generates from its internal applications with display information that it receives from remote devices, the latter referred to as \u201cinherited notifications\u201d, so as to create single display information for devices that connect to bridge .","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, computer  connects to bridges  and  via wireless links. Although display information is rendered as a bitmap image, it is cumbersome to transmit bitmap images over wireless links, due to their large sizes. Instead, computer  transmits display information to bridges  and  in a compressed XML format. Auxiliary display devices - generally have limited CPU power and limited software resources, and may only support simpler data, such as BMP image data. In such cases, bridges  and  transform the display information they receive in compressed XML format to a BMP format, for forwarding to display devices -.","Further in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, such transformation uses look & feel parameters appropriate to each corresponding display device, as described hereinabove with reference to .
