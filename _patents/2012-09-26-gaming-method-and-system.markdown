title: Gaming method and system
abstract: Disclosed herein is a method of gaming, in which a first player and a second player each submit a set of 2 completed gaming tables, a game board and a guess board, for competition against each other. Each gaming table has the same number of gaming cells and is populated by the respective player with a set of tokens. The populated game board of the first player is compared to the populated guess board of the second player to determine a score for either the first player or the second player, depending on the scoring methodology. Similarly, the populated game board of the second player is compared to the guess board of the first player to determine a score for the first player. Two gaming tables are compared against each other by comparing the values of tokens located in corresponding positions of the gaming tables that are being compared. An intermediate score is determined for each position on the gaming table. Those intermediate scores are then utilized to determine a score for a player. The scores for the first player and the second player are compared to determine a winner.

No. 13\/021,503 filed Feb. 4, 2011, which: i) claims priority to Australian Patent Application No. 2010200417 filed Feb. 5, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference; and ii) is a continuation-in-part of International Patent Application No. PCT\/AU2009\/001015 filed Aug. 7, 2009, which claims priority to Australian Patent Application No. 2008904616 filed Sep. 5, 2008 and Australia Patent Application No. 2008904067 filed Aug. 8, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. The Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to entertainment and, in particular, to a gaming method and system.","2. The Relevant Technology","Games of chance, skill, and entertainment exist in many different formats and are played using a variety of different gaming platforms. Such platforms can include, for example, cards, board games, playing fields, and computing devices.","It is desirable for a game to attract a player and retain the attention of the player throughout the duration of the game.","Thus, a need exists to provide an improved gaming method and system.","It is an object of the present invention to overcome substantially, or at least ameliorate, one or more disadvantages of existing arrangements.","Described herein are a gaming system, method, computer server, and computer program product that utilise a first gaming table and a predefined number of tokens. The gaming table includes a number of cells that correspond to the number of tokens and each token has an associated value. The tokens are stored in the cells of the gaming table, with one token in each cell, until all of the cells are populated. The gaming system, method, and computer program product of the present disclosure compute a score for a player by utilising the values associated with the tokens.","In one implementation, the gaming system, method, and computer program product of the present disclosure involve game play between two players. Each player populates a gaming table with a set of tokens, wherein the other player is unable to witness how the opposing player has populated their respective gaming table. Thus, a first player populates a first gaming table with a first set of tokens and a second player populates a second gaming table with a second set of tokens. Each of the first and second players also populates a guess board using the set of tokens. Each gaming table and guess board has a corresponding number of cells. The guess board populated by the first player is compared to the gaming table of the second player to generate an attacking score for the first player or a defending score for the second player. Similarly, the guess board populated by the second player is compared to the gaming table of the first player to generate an attacking score for the second player or a defending score for the first player. The scores are then compared to determine a winner.","In one implementation, a scoring methodology calculates, for each pair of corresponding cells in a guess board of one player and a gaming table of an opposing player, an absolute difference between tokens populated in that pair of cells. In one further implementation, a winner is determined based on the number of scores having an absolute difference of 0. In an alternative implementation, a winner is determined based on the sum of the absolute differences for the pairs of cells.","In one implementation, a scoring methodology calculates, for each pair of corresponding cells in a guess board of one player and a gaming table of an opposing player, a real difference between tokens populated in that pair of cells. If the real difference is a negative number, a value of 0 is awarded to that pair of cells. The sum of the values for each pair of cells is utilised to determine a total score for one player. In one further implementation, a winner is determined based on the number of scores having an absolute difference of 0.","According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of gaming using first and second gaming tables and a predefined set of tokens, wherein each token has an associated value and each of said first and second gaming tables has a predefined number of cells, said method comprising the steps of:","populating said first gaming table associated with said first player with said predefined set of tokens;","providing a first attack sequence of said first player, using said predefined set of tokens, said first attack sequence including a number of moves corresponding to said predefined number of cells;","populating said second gaming table associated with second player with said predefined set of tokens;","providing a second attack sequence of said second player, using said predefined set of tokens, said second attack sequence including a number of moves corresponding to said predefined number of cells;","comparing said first attack sequence of said first player with said second gaming table associated with said second player to determine a first score;","comparing said second attack sequence of said second player with said first gaming table associated with said first player to determine a second score;

In one implementation, the apparatus is a land-based gaming terminal or computer server.","According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a computer program product including a computer readable medium having recorded thereon a computer program for implementing any one of the methods described above.","Other aspects of the invention are also disclosed.","Where reference is made in any one or more of the accompanying drawings to steps and\/or features that have the same reference numerals, those steps and\/or features have for the purposes of this description the same function(s) or operation(s), unless the contrary intention appears.","Disclosed herein is a gaming method and system. According to one embodiment, a plurality of predefined tokens is provided, wherein each token is associated with a value. A gaming table with a corresponding number of gaming cells is also provided, wherein each cell is associated with a unique cell identifier. Each gaming cell is capable of storing one of the tokens.","The gaming table represents an area on which the game is to be played, and can be implemented using, for example, a physical table, a portion of real estate on a display of an electronic device, such as a display screen of a mobile phone handset or computing device, or an area of a proprietary gaming and wagering terminal. Other physical and virtual implementations can equally be practised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.","In one mode of play, each of the tokens is allocated to a corresponding one of the gaming cells and stored therein. The tokens are not initially revealed to a player. The player utilises the cell identifiers to select one of the gaming cells and the corresponding token stored therein is revealed. The player then selects a second gaming cell to reveal the token stored in the second gaming cell. The game continues until the player has selected all of the gaming cells and all of the tokens have been revealed.","A score is then determined based on the sequence in which the tokens were revealed.","As each token has an associated value, one embodiment determines relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected tokens by calculating an absolute value between successively revealed tokens. The sum of the absolute values is the score awarded to the player for that game; the lower the score, the better.","In one embodiment, a predefined starting value is provided to enable an initial score to be determined, based on a value of the first selected token. The initial score is the absolute value between the starting value and the value of the first selected token. The initial score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player. In a further embodiment, a predefined finishing value is provided to enable a finishing score to be determined, based on a value of the final selected token. The finishing score is the absolute value between the finishing value and the value of the final selected token. The finishing score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player. In another embodiment, a starting value and a finishing value are provided to enable an initial score and a finishing score to be determined in the manner described above. Each of the initial score and the finishing score is included in the sum of the absolute values to determine the score awarded to the player.","An alternative embodiment utilises a predefined ordered sequence of values to determine the score, based on the sequence in which the tokens were revealed. The method determines a relative difference between values associated with the selected tokens and corresponding values in the predefined ordered sequence of values. The sum of the relative differences is the score awarded to the player for that game; the lower the score, the better. In one embodiment, the predefined ordered sequence of values is a set of numbered turns. In another embodiment, the predefined ordered sequence of values is assigned by a random number generator, a competing player, a game administrator, or other means. In a further embodiment, the predefined ordered sequence of values corresponds to a layout of a gaming table.","In one embodiment, the tokens are allocated to the gaming cells by a competitor of the player, or a game controller. The game controller can be, for example, another person or a program executing on a computing device.","In one embodiment in which the tokens are allocated to the gaming cells by a game controller, thus populating the gaming table with the tokens, a first player and a second player provide a first and second sequence of identifiers, respectively, corresponding to cells of the gaming table. The gaming method determines a first sequence of tokens stored in the gaming table by utilising the first sequence of identifiers. Similarly, the gaming method determines a second sequence of tokens stored in the gaming table by utilising the second sequence of identifiers. Determining the first and second sequences may be readily performed, as the identifiers in the first and second sequences of identifiers correspond directly to cells of the gaming table.","The gaming method determines a first score for the first player, based on relative differences between values associated with consecutive tokens in the first sequence of tokens, and determines a second score for the second player, based on relative differences between values associated with consecutive tokens in the second sequence of tokens. The gaming method then determines a winner, based on the first score and the second score. Any number of players can compete in this embodiment by each providing a sequence of identifiers corresponding to cells of the gaming table. A score is determined for each player, as described above, and then a winner is determined.","In another embodiment, an interactive gaming method and system are provided to facilitate the playing of a game between two players. An instance of a game includes three main phases: \u201csetup\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d, and \u201cscoring\u201d. During the \u201csetup\u201d phase, each player populates a gaming table with a sequence of tokens. Thus, a first player and a second player are provided with corresponding first and second gaming tables. Each gaming table includes a number of gaming cells. A first set of tokens is allocated to the first player and a second set of tokens is allocated to the second player. The first and second sets of tokens are identical, and each token in the respective sets is associated with a value. The first player selects a gaming cell on the first gaming table for each one of the tokens in the first set of tokens. Similarly, the second player selects a gaming cell on the second gaming table for each one of the tokens in the second set of tokens. The first gaming table is hidden from the second player and the second gaming table is hidden from the first player while the tokens are being placed.","Once each of the first and second players has populated their respective first and second gaming tables with the respective first and second sets of tokens, the game enters the \u201cattack\u201d phase. During the \u201cattack\u201d phase, the first player and the second player take turns to select a gaming cell from the playing table of the other player. The gaming cells are selected by utilising unique identifiers associated with each of the cells. When a cell is selected, the token stored therein is revealed to the other player.","The values associated with the predefined tokens form a sequence. It is desirable for a player to reveal tokens in an order that corresponds to the sequence of the values associated with the tokens (or an inversion thereof). In one embodiment, the scoring is dependent on the absolute values between successively revealed tokens, and thus the lowest score is achievable by revealing the tokens in the same order as defined by the values associated with the tokens (or in reverse). Calculating absolute values between successively revealed tokens provides a score based on relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected tokens.","Once all of the gaming cells for the first and second gaming tables have been selected and all of the tokens from the first and second sets of tokens have consequently been revealed, the game passes to the \u201cscoring\u201d phase. The \u201cscoring\u201d phase calculates the absolute values between the tokens in the order in which the tokens were revealed and then the absolute values are added to provide a total. The player with the lower total is the winner. If the totals are the same, it is a draw.","The tokens can be numbers, icons, pictures, or any graphical symbol. The tokens are arranged in a sequential order by virtue of the values associated with the tokens. It is desirable to identify the tokens in the same sequential order, or the reverse thereof, to minimise the score.","In an alternative embodiment, the \u201cattack\u201d phase and the \u201cscoring\u201d phase occur in parallel, such that one or more interim scores are provided to the players during the attack phase. In one implementation, the \u201cattack\u201d phase and the \u201cscoring\u201d phase are interleaved to provide each player with a progress score after each token has been revealed. Such an embodiment provides the players with immediate feedback relating to their progress in the game.","In one implementation, the players are informed only of their respective score. In another implementation, the scores of the first and second players are provided to each of the first and second players, and thus both first and second players will have an indication of their performance relative to the other player, and thus will have an indication of their relative chances of success.","A further embodiment provides information to the players at one or more intervals during play of the game. The information is based on the sequence of tokens chosen to that time and may include, for example, one or more of: a player's current score, a maximum possible score for that player based on the remaining tokens, a minimum possible score for that player based on the remaining tokens, a range of possible scores for that player based on the remaining tokens, an opponent's score, a maximum possible score for the opponent based on the remaining tokens, a minimum possible score for the opponent based on the remaining tokens, a range of possible scores for the opponent based on the remaining tokens, a probability of the player winning based on the current position of the game, and a probability of the opponent winning based on the current position of the game. The players can then utilise the information to make decisions relating to further bets and stakes that may be wagered on the game.","One embodiment of the present disclosure provides each of first and second players with a gaming table in the form of a 3\u00d73 grid upon which the first and second players have to place the numbers 1 (one) through to 9 (nine) in any cell within the gaming table without the other player knowing where they have placed their numbers on their gaming table. Once a player has completed placing the numbers on the gaming table, that player must wait until their opponent has also setup their gaming table. Once both players have prepared their respective gaming tables (placed the numbers 1 through to 9 within each cell in the game), the game is ready to begin.","One player makes a first guess at identifying a number on the opposing player's gaming table. The player selects a cell, using a unique identifier associated with the cell, and the opponent reveals what number the opponent had placed in the selected cell. The player will then record the revealed number on his score sheet. As there are 9 numbers stored in the 9 cells of the 3\u00d73 grid of the gaming table, each player will have 9 attacking attempts to identify where the numbers are located on their competitor's gaming table. The attacking attempts and their order define an \u201cattack sequence\u201d.","In one or more embodiments, the attack sequence corresponds to a guess by a player as to where an opposing player has placed tokens in cells of a gaming table. In such embodiments, the order of the attacking attempts in the attack sequence corresponds to positions on a gaming table. Any predefined sequence or order may be used to refer to the cells of the gaming table.","In the example of a gaming table implemented using a 3\u00d73 grid, the attack sequence may represent, for example, the 9 cells of that grid in a predefined sequence. In one implementation, the order represents cells from left to right on the top row of the grid, followed by cells from left to right on the middle row of the grid, followed by cells from left to right on the bottom row of the grid. In an alternative implementation, the order represents cells from top to bottom on the left column of the grid, followed by cells from top to bottom on the middle column of the grid, followed by cells from top to bottom on the right column of the grid. In a further implementation, the attack sequence utilises unique identifiers associated with the cells of the gaming table. Depending on the scoring methodology, the order in which the cells are revealed may or may not be of consequence. Similarly, the timing of the revelation of tokens associated with one or more cells may or may not be important, depending on the scoring methodology and the specific gaming embodiment. In particular, the attack and scoring phases may occur substantially contemporaneously in a peer-to-peer match between two players, once each of the two players has populated a gaming table with tokens in a setup phase.","The idea of one embodiment of the game is that the opposing player will attempt to guess where the player has placed their numbers and with each attempt identify a sequence. The goal of the game is to guess where each number is and, with every attempt, guess a low scoring sequence. The total score is determined by determining relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected first tokens and then adding each of the absolute differences between each score sequence. In this particular example, the lowest scoring sequences are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The player with the lowest score wins the game. The lowest possible score for this embodiment is 8.","For example, if the first player selects the cells in the order in which those cells contain the numbers 1 to 9, the revealed sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The scoring is set out below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0107"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Score Sequence achieved {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Score 1&2","1-2 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 2&3","2-3 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 3&4","3-4 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 4&5","4-5 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 5&6","5-6 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 6&7","6-7 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 7&8","7-8 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Score 8&9","8-9 = |\u22121| = 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Total Score","1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"If the first and second player attain the same Total Score, it is a draw.","Draws arising during the play of any one of the gaming embodiments described herein can be handled in many different ways.

Yet other embodiments utilise gaming tables with cells not arranged in a grid formation. For example, the cells can be placed in one or more lines, the cells can be arranged to form a picture or geometric representation, or the cells can be placed randomly within the gaming table. As long as the cells are associated with unique identifiers, any number of cells can be utilised in any desired arrangement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0121"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"1000"},"The gaming process  commences at a Begin step  and progresses to step , in which the first and second players register to play an instance of the game. The actual step of registration will depend on the platform on which the game is being played. In a board game environment, registration may include collecting tokens and a gaming table. In a mobile telephone environment, selecting a gaming application on a mobile handset may register the user with a remote gaming server via a communications network. Optionally, depending on the application, a user may be required to transfer personal information. In an ad-hoc wireless network environment, such as Bluetooth, the establishment of an ad-hoc wireless connection may constitute the registration. In an online computing environment, registration may include the steps of browsing a website and providing personal information.","Control passes to step , in which the first and second players set up a respective gaming table by placing each of the tokens 1 to 9 in a cell of the 3\u00d73 grid. The aim of the game is to identify the locations of a competing player's sequence of numbers on a corresponding gaming table.","In step , the first player attacks by selecting a first cell in the 3\u00d73 grid of the gaming table of the second player. The first player is free to choose any cell, and selects the cell by using unique identifiers associated with each of the cells. In one embodiment, the columns of the 3\u00d73 grid of the gaming table are allocated \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, respectively, and the rows \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, respectively, as identifiers.

The token stored in the selected cell is then revealed to the second player. Control passes to decision step , which determines whether the game has completed. If the game has not completed, No, control returns to step  and the first player attacks again. However, if at step  the game has completed, Yes, control passes to step . Step  determines a winner based on scores derived during the gaming process.

Thus, a player that is about to have a token revealed from his gaming table is allowed to re-allocate a predefined number of the remaining tokens that are yet to be revealed in the cells that are yet to be selected by a competing player. The number of tokens that can be re-allocated can vary from zero to all of the remaining tokens, depending on the particular application.","This variant of the game provides an extra level of entertainment and skill, as the players try to identify a search pattern being employed by an opponent. For example, if the player believes that the opponent is simply traversing a grid of a gaming table from left to right and top to bottom, the player can reorder the remaining tokens to produce a sequence that will yield a poor score for the opponent.","A further embodiment of the present disclosure allows a player to place a bet or stake associated with an instance of the game. The stake may simply comprise an entry fee for playing the game. In one embodiment, a player is able to increase the stake or bet during the game play. In one implementation, a player is able to change the stake or bet on each attacking iteration. This embodiment allows a player to increase a stake or bet if the player progressively reveals a sequence of consecutive tokens, thus yielding a high degree of confidence in obtaining a low, winning score. The players may be able to agree mutually to increase their wager amounts during these rounds. The bets or stakes can be real money or credits managed by a third party. Alternatively, the bets or stakes can be virtual money or credits.","A further embodiment utilises an alternative scoring method that determines a relative difference between the value of a token selected by a player with a corresponding value from the ordered sequence of values to produce a score for each selected token, in a manner similar to that described with reference to . In this alternative scoring method, however, the number of instances of each score is summed.","Using the example of , the scores computed from the relative differences are 3, 1, 1, 4, 7, 2, 2, 4, and 0. A score of 0 indicates the value of the token selected by the player corresponds to the corresponding value from the ordered sequence of values, corresponding to a direct match. Similarly, a score of 1 indicates the value of the token selected by the player differs by 1 from the corresponding value from the ordered sequence of values, and so on. Summing the number of instances of each score provides an indication of the number of direct matches, the number of matches that differed by 1, the number of matches that differed by 2, and so on.","Returning to the example of , the total score for the player is 1 score of \u201c0\u201d, 2 scores of \u201c1\u201d, 2 scores of \u201c2\u201d, 1 score of \u201c3\u201d, 2 scores of \u201c4\u201d, and 1 score of \u201c7\u201d. In an embodiment utilising this alternative scoring method, a winner is determined between 2 players by comparing the number of scores of \u201c0\u201d that each player had. The player with the higher number of scores of \u201c0\u201d is the winner. If the players have the same number of scores of \u201c0\u201d, then one implementation checks how many scores of \u201c1\u201d each of the players had, with the winner being the player with the higher number of scores of \u201c1\u201d. If the players have the same number of scores of \u201c1\u201d, then one implementation checks how many scores of \u201c2\u201d each of the players had, with the winner being the player with the higher number of scores of \u201c3\u201d, and so on. Different implementations may declare a draw between 2 players upon determining that the players have the same number of scores of \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, or other predefined number.","Player Participation","As described above, various embodiments of the gaming method in accordance with the present disclosure can be implemented in many ways, including: (i) standalone with a single player against a competitor or a single competitor against a game controller; and (ii) peer-to-peer with two players competing directly against each other. The objective in each implementation is for a player to obtain the lowest score. Thus, in standalone mode the player competes against a database of known low scores and in the peer-to-peer mode the player competes against the score of the opponent. In another embodiment, the objective of the game is to obtain the highest number of matches of token pairs.","A number of contestants can be organised in many ways to play a series of games to identify an overall winner. In one implementation, a series of peer-to-peer games are played among the contestants in a knockout format, where one contestant is eliminated from each game until an ultimate winner is determined. Thus, a group of 32 contestants will require 16 initial peer-to-peer matches. The winners of those matches will play a second round of 8 matches, with the winners of those matches playing a further 4 matches. The winners of the round of 4 matches will play the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals will play the final match to determine the ultimate winner. Such playoff arrangements can be enhanced by seeding contestants and utilising byes to fill the playoff roster, as commonly utilised in sporting competitions.","An alternative implementation utilises a round-robin tournament, wherein each participant plays every other participant an equal number of times. The participant with the lowest cumulative score wins the entire tournament.","A further implementation provides a tournament beginning with a round-robin component to identify a subset of the contestants. The subset of contestants then compete in playoffs and then ultimately compete in a grand final peer-to-peer contest.","Prizes","Different embodiments of the gaming method and system of the present disclosure utilise different prize schemes. In one implementation, the score itself is the prize and no further benefit is awarded to the player. Such a prize is utilised in a computing device, for example, in which the player sequentially guesses the locations of the tokens of a predefined sequence. A score is determined based on the values associated with the tokens and in light of the sequence in which the player guessed the respective tokens. One implementation of such a computing device includes a database of lowest scores, so that a player can compare himself to other players and\/or his earlier attempts.","A further embodiment is associated with a prize pool. Each player pays a fee upon registration. A portion of the prize pool is then paid to the winner. The prize pool can optionally include prizes for 2nd, 3rd and even subsequent places. The specific prizes awarded will depend on each particular implementation.","Gaming Platforms","Board Game","One embodiment of a gaming method and system in accordance with the present disclosure provides a gaming table in the form of a board having printed thereon a number of cells. Each of the cells is associated with a unique identifier, so that each cell can be readily referenced by an opposing player. The unique identifiers can be grid references, such as A to C for the 3\u00d73 grid embodiment described above. Alternatively, any other unique identifiers such as numbers, letters, colours, or a combination thereof can equally be utilised. The number of cells is equal to the number of tokens that is to be placed on the gaming table; each token is placed on a cell during play of the game, as described above.","Each gaming table is associated with a corresponding set of tokens, with each token having an associated value. One embodiment of the gaming table provides a scoring area, such as that shown in . Alternative scoring tables and wheels can equally be utilised. A further embodiment provides a player with a first gaming table showing where the player has placed his tokens and a second gaming table that the player completes as the tokens from the opposing player's table are revealed.","Computing Device","One embodiment utilises a computing device to allow a player to compete either against the computing device itself or with a second player coupled to the same computing device. The second player can be coupled directly to the computing device or alternatively the second player can be coupled to the computing device via a communications network, such as the Internet, or via an ad-hoc wireless link, such as provided by Bluetooth. In a single player mode, an application executing on a processor in the computing device populates a gaming table with a set of tokens. The gaming table is presented to the player via a display means, with all of the cells initially covered. As the player selects cells, the selected cells are each, in turn, uncovered to reveal the tokens located therein. The computing device records the sequence in which the player selects the cells to be revealed and the tokens that are revealed at each turn to determine a score. Visual and audio feedback are readily provided via the display means and speakers.","The computing device can be implemented by, for example, but is not limited to, a portable handheld gaming computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a dedicated gaming machine, a mobile telephone handset, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, or a proprietary gaming and\/or wagering terminal. The player can provide input in many ways, including using a QWERTY keypad, a numeric keypad, a touchscreen, a joystick, a scratch pad, a stylus, or any combination thereof.","The method of gaming may be implemented using a computer system , such as that shown in , wherein the processes of  and  may be implemented as software, such as one or more application programs executable within the computer system . In particular, the steps of the method of gaming are effected by instructions in the software that are carried out within the computer system . The instructions may be formed as one or more code modules, each for performing one or more particular tasks. The software may also be divided into two separate parts, in which a first part and the corresponding code modules perform the registration, setting up, playing and scoring methods and a second part and the corresponding code modules manage a user interface between the first part and the user. The software may be stored in a computer readable medium, including the storage devices described below, for example. The software is loaded into the computer system  from the computer readable medium, and then executed by the computer system . A computer readable medium having such software or computer program recorded on it is a computer program product. The use of the computer program product in the computer system  preferably effects an advantageous apparatus for gaming and entertainment.","As seen in , the computer system  is formed by a computer module , input devices such as a keyboard  and a mouse pointer device , and output devices including a printer , a display device  and loudspeakers . The input devices may also include, but are not limited to, one or more of a customised keypad, a touchscreen, a scratch pad, and a stylus, which are not illustrated.

In some implementations, the modem  may be incorporated within the computer module , for example within the interface . The computer module  also has a local network interface  which, via a connection , permits coupling of the computer system  to a local computer network , known as a Local Area Network (LAN). As also illustrated, the local network  may also couple to the wide network  via a connection , which would typically include a so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d device or similar functionality. The interface  may be formed by an Ethernet\u2122 circuit card, a wireless Bluetooth\u2122 or an IEEE 802.11 wireless arrangement.","The interfaces  and  may afford both serial and parallel connectivity, the former typically being implemented according to the Universal Serial Bus (USB) standards and having corresponding USB connectors (not illustrated). Storage devices  are provided and typically include a hard disk drive (HDD) . Other devices such as a floppy disk drive and a magnetic tape drive (not illustrated) may also be used. An optical disk drive  is typically provided to act as a non-volatile source of data. Portable memory devices, such optical disks (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD), USB-RAM, and floppy disks for example may then be used as appropriate sources of data to the system .","The components , to  of the computer module  typically communicate via an interconnected bus  and in a manner which results in a conventional mode of operation of the computer system  known to those in the relevant art. Examples of computers on which the described arrangements can be practised include IBM-PCs and compatibles, Sun Sparcstations, Apple Mac\u2122 or alike computer systems evolved therefrom.","Typically, the application programs discussed above are resident on the hard disk drive  and read and controlled in execution by the processor . Intermediate storage of such programs and any data fetched from the networks  and  may be accomplished using the semiconductor memory , possibly in concert with the hard disk drive . In some instances, the application programs may be supplied to the user encoded on one or more CD-ROM and read via the corresponding drive , or alternatively may be read by the user from the networks  or . Still further, the software can also be loaded into the computer system  from other computer readable media. Computer readable media refers to any storage medium that participates in providing instructions and\/or data to the computer system  for execution and\/or processing. Examples of such media include floppy disks, magnetic tape, CD-ROM, a hard disk drive, a ROM or integrated circuit, a magneto-optical disk, or a computer readable card such as a PCMCIA card and the like, whether or not such devices are internal or external of the computer module . Examples of computer readable transmission media that may also participate in the provision of instructions and\/or data include radio or infra-red transmission channels as well as a network connection to another computer or networked device, and the Internet or Intranets including e-mail transmissions and information recorded on Websites and the like.","The second part of the application programs and the corresponding code modules mentioned above may be executed to implement one or more graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to be rendered or otherwise represented upon the display .

Such an embodiment allows a player to submit a populated gaming table and a sequence of attacking moves within a time before a game commences. The time can be a time defined by a computer on which the game is being played, for example, or can be the time up until the game is initiated, such as by pressing a \u201cStart\u201d button. In an alternative embodiment, the time is a scheduled date and time.

For example, the game described above with reference to  requires an attacking sequence of 9 moves. In this example, the player preselects a gaming table and an initial attacking sequence of less than 9 moves. The preselected gaming table and the initial attacking sequence are utilised for an initial phase of the match against a competing player who has also preselected a gaming table and an initial attacking sequence.

For example, one implementation applies different rules to competing players for the attacking sequences and moves that are to be preselected. This can be utilised, for example, to provide a form of handicapping. A novice player may be allowed to choose each attacking move during game play, for example, thus allowing the player to respond to any pattern that might be identified from revealed tokens. However, an expert player may be required to preselect an entire attacking sequence for a game, thus preventing the expert player from responding to any pattern that might be identified from revealed tokens during game play.","In another preselection embodiment, a first player submits a set of 2 completed gaming tables for competition against a second player.

As can be seen from the draw breaking table , the player has preselected cell B as the location of the draw breaking token.","The preselected attack sequence stored in the array  and utilised in the initial, drawn game is utilised in conjunction with the draw round selection table  and a corresponding attack sequence and draw round selection table from a competing player to identify a winner. The winner is the player that identifies the draw breaking token of the competing player in fewer moves.","In the scenario in which the gaming table and the draw breaking table are the same and the draw breaking token is one of the tokens for populating the gaming table, a single gaming table can be utilised, with the location of the draw breaking token preselected by identifying a cell of the gaming table. For example, with reference to  a player can preselect the gaming table by populating the cells with tokens from 1 to 9 and then select any one of those cells for the draw breaking token.","In an alternative implementation, the attack sequence stored in the array  is displayed in a format corresponding to the layout of the gaming table.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0271","num":"0297"},"figref":"FIG. 8B","b":["8200","8200","8210","8220","8210","8210","8210","8220"]},"The preselection interface  also includes a draw round selection table . In this implementation, a draw is resolved by playing a new game. In the example of , the draw gaming table  corresponds to the gaming table . The player preselects the draw breaking table by populating the table  with a set of predefined draw breaking tokens. In one implementation, the draw breaking tokens correspond to the tokens utilised in the gaming table . In an alternative implementation, the draw breaking tokens are different from the tokens utilised in the gaming table . For example, in one implementation larger values are associated with the draw breaking tokens in order to create larger scores, which in turn reduces the chance of a further draw and thus provides a greater chance of identifying a winner. In this particular example, the preselected attack sequence stored in the array  is applied to a draw gaming table of the competing player and an attack sequence utilised by the competing player during the drawn match is applied to the draw gaming table  to identify a winner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0299"},"figref":["FIG. 8C","FIG. 8C","FIG. 1"],"b":["8300","8300","8310","8320","8310","8310"]},"As described above, the player populates the gaming table  by allocating each of the tokens to a corresponding cell of the gaming table . In the preselection implementation, the player also selects an attack sequence before the game commences and the attack sequence is stored in the array . Thus, the sequence of attacking moves is preselected, and individual attacking moves are not made in response to an attack from a competing player.","As indicated above, in this embodiment a draw is resolved by playing a new game with a new attack sequence. Accordingly, the preselection interface  also includes a draw round selection table  and a draw attack sequence array . The player preselects the draw breaking table by populating the draw breaking table  with a set of draw breaking tokens. In one implementation, the set of draw breaking tokens is equal to the number of cells on the draw breaking table . In an alternative implementation, a single draw breaking token is placed in the draw breaking table .","The player preselects the draw attack sequence array  by providing a sequence of attacking moves to be utilised in the event that a draw occurs from the initial game. In the example of , the gaming table  and the draw breaking table  are the same shape and configuration, with the same number of cells. However, the gaming table  and the draw breaking table  can equally be different from each other. In the event that the initial game is a draw, the draw attack sequence stored in the draw attack sequence array  is applied to a draw gaming table of a competing player and a draw attack sequence preselected by the competing player is applied to the draw gaming table  to identify a winner. In the case in which a single draw breaking token is utilised, the winner is the player whose attacking sequence identifies the draw breaking token of the competing player in fewer moves.","An example of multiple players playing a preselected game will now be described with reference to . In this example, a first player and a second player register to play a game by purchasing first and second tickets, respectively. The first and second tickets provide the respective first and second players with a chance to win a portion of a prize controlled by a game administrator. In this particular example, the game administrator controls the gaming server  and the first and second players are registered in the game database  upon purchase of the respective first and second tickets.","In one implementation, the purchase of a ticket involves the preselection of a gaming table and an attack sequence. The preselection of the gaming table and attack sequence are completed by the player purchasing the ticket. In an alternative implementation, the player can optionally select to have a preselected gaming table and attack sequence provided by the game administrator. Depending on the particular implementation, a ticket can be associated with a single gaming table and attack sequence or multiple gaming tables and corresponding attack sequences. Pricing may vary, depending on the number of gaming tables associated with each ticket.","In the example of , the first player utilises the mobile browser  to interact with the gaming server  to purchase the first ticket. Similarly, the second player utilises the mobile browser  to interact with the gaming server  to purchase the second ticket. In an alternative implementation, a player purchases a ticket from a retail outlet (not shown) or other computing device (not shown) that interacts with the gaming server .","Each player that is registered with the gaming server  before a predefined deadline has a chance of sharing a portion of a prize pool. In one implementation, the gaming server provides a master gaming board and master attack sequence and each preselected gaming table and attack sequence competes against the master gaming board and master attack sequence to identify one or more winners based on the resulting scores. For example, all players that attain a score greater than or equal to a predetermined threshold may enter a subsequent stage of the game. In one particular implementation, the identified winners then compete against one another in a tournament to identify an ultimate winner. As described above, the tournament may include round-robin matches, peer-to-peer matches, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the identified winners utilise the same preselected gaming table and attack sequences in the tournament against one another. The tickets can optionally include a draw resolution selection to assist in allocating prizes among players.","In a further embodiment, a first player preselects a first gaming table and a first attack sequence by populating cells of the first gaming table with tokens and providing a first attack sequence of attacking moves. The first player submits a request, via a gaming server, to a second player to compete against each other. The first player also submits the populated first gaming table and the first attack sequence to the gaming server. In one implementation, wthe first gaming table and the first attack sequence are provided to the gaming server in the form of a unitary computer file, multiple computer files, an SMS message, or any combination thereof. Other implementations may equally be practised without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","The second player receives the request, which may be as soon as the request is sent or at any later time, such as when the second player next logs on to a website coupled to the gaming server. When the second player accepts the request, the second player populates a second gaming table with tokens and provides a second sequence of attacking moves. The second player submits the second gaming table and the second attack sequence to the gaming server and the game is then initiated, with a winner being determined almost instantaneously. Thus, the second player receives a result shortly after accepting the request and providing the second gaming table and second attack sequence. This may be minutes, hours, days, or even months after the request from the first player. The first player is then notified of the result. Such notification may occur, for example, via e-mail, SMS, Facebook wall, MySpace, or via an application residing on the gaming server.","In an alternative implementation, the second player populates a second gaming table with tokens and submits to the gaming server the populated second gaming table and a second sequence of attacking moves prior to receiving the request from the first player. On receipt of the request from the first player, if the second player chooses to accept the request, the gaming server already has the populated second gaming table and second sequence of attacking moves for the match against the first player.","In an alternative implementation, the first and second players each provide an attack sequence, and the gaming server populates a single gaming table. The attack sequences provided by the first and second players are applied to the gaming table and a winner is subsequently determined.","The present disclosure provides a method of gaming utilising a first gaming table and a predefined number of first tokens. The first gaming table includes a plurality of cells corresponding to the number of first tokens and each cell of the first gaming table is associated with a unique identifier. This enables a player to readily identify a cell to be populated or selected. Each of the first tokens has an associated value. In one embodiment, relative differences between consecutively revealed tokens are utilised to compute a score for the player. This score can be computed at the end of a game, or interim scores can be displayed during game play.","The method includes the step of populating the first gaming table by storing each of the first tokens in one of the cells of the first gaming table. Population of the cells can be performed by a game controller. Alternatively, the cells of the first gaming table are populated in response to commands from a competing player.","The first player provides selection commands to select one of the cells of the first gaming table to reveal one of the first tokens stored therein. The first player provides further selection commands until each of the first tokens has been revealed. The first player can provide each selection command individually, with a first token revealed before a further selection command is provided. Alternatively, the first player provides a sequence of selection commands, in which first tokens corresponding to cells identified in the sequence of selection commands are revealed. The sequence of selection commands can correspond to the number of first tokens, or any subset thereof.","The method utilises the values associated with the first tokens to determine a score for the first player, based on an order in which the first tokens were revealed. Utilising the values to determine the score can be based on relative differences between values associated with consecutively selected first tokens. Alternatively, a predefined ordered sequence of values can be used to determine the score by comparing values associated with the selected tokens to corresponding values in the predefined ordered sequence of values. Thus, the order in which the first tokens are revealed has a direct impact on the score for the first player.","In the example in which the cells of the first gaming table are populated in response to commands from a competing player, the first player can seek to improve his or her score by attempting to identify patterns of behaviour relating to the competing player. This may be based, for example, on information relating to gaming tables previously populated by the competing player. Such information may be collected by the first player or may be provided in varying levels of detail by a system implementing a method in accordance with the present disclosure.","It is apparent from the above that the arrangements described are applicable to the computer, telecommunications and gaming industries.","The foregoing describes only some embodiments of the present invention, and modifications and\/or changes can be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, the embodiments being illustrative and not restrictive.","In the context of this specification, the word \u201ccomprising\u201d means \u201cincluding principally but not necessarily solely\u201d or \u201chaving\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d, and not \u201cconsisting only of\u201d.
