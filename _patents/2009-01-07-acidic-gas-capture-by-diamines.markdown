{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES","REFERENCES"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/019,646, filed Jan. 8, 2008, which is incorporated in this application by reference.","The present invention was made with support under contract number FC26-2NT41440 awarded by the Department of Energy. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.","As concerns of global climate changes spark initiatives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, its economic removal from gas streams is becoming increasingly important. Removal by absorption\/stripping is a commercially promising technology, as it is well suited to sequester carbon dioxide (CO). Such carbon dioxide emissions may be produced by a variety of different processes, such as the gas stream produced by coal-fired power plants. The removal of COcan be an expensive process, potentially increasing the cost of electricity by 50% or more. Therefore, technology improvements to reduce the costs associated with the removal are highly desirable.","The removal of COfrom fuel gas and flue gas by absorption\/stripping with aqueous amines is a disclosed and commercially practiced technology. A typical flowsheet for such a process is give by Kohl and Nielsen (1997) (). The gas at 30 to 50\u00b0 C. containing COand inerts such as methane, hydrogen, or nitrogen is contacted countercurrently in a trayed or packed column with lean aqueous solvent entering at 30 to 50\u00b0 C. The aqueous rich solvent containing 3 to 6 molar amine is heated by cross exchange with the hot lean solvent. The approach temperature for this exchanger has historically been 10 to 30\u00b0 C. with a lean solution loading of 0.01 to 0.25 moles CO\/mole amine. CO is removed from the solvent at 1.5-2 atm and 90-130\u00b0 C. in a countercurrent reboiled stripper with trays or packing.","Commercially used amines that are used by themselves in water include monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine, diglycolamine, diisopropanolamine, some hindered amines, and others (Kohl and Nielsen (1997)). These amines are soluble or miscible with water at ambient temperature at high concentrations that are used in the process to maximize capacity and reduce sensible heat requirements. Other amines, including piperazine, are used in combination with methyldiethanolamine and other primary amines.","A number of mono- and polyamines, including piperazine, are identified as potentially useful solvent components but have not been used because they are insufficiently soluble in water when used by themselves. Piperazine is a diamine that has previously been studied as a promoter for amine systems to improve kinetics. In water at 25\u00b0 C., solid piperazine has a solubility less than 2 M, so it cannot be used in traditional systems at concentrations that give adequate COcapacity for good energy performance. BASF has disclosed the used of piperazine in combination with other amines (such as alkanolamines) or highly water soluble organics (such as triethyleneglycol) to promote the water solubility of piperazine.","It has also been claimed that number of potentially useful amines such as piperazine would be too volatile if used in high concentrations in aqueous solvents. The boiling point of piperazine (146.5\u00b0 C.) is lower that that of monoethanolamine (170\u00b0 C.), so the use of Raoult's law would suggest that it would have a greater volatility at the top of the absorber.","The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.","While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific example embodiments have been shown in the figures and are described in more detail below. It should be understood, however, that the description of specific example embodiments is not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, this disclosure is to cover all modifications and equivalents as illustrated, in part, by the appended claims.","The present disclosure, according to certain embodiments, generally relates to compositions, systems, and methods for the removal of acidic gas. In particular, the present disclosure relates to compositions, systems, and methods for the removal of acidic gas from a gas mixture using a solvent comprising a diamine (e.g., piperazine) and carbon dioxide. Suitable diamines include those that are volatile or insoluble at normal conditions, for example, piperazine, ethylenediamine, and various substituted ethylenediamines (e.g., methylethylenediamine, dimethylethylenediamine, ethylethylenediamine, and diethylethylenediamine), and piperazine (e.g., methylpiperazine, dimethylpiperazine, ethylpiperazine, and diethylpiperazine).","The present disclosure is based in part on the discovery of optimum stripper process configurations and operating conditions that result in unexpectedly high lean loading of CO. Such process configurations may include the matrix, internal exchange, flashing feed, and multipressure processes described herein. Such operating conditions may include an unexpectedly low exchanger approach temperature. In some embodiments, such exchanger approach temperatures may be approximately 5\u00b0 C.","The present disclosure is also based in part on the discovery that diamines (e.g., piperazine) may be less volatile in an aqueous solution than expected from Raoult's law. In certain embodiments, the activity coefficient of piperazine at infinite dilution in water may be about 0.05, whereas monoethanolamine (MEA) has an activity coefficient of about 0.16.","The present disclosure is also based in part on the discovery that when diamine (e.g., piperazine) solutions are loaded with up to about 0.8 moles of carbon dioxide (CO) per mole of diamine, the volatility of the diamine may be further reduced. Such a reduction may occur at least in part because of the formation of carbamate ions. Such a reduction may result in the ability to produce concentrated solutions of diamine loaded with COwhich have a volatility acceptable for use in the methods of the present disclosure.","The present disclosure is also based in part on the discovery that the total solubility of solid diamine (e.g., piperazine) may be enhanced in solutions loaded with CO. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides solutions comprising up to about 10 m (moles diamine\/kg water) total diamine when said solutions are loaded with about 0.8 moles COper mole of diamine. This increase in solubility may be due in part to the formation of carbamate ions.","The present disclosure is also based in part on the discovery that concentrated aqueous diamine (e.g., piperazine) may be more stable to oxidative and\/or thermal degradation as compared to conventional solutions, such as MEA. In certain embodiments, the presence of dissolved iron may catalyze the degradation of MEA at a higher rate than the degradation of diamine. In certain embodiments, solutions of diamine loaded with COmay not degrade significantly even at temperatures as high as 150\u00b0 C., whereas MEA may undergo significant degradation (up to about 50%) at 120\u00b0 C. Thus, in certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides solutions comprising a diamine which may be used advantageously at higher pressures and\/or temperatures. For example, the solutions comprising a diamine may be used at temperatures less than 175\u00b0 C. Such an ability to operate at higher pressures and\/or temperatures may, among other things, reduce the amount of energy necessary to perform the methods of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, such a reduction of the amount of energy may range from about 10% to about 30%. Additionally, solutions comprising diamine (e.g., piperazine) may absorb COat faster rates. In certain embodiments, the use of solutions comprising piperazine may result in increased in COabsorption rates ranging from about 20% to about 100%. Such increased COabsorption rates may, among other things, enable absorber configurations which require less packing and pressure drop.","When used in the methods of the present invention, the diamine (e.g., piperazine) may be recovered following absorption of CO. In certain embodiments, such recovery may occur through an evaporation process using a thermal reclaimer.","In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method for the removal of acidic gases from a gas mixture comprising contacting the gas mixture with a solvent comprising a diamine (e.g., piperazine) in an amount of from about 4 to about 15 moles\/kg of water and carbon dioxide in an amount of from about 0.3 to about 0.8 moles per mole of the diamine.","While the present disclosure primarily discusses removal of CO, any acidic gas capable of removal by the methods of the present invention is contemplated by the present disclosure. Such acidic gases may include, but are not limited to, hydrogen sulfide (HS) or carbonyl sulfide (COS), CS, and mercaptans.","The gas mixture may be any gas mixture comprising COfor which COremoval is desired and which is compatible with (i.e. will not be adversely affected by, or will not adversely react with) the methods of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the gas mixture may comprise any gas mixture produced as the byproduct of a chemical process. Suitable gas mixtures may comprise one or more of natural gas and hydrogen.","Process Configurations","In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides several process configurations that may be useful in the methods of the present disclosure. The choice of process configuration may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the composition of the gas mixture, the desired amount of COremoval, the concentration of diamine (e.g., piperazine) to be used, and resource or environmental considerations.","One type of process configuration that may be useful in the methods of the present invention is a matrix stripper configuration. In certain embodiments, such a matrix stripper configuration may be a two-stage matrix, such as the configuration shown in . In such a two-stage matrix configuration, the temperature change across the stripper may be reduced without the inefficiencies that may be associated with mechanical compression. The rich solution from the absorber may be split into two streams. The first stream may be sent to the first stripper at a higher pressure, which may result in a slightly superheated feed. Heat may be applied via reboiler steam. The lean solution from the first column may be the semirich feed to the middle of the second column, which may operate at a lower pressure. The other rich stream may be fed to the top of the second stripper. The second column may produce a semilean stream and a lean stream. The semilean stream may be crossexchanged with the rich feed to the second column, while the lean solution may be crossexchanged with the rich solution to the first stripper. The water vapor from the overhead of the second column may be condensed, and the COmay be sent to the first stage of the compression train. The water vapor in the overhead from the first column may be condensed, and the COmay be sent to the second stage in the compression train. The compression work in this configuration may be reduced due at least in part to recovery of a portion of the COat a higher pressure, which may reduce the need for compression downstream. In certain embodiments, the lower pressure column may be set to 160 kPa for normal pressure operations. In certain embodiments, the lower pressure column may be set to 30 kPa for vacuum operations. The pressure of the higher-pressure column and the flow into the flash section may be optimized to minimize the total equivalent work of the system. Even though a two-stage matrix is described in the present disclosure, a three-stage matrix may also be used with reduced energy requirement.","Another type of process configuration that may be useful in the methods of the present invention is multistage flash stripper configuration. In certain embodiments, such multistage flash strippers may be configured as a multistage flash with a multistage intercooled compressor as illustrated in . Cold rich solvent from the absorber is heated by cross exchange with hot lean solution from the last stage. At stage n rich solution is heated then flashed to a lower pressure (P) to release COwith some water vapor. The vapor from the flash tank is combined with vapor from the next stage (n+1), intercooled to condense water and compressed to the pressure (P) of the previous stage. Lean solution from the last stage is returned to the absorber through the cross exchanger. The process may be optimized to select a number of stages from 1 to 6, a pressure ratio (P\/P) from stage to stage of 1.2 to 10, and a heat rate at each stage from 0 to 200 kJ\/mol CO. The temperature of the flash tank may practically vary from 80 to 175\u00b0 C. This configuration will be especially attractive with flash tank temperature from 120 to 150\u00b0 C. when used with amines such as piperazine that do not degrade at the elevated temperature. The most attractive configuration with concentrated piperazine solution might use 3 stages, each at 140 to 150\u00b0 C., with the about the same heat rate, and with approximately equal pressure ratios.","Another type of process configuration that may be useful in the methods of the present invention is an exchange stripper configuration. In certain embodiments, such an exchange stripper configuration may be an internal exchange stripper, such as the configuration shown in . Among other things, this configuration integrates the stripping process with heat transfer. In certain embodiments, this configuration may approach the theoretical limit of adding and removing material and energy streams along the entire column. Similar configurations have been described previously by Leites et al. and Mitsubishi. In certain embodiments, this configuration may alleviate the temperature drop across the stripper by exchanging the hot lean solution with the solution in the stripper. In certain embodiments, the configuration may comprise a continuous heat exchange surface, which may allow for countercurrent heat exchange of the hot-lean solution with the solution passing through the stripper. In certain embodiments, a large overall heat transfer capability of 41.84 W\/K-mol solvent per segment may be used. Such a heat transfer capability may result in a typical \u0394T of about 1.2 K and about 3 K in the internal exchanger for the vacuum operation, and for operation at normal pressure, respectively.","Another type of process configuration that may be useful in the methods of the present invention is a multipressure configuration. In certain embodiments, such a multipressure configuration may be a multipressure configuration with a split feed, such as the configuration shown in . Similar multipressure configurations have been described in our previous work. In certain embodiments, this configuration may take a 10% split feed from the liquid flowing from the middle to the lowest pressure level in a multipressure stripper, and it may send this stream to an appropriate point in the absorber. In certain embodiments, the temperatures at the bottom of the stripper pressure sections may be equal, and heat may be added to each stripper pressure section to achieve isothermal operation in each section. Such operating conditions, among other things, may reduce irreversibilities and work loss. Among other things, this configuration may take advantage of the favorable characteristics of the multipressure configuration and the split flow configurations. In certain embodiments, the middle pressure may be configured to be approximately the geometric mean of the top pressure and the bottom pressure.","Another type of process configuration that may be useful in the methods of the present invention is a flashing feed configuration. An example of such a configuration is shown in . In certain embodiments, this configuration may comprise special configurations of the split flow concept described by Leites et al. and Aroonwilas. In certain embodiments, at least a fraction of the rich stream may be sent to the middle of the stripper, where, after stripping, a lean solution may exit at the bottom. The rich solution may be cross-exchanged with the lean solution exiting the stripper bottom. In certain embodiments, the vapor leaving the stripper may then be contacted with the absorber rich flow in a five-staged upper section where the latent heat of water vapor may be used to strip the COin the \u2018cold feed\u2019 and a semilean stream may be produced. In certain embodiments, the semilean product may be cross-exchanged with the rich solution fed to the upper section. In certain embodiments, the reboiler duty may remain substantially unchanged, and \u2018free stripping\u2019 may be achieved in the upper section. In certain embodiments, the split ratio of the rich streams into the middle and upper sections may be optimized to minimize equivalent work.","The choice of operating conditions for each of these process configurations may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the composition of the gas mixture, the desired amount of COremoval, the concentration of piperazine to be used, and resource or environmental considerations. Examples of suitable operating conditions are shown in , ,  and  for the double matrix, internal exchange, multipressure with split feed, and flashing feed stripper configurations, respectively.","Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as illustrated, in part, by the appended claims.","Solubility of piperazine (PZ.6HO) solid in PZ solvents. The solubility of PZ.6HO in water was measured by differential scanning calorimetry. The vapor pressure of PZ and COwas measured over loaded and unloaded solutions of piperazine from 30 to 60\u00b0 C. These data were combined with other thermodynamic data on PZ\/CO\/HO and regressed with the electrolyte\/NRTL model in AspenPlus.  gives the predicted solubility of PZ.6HO in loaded PZ solvent as a function of T. 5-10 m PZ solvents can be prepared at loading greater than 0.25 moles CO\/equivalent PZ without precipitating PZ.6HO at ambient T. At 0\u00b0 C. solutions up to 4.5 m PZ can be prepared at a loading of 0.3 moles COper mole of PZ.","Loaded solutions of piperazine were prepared by mixing and heating anhydrous piperazine and water, then sparging with COon a balance. Table 1 shows that solutions with loading less than 0.3 and greater than 0.4 usually precipitate solids when cooled to ambient temperature. The solids precipitated at greater loading were identified as hydrated, protonated piperazine carbamate (CO.piperazine.HO).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"PZ","COldg","Observation"]},{"entry":[{},"(m)","(moles\/2molePZ)","at ambient T"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"10","0.3","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"10","0.4","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"15","0.3","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"20","0.3","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.4+","Solids formed,"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"identified as HO\u2022PZ\u2022CO2"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.3","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.1","Solid block"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.4","Clear"]},{"entry":[{},"10","0.425","Precipitates"]},{"entry":[{},"8","0.2","precipitates"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"The solid solubility of PZ was studied over a range of PZ concentration, COloading, and temperature. Solutions were prepared to cover the desired solution properties and were allowed to equilibrate at each condition with stirring before solubility observations were made. The transition temperature of 8 and 10 m PZ solutions over a range of COloading is shown in . The transition temperature is the temperature at which a liquid solution will first precipitate when cooled slowly. The approximate temperature ramp for all transitions was 1\u00b0 C. every 5 minutes. The two dashed lines at rich loadings in  represent soluble PZ solutions indicating that the solubility envelope extends at least this far. The transition temperature of unloaded PZ solutions ranging from 1.0 to 40 m PZ is shown in .","Viscosity. The viscosity of aqueous PZ solutions has been measured from 0.20 to 0.45 moles CO\/mole alkalinity, 2 m PZ to 20 m PZ, and 25\u00b0 C. to 60\u00b0 C. The viscosity of 8 and 10 m PZ is compared with other amines in . The amine concentration is plotted in units of moles alkalinity per kg of water in order to compare mono- and diamines on the same basis. All of the viscosities are at 40\u00b0 C. and at the rich loading of the system (0.3 mol CO\/equiv Amine for MDEA and MDEA\/PZ; 0.4 mol CO\/equiv Amine for PZ and DGA; 0.5 mol CO\/equiv Amine for MEA).","Comparison of the viscosity on this basis shows how the amine basic groups affect overall viscosity. As the concentration of basic groups increases, the viscosity increases in a linear direction. The viscosity of 8 m PZ is higher than that of 7 m MEA, but as compared to 60 wt % DGA\u00ae, the viscosity of PZ is lower for a higher alkalinity. DGA\u00ae solutions at 60 wt % are successfully used in natural gas treating.","Oxidative Degradation. Heavy metals are known to catalyze the oxidative degradation of amines. The results of oxidative degradation of concentrated PZ in the presence of several dissolved metals are shown in Table 2.

Data at 60\u00b0 C. are plotted versus the equilibrium partial pressure of COif the solution were at 40\u00b0 C. for comparison purposes.","As demonstrated in , the normalized flux, k\u2032, for 8 m PZ is 2 to 3 times greater than for 7 m MEA. For example, at 40\u00b0 C. and an equilibrium COpartial pressure of 500 Pa, the k\u2032 for 8 m PZ and 7 m MEA are 1.98\u00d710and 7.66\u00d710mol\/s-Pa-m, respectively. This demonstrates that the kinetic rate of concentrated PZ is over twice as fast as MEA at 40\u00b0 C. The same trend is observed for the data at 60\u00b0 C.","Volatility of PZ Solutions. The volatility of PZ was measured in the equilibrium cell with hot gas FTIR. The volatility of 8 m PZ solutions is compared to that of 5 m PZ and 7 m MEA in . The volatility of each solution is normalized by the PZ concentration for comparison purposes.","At 40\u00b0 C., the normalized volatility of PZ solutions is the same as the normalized volatility of MEA solutions. It was anticipated that PZ would have a higher volatility than MEA because the boiling point of PZ, 146\u00b0 C., is lower than that of MEA, 170\u00b0 C. However, the volatility of PZ is comparable at 40\u00b0 C. Initial modeling of PZ systems demonstrates this effect as a greatly reduced activity coefficient for PZ. At 40\u00b0 C., PZ volatility varies from 10 to 19 ppm at atmospheric pressure.","Cullinane (2005) estimated PZ volatility over lean solutions (). At 60\u00b0 C., with an equilibrium COpartial pressure of 1000 Pa, he estimates a volatility of 20 e-6 atm with 1.8 m PZ. If his estimate is extrapolated to 9 m PZ, the estimated volatility would be about 90 ppm. However, the measured vapor pressure of piperazine is given in . At 40\u00b0 C. with 9 m PZ and an equilibrium COpartial pressure of 1000 Pa, the volatility of piperazine is only 45 ppm. At lower loading the measured volatility of 9 m PZ would asymptote at 81 e-6 atm. Therefore the volatility is reduced significantly by operation at a reasonable loading for lean solution.","Kohl and Nielsen (1997) note that \u201cCOstripping from MEA solution increases with increased reboiler pressure.\u201d Elevated stripper pressure\/temperature has also been identified as a useful operating condition to minimize total energy requirement (PCT\/US2004\/019838). This effect results from temperature swing desorption, because the heat of COdesorption is greater that the heat of HO evaporation, less heat is required to strip COat greater stripper temperature. This is especially true with solvents that have a greater heat of COdesorption.","The heat of COdesorption was estimated by the rigorous thermodynamic model based on data with 2.4 m PZ.

Therefore, it may be advantageous to operate the stripper at greater temperature. Because PZ does not degrade very fast, even at greater temperature it should be possible to operate the stripper as hot as 135 to 160\u00b0 C., giving improved energy performance.","Estimated Energy Requirement. Thermodynamic models for MEA and PZ were developed by Hilliard, and the PZ model was modified for concentrated solutions. The stripper section of an absorber\/stripper system for COremoval was simulated for 8 m PZ and compared with 7 m MEA. These simulations included a simple stripper with COcompression to 5 MPa, a 5\u00b0 C. cold side temperature approach for the cross heat exchanger, and a 10\u00b0 C. approach for the reboiler. For all cases, 15 m of CMR NO-2P packing was used with an 80% approach to flood. The rich stream for each case assumed a P*at the absorber temperature of 40\u00b0 C. One PZ case assumed a higher P*due to the faster rates of PZ expected in the absorber.","Each system was simulated at their optimum lean loadings and the baseline system, 7 m MEA, had an equivalent work of 36.1 kJ\/mol CO. The two 8 m PZ systems modeled at a 5.0 or 7.5 kPa rich equilibrium COpartial pressure had minimum equivalent works of 33.5 kJ\/mol COand 32.6 kJ\/mol CO, respectively. The PZ system with the lower rich P*, 5 kPa, was less efficient than the system with 7.5 kPa P*, but was better than the 7 m MEA case with an equivalent rich loading. The increased capacity of PZ improved its performance over the baseline, despite a lower \u0394H.","Testing of Process Configurations.","Model Development. An equilibrium stripper model for aqueous solvents developed in Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM) was used to evaluate the different process configurations and solvents. A rich end pinch is usually predicted because of the generous amount of contacting assumed in the model. The stripper consisted of a flash region, 10 segments with 40% Murphree efficiency assigned to CO2, and a reboiler with 100% CO2 efficiency. The flash region in the column was quantified in terms of actual section performance.","Modeling Assumptions.

The matrix and internal exchange configurations with a 160 kPa reboiler and 5 K approach with 7 m MEA offer 9 and 11% energy savings, respectively, over the simple stripper operated at 160 kPa with a 5 K approach.","The characteristics of the matrix (265\/160 kPa) and 160 kPa strippers for MEA are shown in . The matrix stripper recovers about 40% of the COat a higher pressure, and does not have the inefficiencies associated with the multipressure stripper. The reboiler duty is also slightly less for the matrix than the normal pressure stripper.","The characteristics of the vacuum, and the vacuum internal exchange strippers are in . The major difference between the two configurations is the difference in the ratio of the water vapor to COin the overhead stream. The internal exchange stripper has a smaller ratio of water vapor to CO. Multipressure with split feed reduces the flow into the bottom section of the stripper, and, thus, equivalent work. The flashing feed makes use of the latent heat of water vapor in the simple\/vacuum configuration to strip some COin the rich stream entering the stripper at the top of the column.","Solvent Performance.  shows the performance of the different solvent types. The results show that at 160 kPa, MEA\/PZ, MDEA\/PZ, and KS-1 require significantly less equivalent work than 7 m MEA. MEA\/PZ offers a 13 and 8% savings over 7 m MEA with the matrix and internal exchange configurations at 160 kPa. MDEA\/PZ was the most attractive solvent in vacuo conditions. MDEA\/PZ offers a 14 and 10% savings over 7 m MEA, with the matrix and internal exchange configurations at 30 kPa. This shows that, at normal pressure, solvents with high heats of absorption and reasonable capacities are attractive. In vacuo conditions, solvents with lower heats of absorption and higher capacities are attractive. Capacity seems to play a more important role in determining energy requirements at vacuum conditions.","Effect of Heat of Absorption. From , solvents with similar capacities, but different heats of absorption can be compared. 6.4 m K+\/1.6 m PZ and 5 m K+\/2.5 m PZ are compared. The results show that at a fixed capacity, solvents with high heats of absorption require less energy for stripping. This is a consequence of the temperature swing. The 5 m K+\/2.5 m PZ offers 18% savings over 6.4 m K+\/1.6 m PZ at 160 kPa with a 5 K approach and savings of 3 and 4%, with the matrix and internal exchange configurations at vacuum conditions.","Effect of Capacity and Mass-Transfer Rates. The capacity of a solvent is defined as the amount of COa solvent can absorb over a given range of loading or partial pressure. This reflects the vapor-liquid equilibrium characteristics of a solvent. A high-capacity solvent can absorb or desorb more COthan one with a low-capacity. Some solvents can also achieve richer loading because they have greater rates of COabsorption.","In , 5 m K+\/2.5 m PZ and MDEA\/PZ have similar heats of absorption. However, MDEA\/PZ has a greater capacity, and is also assumed to achieve greater equivalent rich loading than 5 m K+\/2.5 m PZ. Therefore, MDEA\/PZ provides 30 and 19% energy savings over 5 m K+\/2.5 m PZ, with the matrix and internal exchange configurations with the reboiler operating at 160 kPa and 17 and 12% savings with these configurations at 30 kPa.","The two MEA solvents also have similar heats of absorption. MEA\/PZ represented by 11.4 m MEA has a higher capacity and rich loading than 7 m MEA. MEA\/PZ offers 13% energy savings over 7 m MEA, with the matrix stripper operated with a 160 kPa reboiler temperature.","On the other hand, KS-1 is never quite as good as MDEA\/PZ, even though it has a slightly greater heat of absorption and a slightly greater capacity. The primary difference in this case may be the rich P. Because it is assumed to be a slower reacting hindered amine, KS-1 was assigned a value of 5 kPa compared to 7.5 kPa for MDEA\/PZ.","Insight into Stripper Operation.

Flashing of the rich solution occurs at the top of the column. A rich end pinch is observed. The total equivalent work to generate COat 330 kPa increases from 23.7 kJ\/gmol COwith 10 segments to 23.2 kJ\/gmol CO(a 2% reduction) when the number of segments is doubled. Increasing the number of segments implies increased capital cost.","The McCabe-Thiele plot for 7 m MEA with the matrix (265\/160 kPa) configuration is shown in . It is observed that the high- and low-pressure columns are highly pinched. A significant amount of COdesorption occurs due to flashing and under boiling conditions in the reboiler. The rich, semirich, and lean loadings are 0.563, 0.513, and 0.447 mol CO\/mol Alk.

For 8 m PZ, a COloading of approximately 0.25 mol CO\/mol alkalinity is required to maintain a liquid solution without precipitation at room temperature (20\u00b0 C.). Additionally, the solubility of PZ at 20\u00b0 C. is approximately 14 wt % PZ, or 1.9 m PZ. The volatility of 8 m PZ systems was found to be between 10.2 and 18.7 ppm PZ at 40\u00b0 C., which is comparable to 7 m MEA solutions.","Oxidative degradation of concentrated PZ has been shown to be four times slower than 7 m MEA in the presence of the combination of Fe, Cr, and Ni and Fe and V. In the presence of copper-based corrosion inhibitors, oxidative degradation is an issue but can be drastically reduced with the use of Inhibitor \u201cA\u201d. Concentrated PZ is resistant to thermal degradation up to 150\u00b0 C. but does degrade at 175\u00b0 C., losing 32% of the PZ over 2 weeks. The resistance of PZ to thermal degradation allows for the possibility of higher pressure strippers to improve energy performance.","Kinetic measurements have shown that the rate of COabsorption into 8 m PZ is more than twice that of 7 m MEA at 40\u00b0 C. and nearly double at 60\u00b0 C. The working capacity of an 8 m PZ solution is 0.73 mol CO\/(kg PZ+HO), nearly double that of 7 m MEA. Initial modeling of the stripper section indicate that the equivalent work required for stripping of an 8 m PZ solution will be approximately 5-10% lower than that of 7 m MEA.","The rapid rate of COabsorption, low degradation rate, and low predicted equivalent work indicate that 8 m PZ solutions are an attractive option for COcapture in absorption\/stripping systems.","Effect on Power Plant Output and Process Improvement. The addition of an absorption\/stripping system to a power plant will reduce the plant efficiency by reducing the net power produced from the plant, since steam is withdrawn from the plant to drive the reboiler and electrical power is used to operate compressors, blowers etc. Based on previous process analysis and economic studies, the net power output of a 500 MW power plant is about 150 kJ\/gmol COwith 90% COremoval. Different separation techniques are compared by separation and compression work in . The smaller energy requirements for fans and pumps have not been included in this analysis.","The total equivalent work for reversible isothermal separation to 100 kPa and 313 K, and subsequent compression to 10 MPa, is 18.1 kJ\/gmol CO. This is the theoretical minimum work for separation and compression to 10 MPa. This constitutes about 12% of the power plant output. If reversible, isothermal separation to 100 kPA and 313 K is combined with a real, five-stage, intercooled compressor with 75% adiabatic efficiency, the total equivalent work is 24.1 kJ\/gmol CO(16% of the power plant output). If an isothermal separation, such as a perfect membrane is used to produce COat the partial pressure in the flue gas at 313 K, and its pressure is increased by a real five-stage, intercooled compressor with 75% adiabatic efficiency, the total equivalent work is 28.4 kJ\/gmol CO.","The best solvent and process configuration is the matrix (295\/160 kPa) with MDEA\/PZ. This consumes 26.2 kJ\/gmol CO(18% of the net output from a 500 MW power plant with 90% COcapture). This best case offers 22% energy savings over the current industrial baseline (7 m MEA, \u0394T=10 K, 160 kPa), and 15% savings over the improved baseline (7 m MEA, \u0394T=5 K, 160 kPa). This best case requires 2.1 kJ\/gmol COmore work than the theoretical minimum with real compressors. Because this analysis is attempting to account for the use of heat and work, it is sensitive to the efficiency selected (75%) for the conversion of steam heat to work.","Multistage Flash Stripper Configuration.","The performance of the multistage flash was estimated for 8 m piperazine.

The basis for the calculation was 0.5 moles\/s piperazine (1 equivalent\/s piperazine) in the liquid solvent being regenerated.","At each stage the equilibrium COpartial pressure (P*, Pa) was calculated as a function of temperature (T,K) and loading (\u03b1, moles CO2\/mole alkalinity) from an empirical correlation of the available data:\n\nLn()=36.1\u221293200\/8.31413.9883014.3\u03b1\n\nThe heat of COabsorption (\u0394H, J\/mole) was estimated by differentiating this expression to get:\n\n\u0394=\u221293200+8839*8.314\u03b1\n\nThe heat of HO absorption ((\u0394H, J\/mole) was taken to be independent of temperature at \u221240 kJ\/mole. The equilibrium partial pressure of water (P*, atm) was at each stage was estimated by:\n\nexp(\u0394\/8.314(1\/373\u22121))\n\n\n\nThe work to compress the vapor product of each stage to 150 atm with precooling and intercooling to 40\u00b0 C. was estimated by\n\n(kJ\/mole CO)=8.314\/1000\/0.5 ln(150)\n\nThe liquid COflow rate of each stage (l, mole\/s) is equal to the loading (a).\n\nl=\u03b1\n\nThe gas COflow rate at each stage is the difference in CO2 between the feed to the stage (l) and the liquid leaving that stage:\n\n\n\nThe water flow rates are given by:\n\n\n\n=l\n\nThe heat rate for each stage is given by the energy balance:\n\n(J\/mole CO)=(\u2212\u0394H\u2212g\u0394H+(4.18*181+3.0*0.5*86)())\/\n\nThe energy value of this heat was represented by its equivalent work value:\n\n0.7(+10\u2212313)\/(+10)\n\nThe total work for each case is given by\n\n=\u03a3()(\u03b1\u2212\u03b1)\/(\u03b1\u2212\u03b1)\n","Table 5 gives the estimated total work required to regenerate 8 m PZ at a rich loading of 0.39 moles\/mole alkalinity to a lean loading of 0.30. The calculation assumes that lean solution from the last stage of the multistage flash is exchanged to give a rich solution with a feed T that is 5\u00b0 C. less than the hot lean solution. The vapor produced from each stage is cooled to 40\u00b0 C. to condense water, then compressed to 150 bar in a multistage compressor intercooled to 40\u00b0 C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0143","num":"0145"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},{},"\u03b1",{}]},{"entry":[{},"T","P","(mole","W"]},{"entry":["Stages","(K)","(atm)","CO\/mole alk)","(kJ\/mole CO)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["3","423","15, 10, 7","0.36, 0.33, 0.30","30.1"]},{"entry":["2","423","13, 8","0.345, 0.3","31"]},{"entry":["3","423, 416, 406","15, 8, 4","0.36, 0.33, 0.30","32.9"]},{"entry":["3","373","1.7, 1.3,","0.36, 0.33, 0.30","39.6"]},{"entry":[{},{},"1.1"]},{"entry":["2","373","1.5, 1.1","0.345, 0.3","41.2"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"\u03b1= 0.39,"},{"entry":"\u03b1= 0.30,"},{"entry":"\u0394T= 5\u00b0 C., compression to 50 atm"}]}}]}}},"The least total work, 30.1 kJ.mole CO, is achieved by a three stage flash with each stage heated to 423 K by steam condensing at 433 K.

With a two stage flash at 423 K, the work increases to 31.0 kJ.mole CO.","With a simpler three stage flash that heats only at the first stage, the stage T is respectively, 423, 416, and 406. The latter stages operate at lower pressure to provide vapor without additional heating. The stage P is respectively, 15, 8, and 4 atm.","If the three stage flash is operated at 373 K, typical of conventional simple stripper designs, the total work is substantially greater, 41.2 kJ\/mole. Furthermore the compressor must be sized to deal with a larger volume of gas at the respective stage pressure, 1.7, 1.3, 1.1 atm, resulting in greater capital cost as well.","Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein.
