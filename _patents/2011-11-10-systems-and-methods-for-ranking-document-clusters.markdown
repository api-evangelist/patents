{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/500,109 filed Jun. 22, 2011 under the title SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RELEVANCE RANKING OF DIGITAL DATA.","The content of the above patent application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the detailed description hereof.","The present disclosure relates generally to document clustering. More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for automatically ranking document clusters.","Traditional news sources have relied on editors in order to determine the significance and prominence of stories. An editor is a person who is generally in charge of and who determines the final content of a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine.","Traditional media sources such as newspaper, television and radio now coexist with non-traditional media sources, such as micro-blogs including Twitter\u2122. The volume of documents may be particularly large for non-traditional media sources, such as micro-blogs. Since micro-blogs provide a means for laypeople to publish comments, the number of documents which are published on a micro-blog provider system (such as Twitter\u2122) may be extremely large. That is, the large number of potential authors can result in a large number of documents being produced.","Similarly, due to the abundance of media sources, the quantity of stories produced has become quite large. Since stories may be initiated by any person who is able to publish to a blog or micro-blog, the volume of stories increases with the number of bloggers and micro-bloggers. For example, any user with a Twitter\u2122 account may initiate a new story.","Due to the abundance of media sources and content produced by various media sources, determining the significance and prominence of stories may be a difficult or impossible task for a traditional editor. By way of example, this task may be particularly difficult for news aggregation systems and websites. News aggregation systems and websites may analyze content from various sources and may provide access to that content through a common portal. Since news aggregation systems and websites index content from many different sources, the number of stories and documents which are indexed by such systems and websites may be quite large.","Similar reference numerals are used in different figures to denote similar components.","In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of ranking a document cluster. The document cluster includes one or more documents. In some example embodiments, the method includes: obtaining, at a document cluster ranking system, values associated with a first feature for each of a plurality of document clusters; based on the values associated with the first feature, automatically generating, at the document cluster ranking system, a plurality of first feature bins, each first feature bin defining a range of values and a bin identifier; and obtaining a score for one of the document clusters, by: i) identifying the first feature bin having a range of values which includes the obtained value associated with the first feature for that one of the document clusters; and ii) determining a score for that document cluster based on the first feature bin identifier for the identified first feature bin.","In a further aspect, the present disclosure describes a document cluster ranking system for ranking a document cluster which includes one or more documents. The document cluster ranking system includes a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory stores processor executable instructions which, when executed by the processor cause the processor to: obtain values associated with a first feature for each of a plurality of document clusters; based on the values associated with the first feature, automatically generate a plurality of first feature bins, each first feature bin defining a range of values and a bin identifier; and obtain a score for one of the document clusters, by: i) identifying the first feature bin having a range of values which includes the obtained value associated with the first feature for that one of the document clusters; and ii) determining a score for that document cluster based on the first feature bin identifier for the identified first feature bin.","In a further aspect aspect, the present disclosure provides a computer readable storage medium comprising computer executable instructions for: obtaining, at a document cluster ranking system, values associated with a first feature for each of a plurality of document clusters; based on the values associated with the first feature, automatically generating, at the document cluster ranking system, a plurality of first feature bins, each first feature bin defining a range of values and a bin identifier; and obtaining a score for one of the document clusters, by: i) identifying the first feature bin having a range of values which includes the obtained value associated with the first feature for that one of the document clusters; and ii) determining a score for that document cluster based on the first feature bin identifier for the identified first feature bin.","Other aspects and features of the present application will become apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art upon review of the following description of specific embodiments of the application in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Sample Operating Environment","Reference is first made to , which illustrates a system diagram of a possible operating environment  in which embodiments of the present disclosure may operate.","In the embodiment of , a document aggregation system  is configured to group related documents  together. The documents  which grouped by the document aggregation system  are machine readable documents , such as, for example, text based documents, video, and\/or audio. These documents  may include, for example, blog posts , micro blog posts , news articles , comments , videos , and other documents . Other types of documents  may be included in the groups of related documents  obtained by the document aggregation system .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  is configured to analyze at least a portion of one or more machine readable documents  and to group related documents together. That is, the document aggregation system  is configured to obtain document clusters . Each document cluster  includes one or more documents  which are related to one another. More particularly, in at least some embodiments, the documents  in a document cluster  are related to one another by subject matter. That is, all of the documents  in a given document cluster  may be related by virtue of the fact that they all discuss a common story. The story may relate to a topic, issue, or event such as a recent event.","Some document clusters  may include a single document . This may occur, for example, where none of the other documents  analyzed by the document aggregation system  are related to the single document  in the document cluster . A single document cluster  may, however, include a plurality of documents . Where a single document cluster  includes a plurality of documents , all of the documents  in that document cluster  are related.","In the embodiment illustrated, three document clusters  are illustrated. These include a first document cluster , a second document cluster , and a third document cluster . However, in other example embodiments, a greater or fewer number of document clusters  may be obtained. Each document cluster  includes one or more documents  which are determined, by the document aggregation system , to be related.","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters  may, for example, be documents  which are associated with one or more document servers . In some embodiments, the documents  may include one or more blog posts . A blog is a website on which an author records opinions, links to other sites, and other content on a regular basis. A blog is a form of online journal which allows user to reflect, share opinions and discuss various topics in the form of an online journal. A blog post  is an entry in a blog. In at least some embodiments, the blog posts  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more blog server .","In some embodiments, the documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters  may, for example, include micro-blog posts . A micro-blog is a form of a blog in which the entries to the blog are typically restricted to a predetermined length. By way of example, in at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts  may include Tweets\u2122 on Twitter\u2122. In at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts  may be social networking posts including status updates, such as Facebook\u2122 posts and updates and\/or Google\u2122 Buzz\u2122 posts and updates. In at least some embodiments, the micro-blog posts may be restricted to one hundred and forty () characters. The micro-blog posts  may, in at least some embodiments, be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more micro-blog server .","In some embodiments, the documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters  may, for example, include news articles . News articles  are text based documents which may, for example, contain information about recent and\/or important events. In at least some embodiments, the news articles  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more news servers .","In at least some embodiments, the documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters  may include other documents instead of or in addition to the blog posts , micro-blog-posts  and\/or news articles . By way of example, in at least some embodiments, the documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which may be included in the document clusters  may include one or more comments , one or more videos  and\/or one or more other documents . Comments  may, in at least some embodiments, be documents  which are user-generated posts which are input within an interface which allows a user to comment about a primary document. The primary document may, for example, be a blog post , micro-blog post , news article , or video . Other types of primary documents may also be used. That is, comments  may be remarks which express an opinion or reaction to a primary document. Users may be given the opportunity to submit comments  when viewing the primary documents. In at least some embodiments, the comments may be stored on and\/or accessed through the blog server , micro-blog server  or news server . In other embodiments, the comments  may be stored on and\/or accessed through one or more other document servers .","The other document servers  may, in at least some embodiments, store and\/or provide access to one or more videos  and\/or other documents.","The documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  are machine readable documents. The documents  may include, for example, text-based documents which contain data in written form. By way of example and not limitation, the documents  may be formatted in a Hyper-Text Markup Language (\u201cHTML\u201d) format, a plain-text format, a portable document format (\u201cPDF\u201d), or in any other format which is capable of representing text or other content. Other document formats are also possible.","In at least some embodiments, the documents  may include documents  which are not text-based documents. Instead, the documents  may be documents which are capable of being converted to text based documents. Such documents  may include, for example, video or audio files. In such embodiments, the document aggregation system , or another system, may include a text extraction module which is configured to convert audible speech into written text. Such text may then be analyzed by the document aggregation system  in order to obtain the document clusters .","Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, the documents  which are analyzed by the document aggregation system  and which are used to form the document clusters  are documents  which are stored on a document server  which is accessible to the document aggregation system . The document aggregation system  may connect to the document servers  via a network , such as the Internet. In some embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may be a publicly and\/or privately accessible web-site which may be identified by a unique Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d).","The network  may be a public or private network, or a combination thereof. The network  may be comprised of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN), a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), or any combination of these network types. Other types of networks are also possible and are contemplated by the present disclosure.","In at least some embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may include an application programming interface (API)  which permits the document aggregation system  to access the documents  associated with that document server . By way of example, in some embodiments, the blog server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  to access blog posts  associated with the blog server . Similarly, in at least some embodiments, the micro-blog server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  to access micro-blog posts  associated with the micro-blog server . Similarly, in at least some embodiments, the news server  may include an API  which permits the document aggregation system  to access news articles  associated with the news server . In at least some embodiments (not shown), one or more of the other document servers  may include an API  for permitting the document aggregation system  to access the documents  associated with those other document servers .","The API  associated with any one or more of the document servers  may be configured to provide documents  associated with that document server  to the document aggregation system . For example, in at least some embodiments, an API  associated with a document server  may be configured to receive a request for one or more documents  from the document aggregation system  (or another system) and, in response, retrieve one or more documents  from storage and provide the retrieved document(s) to the document aggregation system  (or other system from which a request was received).","While in some embodiments, the API  of one or more of the documents servers  may be configured to return documents  to a system (such as the document aggregation system ) in response to a request from that system, in other embodiments, one or more of the document servers  may provide documents  to a system (such as the document aggregation system ) when other criteria is satisfied. For example, one or more of the document servers  may, in at least some embodiments, be configured to periodically provide documents  to the document aggregation system . For example, a document server  may periodically send to the document aggregation system  any documents  which have been posted since the document server  last sent documents  to the document aggregation system  (i.e. it may send new documents ).","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may access the documents  on the document servers  in other ways. For example, in at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may include web scraping and\/or crawling features. In such embodiments, the document aggregation system  may automatically navigate to a URL associated with a document server  and may index and\/or retrieve one or more documents  associated with that document server .","In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may be of the type described in United States Publication Number 2011\/0093464 A1 which was filed Aug. 17, 2010 and entitled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GROUPING MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA,\u201d the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The document aggregation system  may include a number of systems, functions, subsystems or modules apart from those specifically discussed herein. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation system  also includes a web-interface subsystem (not shown) for automatically generating web pages which permit access to documents  in the document clusters  and\/or provide other information about such documents . The other information may include a machine-generated summary of the contents of the documents .","The web-pages which are generated by the web-interface subsystem may provide access to documents  in document clusters  determined by the document aggregation system . More particularly, the web-pages may display document clusters  or information associated with document clusters. Each document cluster  may represent a story. A user may select a story via the webpage by selecting a document cluster  (or by selecting other information associated with a document cluster ) and documents  associated with that document cluster  may then be displayed (or information associated with those documents  may be displayed).","In at least some embodiments, the web-interface subsystem (not shown) is configured to generate web pages based on scores assigned to each of a plurality of the document clusters . More particularly, as will be explained in greater detail below, in at least some embodiments, a document cluster ranking system  may be configured to score each of a plurality of the document clusters. In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  may do so by assigning a score, such as a comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score  to a document cluster  and\/or by assigning a rank, such as an overall document cluster rank  to each of a plurality of document clusters. The document cluster ranking system  may assign such scores and\/or ranks to a plurality of document clusters . For example, the document cluster ranking system  may, in at least some embodiments, assign a document cluster rank, comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score  to each document cluster  obtained by the document aggregation system . The overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and independently-generated-score  are measures of the importance of a document cluster . That is, the scores and ranks are metrics which describe the importance of the document cluster  as perceived by the document cluster ranking system . These scores and ranks will be discussed in greater detail below.","In at least some embodiments, the comparatively-generated-score  is a score which is obtained based on values associated with a feature for more than one document cluster. That is, when determining a comparatively-generated-score for one of the document clusters , the document cluster ranking system  considers values for features for other document clusters (i.e. document clusters which are not the document cluster for which a score is currently being determined). In at least some embodiments, the comparatively-generated-score differs from the independently-generated-score in that the independently-generated-score does not consider values for features for other document clusters. That is, when determining the independently-generated-score for a document cluster, the document cluster ranking system  does not consider the values for features for document clusters apart from the document cluster which is currently being scored. The overall document cluster ranks may be obtained based on the comparatively-generated-score , the independently-generated score , or both.","Accordingly, in at least some embodiments, the web-interface subsystem may generate one or more web-pages based on the overall document cluster ranks , comparatively-generated-scores  and\/or independently-generated-scores  for a plurality of the document clusters . For example, in some embodiments, the web-pages may display identification data for document clusters  having a higher relative overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score  more prominently than identification data for document clusters  having a lower relative overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score . For example, in at least some embodiments, the generated web-pages may display identification data for document clusters  having a higher relative overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score  at a higher relative position than identification data for document clusters  having a lower relative overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score .","Accordingly, in some embodiments, the document aggregation system  may allow public access to documents  in a document cluster . In some such embodiments, the document aggregation system  provides such access by generating web pages which are accessible through a network  such as the Internet. The web pages may visually represent the relationship of documents by subject matter. For example, the web pages may display related documents, portions of related documents and\/or or links to related documents (i.e. documents  in the same document cluster ) on a common web page to indicate that such documents are related. Such related documents, portions and\/or links may be displayed in close proximity to one another to visually represent the fact that the documents are related to one another.","In at least some embodiments, in order to produce an overall document cluster rank  for a document cluster , the document cluster ranking system  may first obtain a comparatively-generated-score  and\/or an independently-generated-score  for the document cluster . The document cluster ranking system  may then obtain the overall document cluster rank  based on the comparatively-generated-score  and\/or an independently-generated-score . The document cluster ranking system  and methods of scoring and ranking document clusters  will be described in greater detail below with reference to .","The document cluster ranking system  is, in at least some embodiments, directly coupled to the document aggregation system  via wired or wireless communication interfaces. In other embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  and the document aggregation system  are connected via a network , such as the Internet.","The document cluster ranking system  and\/or the document aggregation system  may in various embodiments, include more or less subsystems and\/or functions than are discussed herein. It will also be appreciated that the functions provided by any set of systems or subsystems may be provided by a single system and that these functions are not, necessarily, logically or physically separated into different subsystems. For example, in at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  and the document aggregation system  may be a single system which provides both document aggregation capabilities and also document cluster ranking capabilities. Such a system may be referred to as a document cluster ranking system  or a document aggregation system  since both document cluster ranking capabilities and document aggregation capabilities are provided.","Accordingly, the term document cluster ranking system  as used herein includes standalone document cluster ranking systems which are not, necessarily, part of a larger system, and also document cluster ranking systems  which are part of a larger system or which include other systems or subsystems. The term document cluster ranking system , therefore, includes any systems in which the document cluster ranking methods described herein are included.","Furthermore, while  illustrates one possible operating environment  in which the document cluster ranking system  may operate, it will be appreciated that the document cluster ranking system  may be employed in any system in which it may be useful to rank groups of documents.","Example Document Cluster Ranking System","Referring now to , a block diagram of an example document cluster ranking system  is illustrated. The document cluster ranking system  includes a controller, comprising one or more processor  which controls the overall operation of the document cluster ranking system .","The document cluster ranking system  includes a memory  which is connected to the processor  for receiving and sending data to the processor . While the memory  is illustrated as a single component, it will typically be comprised of multiple memory components of various types. For example, the memory  may include Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), a Solid State Drive (SSD), Flash Memory, or other types of memory. It will be appreciated that each of the various memory types will be best suited for different purposes and applications.","The processor  may operate under stored program control and may execute software modules  stored on the memory . In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  also functions as a document aggregation system  (). In such embodiments, the modules  may include a document aggregation module  which is configured to perform the functions of the document aggregation system . Example functions of the document aggregation system  are discussed above. In at least some embodiments, the document aggregation module  is configured to obtain a document cluster . The document cluster  may, for example, include a plurality of documents  which are determined by the document aggregation module  to be related to one another. For example, the document aggregation module  may find a plurality of documents  which are all related to the same subject matter.","In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  includes a document cluster ranking module . The document cluster ranking module  is configured to assign an overall document cluster rank , a comparatively-generated-score  and\/or an independently-generated-score  to a document cluster . The overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated-score  and\/or independently-generated-score  are measures of the level of importance of the document cluster . The level of importance may depend, for example, on one or more features related to the document cluster . For example, the level of importance may depend on the number of documents  in the document cluster , the freshness of the documents  in the document cluster  (i.e. whether the documents  in the document cluster  are relatively new), or other features related to the document cluster . Examples features will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some embodiments, in order to produce an overall document cluster rank  for a document cluster , the document cluster ranking system  may first obtain a comparatively-generated-score  and\/or an independently-generated-score . The comparatively-generated-score  may be determined based on a different feature or a different set of features than the independently-generated score . For example, in at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking module  may determine the comparatively-generated-score  based on the volume of documents in the document cluster  and the document cluster ranking module  may determine the independently-generated-score  based on the freshness of the documents  in the document cluster. Then, the document cluster ranking system  may obtain the overall document cluster rank  based on the comparatively-generated-score , the independently-generated score , or both.","The document cluster ranking module  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to . More particularly, methods of generating a comparatively-generated-score  will be discussed below with reference to  methods of generating an independently-generated-score  will be discussed below with reference to .","In at least some embodiments, the overall document cluster ranks , comparatively-generated scores , and\/or independently-generated-scores  are used to determine how prominently a document cluster  and\/or the documents  in that document cluster  will be displayed. For example, when document clusters  (or information about document clusters ) are displayed in a web page, the document clusters  may be ordered according to their respective scores and\/or ranks. A document cluster  with a relatively higher overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated score , and\/or independently-generated-score  may be displayed higher on a web page than a document with a relatively lower overall document cluster rank , comparatively-generated score , and\/or independently-generated-score .","The document clusters , documents , overall document cluster ranks , comparatively-generated-scores , and\/or independently-generated-scores  may, for example, be stored in a data  area of memory . The document clusters  may include documents , portions thereof, or identifying information regarding documents . That is, in some embodiments, the documents  themselves may be locally stored in the memory  of the document cluster ranking system . In other embodiments, the document clusters  may include pointers or links specifying where such documents  may be found. For example, in some embodiments, the documents  in the document clusters  may be stored on a remote server such as the document servers  of  and the document clusters  may specify the location of the documents  (such as an address associated with the document server  and the location of the documents  on the document server ).","The memory  may also store other data  not specifically referred to above.","The document cluster ranking system  may be comprised of other features, components, or subsystems apart from those specifically discussed herein. By way of example and not limitation, the document cluster ranking system  will include a power subsystem which interfaces with a power source, for providing electrical power to the document cluster ranking system  and its components. By way of further example, the document cluster ranking system  may include a display subsystem for interfacing with a display, such as a computer monitor and, in at least some embodiments, an input subsystem for interfacing with an input device. The input device may, for example, include an alphanumeric input device, such as a computer keyboard and\/or a navigational input device, such as a mouse.","It will also be appreciated that the modules  may be logically or physically organized in a manner that is different from the manner illustrated in . By way of example, in some embodiments, two or more of the functions described with reference to two or more modules may be combined and provided by a single module. In other embodiments, functions which are described with reference to a single module may be provided by a plurality of modules. Thus, the modules  described with reference to  represent one possible assignment of features to software modules. However, such features may be organized in other ways in other embodiments.","Ranking of Document Clusters","Obtaining Comparatively-Generated Score","Referring now to , a flowchart is illustrated of a method  for ranking a document cluster . The document cluster  includes one or more related documents .","The method  includes steps or operations which may be performed by the document cluster ranking system . In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  may include a memory  (or other computer readable storage medium) which stores computer executable instructions which are executable by one or more processor  and which, when executed, cause the processor to perform the method  or a portion thereof. In some example embodiments, these computer executable instructions may be contained in one or more module  such as, for example, the document cluster ranking module  and\/or the document aggregation module . That is, in at least some example embodiments, one or more of these modules  (or other software modules) may contain instructions for causing the processor  to perform the method  of .","In the embodiment of , the document cluster ranking system  scores one or more document clusters  based on one or more features related to the document clusters . A document cluster  may have a value (or other quantifier) associated with one or more features. That is, one or more of the features which are used to score and rank a document cluster  may be a numeric feature which may be represented by one or more numbers.","In some embodiments, one of the features used to score and\/or rank the document clusters  may represent the number of documents  in a document cluster . Such a feature may be referred to as a number-of-documents-feature. That is, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to score a document cluster  based on the volume of that document cluster  (i.e. the number of documents). In such embodiments, the value associated with the number-of-documents-feature for a document cluster may be an integer number which quantifies the number of documents. In embodiments in which a number-of-documents-feature is used, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to prefer document clusters  which include a greater number of documents to document clusters  which include a lesser number of documents. That is, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to provide a higher score to a document cluster if that document cluster  has a relatively high number of documents than if the same document cluster  has a relatively low number of documents.","In at least some embodiments, one of the features used to score and\/or rank the document clusters  may be a measure of the portion of the documents in the document cluster which are blog posts. Such a feature may be referred to as a blog-post-portion-feature. That is, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to score a document cluster  based on the blog-ratio of that document cluster . In such embodiments, the value associated with the blog-post-portion-feature for a document cluster  may be a number which represents the ratio of the number of documents in the document cluster  which are blogs to the total number of documents  in the document cluster  or which represents the ratio of the number of documents  in the document cluster  which are blogs to the number of documents  in the document cluster  which are not blogs. It at least some embodiments, the blog-ratio may be expressed as a percentage. In at least some embodiments, the blog-ratio may be expressed as a fraction. In other embodiments, the value associated with the blog-post-portion-feature for a document cluster  may be the number of blog posts in the document cluster . That is, an integer may be used.","In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  is configured to prefer stories (i.e. document clusters) which generate a buzz in the blogosphere (i.e. which have a large number of blog posts). Accordingly, in embodiments in which a blog-post-portion-feature is used, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to prefer document clusters  which include a greater number of blog posts to document clusters  which include a lesser number of blogposts. That is, the document cluster ranking system  may be configured to provide a higher score to a document cluster if that document cluster  has a relatively high number (or portion) of blog posts than if the same document cluster  has a relatively low number (or portion) of blog posts.","In at least some embodiments, one of the features used to score and\/or rank the document clusters  may be a measure of the number of the documents  in the document cluster  which are comments (such a feature may be referred to as a comment-quantity-feature). Comments  may, in at least some embodiments, be documents  which are user-generated posts which are input within an interface which allows a user to comment about a primary document (such as a news article or blog). The document cluster ranking system  may be configured to score a document cluster  based on the number of comments which are associated with that document cluster . In such embodiments, the value associated with the comment-quantity-feature may be an integer number which represents the total number of comments included in the document cluster . In other embodiments, the value associated with the comment-quantity-feature may be a ratio or percentage. For example, the value associated with the comment-quality-feature may be a ratio of the number of the number of documents in the document cluster  which are comments to the total number of documents  in the document cluster  or a ratio of the number of documents  in the document cluster  which are comments to the number of documents  in the document cluster  which are not comments.

In at least some embodiments, the value associated with the comment-quantity-feature may be expressed as a fraction or a decimal number.","In at least some embodiments, the document cluster ranking system  is configured to prefer stories (i.e. document clusters) which are talked about. That is, the document cluster ranking system  is configured to prefer stories (i.e. document clusters) which have a relatively large number of comments.
