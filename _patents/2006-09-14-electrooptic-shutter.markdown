{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","Not applicable.","The present disclosure relates to electro-optic shutters, and more specifically to a shutter using a Pockels cell.","The high intensity light in a laser pulse can damage the human eye to such an extent that permanent blindness occurs. Laser pulses can also damage electronic imaging or sensor devices. Using a shutter device to block a laser pulse is difficult because of the quick transient time of the optical pulse, on the order of milliseconds down to nanoseconds. The short response time makes mechanical shutters unworkable for laser pulses. Chemical dye-based shutters have a faster response time, but do not provide enough attenuation to protect against laser pulses. Electro-optic shutters have a quick response time and good attenuation, but conventional designs do not extinguish light evenly over the extent of the electro-optic element. Therefore, an improved electro-optic shutter is needed.","The invention is summarized in an electro-optic shutter including: an electro-optic element; a first polarizer; a second polarizer; and a pair of electrodes. The electro-optic element operates as a half wave plate when a voltage V is applied to the element, and has two opposing transverse surfaces. The first polarizer is disposed adjacent to one transverse surface of the electro-optic element and has a first transmission axis. The second polarizer is disposed adjacent to the other transverse surface of the electro-optic element and has a second transmission axis different than the first transmission axis. Each electrode is disposed on one of the transverse surfaces of the electro-optic element and has an electric field which is substantially uniform over the transverse extent of the electro-optic element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","130","110","120","130","110","110"],"sub":"7"},"Polarizers (, ) are located on either side of Pockels cell .

A voltage source (not shown) applies a voltage between electrodes  and .

However, a person of ordinary skill in the art should understand that some amount of light will be transmitted through improved electro-optic shutter, where the amount depends on the extinction available from the crossed polarizers and on how quickly the device begins to block light.","In alternative embodiment, improved electro-optic shutter is \u201cnormally on\u201d. That is, light is blocked by improved electro-optic shutter unless voltage V is applied to electrodes  and . In this normally-on configuration, the two linear polarizers have perpendicular, rather than parallel, transmission axes. Pockels cell  rotates the axis of polarization 90\u00b0 as long as voltage V is applied to electrodes  and . Light exiting Pockels cell  has a polarization vector parallel to the second linear polarizer (since the second polarizer has a transmission axis 90\u00b0 to the first polarizer), and therefore passes through the second linear polarizer.","The normally-off configuration provides for a transparent shutter if the power fails, which may be desirable for some applications. The normally-on configuration, which provides for a blocked shutter if the power fails, offers features which may be desirable for other applications. The normally-off configuration uses less power compared to the normally-on configuration, and field uniformity is not an issue.","The electro-optic effect of Pockels cell  will now be described in more detail. Pockels cell  exhibits a linear electro-optic effect such that birefringence occurs when the cell is placed in an electric field. The induced birefringence is proportional to the applied electric field. The induced birefringence is due to the deformation of the indicatrix (index ellipsoid) caused by the applied field. In order to describe how the indicatrix changes in the presence of an electric field, it is first desirable to define a reciprocal dielectric tensor:\n\n\u03ba=\u2208\u00b7(\u2208)\u2003\u2003(Equation 1)\n\nwhere \u2208is the permittivity of free space and \u2208is the relative dielectric permittivity tensor. Note that underlined boldfaced symbols denote tensors (\u03ba, r, \u2208) the boldface symbols denote vector quantities (E), whereas regular type denotes a scalar quantity (n, n, x, y, z). The indicatrix in the coordinate system of the principal dielectric axes is then defined as shown in Equation 2:\n\n()+()+()=1\u2003\u2003(Equation 2)\n","Equation 3 describes the normalized indicatrix without an external electric field applied:\n\n1\u2003\u2003(Equation 3)\n","When a strong external electric field E is applied, the indicatrix is distorted; the length of the principal axes is modified and the orientation of the indicatrix is also modified:\n\n\u03ba\u2032=\u03ba+\u2003\u2003(Equation 4)\n\nwhere r is the Pockels electro-optic tensor. The indicatrix is renormalized to the new field:\n\n1\u2003\u2003(Equation 5)\n","The sum of the changes in \u03ba due to the external field can then be written as:\n\n\u0394\u03ba=\u2003\u2003(Equation 6)\n","The expanded form of Equation 6 for a tetragonal group  m crystal (using Hermann-Mauguin notation) includes KDP and its isomorphs.

In , the orientation of crystal axes in a practical device is shown. In the presence of an applied field, the indicatrix changes and the x and y axes are rotated to x\u2032 and y\u2032.\n","The incident light polarized parallel to x, can be resolved into two orthogonal components parallel to x\u2032 and y\u2032, oriented 45\u00b0 to either side of the x-axis of the crystal. The crystal is customarily cut in a z-cut configuration, meaning that the incoming light travels down the z-axis of the crystal. One component x\u2032 is advanced by \u03bb\/4 and the y\u2032 component is delayed by \u03bb\/4. The result is a total phase difference of \u03bb\/2, which rotates the incoming polarization 90\u00b0.","The phase shift \u0394\u03c6 that occurs if light is passed through the crystal in the direction of the applied electric field can also be written as:\n\n\u0394\u03c6=2\u03c0\u2003\u2003(Equation 10)\n\nwhere \u0394\u03c6 is the phase shift (in radians) of the light of wavelength \u03bb(units of m); nis the refractive index (dimensionless quantity) of the Pockels medium at wavelength (units of m); ris the particular electro-optic constant for the Pockels material (units of m\/V); and V is the applied voltage (units of V).

Each photodetector  is coupled to voltage source  in such a manner that detection of light by that detector  triggers voltage source  to produce a voltage pulse at voltage V, which scales linearly with the wavelength \u03bb.
