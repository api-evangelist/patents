{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to electronic commerce (e-commerce) and, more particularly to electronically sharing technical information among suppliers, manufacturers and customers of a particular product development chain.","2. Background Description","In any large industry, such as the food industry, manufacturers purchase raw materials from suppliers, process the raw material to produce goods and, sell finished goods to customers. At each stage during production, volumes of data may be generated for different products, e.g., how to solve a particular manufacturing problem or, the best way to store the product. Specifications may be generated for finished products and advance sheets may be available for planned products. Since one manufacturer's finished product may be the next manufacturer's raw material, passing some or all information collected on the product may be important to both parties.","Further, audits may be required to be done on one product several times. Each audit may be at considerable expense to the party being audited. Typically, audit results are not generally available.","Currently, the food industry does not have a centralized repository that provides an all-encompassing platform for sharing technical information. This omission has created inefficiencies within the food industry because of redundancy and duplication of effort in the management and use of food-related technical information.","Thus, there is a need for providing suppliers, manufacturers and customers of a particular industry, such as the food industry, with a tool for managing and sharing specifications and other information in a standardized format.","It is therefore a purpose of the present invention to allow sharing of information between suppliers, manufacturers and customers of a large industry;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to improve synergy and efficiency in product development in a large industry;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to provide a collaborative approach to solving industry technical problems;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to share supplier audit results;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to facilitate finding food product related topical information;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to provide a standard format for specifications that will allow sharing of information between suppliers, manufacturers and customers in the food industry;","It is yet another purpose of the present invention to facilitate collaboration on food technology among food manufacturers\/suppliers, food industry service providers and customers.","The present invention is a member accessible information system for managing member information, and selectively providing member information to individual members. The members, typically belong to a common industry, such as the food industry and connect through remotely connected networked computers, such as over the Internet. Members may be food industry members including suppliers, manufacturers and customers, each accessing information supplied by members and maintained by the system. Members may search through previously authorized member provided information. The system includes a central storage which may be located on a database server and which stores product information, e.g., food product information and specifications. Members access the system through a web server. A security policy server verifies what product information and which specifications are to be available to each member. Specifications may be stored centrally or, distributed to member locations. An app server stores and selectively executes applications used by members. User security profiles are stored on and managed by a policy server. Each member's security profile indicates the level of authorization of the corresponding member. A personalization server may be included to record user member characteristics, i.e., content viewed by the member, and personalizes content to subsequently automatically make similar content available to the member. An ad server may be included to schedule, serve and track advertising content provided to members. Orders may be generated and placed automatically. Member use may be tracked to generate member bills automatically and bill individual members.","Advantageously, the preferred embodiments of the present invention provide large industries, such as the food industry, with a system having a broad platform for sharing technical information between suppliers, manufacturers and customers of the particular industry. A food product specifications are in a standard format to allow sharing of information between food industry suppliers, manufacturers and customers, thereby facilitating food product related topical information distribution. Thus, the present invention reduces redundancy and duplication of effort within the food industry eliminating inefficiency in management and use of food-related technical information. Food product development synergy and efficiency is improved, providing a collaborative approach to solving food industry technical problems.","Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly,  shows a first preferred embodiment system  with a distributed specification storage, wherein specifications are stored, locally, with individual participants. A typical specification includes multiple predefined sections including a header, text, references, and property. The sections each include predefined fields which include basic data types text, number and date. Ordinarily, the system does not have a specification generation workflow component and all specifications that are submitted to the system are complete, final product specifications. It should be noted that although the preferred embodiments are described hereinbelow with reference to the food industry, this is for example only and not intended as a limitation. Thus, the system and method of the present invention may be applied any appropriate industry, e.g., the medical industry or the drug industry. Also, as used herein, participant refers to any party using or otherwise participating in the use of the system, including, but not limited to manufacturers, suppliers, service providers and any customers thereof. Further, user and participant are used interchangeably unless otherwise indicated.","So, participating manufacturers and suppliers at local terminals , , , and  post the uniform resource locator (URL) of extensible Markup Language (XML) web pages ,  , ,  making related relevant information available over the network , e.g., the Internet. Local terminals , , ,  may each be a personal computer (PC), a network computer or the participant's server. The system  includes an XML Crawler and Search Engine  searching posted specifications and other information available from industry sources. Individual participants access the central site or the system through a Firewall . All specifications that are accessible from the central site are XML documents and, in this embodiment, are stored on participant's web servers, e.g., , ,  or , at participating client locations. Technical information and other related documents are stored, locally, in central storage .","A Web Server  stores static content (e.g., icons, images and unchanging HTML pages) that is available to participants. A suitable Web Server  system is the Netra t1 from Sun Microsystems, with a 360 MHz UltraSparc microprocessor, 512 MB random access memory (RAM), a 2 by 18 GB OS RAID 1 configuration, running Solaris 2.6 and NES. Examples of suitable web servers applications include Apache web server or Netscape Enterprise Server. An App Server  executes functional applications stored thereon, e.g., training modules in PowerPoint, enhanced searching capability. The particular applications are customized as required for the particular on site requirements. A suitable App Server  is a E250 from Sun Microsystems, with two 400 MHz UltraSparc microprocessors, 512 MB random access memory (RAM), a 2 by 18 GB OS RAID 1 configuration, running Solaris 2.6 and NES. Websphere from IBM Corporation and Netscape iPlanet are examples of suitable App Servers .","A Database Server  includes central storage  and manages product information as well as procedures and functions stored therein. Oracle i Enterprise Edition is a suitable database server . Information that may be stored on the database server  includes, for example, links and indexes for XML documents previously found by the crawler, certificates of analysis for various products, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) templates and documents , quality monitoring documents , and various relevant technical papers . Also, product related publications , technical information , governing regulations , ongoing research lists , as well as contact lists  may be included. In addition, audit results  for various products and Kosher\/Halal compliance testing  may be included.","A Security Policy Server  maintains user security profiles in a security database  entered through a Security Administration interface . Security profiles may include such things as company name and position (e.g., marketing representative, buyer, etc.), products supplied or manufactured and any basic requirements. Netegrity Siteminder is suitable Security Policy Server . The Security Policy Server  manages resource access insuring that participating users receive access only to authorized resources while protecting unauthorized resources and application functions.","A Content Server , such as Interwoven or the Vignette Content Server, interfaces between the Web Server  and a Content Management Engine . A Content Administration Interface  allows a content manager, editor and\/or writers to input content that is identified, gathered, organized and prepared for the site. Content may be in the form of text, financial data or images and can include help screen information, section introductions, periodical articles, streaming content, etc. The Content Management Engine  also provides content management, workflow and delivery. Content Management Engine  also interfaces with Personalization Engine\/Server , which personalizes each user's web experience. Content and navigation characteristics dynamically extracted from searches performed by the particular user and adapted for the user. A Personalization Administration interface  allows an administrator to enter, remove or modify personalization as deemed necessary.","An Ad Engine\/Server , e.g., from Engage, manages, schedules, targets, serves and tracks advertising content. Banner ads may be displayed to participants at various points (e.g., upon logging in, during use, upon logging out, etc.) For a source of additional income and\/or to help defray operating costs. Accordingly, an Ad Administration interface  is included for providing advertisements and administering to ad content.","Web Server Logs  are included for logging and tracking system activity, in particular for tracking member\/participant use and in generating bills based on such use. A search engine  with full indexing and search capability is included for searching documents stored in the central site and, in particular, in the central storage  through the App Server . The Verity Information Server is a suitable search engine . Also, a Custom Functionality Administration Interface  is included for selectively administering to system unique features provided in custom functional applications of the App Server . Optionally, an e-Procurement Engine interface  may be included for conducting transactions interactively amongst participants. Transactions may include things such as ordering materials (e.g., from an automatically generated bill of materials), selling products, shipping, billing member\/participants and collecting payments electronically. Participants may also be billed for system use.","Regarding XML Crawler and Search Engine , the XML crawler continuously searches for completed XML specification documents and indexes any newly encountered XML documents storing the search results in Index Server . In this first embodiment, the index and links for the XML documents are stored in the Index Server  at the central site; however, as noted above, the actual XML documents are stored on web servers , , ,  of participating clients. So, in response to a search request, the XML search engine searches through indexed documents listed in Index Server , selects documents matching search criteria and retrieves selected XML documents from the particular participant's server , , , . Thunderstone or Ultraseek are a suitable crawler and search engine combination . Participants must provide a local web server (which may also be the participant's point of entry , , ,  to the system) where XML documents are archived and accessible by the XML crawler in order to participate in the first embodiment system .","XML specifications may be manually formatted as XML documents or, generated automatically from a non-XML format specification. Typically, specifications are stored, currently, as text or in a relational database form and parsed information may include sections for a header, a reference, property and text. An application programming interface (API) may be created to perform automatic specification migration from data organized into predefined fields. After parsing data, a participant provides the parsed data in predefined specification textual fields that may include time\/data stamps. The API then converts the parsed data to an XML document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","100","200"]},"Since specifications are stored centrally in this embodiment , the XML crawler and search engine  is unnecessary and, so, is omitted. Further, data is exchanged with participants at local terminals , , ,  through an XML-based API , , , . Thus, in addition to the elements in common with the first embodiment , the second preferred embodiment system includes: an XML-based API , , ,  that allows participating customers\/partners to exchange data; a specification creation tool  that can be useable, especially by smaller businesses, for creating specifications; and, specification storage  for storing specifications in the central database . Participants can transfer their completed specifications in XML format to the central database  using the XML based API.","To compensate for any additional load that must be bourne by the central site, in this second embodiment , two servers may be used for each of the Web Server , the App Server  and the database server . Two servers provide better load distribution for each of the Web Server  and the App Server . Also, two servers operating in parallel are better able to handle the storage demands placed on database server  by centrally storing specifications. In addition, unlike the first preferred embodiment , the second embodiment , also includes an automatic specification generation tool  for participants' convenience. XML specifications are stored in specification storage . Data stored in the central storage  may be parsed in XML parser  for incorporation in XML specifications. Thus, companies that may not own a specification generation tool can automatically create XML specification documents in this embodiment , rather than manually or by other more taxing means as may be necessary in the first preferred embodiment .","The specification generation tool  reads specification data from the original repository and parses the data for each specification into relevant data fields. Parsed data may also be extracted from central storage . Then, XML documents are generated from the parsed data. The format of the XML document is validated. Valid documents are stored in the specification storage .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","128","100","302","304","302","304","124","130","160","170","304","154","302","302","304","154","160","170","300","306","308","200","306","308","302","306","308","306","300","100","200","122","306","308","302","122"]},"Thus, participants individually using terminals , , ,  can log in through the Internet , through Firewall  to web servers , , retrieving stored information and passing documents and other information to the system . Requests for XML related services, such as searches, are passed through web server  to App Server  and then, to XML Crawler and Search Engine . Content management, workflow and characteristics of content tracking are interfaced through web server .","Advantageously, the preferred embodiments of the present invention provide large industries, such as the food industry, with a system having a broad platform for sharing technical information between suppliers, manufacturers and customers of the particular industry. Food product specifications are in a standard format to allow sharing of information between authorized food industry suppliers, manufacturers and customers, thereby facilitating food product related topical information distribution. Audit results may be stored and made available as XML documents, thereby, reducing food product audit costs. Thus, the present invention reduces redundancy and duplication of effort within the food industry eliminating inefficiency in management and use of food-related technical information. Food product development synergy and efficiency is improved, providing a collaborative approach to solving food industry technical problems.","While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing and other objects, aspects and advantages will be better understood from the following detailed preferred embodiment description with reference to the drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
