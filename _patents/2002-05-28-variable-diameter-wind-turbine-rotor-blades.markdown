title: Variable diameter wind turbine rotor blades
abstract: A system and method for changing wind turbine rotor diameters to meet changing wind speeds and control system loads is disclosed. The rotor blades on the wind turbine are able to adjust length by extensions nested within or containing the base blade. The blades can have more than one extension in a variety of configurations. A cable winching system, a hydraulic system, a pneumatic system, inflatable or elastic extensions, and a spring-loaded jack knife deployment are some of the methods of adjustment. The extension is also protected from lightning by a grounding system.

The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The field of the invention relates to wind turbines. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of a variable diameter rotor for wind turbines.","Wind power is one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly methods of producing electrical energy currently available. Wind power can produce major amounts of electrical energy without the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Additionally, wind power is renewable, as opposed to traditional fossil fuel sources of energy.","Modern wind turbines are placed on towers to take advantage of strong winds found higher up in the atmosphere, above the clutter of buildings and trees. Traditionally, rotors are attached by a hub to a low speed shaft leading into a nacelle. Inside the nacelle, a gearbox takes the high torque and low speed of the low speed shaft and converts it to the low torque and high speed of the high-speed shaft. The high-speed shaft drives a generator to produce electrical energy.","The amount of electrical energy generated is based in part on the size of the rotors used by the wind turbine and its relationship to the size of electrical generator. A general rule is that wind energy is proportional to the square of the diameter of the rotor. A second factor that contributes to the amount of electrical energy is the speed of the winds acting upon the rotor. If a large rotor relative to the size of the generator is suddenly acted upon by high winds, it can produce more electricity than the generator can absorb and additionally over stress the structure. Conversely, in a time of low winds, if the rotor is not large enough for the generator, the wind turbine efficiency may be low and the structure will see only a small proportion of its load carrying potential. What is needed is a wind turbine that can adjust to handle varying wind speed conditions in an efficient manner, while attempting to maximize energy capture for a given support structure.","A system and method for adjusting the diameter of a rotor in a wind turbine is described. In one embodiment, a wind turbine rotor is described that comprises a center hub, a first set of aerofoil rotor blades arranged around the center hub, and a first set of aerofoil rotor blade extensions nested inside the first set of aerofoil rotor blades. The first set of extensions are capable of extending an amount less than or equal to the length of the first set of blades by protracting from the first set of blades.","A variable diameter rotor for a wind turbine generator is disclosed. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that these specific details need not be used to practice the present invention. Well-known structures, materials, circuits, processes and interfaces have not been shown or described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.","The variable diameter rotor includes base blades and one or more blade extensions associated with the base blades. The blade extensions move between positions that range from fully extended to fully retracted. In embodiments where blades have more than one blade extension, the blade extensions for a blade may be independent from each other in that various blade extensions for a blade may be more extended or retracted than the other blade extensions for that blade.","In one embodiment, the extension and retraction of rotor blades to increase or decrease rotor diameter, respectively, is based on wind conditions and blade pitch angle. For example, in low winds, the rotor may be fully extended. As the winds increase in speed, the blades may start to pitch and a portion of the rotor blades may be retracted. In high winds, the rotor blades may be fully retracted. Thus, the diameter of the rotor may be increased to increase energy capture in frequently occurring moderate wind speeds (e.g., below rated wind speed) where most of the energy is available. At the same time, the rotor diameter may be reduced in high winds that would cause loads that would otherwise penalize a rotor of relatively large diameter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","100","105"]},"In one embodiment, rotor blades  include aerofoils that nest telescopically within blade sections of greater dimension also using aerofoils, thereby preserving greater rotor efficiency. That is, the rotor blades comprise sections that have the ability to nest a narrow, constant chord or tapered aerofoil section inside a wide airfoil section.","Hub  is attached to a nacelle  by the shaft . The rotation of shaft  is coupled to a gearbox .","An electrical control system  monitors the conditions of the wind turbine, making appropriate adjustments as necessary. The electronic control system  controls a yaw mechanism , which controls the direction of the turbine upon tower . In addition to yaw control, the electronic control system  also controls the pitch mechanism , which control the pitch angle of the rotor blades , the rotational speed of the shaft  and the extension of the rotor blades .","In one embodiment, the diameter of the rotor is adjusted by extending or retracting the blade extensions. In one embodiment, the extension or retraction of blade extensions is performed based on wind speed. The change of rotor diameter compensates for differences in wind speed and turbulence, with a goal being to convert as much wind energy to electrical energy as possible in an efficient manner, while keeping loads within prescribed levels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a\u2013c ","a ","b ","c "]},"In one embodiment, the variable diameter rotor may operate with a larger diameter and higher rating than a baseline fixed diameter turbine and the load is regulated using the pitch system. In one embodiment, a torque factor greater than a conventional baseline turbine (e.g., 1.5 times baseline torque) is used whenever the rotor diameter is at its maximum and a minimum pitch angle (e.g., 1\u00b0) is used for maximum energy capture. Whenever the blade extensions are not fully extended or whenever a command to retract is received, the minimum pitch angle is immediately set to another predetermined value (e.g., 8\u00b0) greater than that used when the rotor diameter is at its maximum. This helps to reduce, and potentially minimize, loads on the system.","There are a number of different techniques for adjusting the rotor diameter. A number of such techniques are shown in \u2013. shows a base blade  with a blade extension , in which the base blade  is attached to the central hub . shows the same base blade  with the extension  fully retracted.

Alternatively, other lightweight compounds may be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["c ","d "],"b":["320","310","310","320","320","310","310","300","320","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["e ","f "],"b":["300","310","330","310","330","310","300","330"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["g ","h ","i ","j "],"b":["315","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["k ","l "],"b":["300","105","315","340","315","300","300","340","315","315"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["m ","n "],"b":["310","300","350","310","300","105","310","310","310","310"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["o ","p ","q ","r "],"b":["360","360","370","105","300","370"]},"Note that \u2013only illustrate the rotor blades only in fully extended or fully retracted positions. However, in operation, the blade extensions may only be partially extended or retracted at times depending, in part, on wind conditions. To that extent, the blade extensions and base blades move relative to each other.","One embodiment of the slider track used to guide a blade extension between extended and fully retracted positions is illustrated in . Blade extension  is guided by one or more bearing tracks  in the interior of the base blade . This movement may be facilitated by the use of slider bearings. An extender root block  is attached to the end of blade extension  closest to the base blade . Bearing pads  are arranged around the extender root block  to facilitate movement on the bearing track . Two support spars straddling blade extension  replace internal center support spars that would be normally used to support the base blade. In one embodiment, the slider bearing may comprise glass-filled PTFE flat sheet material. In an alternate embodiment, anti-friction rolling element, hydrodynamic or hydrostatic bearings are used in place of the slider bearings.","In one additional embodiment, friction guide blocks may be used on the blade extensions  or friction pads at the ends of the base blades  to prevent slippage of blade extension . A set of replaceable seal strips (not shown) between the base blade  and blade extension  prevent wind, snow, and other debris from obstructing the rotor blade retracting or extending.","There are a number of options for a bearing track material and some exemplary materials are as follows:","a) glass\/epoxy structural laminate within a directional surface laminate and no gel coat;","b) phenolic laminate (e.g., Tufnol) facings, which is non-corroding and will act as a failsafe bearing should the PTFE pad become excessively worn; and","c) stainless steel facings, which works well with PTFE, is durable and relatively inexpensive.","Additional bearings within the tip of the base blade may be used to limit any undesirable motion of the extending portion of the blade relative to the base blade. Note that the base blade structure may have to be reinforced to handle the load associated with the sliding blade extension and the slider track.","In one embodiment, a cable winch, as shown in , is used for extending and retracting the extensions . A cable winch  is inserted into the blade base. The cable  (e.g., steel wire rope, braided non-metallic rope) is run through a pulley  attached to the end of the extender root block . Fixed guides are included for cable . A moving cross bar  supports the cable when the extender is fully extended. Cross bar  fastens between the base blade sheer webs to offer support and separation of the cable when the blade extension is deployed. The blade extension is extended using mechanical or inertial force. To keep the extension in place, friction pads may be used. In one embodiment, the winch is sized for the maximum load required to winch against the forces composed of the inertial forces and aerodynamic load at normal operational speeds and guide bearing friction. In one embodiment, the winch is anchored into the base blade on a fabricated frame.","In another embodiment, a cable system may be used in conjunction with one or more pulleys to cause the blade extension to extend as a cable is pulled towards the rotor hub. Furthermore, additional methods of extending and retracting the extension include, for example, but not limited to, a recirculating ball worm screw, a jacking screw, a pneumatic retraction and extension system, and a hydraulic retraction and extension system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["b ","a","b"],"b":"540"},"In one embodiment, the blade extensions can be grounded to protect against strikes by lightning, as shown in . shows a spark gaps model of lightning protection.

A second group of spark gaps  are placed at the cable winch  end of the cable  to provide an electrical connection to the hub casting . The base blade  is protected by a standard tip stud  and bonding conductor  through to the hub casting .

This allows more power to be generated, as shown in , without any increase in gearbox torque. Although the extra energy from this strategy arises from operation in rather high, less frequent wind speeds, it still represents an economic gain as only the turbine electrical system cost increases to accommodate this increased power level operating mode. An important feature of the power curve of the variable diameter rotor is the ability to maintain a high almost constant rotor efficiency in the diameter changing regime due to automatic matching of tip speed ratio and rotor solidity.","As to a relation between torque rating of the drive train and diameters for optimum economics, the key lies in the ability to regulate systems loads almost independent of torque up-rating. Results suggest that about a 30% up-rating in drive train torque (1.3 torque factor) is advantageous (at higher torque factors, the energy increases are diminished by the load regulation strategies). This leads to a power curve shown in . The baseline is the curve with the x's on it.","Load Management","In contrast to conventional wind turbines, the variable diameter rotor may be operated with a relatively larger rotor diameter and higher power. Load regulation may be controlled using appropriate control of pitch system set points and diameter\/speed variation. As torque factor increases, the rotor thrust increases. Even for small increases in torque factor, from 1 through 1.3 to 1.5 (at a 1\u00b0 minimum pitch setting), the increase in rotor thrust may be substantial. To avoid an increase in rotor thrust when increases in torque factor are made, the minimum pitch angle may be increased. For example, the minimum pitch angle may be increased from a more normal 1\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 and 8\u00b0 for torque factors of 1.3 and 1.5.","There is of course some energy penalty associated with increasing the minimum pitch angle. The energy yield increases almost linearly with torque factor in the absence of any load regulation. However, when the pitch setting is adjusted to regulate rotor thrust, the power curves converge at the higher torque factors. Up to a factor of approximately 1.3, there are substantial energy gains with each increment of torque factor, but thereafter little difference.","Although the present invention is described herein with reference to a specific preferred embodiment, many modifications and variations therein will readily occur to those with ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, all such variations and modifications are included within the intended scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a","c "],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","i":["a","r "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 5","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 6","i":["a","b "],"b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 7","i":["a","e "],"b":"7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
