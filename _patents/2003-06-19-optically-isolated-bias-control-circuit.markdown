The present invention can be operated with very high voltage isolation enabled by the use of free-space optics or fiber-optics for the transmission of optical control signals.","Another advantage is the fact that the present invention may provide control signals at DC, whereas simple transformer-based switching control circuits cannot.","Still another advantage is the fact that the present invention may be either self-powered or solar-powered.","Yet still another advantage is the fact that either solar-powered or pulse transformer self-powered bias voltage sources can be bootstrapped together so as to provide increased bias voltage and bias current for switching even higher voltages and higher currents with the same low power optical control signals.","Referring to , a schematic of the present invention is shown. This preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a floating bias voltage source  positive terminal electrically connected in series to the collector of a photo-transistor (Q) . The emitter of Q is connected in series through inductance (L)  to the parallel connected N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET  gate (G) and collector of another photo-transistor (Q) . The emitter of Q is connected to both the MOSFET source (S) and to the negative terminal of the bias voltage source. The bias voltage source  may be either a solar power source or a battery, and with its positive voltage terminal electrically connected in series with a diode D (for solar source) to a parallel connected energy storage capacitor (C)  and low inductance capacitor (C)  which are series connected to the negative voltage terminal of the bias voltage source  (solar powered source or battery). Operation of this embodiment of the present invention requires the illumination of the solar powered source or connection to a battery to achieve the operating voltage across the energy storage capacitor C. When the operating voltage is reached, two complementary \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d light signal pulses are applied to the light sensitive base regions of the photo-transistors Q and Q, respectively. Minimal charge flow is achieved by allowing the active high \u201cON\u201d light signal to be applied in the high state to photo-transistor Q only when the active high \u201cOFF\u201d light signal applied to photo-transistor Q is in the low state (see  \u201cTIMING DIAGRAM\u201d). This prevents the direct shorting of the bias voltage source  (solar power source or battery) through both photo-transistors ,  and reduces the flow of charge required to control the MOSFET  switching circuit. It is important to apply \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d light signal pulses which have minimal rise and fall times to ensure that the MOSFET  is driven as fast as possible through its switching states. Darlington photo-transistors may be used to reduce the rise and fall times of the control pulses. This decreases the time in which the MOSFET  has drain-to-source resistances which can dissipate heat (waste energy), cause the device temperature to increase and possibly damage the MOSFET . It is important to note that the stray capacitance of photo-transistor (Q)  together with the MOSFET  gate capacitance, inductances of the source and drain, and Miller effects will affect the efficiency of operation as a function of frequency and the range of effective switching pulse widths and duty cycles. Switched capacitor circuits can dissipate energy by radiation and generate electromagnetic noise. A properly selected small inductance (L)  in series with the gate can reduce switching losses by appropriately slowing the gate capacitor charging time.","Alternate Embodiment #1","Referring to , a first alternative embodiment of the invention is depicted. The first alternate embodiment of the present invention involves the use of two additional optically isolating photo-transistors Q and Q. This embodiment effectively reverses the polarity of the bias voltage source  applied to the gate-to-source circuit of the MOSFET  in order to force the circuit off as fast as it is forced on. This circuit has enhanced noise immunity due to a negative gate-to-source voltage and may be able to operate with pulses of faster rise and fall times than the embodiment depicted in  with a given gate control voltage, but it requires two additional optically isolating devices.","Referring to , a series connection of either embodiment of the gate bias control circuits (see  or ) is depicted that enables operating voltages greater than a single MOSFET can hold off. The series of gate bias control circuits must receive the complementary light signals in-phase, so that all of the corresponding devices switch \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d simultaneously. \u201cSnubber\u201d circuits, consisting of Capacitors C in series with resistors R  are connected in parallel with the MOSFETs  and function as voltage dividing capacitors that help to prevent damaging excess voltages from occurring on any single MOSFET  during the switching transitions. Metal oxide varistors or other voltage surge suppressors can also be used for this purpose. The present invention can also be adapted to other high input impedance device circuits such as Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) circuits. IGBT devices have higher voltage capabilities with lower \u201con\u201d resistances, but have slower turn-off characteristics than MOSFETs.","Referring to FIG.  and , two different self-powered embodiments of the preferred embodiment of the present invention (see ) are depicted.  uses a pulse transformer  inline with the load impedance. This transformer  does not have to be high voltage isolating because both the primary and secondary windings are connected to the same voltage potential at the source terminal of the MOSFET . This self-powered embodiment is possible if the load is amenable to the small added inductance of the transformer's  primary winding. The center tapped pulse transformer  secondary used in the embodiment depicted in  provides charging currents which flow through the rectifying diodes D and D into the energy storage capacitance . A center-tapped secondary allows charging currents to flow for both \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d switching transitions. A transformer  without a center tap can be used but will then only charge on one direction of the switching transitions. To protect the bias circuit from over-voltage charging if the transformer charging currents become too high, a voltage-limiting device (not shown) such as a Zener diode with a series limiting resistor may be placed in parallel with the energy storage capacitor . The bias voltage source V can have a rechargeable battery, which could be recharged during operation and then, when the circuit is cold started, there will be voltage available to begin pulsed operation and resume recharging. This pulse transforming self-powered embodiment will require a certain minimum pulse frequency to be able to recharge the power supply. The solar self-powered embodiment (see FIG. ), does not have these operational frequency constraints.","Referring to , a schematic of a simple, low cost implementation of the preferred embodiment of  is depicted. This implementation was tested using a load  of two series connected 150 watt, 120 volt, incandescent light bulbs. A parallel connection of three, low cost ($0.39 ea), MTP3N40 N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFETs  (internal freewheel diodes are not shown) were used to drive the test load . These parallel-connected MOSFETs  operated at cool temperatures (to the touch), even without heat sinks, for all but the highest frequency test conditions. MOSFETs connected in parallel can provide high currents to the load impedance than can an individual MOSFET. Two, low cost ($0.16 ea), 4N35 optoisolators  (functional equivalent of Q and Q in , FIG.  and ) provide the isolated signal drive for the complementary gate control. The optoisolators  are driven by +5 volt pulses which produce about 16 mA of current through the 270 ohm series resistors . The bias voltage source  consists of two very small series connected, 6 V, 1.5 mA solar panels (not shown) in parallel with a 22 microfarad tantalum capacitor (C) . A diode (not shown) in series with the solar panels was not used for this implementation but can be added to maintain the voltage on the capacitor C if the light source is removed. The capacitance of C will affect the number of switching cycles which can occur before the voltage falls below the switching threshold. These parts used for this implementation of the invention were readily available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts. The frequency of this implementation was limited to about 10 kHz by the limited drive current of the solar panels. Higher current solar cells or a battery would be able to drive these MOSFETs  to higher frequencies.","Referring to , a photograph of the completed circuit of  is shown.","Referring to , a simple circuit using only four, low cost ($0.10 ea), small signal 2N7000 N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFETs  which generates a typical complementary pulse timing (see FIG. ), including both of the two required small, device dependent (approx. 10 ns in this case), \u201cdead times\u201d, between the complementary pulses. Both complementary pulses are generated from a single input pulse which is of the same duration as the complementary \u201cON\u201d signal output pulse. The \u201cdead\u201d times are useful to achieve minimal charge flow but can be eliminated by pulse timing overlap within the rise and fall times of the \u201cON\u201d and \u201cOFF\u201d signals if very high voltage or very high current switching is needed or when bias noise immunity is more important than bias circuit efficiency.","While the preferred embodiments have been described and illustrated, it should be understood that various substitutions, equivalents, adaptations and modifications of the invention may be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the present invention has been described by way of illustration and not limitation."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00024","num":"00024"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00025","num":"00025"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00026","num":"00026"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00028","num":"00028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00030","num":"00030"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00031","num":"00031"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00032","num":"00032"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":"3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
