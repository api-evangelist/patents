title: Systems and methods for generating a selective distribution of media content feeds
abstract: Aspects relate to systems and methods for generating a selective distribution of media content feeds. A content server can identify a set of mobile video cameras or other sources for delivery to a mobile device, based on a state of motion or orientation of the mobile device. Media content can be collected from video-equipped cellular devices capable of reporting their position, bearing, speed, and other sensor data. In one aspect, the position, bearing, and speed of the mobile device along with similar data for the media sources can be taken into account to generate a media envelope, or included set of media devices, to make available to the user. In one aspect, the selected content can be based on the compass orientation of a sensor in the mobile device. In one implementation, user preferences along with other access criteria can be used to further select content feeds.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application for Patent claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/241,865 filed on 11 Sep. 2009 entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GENERATING A SELECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA CONTENT FEEDS,\u201d the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The present teachings relate to systems and methods for generating a selective distribution of media content feeds, and more particularly, to platforms and techniques for identifying a set of mobile video or other content sources for delivery to a mobile device based on various criteria that can include data from an integrated sensor in the device, such as data from as a position, speed, or direction sensor, data processed or derived from sensor data, user preference data, and\/or other criteria to define the content feeds.","The proliferation of media capture and media playback devices, along with the deployment of advanced wireless services, has increased the range of content delivery and marketing opportunities to cellular telephone and other users. Cellular telephones for instance today are commonly equipped with comparatively high-resolution imaging sensors for imaging or video capture. Today's cellular telephone or other users can uses those capture devices to upload video clips or still images to personal Web pages, social networking sites, school or corporate portals, or other destinations to share video or other media content with friends, family members, colleagues and others.","In existing media sharing platforms, an option can sometimes be provided to filter the content delivered to a mobile device based on a position of the device. For example, geo-tagged video clips can be offered or delivered to a user based on their current location, for instance as reported by a Global Positioning System (GPS) chip built into the cellular device. While location-based services of these types may be useful to restrict the geographic range of offered content, certain limitations on location-based delivery platforms exist.","For one, existing media delivery platforms have no capability to leverage the predictive effect of a user's direction of movement. It may be assumed that media sources that lie within a projected travel path of a mobile device will generally be of potentially greater interest to the user than sources located outside that path. For instance, media feeds from points of interest, such as museums, restaurants, or concerts that lie within a projected travel path of a mobile device may represent events or destinations which the user can reach with relative convenience, and therefore be of greater interest to that user.","For another, the availability, number, and type of media capture devices and services are significant and only increasing. Over time, as a consequence, the number of available video feeds or other content streams surrounding a user's current location can or will eventually become large and difficult to manage, if not overwhelming, to many users in the absence of effective reduction techniques. For another, existing delivery platforms do not discriminate media sources based on the directional orientation, or compass, of the camera or other sensor on a mobile device. That is, media sources that intersect the view field or frustum of a mobile device may be of greater potential interest than sources outside that field of view. For another, the content delivery platforms do not permit a user to discriminate desired feeds based on characteristics of the capture device, such as the model, manufacturer, resolution, or other features of the media capture hardware.","For yet another, content delivery mechanisms that are in use today may not take into account user preferences, such as preferences for certain types of food, music, entertainment, or other preferences, to refine the content selections that may be available to the user, whether within a current geographic zone, or outside their located geographic area. Instead of delivering content based on simple location-based selection options, it may be desirable to provide methods and systems which can receive and apply comparatively more sophisticated and selective access criteria to a potentially large population of media sources, and thereby provide a user more targeted content that is more sharply focused on their content interests, user preferences, preferred hardware identification, view orientation, and\/or projected travel surroundings, among other selection criteria.","One or more implementations of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for generating a selective distribution of media content feeds. Aspects of the present teachings relate to a method of identifying content for delivery to a mobile device, including features of identifying a set of media sources available in a network, and identifying at least a subset of the set of media sources for delivery to the mobile device based on a set of access criteria.

In one or more aspects, the set of access criteria can include at least one of the position, speed, and direction data, the compass orientation data, or a set of static data associated with the set of media sources.","According to one aspect, a mobile device is provided. The mobile device can include features of means for providing a wireless interface to at least one content server via a network, and means for processing data, the means for processing data communicating with the at least one content server via the means for providing wireless interface, the means for processing being configured to capture at least one of (a) position, speed, and direction data for the mobile device, or (b) compass orientation data for a video sensor of the mobile device, and initiate access to at least a subset of a set of media sources available in the network for delivery to the mobile device based on a set of access criteria. In one or more aspects, the set of access criteria can include at least one of the position, speed, and direction data, the compass orientation data, or a set of static data associated with the set of media sources.","One or more aspects of the present teachings relate to a computer program product, including features of computer readable media comprising at least one instruction for causing a computer to generate at least one of (a) position, speed, and direction data for the mobile device, or (b) compass orientation data for a video sensor of the mobile device, and at least one instruction for causing a computer to initiate access to at least a subset of a set of media sources available in a network for delivery to the mobile device based on a set of access criteria. In one or more aspects, the set of access criteria can include at least one of the position, speed, and direction data, the compass orientation data, or a set of static data associated with the set of media sources.","One or more aspects of the present teachings relate to a method of capturing media content via a media source device, including features of capturing at least one type of media content via the media source device, capturing content metadata for the at least one type of media content, the content metadata comprising at least one of (a) position, speed, and direction data for the media source device, (b) compass orientation data for a video sensor of the media source device, (c) a content category type for content captured via the media source device, or (d) a set of static data associated with the media source device.

More particularly, one or more aspects relate to platforms and techniques for identifying, aggregating, and distributing media content from a population of media sources to a mobile device based on a set of advanced criteria that can include sensor data such as the location, travel path, and\/or compass orientation of the subject device. Content selection can further be performed based on sensor data that is processed or manipulated after capture in the device. Content selection can in addition be predicated on static data representing hardware features, brand, or model information of the capture device, as well as on user preferences or profiles associated with the mobile device.","In one or more aspects, a service provider can manage and distribute media to a mobile device based on the sensor-detected location and projected surrounding pathway of that device, selecting media sources located within a defined boundary or range of the location and projected pathway of the mobile device for inclusion in the user's potential media selections. The media sources can be updated based on the reported location, speed, and bearing of the mobile device sensed by an integrated or onboard GPS or other positioning sensor, whose raw and\/or processed data can be used to select sources within a projected travel path. In one or more aspects, the boundary or envelope within which sources of potential interest are identified can be generated as a dynamic function of the speed and other parameters of the mobile device, and\/or as a function of similar parameters of the media sources.","In one or more aspects, in addition to or instead of the location, speed, and bearing of the mobile device, media sources can be selected based on a compass orientation of a video camera or other sensor in the device, as for instance sensed by an electromagnetic compass or other orientation-sensing device. The content delivery platform of the present teachings can capture the orientation or pointing direction of the mobile device and\/or its media sensors, so that media sources toward which the mobile device is pointed can be selected and displayed.","In one or more further aspects, media sources can be selected based on static or hardwired data related to those sources, such as the brand, model, firmware version, video resolution, and\/or other characteristics of the device itself, so that, for instance, video cameras of a preferred brand or with a resolution greater than a certain number of megapixels can be selected within a given travel path or other area.","In still one or more further aspects, media sources can in addition or instead be filtered by user-selected or user-associated preference settings, such as an indication of the categories or types of media content that the user wishes to receive, or based on a social networking group of which the user is a member.","Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Service provider  can communicate with and maintain a media store , such as a database or other data storage resources, to host media  and other information used to deliver selected content to mobile device . In one or more aspects, service provider  can be part of or associated with a network operator or carrier, such as a cellular network service or other service or network.","Mobile device  can be or include any network-enabled mobile device, client, or platform, such as a mobile cellular telephone, a network-enabled personal digital assistant, a network-enabled media player, a laptop computer equipped with a wireless interface such as a Wi-Fi\u2122 or Wi-Max\u2122 interface, or other device. Mobile device  can include a location module , such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) module or circuit, which can capture location fixes or other location-related information for mobile device . Location information captured via location module  can be incorporated in a set of attributes , which in turn can be communicated from mobile device  to location service , and used to discriminate content from set of media sources  for delivery to mobile device .","Set of media sources  can comprise one or more media source device  located throughout a geographic area, in network  in its entirety, and\/or in other networks or storage. Each media source device  can be or include one or more sensors , such as a video camera, a still image camera, a microphone or other audio sensor, and\/or other media capture or input device. In one or more aspects, each media source device  can comprise a location module  of GPS or other type, similar to mobile device . In one or more aspects, each media source device  in set of media sources  can generate, retrieve, or store a set of attributes , including position data recorded by location module , to combine or associate with media  captured via the source's sensor .","Media source device  can upload or transmit the resulting media  and associated set of attributes  to service provider  for distribution to one or more mobile device . In one or more aspects, each media source device  can be programmed or configured to automatically capture and upload media , or can operate to capture media  on a manual or other basis. In one or more aspects, set of media sources  can also or instead include resources that are not themselves media capture devices, such as servers or data stores hosting media captured from other media capture devices.","More particularly, in one or more aspects, the set of attributes  generated for mobile device , and set of attributes  associated with one or more media source device , can generally include sensor data captured from one or more sensors integrated or associated with mobile device . It will be appreciated that sensor data can include a variety of information captured from one or multiple sensors integrated in or connected to one or more media source device  and\/or mobile device . Sensor data can include, for instance, latitude and longitude or other location coordinates generated by location module , as well orientation data captured by a compass sensor. Sensor data can or include other types of information, including for instance vibration, shaking, and\/or acceleration data reported from an accelerometer, sonar data captured by a sonar module, or radar data captured from a radar transponder. Sensor data can further include, merely by way of example, temperature data, altitude data, atmospheric pressure data, spectrographic data, ambient sound level data, force, torque, or axis data, or other types of information related to the physical surroundings of a device hosting or connected to the sensor(s). Sensor data can include other raw, direct, or unprocessed data captured directly from one or more sensor associated with mobile device , one or more media source device , and\/or other devices. In one or more aspects, each of one or more media source device  and\/or mobile device  can contain or utilize more than one sensor.","Set of attributes  can further include processed sensor data that is computed or derived from sensor data, including variables such as speed, acceleration, and\/or bearing of the subject device, which can for instance be derived from raw position data reported by location module . In one or more aspects, the speed, acceleration, and\/or bearing (or direction) of mobile device  and\/or a media source device  can for example be obtained by periodically sampling a location fix generated by location module . In one or more aspects, processed sensor data can be generated by a variety of computational techniques or platforms, including, for example, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and\/or other processing techniques.","Set of attributes  can further include static data related to the characteristics of one or more media source device , mobile device , and\/or other participating hardware client or device. For instance, static data can encode the manufacturer, model identifier, and\/or performance characteristics of one or more media source device . The static data related to a video camera can, for example, include the manufacturer name, model number or other identifier, serial number, operating system, firmware revision, pixel resolution, audio bit resolution, memory size, and\/or other comparatively fixed or hardwired characteristics of those devices that can be associated with the media  delivered from those devices. Viewers can then for instance select or filter for content matching criteria related to the media capture hardware itself, such as video feeds in High-Definition (HD) resolution or other specifications.","The set of attributes  can also include additional information such as user preference, profile, and\/or other configuration data, for instance, a set of keyword tag or tags reflecting a type or category of media which the user of mobile device  wishes or prefers to receive. In one or more aspects, the relationship between set of attributes  for mobile device , as well as the set of attributes  set of media sources , and\/or user-related attributes or preferences and other information, can be used to discriminate media  which may be of particular interest to the user of mobile device , as described herein.","In one or more aspects in various regards, the discrimination of media  can be based on motion characteristics of mobile device  as reported by location sensor data and\/or processed location sensor data, among other information. In one or more aspects according to these regards, service provider  can determine or establish a media envelope  surrounding the projected path of travel of mobile device  to select media  to present to the user of mobile device  as available options for viewing or consumption. Service provider  can likewise employ the compass orientation of mobile device , static data related to one or more media source device , and\/or any associated user preferences to organize, categorize, and ultimately filter media  for presentation to the user of mobile device .","According to one or more aspects in one regard, and as for instance also illustrated in , the set of attributes  associated with mobile device  can comprise sensor data and\/or processed sensor data including the location, speed, bearing, and compass of mobile device , as well as device-related static data and\/or user preferences associated with the user of that device at a given time. When used as part of set of attributes , the location, speed, and\/or bearing data can locate mobile device  within a given geographic area at a given time, and identify the speed and direction of that device in transit.","Service provider  can also analyze a corresponding set of attributes  and data for set of media sources  to identify one or more media source device  located within a media envelope  of mobile device, for potential delivery to mobile device . In one or more aspects, media envelope  can represent a boundary or range surrounding mobile device  within which one or more media source device  of interest to the user of mobile device  may reside. In one or more aspects, the selection of media sources can be based on the projected travel path of mobile device  relative to those media sources. That is, based on the set of attributes  of mobile device , as shown, it may be determined that mobile device  is moving in a northeasterly (e.g., 45 degrees from north) direction at moderate (e.g., 25 mph) speed. (In  and elsewhere, the relative speed of entities including mobile device  may be denoted in vector notation as vor similar, and reflected as an illustrative vector indicating a proportional speed of that device).","Based on that sensor or processed sensor data, as shown, it may be determined that within a forward trajectory of mobile device , at least two media source devices  are present (as shown, e.g., a restaurant and concert site) which may be within an identified travel range and therefore of possible interest to the user of mobile device . The media envelope  can be generated as a regular or irregular boundary associated with the location of mobile device , such as an ellipse projecting forward from the location of mobile device . According to one or more aspects, media envelope  need not be physically or numerically generated as an actual set of boundary points or curve surrounding mobile device , but can be represented as a maximum distance from mobile device  from which content sources may be identified or selected.","More particularly, in one or more aspects, and as shown for example in , in terms of source discrimination based on sensor data and\/or processed sensor data encoding the location, speed, and\/or bearing data for mobile device , the boundary of media envelope  can be configured to dynamically elongate along the axis of motion of mobile device  as a function of the present speed of mobile device . (In , the media source devices in set of media sources  are pictorially shown as small \u201cx\u201d markings, for simplicity). As shown for instance in , media envelope  can be calculated or generated to be a simple circle surrounding mobile device , when for instance mobile device  is stationary, or below a relatively low speed threshold (e.g., below 10 mph or other values). These conditions may pertain for instance when the user of mobile device  is walking.","As shown for instance in , media envelope  can be calculated or generated to adopt a moderately elongated or elliptical shape along a direction of travel of mobile device , when that device is moving at a moderate speed (e.g., up to 25 mph or other values). These conditions may pertain for instance when the user of mobile device  is riding a bicycle. As shown for instance in , media envelope  can be calculated or generated to adopt a somewhat more sharply elongated or elliptical shape along a direction of travel of mobile device , when that device is moving at increased or moderately fast speeds (e.g., 25-55 mph or other values). These conditions may pertain for instance when the user of mobile device  is traveling in a car.","As shown for further instance in , media envelope  can be calculated or generated to adopt a relatively wide circular shape surrounding mobile device , when that device is moving at a relatively high speed (e.g., over 75 mph or other values), such as when the user of mobile device  has boarded a train. In one or more aspects in various regards, during high-speed travel of mobile device , the media envelope  can be set to be large or unlimited, to cause the selected sources to default to all available sources, since location, speed, bearing, and\/or other characteristics may make the relative location of the sources less relevant to the user when traveling at a high rate of speed, since access to nearby points of interest may be impractical.","In scenarios in these regards, when a network-wide or all-available media envelope  is used, and\/or at other times, one or more media source device  can be selected from set of media sources  based on other parts of set of attributes , such as static device data and\/or user preferences, as described herein. In further aspects, the boundary or limits of media envelope  can take on other regular or irregular shapes, contours, or configurations. It may be noted that in one or more aspects, media envelope  can be calculated or generated based on a most-current set of attributes  for mobile device  and\/or set of media sources . In one or more aspects, media envelope  can be dynamically updated or adjusted based on updates to set of attributes  for either mobile device , set of media sources , and\/or both.","Returning to , in terms of source selection based on sensor-detected speed, direction, and\/or bearing, in one or more aspects as shown a media source device  (e.g., installed at an oceanside park or other site) located outside the boundary of media envelope  can be omitted from any set of selected sources from which a traveling mobile device  can receive and view media . For one or more media source device  located within media envelope , service provider  can generate a view or notification, such as a thumbnail view or source identification list, to transmit to mobile device  for potential selection and viewing. The user of mobile device  can therefore be presented with a range of media selections that have been discriminated based on the user's travel path and\/or other set of attributes , compared to those of set of media sources . This discrimination of one or more media source device  based on these criteria results in selected media  which is more closely aligned with the user's potential interests and immediate travel surroundings.","It may be noted that in one or more aspects, besides a projected travel path or travel range, the one or more media source device  can also or instead be selected for delivery to mobile device based on a projected intersection with that source device or devices. That is, in one or more aspects, rather than aggregate each media source device  within a boundary determined by the location, speed, and bearing of mobile device , service provider  can constrain the one or more media source device  presented to the mobile device  to those sources which will actually or substantially intersect the path of mobile device , or intersect within a relatively small margin (e.g., within 100 feet). In one or more aspects, the intersection criteria can be specified by the user of mobile device , and can, for instance, be used to supply media  from sites the user expects to physically encounter.","In one or more aspects in further regards, and as for example shown in , in terms of source selection, in addition to or instead of the location, speed, and bearing of mobile device  and the associated travel path of that device, media sources can be selected for delivery based on a compass orientation of a video camera or other sensor  embedded in mobile device . That is, in one or more aspects as shown, a mobile device  having a video camera or other sensor  can be pointed or trained in a certain compass or rotational direction. In these aspects, the user of mobile device  may be assumed to have greater interest in one or more media source device  located within the three-dimensional field of view, or frustum, of mobile device .","In such aspects, the compass orientation of a sensor in mobile device  can be captured using a magnetic, radio, or other compass module  and incorporated in set of attributes , and transmitted to service provider . Compass module  can for instance comprise a gyroscope, electronic compass, accelerometer, and\/or other sensor. Service provider  can receive the compass data, and in this case identify one or more media source device  (e.g., a sports event as shown) located in media envelope  represented as a three-dimensional section or frustum. The user of mobile device  can likewise then receive a thumbnail, list, or other notification or view of the one or more available media source device  contained within that three-dimensional view or section. In one or more aspects, the media envelope  derived from a compass orientation of mobile device  can be generated without factoring in the location, speed, direction, and\/or other data in set of attributes  for mobile device . In one or more aspects, the media envelope  derived from a compass orientation of mobile device  can be generated while also factoring in the location, speed, direction, and\/or other data in set of attributes  for mobile device . In the latter case, media sources located not just in the projected pathway of the mobile device , but along a compass orientation, or being categorized within preferred content categories, can be selected. Other combinations of content selection criteria are possible. In further aspects, and as for example shown in , again in terms of source selection, in addition to or instead of the projected travel path and\/or compass orientation of mobile device , media sources can be selected for delivery based on a set of user preferences  associated with a user of mobile device .","That is, as for instance shown in more detail in , in one or more aspects as shown, a user of mobile device  can enter or register a set of user preferences  related to the operation of mobile device , and\/or the selection of one or more media source device  within set of media sources . In aspects as shown, set of user preferences  can be or include preferences, filters, specifications, and\/or criteria related to a number of variables including compass orientation, the speed of media sources the user wishes to select, the location\/bearing of media sources, the cost of accessing or viewing media sources, the popularity rating of media sources, media category types, buddy list or other social networking groups, keywords to be matched in the attributes of selected media , and\/or other preferences. In one or more aspects, media categories can be specified in set of user preferences  such as, for instance, celebrity sightings, restaurant locations, musical venues, sports events or stadiums, recreational sites, and\/or other categories or classes of media . In one or more aspects, user preferences  can for instance be entered via a dialogue on mobile device  as shown, or registered through other means, such as the Internet.","In one or more aspects in additional regards, user preferences  can specify hardware characteristics and\/or other fixed or static data related to one or more media source device , set of media sources , and\/or other media capture or delivery hardware or platforms. For instance, a user can specify that they wish to receive video streams captured from cameras made by a certain manufacturer, having a certain pixel resolution or frame rate, having a certain file format, or having other comparatively static characteristics. For further instance, when media  includes audio content, the user can specify that they wish to receive audio feeds from a concert or speech where the audio encoder captures at least sixteen bit audio clips in stereo at 44.1 kHz (compact disc standard), meets other requirements. Other criteria can be used.","In one or more aspects in yet further regards, in may be noted that keywords or other criteria or fields in user preferences  need not be manually entered by the user of mobile device . For instance, a user can operate sensor  of mobile device  to initiate a visual search on a scene they are viewing to retrieve keywords for tagging or search purposes. A visitor to a zoo, for instance, can point sensor  at a panda bear or other animal of interest, initiate a search for similar identified content via service provider , as understood by persons skilled in the art. The user can then retrieve search or keyword matching results for media sources having a content tag of \u201cpanda.\u201d Other types of automated entry or importation of user preferences  can be incorporated or used. For example, user preferences, play lists, and\/or other data collected from the user's social networking profile can be imported or used.","By specifying user preferences  as shown, a user can consequently create filters on their selected media, such as media category types to indicate the types of media or content the user wishes to receive. In one or more aspects, the user as noted can enter a category type or keyword, such as \u201ccelebrity,\u201d and a cost constraint, such as 15 cents, to indicate that the user wishes to potentially view media  generated by a media source device  that is related to a celebrity or other public figure while having a download cost of that amount per download or less. In one or more aspects in these regards, media  generated by set of media sources  can have or receive an associated tag or category type as part of set of attributes  of media , for instance, assigned by an operator of a given media source device  or assigned by service provider .","In one or more aspects, and as likewise shown in , media  generated by a media source device  having a tag or keyword matching one or more of user preferences  associated with mobile device , such as a media feed from a celebrity concert site as shown, can thereby be included or encompassed within media envelope  (here, potentially a function of content rather than strictly position) and transmitted for selection to mobile device  via a thumbnail, list, or other view or notification. In one or more aspects, selection of one or more media source device  based on user preferences  can be generated without factoring in the location, speed, direction, compass orientation, and\/or other data in set of attributes  for mobile device . In one or more aspects, selection of one or more media source device  based on user preferences  can be generated while also factoring in the location, speed, direction, compass orientation, static capture device data, and\/or other data in set of attributes  for mobile device , so that media sources located not just in the projected pathway and\/or frustum of the mobile device , but also containing media  of specified categories, capture device specifications, or other preference types, are selected. Other combinations of content selection or access criteria are possible.","It may be noted that in various implementations, including those involving media selection criteria as illustrated for instance in , service provider  can employ machine learning or feedback systems to learn the viewing or selection patterns of the user of mobile device , and thereby enhance the selection mechanisms used for that user. In one or more aspects, for example, service provider  can maintain a record or log of the user's various media selections under different conditions to identify any habits, preferences, or patterns that may be implicit in the user's media selection behavior. Thus, for instance, if a user regularly selects to view one or more media source device  and related media  that relates to sporting events rather than music, service provider  can configure the delivered media  to include sports-related video feeds or other media  at the top of the user's list of available content. In further aspects, service provider  can track explicit or implicit feedback about user selection patterns to identify which parts of media  presented to the user came closest to the user's interest. Thus, for instance, service provider  can track viewing selections for which the user rarely or never initiates a download, versus selections for which the user immediately or frequently makes a download selection. In one or more aspects, a user dialogue can ask the user to rate media selections for similar purposes. Other learning or selection mechanisms can be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["102","102","402","404","402","418","402","104","106","402","404","406","408","102","410","408"]},"Processor  can analyze set of attributes , media , and\/or other data received by antenna  and\/or processed via a user interface  of the mobile device , and\/or generate set of attributes , media , and\/or other data for transmission by a transmitter  via a modulator .

For instance, the various illustrative logics, logical blocks, modules, devices, and circuits, including personal computers, cellular telephones, media playback devices, and servers, described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with or using a general purpose processor, a digital signal processor (DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general-purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but, in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration. In one or more exemplary implementations, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Also, any connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium. For example, if the software is transmitted from a website, server, or other remote source using a coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, digital subscriber line (DSL), or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave, then the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, twisted pair, DSL, or wireless technologies such as infrared, radio, and microwave are included in the definition of medium. Disk and disc, as used herein, includes compact disc (CD), laser disc, optical disc, digital versatile disc (DVD), floppy disk, and blu-ray disc where disks usually reproduce data magnetically, while discs reproduce data optically with lasers. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media. The steps of a method or algorithm described in connection with the implementations disclosed herein may be embodied directly in hardware, in a software module executed by a processor, or in a combination of the two. A software module may reside in RAM memory, flash memory, ROM memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. An exemplary storage medium is coupled to the processor, such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. The processor and the storage medium may reside in an ASIC. The ASIC may reside in a user terminal. In the alternative, the processor and the storage medium may reside as discrete components in a user terminal For further example, while implementations have been described where mobile device  communicates with a single service provider  to register and receive selective media content feeds, In one or more aspects, mobile device  can communicate with multiple servers or other resources to receive media  and associated information. For still further example, while implementations have been described where device location and other data is encoded within a location-enhanced uniform resource locator (URL) , in one or more aspects other encodings or interfaces, such as sockets, ports, application programming interfaces (APIs), can communicate location-related attributes and other data. Other resources described, as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed, and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined.
