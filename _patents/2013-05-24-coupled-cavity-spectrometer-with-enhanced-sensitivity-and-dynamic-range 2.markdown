title: Coupled cavity spectrometer with enhanced sensitivity and dynamic range
abstract: A coupled-cavity ring-down spectrometer utilizes an optical resonator to increase the reflectivity of ring-down cavity mirrors by adding external optical cavities that recycle light to the main cavity. These input and output cavities are made up of at least one coupling mirror and at least one movable recycling mirror. The movable recycling mirrors are coupled to at least one piezoelectric transducer, which generates movement of the recycling mirrors. The coupled-cavity ring-down configuration achieves higher spectrometer finesse, sensitivity and dynamic range.

The detection limit may be expressed as (u(tau)\/<tau>)*\u03c0\/(Finesse). Where u(tau) is the uncertainty (one standard deviation) of the measured time constant, and <tau> is the mean value of the measured time constant.","As used herein, the term \u201cdisplacement\u201d means the difference in position of the recycling mirror due to the change in angle of reflection.","As used herein, the term \u201cdynamic range\u201d means the range of the largest to smallest absorption strength signal as achieved by the overall reflectivity range achieved by a CRDS.","As used herein, the term \u201cetalonging\u201d means the effect interference between unwanted reflections from external optical elements back to the ring-down cavity.","As used herein, the term \u201cfinesse\u201d is a dimensionless measurement of the lifetime of the photon in the resonator that indicates the sensitivy of the resonator, and as the sensitivity increases the finesse value increases.","As used herein, the term \u201cpiezoelectric transducer\u201d (PZT) means a device that provides micrometric linear translation or which actuates or displaces a recycling or feedback mirror and all functionally equivalent devices.","As used herein, the term \u201crecycling mirror\u201d refers to a mirror external to the optical component that reflects light back into a cavity.","As used herein, the term \u201creflectivity value\u201d means a numeric value signifying the amount of light reflected from a mirror. A reflectivity value may be varied by positioning a mirror or according to the manufacturing specifications for the mirror.","As used herein, the term \u201csensitivity\u201d means a value reflecting the smallest quantity of change per unit length that a system is capable of measuring. There is an inverse relationship between sensitivity and finesse.","As used herein, the term \u201ctime constant\u201d is a time quantity which reflects the photon decay lifetime.","An optical cavity resonator is an arrangement of mirrors that forms a standing wave cavity for resonating light waves.","Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a highly sensitive optical spectroscopic technique that enables very precise measurement of samples that scatter and absorb light. CRDS is used to study gas, liquid, and dispersed aerosol samples which absorb light at specific wavelengths. CRDS can be used to determine mole fractions of analytes down to the parts per trillion level.","A CRDS setup measures how long it takes for the light to decay to 1\/e of its initial intensity, and this \u201cring-down time\u201d can be used to calculate the concentration of the absorbing substance present in the cavity. The laser is then turned off in order to allow the measurement of the exponentially decaying light intensity leaking from the cavity. During this decay, light is reflected back and forth thousands of times between the mirrors, giving an effective path length for the extinction on the order of a few kilometers.","A typical CRDS setup consists of a laser and one or more highly reflective mirrors (generally two). The mirrors are placed in optical communication with each on opposite sides of a high-finesse optical cavity. If a sample placed in a cavity absorbs light, the amount of light decreases faster and the photon life is decreased.","The finesse of an optical cavity is represented as the total phase change (in radians) of the oscillating electromagnetic wave (i.e. the laser beam) over the time that the beam is trapped in the resonator. One exemplary equation that may be used to represent finesse is: 2\u03c0 (effective path length)\/(round-trip path length). Finesse equals \u03c0\/(1\u2212R) where R is the intensity reflectivity of the ring-down cavity mirror.","It is desirable to maximize the finesse value of an optical cavity in order to maximize the time a beam is trapped in the resonator, referred to as the photon lifetime. The longer the photon lifetime, the more sensitive the measurement.","In addition to finesse there are several other key performance parameters of a CRDS system known in the art. These measurements include wavelength coverage, dynamic range, detection limit, and sensitivity.","CRDS systems may be configured for specific experimental needs by structurally altering attributes including: (1) distance between mirrors in optical cavity; (2) the angle of reflection of each mirror; (3) the number of mirrors in a cavity; and (4) the preselected reflectivity value of each mirror. It is also known in the art to use dielectric films to increase the reflectivity value.","One problem known in the art is that mirrors for CRDS applications are custom manufactured and have preselected reflectivity value depending on the experimental application for which they are used. The reflectivity value cannot be readily altered after manufacturing resulting in a need for numerous custom mirrors to perform exacting experimentation techniques.","Another problem known in the art is that custom mirrors generally have an upper bound on their reflectivity. Additionally, commercially available mirrors generally have a maximum reflectivity value of 0.99999.","It is desirable to increase the maximum attainable reflectivity values available during an experimental process to allow CRDS measurements to be performed over a wider range of physical conditions.","It is further desirable to increase the key performance parameters attainable by a CRDS system known in the art, including finesse wavelength coverage, dynamic range, detection limit, and sensitivity.","The present invention uses controlled feedback of the probe laser beam to a ring-down cavity, which leads to interference between the internally circulating light and that which is fed back through one or more coupled cavities mirror ports. The channeled use of the interference (etaloning) alters the finesse of the optical resonator in a controlled and quantifiable manner. A coupled cavity component may be used for each primary ring-down mirror. In various embodiments the number of coupled cavities may be equal to or less than the number of primary ring-down mirrors used in standard ring-down cavity.","The coupled cavity configuration enhances the performance of a spectrometer by increasing the finesse of an optical resonator. The invention reduces interferences known as etalons that cause u(tau) to increase. As u(tau) decreases, so does the detection limit.","The coupled cavity configuration increases the key performance parameters of wavelength coverage, dynamic range, detection limit, and sensitivity.","The invention achieves 10- to 40-fold lower detection limits and 20-fold wider range of concentration. The invention more than doubles the wavelength coverage for a given set of mirrors. The invention enables laser-based spectrometer methods to be applied over a wider range of physical conditions than with current technology. Exemplary applications include rare and multiple substituted isotopologues CO, CO O; measurement of ultra-low concentrations (<1 part-per-trillion) of gases, aerosols, and nanoparticles in environmental monitoring or green house gases and other trace gas and high-purity gas montioring.","For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the present invention, references are made in the text to exemplary embodiments of a coupled-cavity ring-down spectrometer, only some of which are described herein.

The absorption coefficient of the cavity medium is inferred by measuring small changes in the ring-down time, and its limit of detection is nominally equal to \u2208TL. Here \u2208, whose magnitude is influenced by statistical effects such as signal strength and detector and digitizer noise, is the relative standard uncertainty in the measured ring-down time . Long-term averaging of to improve measurement precision is often limited by uncertainty and variability in the base losses T\u00d7L()that are caused by interference involving unwanted reflections from external optical elements back to the ring-down cavity  (RDC).","This effect, known as etaloning, increases in importance as R approaches unity. Etaloning leads to an effective RDC mirror reflectivity, R, that can be greater or less than that of the isolated mirror. In CRDS and other cavity-enhanced experiments, etaloning is manifest by slow temporal variation and sinusoidal wavelength dependence in . This occurs because the effective base losses are sensitive to uncontrolled variations in the phase of the optical feedback (from external cavities) that are caused by drift in\\the relevant optical path lengths.","In the exemplary embodiment shown, a voltage applied to PZT actuator  allows for displacement of input feedback mirror and output feedback mirror to occur. The ring-down cavity time constant is calculated from the etaloning between the input dichroic beam splitter (DBS) mirror and output dichroic beam splitter (DBS) mirror and the first primary ring down mirror  and secondary primary ring down mirror .
