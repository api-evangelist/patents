No. 60\/882,270 filed Dec. 28, 2006 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","This invention relates to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, ways to make them and methods of treating patients using them.","Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) is essential for facilitating DNA repair, controlling RNA transcription, mediating cell death and regulating immune response. This activity makes PARP inhibitors targets for a number of disorders. PARP inhibitors have shown utility for treating diseases such as ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammatory disease, retroviral infections, ischemia reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, stroke and other neural trauma, organ transplantation, reperfusion of the eye, kidney, gut and skeletal muscle, arthritis, gout, inflammatory bowel disease, CNS inflammation such as MS and allergic encephalitis, sepsis, septic shock, hemmorhagic shock, pulmonary fibrosis, and uveitis, diabetes and Parkinsons disease, liver toxicity following acetominophen overdose, cardiac and kidney toxicities from doxorubicin and platinum-based antineoplastic agents and skin damage secondary to sulfur mustards. PARP inhibitors have also been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing cell death of cancer cells, limiting tumor growth, decreasing metastasis, and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing animals. There is therefore a need in the therapeutic arts for PARP inhibitors.","One embodiment of this invention, therefore, pertains to compounds that inhibit the activity of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and

Biotinylated histone H1 was prepared by treating the protein with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin from Pierce (Rockford, Ill.). The biotinylation reaction was conducted by slowly and intermittently adding 3 equivalents of 10 mM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin to 100 \u03bcM Histone H1 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 4\u00b0 C. with gentle vortexing over 1 minute followed by subsequent 4\u00b0 C. incubation for 1 hour. Streptavidin coated (FLASHPLATE PLUS\u00ae) microplates were purchased from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, Mass.).","PARP1 assay was conducted in PARP assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 4 mM MgCl. PARP reactions contained 1.5 \u03bcM [H]-NAD (1.6 uCi\/mmol), 200 nM biotinylated histone H1, 200 nM slDNA, and 1 nM PARP enzyme. Auto reactions utilizing SPA bead-based detection were carried out in 100 \u03bcL volumes in white 96 well plates. Reactions were initiated by adding 50 \u03bcl of 2\u00d7 NAD substrate mixture to 50 \u03bcL of 2\u00d7 enzyme mixture containing PARP and DNA. These reactions were terminated by the addition of 150 \u03bcL of 1.5 mM benzamide (\u02dc1000-fold over its IC50). 170 \u03bcL of the stopped reaction mixtures were transferred to streptavidin FLASHPLATE PLUS\u00ae, incubated for 1 hour, and counted using a TOPCOUNT\u00ae microplate scintillation counter from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, Mass.). The ECfor exemplified compounds of this invention are provided in Table 1.","Cellular PARP Assay:","C41 cells were treated with a compound of this invention for 30 minutes in 96 well plate. PARP was then activated by damaging DNA with 1 mM HOfor 10 minutes. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS once and fixed with pre-chilled methanol:acetone (7:3) at \u221220\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. After air-drying, the plates were rehydrated with PBS and blocked 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS-TWEEN20\u00ae (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) (0.05%) (blocking solution) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were incubated with anti-PAR antibody 10H (1:50) in Blocking solution at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes followed by washing with PBS-TWEEN20\u00ae 5 times, and incubation with goat anti-mouse fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate-coupled antibody (1:50) and 1 \u03bcg\/ml 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in blocking solution at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. After washing with PBS-TWEEN20\u00ae 5 times, the analysis was performed using an FMAX FLUORESCENCE MICROPLATE READER\u00ae (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvalle, Calif.), set at the excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 528 nm fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC) or the excitation wavelength of 355 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm (DAPI). The PARP activity (FITC signal) was normalized with cell numbers (DAPI).","The cellular assay measures the formation of poly ADP-ribose by PARP within cells and demonstrates that compounds of this invention penetrate cell membranes and inhibit PARP in intact cells. The Kdata (nM) were determined from inhibition curves at various substrate concentrations and are shown in TABLE 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0187","num":"0274"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Inhibition of PARP by Representative Compounds Having Formula I"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Example","PARP-1 (K, nM)","Cell, EC, nM"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"91pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","474",{}]},{"entry":["2","91"]},{"entry":["3","83"]},{"entry":["4","179"]},{"entry":["5","49","39"]},{"entry":["6","11","9.6"]},{"entry":["7","6","5.4"]},{"entry":["8","99"]},{"entry":["9","206"]},{"entry":["10","26","12"]},{"entry":["11","127"]},{"entry":["12","32","13"]},{"entry":["13","44","37"]},{"entry":["14","98"]},{"entry":["15","48","29"]},{"entry":["16","51"]},{"entry":["17","130"]},{"entry":["18","79"]},{"entry":["19","47","31"]},{"entry":["20","131"]},{"entry":["21","280"]},{"entry":["22","330"]},{"entry":["23","519"]},{"entry":["24","5180"]},{"entry":["25","2850"]},{"entry":["26","492"]},{"entry":["27","1120"]},{"entry":["28","1470"]},{"entry":["29","1500"]},{"entry":["30","2650"]},{"entry":["31","1490"]},{"entry":["32","809"]},{"entry":["33","554"]},{"entry":["34","114"]},{"entry":["35","63","48"]},{"entry":["36","3490"]},{"entry":["37","98"]},{"entry":["38","340"]},{"entry":["39","71"]},{"entry":["40","1500"]},{"entry":["41","284"]},{"entry":["42","7790"]},{"entry":["43","97"]},{"entry":["44","60","143"]},{"entry":["45","146"]},{"entry":["46","130"]},{"entry":["47","2160"]},{"entry":["48",">9500"]},{"entry":["49","1350"]},{"entry":["50","1960"]},{"entry":["51","779"]},{"entry":["52","698"]},{"entry":["53","917"]},{"entry":["54","635"]},{"entry":["55","1500"]},{"entry":["56","909"]},{"entry":["57","1140"]},{"entry":["58","1440"]},{"entry":["59","534"]},{"entry":["60","318"]},{"entry":["61","134"]},{"entry":["62","38","106"]},{"entry":["63","211"]},{"entry":["64","369"]},{"entry":["65","427"]},{"entry":["66","23","32"]},{"entry":["67","356"]},{"entry":["68","1630"]},{"entry":["69","129"]},{"entry":["70","139"]},{"entry":["71","182"]},{"entry":["72","163"]},{"entry":["73","874"]},{"entry":["74","776"]},{"entry":["75","1640"]},{"entry":["76","149"]},{"entry":["77","42","797"]},{"entry":["78","86"]},{"entry":["79","615"]},{"entry":["80","113"]},{"entry":["81","94"]},{"entry":["82","1540"]},{"entry":["83","58"]},{"entry":["84","98"]},{"entry":["85","16","23"]},{"entry":["86","35","204"]},{"entry":["87","77"]},{"entry":["88","8690"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"As PARP inhibitors, the compounds of this invention have numerous therapeutic applications related to ischemia reperfusion injury, inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases, protection from adverse effects of cytotoxic compounds, and potentiation of cytotoxic cancer therapy.
