title: Low profile compact RF coaxial to planar transmission line interface
abstract: A compact, low profile coaxial to printed wiring board interface includes an interface block and an adapter. The interface block has a stepped opening for receiving the adapter and a coaxial cable. The adapter includes an outer profile with a series of steps that align and mate with the stepped opening of the interface block. An inner insulator of the coaxial cable is positioned entirely within the interface block and lies substantially flush with a first outside surface of the interface block, an outer conductor of the coaxial cable is positioned at an approximate midpoint interface of the adapter, an outer insulator of the coaxial cable lies flush with an external surface of the adapter, and a portion of the adapter positioned outside the interface block comprises a low profile such that the coaxial cable can be positioned away from a perpendicular to the interface block.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to RF coaxial to planar transmission line interfaces, and in an embodiment, but not by way of limitation, to a low profile compact RF coaxial to planar transmission line interface.","A typical commercial off the shelf (COTS) interface that is used to connect a coaxial cable to a printed wiring board is illustrated in . The COTS interface  includes a board mount jack  that couples to the printed wiring board . The jack  includes a center conductor , which serves as an electrical coupling agent to the printed wiring board. A transition piece  includes a center conductor transition piece , which inserts into the center conductor . The transition piece  includes another center conductor transition piece , which includes a female portion to receive the center conductor  of a coaxial cable . The interface  further includes a plug  that encases the two coupled coaxial connections in the interface . The coaxial cable includes an outer insulator , an outer conductor , and an inner insulator , all of which terminate at the outer housing portion of the interface .","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described herein in connection with one embodiment may be implemented within other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are entitled.

The inner insulator , when the coax cable  is inserted through the interface block  and into the printed wiring board, is positioned entirely within the interface block  and lies substantially flush with the outside surface of the interface block that faces the printed wiring board. The coaxial cable  further includes an outer conductor . The outer conductor , when the coaxial cable is inserted into the passageway of the interface block  and the adapter , comes to rest on the step  formed by the first inner diameter and the second inner diameter of the adapter. The coaxial cable  further includes an outer insulator , which when the coaxial cable  is inserted into the interface block and adapter interface, rests on the outside surface of the adapter .","The portion  of the adapter  that protrudes from the interface block  comprises a low profile. The low profile permits a coaxial cable  that is inserted into the interface block and adapter unit to be positioned away from a perpendicular to the interface block (or a line parallel to the central axis of the stepped opening of the interface block and the central axis of the adapter). In an embodiment, this low profile results in a distance, between the printed wiring board and the point of an attached coaxial cable that is bent to parallel in relation to the printed wiring board, of approximately 0.400 inches. Because of this low profile of the interface block and adapter construct, the positioning away from the perpendicular can be obtained closer to the printed wiring board than the constructs of the prior art such as that illustrated in .","In the foregoing detailed description of embodiments of the invention, various features are grouped together in one or more embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments of the invention require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the detailed description of embodiments of the invention, with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment. It is understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. It is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. In the appended claims, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201cin which\u201d are used as the plain-English equivalents of the respective terms \u201ccomprising\u201d and \u201cwherein,\u201d respectively. Moreover, the terms \u201cfirst,\u201d \u201csecond,\u201d and \u201cthird,\u201d etc., are used merely as labels, and are not intended to impose numerical requirements on their objects.","The abstract is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R.1.72(b) to allow a reader to quickly ascertain the nature and gist of the technical disclosure.
