title: Method of automated demodulation and classification of phase-shift-keying signals using hysteretic differential zero-crossing time samples
abstract: An automatic zero-crossing signal demodulation and classification device for rapidly identifying unknown modulation in a signal identifies unknown modulation in a signal, demodulates differential phase shift keying signals and automatically recognizes certain phase shift keying signals. This is accomplished by eliminating unknown term fin differential phase estimation, introducing a symbol rate tracking mechanism, applying hysteresis nonlinearity to eliminate phase shaping effect and using weighted average to estimate phase difference. Better estimates are accomplished by using hysteretic nonlinear function to detect zero-crossing points in eliminating false detecting of zero-crossing points caused by additive noise, and calculating differential phase without directly using center frequency to simplify estimation process. Present invention also encompasses automated zero-crossing signal surveillance demodulation and classification device for rapidly identifying unknown modulation in a signal and method for automatic zero-crossing demodulation and classification of unknown modulation signal.

In non-cooperative communications such as signal surveillance and some cognitive radio applications, the modulation scheme is unknown and has to be estimated and classified automatically. Continuing research and development has led to steady progress and advances in automated modulation classification techniques over the years. However, these techniques still suffer from a number of difficulties and limitations when being implemented in non-cooperative environments in the field, because of unknown parameters such as signal and noise power, carrier frequency and pulse shape, and so on. Those skilled in the art recognize that prior art signal classification equipment, techniques and methods need to be more robust in order to perform adequately in harsh environmental conditions.","One potentially promising technique is the zero-crossing approach, which should be relatively simple to implement, but to date has not yet been successfully accomplished. Recognizing phase-shift-keying (PSK) with a zero-crossing approach has only met with limited success.","A brief examination of the zero-crossing approach in signal repetition rate estimation points to a few of the most noteworthy difficulties with that approach. If we denote f(k), k=1, 2, . . . , as a digitized intermediate frequency (IF) copy of an unknown phase-shifted keying signal at time t(k), then denote a subset of t(k) as x(1), x(2), . . . which are zero-crossing samples of f(k), i.e. f(x(i))=0 for all i, and also denote \u03c6(1), \u03c6(2), . . . as phase symbols of f(k), then one can estimate the relative phase of f(k) at the msymbol according to this expression:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u03d5","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":"\u03c0","mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["f","c"]},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["{","}"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","msub":{"mi":["L","m"]}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"=","msub":{"mi":["j","m"]}},{"msub":[{"mi":["j","m"]},{"mi":["L","m"]}],"mo":["+","-"],"mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},"mo":"-","mfrac":{"mi":"n","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["f","c"]}}}}}}}},"mo":"."}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":"Equation","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"sub":["c ","m ","m","m","m","m"],"sup":["th ","th "],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["m","m","m\u2212"]},"This prior art approach suffers from a number of drawbacks. The drawbacks include the need to know the center frequency faccurately in Equation 1 in order to estimate \u03c6(m) and the need to conduct symbol estimation and symbol timing precisely in order to align the starting point x(j) and ending point x(j+L\u22121) within the desired symbol time-period in order to reliably detect zero-crossing points. Another drawback is the lack of reliability in detecting zero-crossing points due to the additive noise. If the zero-crossing points x(i)=t(a) are not detected due to noise, but points x(i+1)=t(b) are still detected in spite of the noise, then x(i)=t(b) will be mistakenly used in Equation 1 and consequently all further phase estimates after time t(a) will also be incorrect. The prior art approach also requires a square pulse shape, and if a square pulse shape is not available, then the zero-crossing points near the pulse edges will be dominated by noise and cause faulty detections. These kinds of limitations of the zero-crossing approach for signal repetition rate estimation devices and techniques along with long-standing prior art difficulties in modulated classification such as questionable strength in the face of harsh environmental conditions have created a long-felt need for a zero-crossing point estimating technique that is faster, more robust and more accurate than current zero-crossing modulation classification techniques. Up until now, there is no available zero-crossing demodulation and classification approach that overcomes the long-standing limitations, shortcomings and disadvantages of the prior art equipment and techniques.","In order to overcome the long-standing prior art drawbacks caused by need to solve the unknown center frequency, f, achieve perfect pulse timing estimation, the need for a square pulse shape, and the excessive sensitivity to noise in detecting zero-crossing points, the present invention provides automatic zero-crossing signal demodulation and classification device for rapidly identifying an unknown modulation in a signal. Despite the fact that the zero-crossing technique would be relatively simple to implement in classifying signals and is not a baseband constellation based system, the zero-crossing approach has not yet been successfully used for classifying signals.","Zero-crossing, or level crossing, time sampling, has often been used in numerous electronic applications such as frequency estimation, frequency-drift estimation, angular velocity estimation and signal modulation classification. The term \u201czero-crossing point\u201d refers to the point where a periodic waveform varies from a positive value to a negative one and crosses the zero value in the process. This means that a waveform with only a positive or a negative value has no zero-crossing point, but if it varies up or down it may cross a given non-zero level, which is also known as the level-crossing point. Zero-crossing time estimation takes the average of the time differences between two zero-crossing points of a periodic function.","The present invention fulfills the long-felt need for a more rapid, robust and accurate estimating technique than prior art zero-crossing estimation techniques by providing automated demodulation and classification zero-crossing estimation devices and methods. This invention overcomes prior art problems by eliminating the unknown term fin differential phase estimation, introducing a symbol rate tracking mechanism, applying hysteresis nonlinearity to eliminate the phase shaping effect and using a weighted average to estimate the phase difference.","It is an object of this invention to provide an automated demodulation and classification zero-estimating device for unknown modulation signals.","It is a further object of this invention to provide an automatic zero-crossing signal demodulation and classification device for rapidly identifying an unknown modulation in a signal that classifies and demodulates differential phase shift keying signals and automatically recognizes certain phase shift keying signals.","It is yet a further object of this invention to provide methods for automatically classifying the zero-crossing point by demodulating differential phase shift keying signals and automatically recognizing certain phase shift keying signals.","These and other objects are advantageously accomplished with the present invention providing an automated demodulation and classification zero-estimating device comprising a sample delay, differential phase estimator, symbol timing circuit, phase histogram, histogram templates and PSK modulation. Better estimates are accomplished by using the hysteretic nonlinear function to detect the zero-crossing points in eliminating the false detecting of the zero-crossing points caused by the additive noise, and calculating differential phase without directly using the center frequency to simplify the estimation process.","This invention's automated demodulation and classification zero-estimating approach demodulates M-ary differential phase shift keying (M-DPSK) signals and automatically recognizes M-DPSK and M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) signals. More rapid, robust and accurate estimates are achieved because the innovative techniques of the present invention eliminate the need to accurately estimate the center frequency, pulse shape and pulse timing, and they are therefore simpler and more rapid than prior art approaches. This invention's devices and methods advantageously optimize and improve the user's ability to estimate and classify unknown modulation schemes, which the prior art has not yet achieved with non-cooperative communications.

The histogram templates may be formed with the current method described by Hsue and Soliman and should then be normalized using the factor K. It is noted that if an automated histogram normalization procedure is used, the calculation of Kcan be omitted. The histogram of the unknown signal will be correlated to Nnumber of known templates to result in Nnumber of correlation scores. Since each score is associated with a known modulation type, the highest score indicates a recognition result. A threshold is chosen to exclude the low confidence results. If a score is below the threshold, the classification is reported as failure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["55","53","33","55","52","55","61","62","35","64"],"sub":["s","cb ","cb "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":"52"},"The present invention also includes a software embodiment for automatic demodulation and classification of phase shift keying signals with hysteretic differential zero-crossing time samples.  is a flow chart depicting the operation of this software embodiment.
