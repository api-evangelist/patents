title: Software development tool for providing user context information to improve message quality at development time
abstract: A message occurrence can be detected when a software application runs on a computing device. The message occurrence can be an occurrence where a text containing message is presented upon a user interface of the software application or a log associated with the software application is updated with a text containing message. A user context for the message occurrence can be determined. The user context can include a user sequence and an execution path. Message occurrence information can be conveyed to a message context catalog. Within the message context catalog, the message occurrence information can be indexed against unique message identifiers. Message occurrence information from the message context catalog can be presented in a computer's user interface when a message uniquely identified by the message identifier is presented in the user interface. The user interface can permit a user to edit text of messages.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the field of software development, more particularly, to a software development tool for providing user context information to improve message quality at development time.","Poorly written software messages are a very common problem in the software industry, which results in messages with low usability. In many cases, messages (e.g., error messages) do not adequately describe the details of a software problem or the action that should be taken by the user\/developer to resolve the problem. For example, messages presented to a user can include text for software error codes, can provide overly technical description of the problem, and can provide poorly translated messages.","From an end-user viewpoint, being presented with software messages ill suited for the user can be exceptionally frustrating. Such error messages are confusing to users attempting to decipher them, provide little guidance to users pertaining to steps that can be taken to resolve an error state and\/or prevent it from reoccurring in the future, and generally have a detrimental effect on users' experience with a software application. Another problem with unintelligible error messages is that they do not provide system administrators, software maintainers, and other support personnel with sufficient information to take corrective actions.","An underlying reason that software messages often include difficult to decipher messages is inherent in the software message creation process itself. Software projects are typically decomposed into different discrete tasks or modules, which can be written by different development team members. Code messages are written by module specific developers and often include content tailored for that module. Code modules are tested and refined discretely and then integrated with each other. During integration, many messages are edited, modified, or even added. Besides the module developer, other developers and software testers working on the project also review the produced messages. Development can be cyclic, where module development, integration, and other testing repeat over multiple iterations.","From the above, it can be seen that the message creation process is largely a bottom-up one, where low-level code developers are responsible for the content of software messages that are to be presented to end users. These developers lack information about user context as it pertains to the messages, which are to be presented to and interpreted by end users. From an end-user perspective, messages are presented in a top-down manner. Thus, software messages are often presented to users that refer to low-level modules\/concepts, which a typical user should not be expected to understand. This disconnectedness between the message intent and the message content is often a result of developers not having a proper user context for the user presented messages. Stated differently, a typical user is not exposed to (and is not overly concerned with) structural design considerations specific to internal logic that causes a software application to operate. An end-user is instead focused on accomplishing his or her goal through a sequence of interface interactions that are designed to result in the end-goal, which a developer creating user presented messages is often not fully aware of. There is a strong disconnect between these two different viewpoints, the message intent (the purpose of the message) and the message content (the information that is conveyed by the message.","A further challenge exists for software applications that support more than one natural language. Typically, software messages are converted from one language to another by translators who are at least bilingual. These messages are typically translated without context (or with an improper context), which can result in significant translation errors, which further diminishes an overall quality of the software messages. No known software development tools exist that present a message context to a developer\/translator who is creating, editing, and\/or translating software messages.","The present invention discloses a solution for improving the quality of software messages at development time or translation time using a message context tool. A message context catalogue can be maintained that stores message identifiers and different message occurrences. Each of these occurrences can include a user context, associated with a user meaning of the occurrence. For instance, the user context can refer to an application state from a user perspective that resulted in the occurrence of the message. The user context can include, for example, a sequence of one or more user interface actions, which resulted in a message being presented. This information is typically not captured and stored in a data repository for developer use, as is the case with the disclosed solution. That is, an end-user perspective of occurrences where messages are presented to a user in a user interface (or where messages to be read by users are written to a log) is typically unknown to a software developer or translator who constructs the messages. Thus, it is common for user presented (or log written) messages to be written in a manner difficult for end-users to understand. The present solution tracks user context during an execution flow of an application, detects message occurrence events, captures and stores a user context, and correlates execution paths of code resulting in the message occurrence events to user context. The correlated user context is made available to developers responsible for message creation, which minimizes a disconnect between developers responsible for message content and users that digest and interpret the message content.","In one embodiment, a top-down depiction of the user context can include a set of user interface screens and user actions that resulted in a message occurrence. In one embodiment, the user context can include a user pattern, which is a sequence of user interactions leading to a message occurrence. In another embodiment, an execution path, which is a code execution sequence leading to a message occurrence, can also be maintained in the message context catalogue and correlated with the user context. In one embodiment, different filters can be established for the message context catalogue, such as only cataloging occurrences of designed message types, such as error, warning, and informational messages. In one embodiment, the message context catalogue can automatically be populated by message occurrences whenever these occurrences are triggered during any software development and\/or testing phase of a software development lifecycle.","User context can be enabled and then tracked in many different software development environments, including a distributed environment, such as a Web based application development that includes support for Web services. A Web based application development environment can be particularly challenging because different portions of code can be executed by different distributed servers but they still belong to the same user context tracked on the same execution path. In a Web application environment, XML or other markup messages can be exchanged over a network. These messages can include metadata (e.g., a header section) that describes user context, execution path, and other data maintained by a message context catalogue. As Web software executes, it can write\/update the metadata. Whenever a message occurrence is triggered, a final metadata update can be performed, and the metadata information can be automatically conveyed to a server, which maintains the message context catalogue. It should be appreciated that while the message context tool can be considered a developer tool, the inventive arrangements disclosed can be used to record production, runtime information in a message context catalog (as well as development\/testing generated information), which can be used to improve message quality in subsequent software releases\/software updates.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product tangibly stored in a physical medium. Additionally, any combination of one or more computer usable or computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM), an optical storage device, or a magnetic storage device.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","100","120","110","112","114","131","120","124","130","124"]},"The message context catalogue  can be a storage space for digitally encoded information. For each unique message occurrence, a set of data can be stored, which includes user context  information. The user context information  is designed to characterize the message occurrence  from a user perspective. In one embodiment, user sequence data , occurrence state  data, and\/or execution path  data can be maintained for each occurrence . Interface sequence data  records a sequence of user interactions with an interface, which resulted in the message occurrence . The occurrence state  comprises point-in-time application  details or an application \u201csnapshot\u201d existent at a time of the message occurrence . The execution path  can be the sequence of programmatic actions from an executable code perspective leading up to the message occurrence .","System  can continuously builds context  for different message occurrences  as application  executes and makes this context information available to a development team that is editing, reviewing, and translating those messages. The context information  can include a set of triggering occurrences that caused the software messages to be presented. For each occurrence , an execution path , a user sequence , and other information can be maintained. An execution path  can refer to a sequence of called and calling software routines that lead to an execution event, which resulted in the software message being presented. The user sequence  can be a set of user actions and\/or user interface screens, which resulted in the event causing the software message to be presented. The user sequence  can include a set of user intent annotations, which are used to bridge a gap between a user's intent and resulting code that executes (e.g., the execution path ). For instance, code annotations can be implemented within source code for application  to enable user intent to be derived from execution paths .","To elaborate, as application  executes, the user annotations (e.g., user context ) described above are used by the context tracking system  to record user context flow through the application . Tracking of user context can be achieved by decorating methods of the application  that contain user context metadata to signal the context tracking component (message occurrence sensor ) on entry and exit of the method. Decoration of the code can be achieved with an aspect-oriented approach that uses the annotated metadata as the anchor point. The tracking component (message occurrence sensor ) processes entry and exits of user context data through the code from the initiation of a request through its completion, building a tree of the user context request path. To track threads of execution, the tracking component needs to be adapted to specific execution environments -. For example, in a simple application, using thread ID may be sufficient for correlating the user contexts associated with a single request. For more complex application environments, integration with request context services may be used.","In one embodiment, an analyzer  executing on a computing device  can perform pattern analysis operations to discover if multiple message identifiers with the same message text (or semantic meaning) exist having similar user context , which would cause these different messages to be advantageously grouped to each other. Further, the analyzer  can determine if a message text for a single message should be split into multiple different context-dependent message texts based upon commonalities\/differences and programmatic rules. For example, if a message identified as Message  has one context relating to a mistyped password and another related to an unfound user identifier, message text can be varied\/tailored based upon the different contexts.","A set of users  can interact with the message context catalogue  via a user interface  presented by a computing device . Different types of users  can include information developers , translators , software developers , and\/or software testers , where specifics of the user interface  can change based upon implementation specifics and a type of user  interacting with the message context catalogue . Interface  can include some message editing (e.g., message editor ) capabilities, shown by interface section . Interface  can also include a context interface section , which shows message occurrence information (e.g., data -) for a presented message.","Depending upon implementation specifics, the user interface  may integrate message context catalogue  information with code repository  information. The code repository  information can be information tied to the source code of the application  and\/or can be linked to message text  which is triggered when application  executes. In one embodiment, the message editor  functions can be integrated into a software development tool , such as an integrated design environment. In the embodiment development tool  can be a part of an Information Development Workbench.","In one embodiment, a user  manipulating message text  can lack permissions to access underlying code of the application . In the embodiment, message text  can be modified independent of application  source code. For example, a user  can be a translator  responsible to internationalizing software application  and\/or for providing translations of messages of the application .","In system , the message context catalogue  can be communicatively linked to a network, which is also connected to environment -, computing device , and\/or computing device . This network can convey digitally encoded information within carrier waves using wired and\/or wireless communication pathways. Each of the repositories\/catalogues , ,  can be storage spaces comprising storage hardware\/media for digitally encoded data (e.g., hard drives, solid state drives (SSD), optical drives) and optionally including software and hardware for managing stored data (e.g., database software and\/or machines upon which database software executes). Source code associated with application  can be one or more computer languages which can include, but is not limited to, C++, JAVA, and the like.","Application , sensor , analyzer , and entities - can be implemented as computer program products stored in a physical storage medium and able to be executed by computing devices upon which they reside. These computing devices, which include computing devices  and , can include, for example, a microprocessor, a volatile memory, and a nonvolatile memory linked via a bus. These computing devices can be general purpose machines executing computer program products within a general purpose operating system and\/or can be special purpose machines tailored (via integrated electronics, firmware, and software) for a discrete set of computing functions. User interface  can be a graphical user interface (GUI), a text user interface (TUI), a voice user interface (VUI), a multimodal interface, and the like depending upon implementation choices.","The software messages and triggering events can include error messages and error conditions, but the invention is not so limited and the message context tool can be used for improving a development time quality of any type of software message that an end-user is intended to read. In one embodiment, the software message context development tool can function in a distributed environment, such as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment, a Web development environment, and the like. In such an environment, metadata can be added to code (e.g., markup code) to facilitate user context tracking.","Detection of a message can be achieved by sensor  which can monitor display components and\/or message presentation components to identify when a message is presented. For instance, sensor  can be a log file handler able to detect a logging event. When a message is detected, the appropriate user context information  can be conveyed to context catalog .","Context catalog  can provide message occurrence  and\/or user context  data for editor , and tool . Catalog  can index occurrence  information to enable access to any portion of user context  data. Catalog  can be continually updated by entities -,  during the software execution and\/or development; as such catalog  is progressively improved.","In one embodiment, message text  can be stored within message context catalog . In the embodiment, message text  can be updated by entities - through access to the context catalog . Alternatively, message text can be stored in code repository , where concurrent versioning system (CVS) tools can be used to apply modifications to message text .","Drawings presented herein are for illustrated purposes only and should not be construed to limit the invention in any regard. In system , analyzer  and repository  can be optional components. Application  can include stand-alone applications, Web services, and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B"],"b":["190","194","172","122","130","190","194","198"]},"Record ,  represent two message occurrences, identified as RALVMJ02E and RALVMJ03E, respectively. Each record shows a user context correlated to an execution path. In both records ,  a user has attempted to sign onto a Web page with a user ID and password. Both records ,  ultimately trigger a message generated by execution of code \u201cGenerateSignonErrorMessage( ).\u201d An original developer written message (shown in table ) can be the same for both messages, RALVMJ02E and RALVMJ03E.","A developer exposed to the user context can determine a significant difference relevant to a user exists for the different message occurrences stored as records  and . Specifically, the message of record  is triggered when credential validation is attempted (e.g., ValidateCredentials( ) executes) while the message of record  is triggered when access verification is attempted (e.g., CheckConsoleAccess( ) executes). Armed with this user context information, which is typically not available, a software developer can customize the messages in a user comprehensible manner. As shown in table , a message associated with record  can be updated to state \u201cThe user ID or password is incorrect\u201d and the message associated with record  can be updated to state \u201cThis operator role is not authorized to perform this action.\u201d These new messages when presented to a user will minimize user experienced confusion, which would likely result upon being presented with the original message. That is, a user reading the first message (RALVMJ02E) will know to reenter their user name and password and a user reading the second message (RALVMJ03E) will know that to access the Web page their permissions must be upgraded by a responsible system administrator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["130","210","240"]},"Interface sequence  can include one or more interface artifacts presented to a user resulting in a message occurrence . In one embodiment, interface events can be tracked to determine user interaction for the context at the application state. For instance, determining which menu items and\/or which buttons were selected by a user can be evaluated and associated with the user sequence  of user context. In another embodiment, screen captures can be stored during each interface state change. For instance, GUI A-C screenshots can be collected as a user navigates through a DVD creation process. In yet another embodiment, video capture of user interaction can be acquired and presented to message creators.","Occurrence ID  can be used to track message occurrences during application execution. Occurrence ID  can be used to reference user context for message occurrences. When an occurrence is detected, a unique identification (ID) value can be assigned to the message occurrence. The ID can be a globally unique ID such as a database ID, process ID, and the like. In one embodiment, thread ID can be utilized to identify message occurrences in multithreaded applications. For instance, message occurrence  can be indexed using a process ID or an internalized ID, as shown in section .","Code path  can include one or more sequences of programmatic actions from an executable code perspective leading up to the message occurrence . Code path  can include API calls, libraries, code segments, functions, and the like. Code path  can correspond to user sequences  or to transitions between interfaces. For instance, executable code ,  can identify user context related to the executable code present in GUI A. In another instance, error handling code ,  can provide user context for object oriented applications where execution paths can be handled by specialized code.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","320","310","328","320","328"]},"Interface  can enable message authors to review and modify messages in the presence of user context . Messages can be presented to authors in section , which can change for each type of message being reviewed. For instance, a log message normally written to a log file can be presented in section . Tools  can be utilized by authors to improve messages such as modifying message text presentation and message artifacts (e.g., images).","Section  can present context information including, but not limited to, user sequence and execution path. For instance, interface  can be presented simultaneously during message editing. Interface elements  can enable navigation through user sequences, enabling a message editor to view user context which triggered the message occurrence. For instance, buttons  can enable backwards and forwards navigation through the context of a message occurrence.","Section  can be used by message editors to search for keywords in messages occurrences. With search functionality, message editors can identify groups of message occurrences which relate to user context, enabling editors to maintain message consistency. Further, search functionality can permit searching by user sequence element, execution path element, and the like allowing editors to access message occurrences by any user context criteria.","Annotation information can be optionally presented in section  of interface . Header information can be selectively suppressed based on user configuration of interface . Annotation description text can be presented in section  for each point in the execution path. For example, an execution path having five annotations can be presented in a set of sequential dialogs (e.g., wizard dialog) enabling authors to obtain detailed user context information.","Drawings presented herein are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed to limit the invention in any regard. Interface  can comprise of one or more user interface elements which can be selectively presented based on user permissions. For instance, interface elements can be suppressed when users are only permitted to view messages. Interface  can be a stand-alone executable tool utilized during software development such as debugging\/testing, quality assurance, and deployment phases.","Interface  can include common IDE features not shown in the interface. Additional features which can assist in the message creation process can include adding comments to a message occurrence. For example, reviewers who do not have permissions to edit notification messages can attach comments\/notes to the message occurrences which can be presented to authors, editors, and developers using the interface . Interface  can include a local history\/change log which can help authors track changes performed between sessions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","450"]},"Unlike traditional runtime environments, Web based environments such as Service Oriented Architectures can be problematic to perform tracing. This is a result of the distributed architecture resulting in disparate code segments (e.g., services) communicating in an ad-hoc manner. The ability to track execution path becomes further complicated when services are loosely coupled. To address these scenarios, user context can be associated with service response\/requests. In one embodiment, Extensible Markup Language (XML) headers associated with application communication can include user context information.","In action , applications can communicate messages with user context embedded within the header and\/or message body. As applications  communicate request\/response messages, user context  can be encoded within XML header . User context  can be XML data indicating user sequence information, execution paths, application state, and the like.","In action , user context can be continually updated as applications execute. During an initial request, initial context  can be established, which can include application programming interface (API) entry points, request parameters, and the like. As the application state changes, additional context  can be amended to the user context. Context can be continually updated until a message occurrence is detected. When a message occurrence is detected, context  is appended to indicate user context at the message occurrence.","In action , message occurrence can be detected in a variety of manners compliant with distributed environments. In one instance, message occurrence can be determined when a Web page  is requested\/delivered. Alternatively, error handling code and\/or services  can be monitored to determine when a message occurrence is triggered.","In action , user context  can be extracted from communication messages. This action can be performed by an user context extraction tools. User context can be assigned a unique ID  based on response\/request ID, Web server thread ID, port number, and the like.","In action , user context  can be added to a message catalog containing other user contexts for message occurrences. The catalog  can index the user context using one or more parameters, which can include a message occurrence ID.","Actions - can be repeated for each message occurrence detected. Stored messages in catalog  can be improved by message editors and reintroduced into process , allowing messages to continually be improved throughout the development process.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","510","520","500","520"]},"Code  shows metadata with user semantic (\u201cdescription\u201d tag in the example) being added to methods by creating a JAVA Annotation for context tracking. Code  shows an example usage of code .","Once metadata is added to methods, user context must still be tracked during execution flow. Code  shows a simple tracking component that uses thread ID to correlate user contexts with the same request. The tracking component is informed of entry and exit methods with the \u201cContext\u201d annotation by using AspectJ to decorate the methods.","Code  implements a tracking component that records user contexts in a tree structure, which allows for tracking of the nesting structure. It should be noted that a root request may be forwarded to multiple page handlers before a response is sent back to the client, in the code above, which poses an additional challenge to the Web application tier. This challenge can be overcome by adding a servlet filter to the Web application to initiate the context for a request received from a user's Web browser. Although thread ID was used in the code , other solutions exist. For example, a more robust solution in a J2EE environment is to use services, such as the WEBSPHERE WORK AREA SERVICE, so that tracking continues across EJB calls, etc.","In the example based on code -, multiple avenues can exist for displaying a message. These avenues include message logging, displaying of a full page error message, and displaying of an in-line error message. Each of these messages occurrences need to be detected by a message occurrence sensor.","To detect messages being logged into a file, a JAVA log API Handler can be implemented that triggers sending information to a correlation component (e.g., a local queue that intermittently sends message occurrence information to a message context catalog, the message context catalog itself, etc.), which thereafter passes the relevant messages to an existing log handler implementation. In the case of displaying a full page error message, a tag library used to display an error message can be updated to send message ID and user context information to the correlation component. In the case of displaying an in-line message, a tag library used to display the error message can be updated to send message ID and user context information to the correlation component. These are just a few possible message avenues and detection mechanisms, which are provided for illustrative purposes, and which are not intended to be comprehensive or interpreted in a manner that limits the scope of the claims.","It should be noted that once message occurrence information has been placed in the correlation component, message ID, message code, usage patterns, execution paths, occurrence state, and user sequence will have to be correlated or indexed with each other. In one embodiment, this can be accomplished using a database schema established for this purpose, which can be maintained by the message context catalog. In another embodiment, file based indexing schemes (as opposed to using a pure database) can be used to correlate this information. Any indexing techniques for data correlation can be used herein and the invention is not to be construed as limited in this regard.","The diagrams in the  illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.
