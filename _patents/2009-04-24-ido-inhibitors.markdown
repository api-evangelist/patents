No. 61\/047,579 filed 24 Apr. 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein was made in part with government support under Grant No. R01-CA109542, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present disclosure relates to compounds and methods for inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; further the disclosure relates to method of treatment of diseases and disorders mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.","2. Summary of the Related Art","Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid required for the biosynthesis of proteins, niacin and the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (also known as INDO or IDO) catalyzes the first and rate limiting step in the degradation of L-tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. In human cells, IFN-y stimulation induces activation of IDO, which leads to a depletion of Trp, thereby arresting the growth of Trp-dependent intracellular pathogens such as and . IDO activity also has an antiproliferative effect on many tumor cells, and IDO induction has been observed in vivo during rejection of allogeneic tumors, indicating a possible role for this enzyme in the tumor rejection process.","It has been observed that HeLa cells co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) acquire an immunoinhibitory phenotype through up-regulation of IDO activity. A reduction in PBL proliferation upon treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) was believed to result from IDO released by the tumor cells in response to IFN-y secretion by the PBLs. This effect was reversed by treatment with 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT), a specific IDO inhibitor. It was proposed that IDO activity in tumor cells may serve to impair antitumor responses (Logan, et al., 2002, Immunology, 105: 478-87).","Several lines of evidence suggest that IDO is involved in induction of immune tolerance. Studies of mammalian pregnancy, tumor resistance, chronic infections and autoimmune diseases have shown that cells expressing IDO can suppress T-cell responses and promote tolerance. Accelerated Trp catabolism has been observed in diseases and disorders associated with cellular immune activation, such as infection, malignancy, autoimmune diseases and AIDS, as well as during pregnancy. It was proposed that IDO is induced chronically by HIV infection, and is further increased by opportunistic infections, and that the chronic loss of Trp initiates mechanisms responsible for cachexia, dementia and diarrhea and possibly immunosuppression of AIDS patients (Brown, et al., 1991, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., 294: 425-35). To this end, it has recently been shown that IDO inhibition can enhance the levels of virus-specific T cells and, concomitantly, reduce the number of virally infected macrophages in a mouse model of HIV (Portula et al., 2005, Blood, 106:2382-90).","IDO is believed to play a role in the immunosuppressive processes that prevent fetal rejection in utero. More than 40 years ago, it was observed that, during pregnancy, the genetically disparate mammalian conceptus survives in spite of what would be predicted by tissue transplantation immunology (Medawar, 1953, Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 7: 320-38). Anatomic separation of mother and fetus and antigenic immaturity of the fetus cannot fully explain fetal allograft survival. Recent attention has focused on immunologic tolerance of the mother. Because IDO is expressed by human syncytiotrophoblast cells and systemic tryptophan concentration falls during normal pregnancy, it was hypothesized that IDO expression at the maternal-fetal interface is necessary to prevent immunologic rejection of the fetal allografts. To test this hypothesis, pregnant mice (carrying syngeneic or allogeneic fetuses) were exposed to 1MT, and a rapid, T cell-induced rejection of all allogeneic concepti was observed. Thus, by catabolizing tryptophan, the mammalian conceptus appears to suppress T-cell activity and defends itself against rejection, and blocking tryptophan catabolism during murine pregnancy allows maternal T cells to provoke fetal allograft rejection (Munn, et al., 1998, Science 281: 1191-3).","Further evidence for a tumoral immune resistance mechanism based on tryptophan degradation by IDO comes from the observation that most human tumors constitutively express IDO, and that expression of IDO by immunogenic mouse tumor cells prevents their rejection by preimmunized mice. This effect is accompanied by a lack of accumulation of specific T cells at the tumor site and can be partly reverted by systemic treatment of mice with an inhibitor of IDO, in the absence of noticeable toxicity. Thus, it was suggested that the efficacy of therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients might be improved by concomitant administration of an IDO inhibitor (Uyttenhove et al., 2003, Nature Med., 9: 1269-74). It has also been shown that the IDO inhibitor, 1-MT, can synergize with chemotherapeutic agents to reduce tumor growth in mice, suggesting that IDO inhibition may also enhance the anti-tumor activity of conventional cytotoxic therapies (Muller et al., 2005, Nature Med., 11:312-9).","One mechanism contributing to immunologic unresponsiveness toward tumors may be presentation of tumor antigens by tolerogenic host APCs. A subset of human IDO-expressing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that coexpressed CD123 (IL3RA) and CCR6 and inhibited T-cell proliferation have also been described. Both mature and immature CD123-positive dendritic cells suppressed T-cell activity, and this IDO suppressive activity was blocked by 1MT (Munn, et al., 2002, Science 297: 1867-70). It has also been demonstrated that mouse tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) contain a subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that constitutively express immunosuppressive levels of IDO. Despite comprising only 0.5% of lymph node cells, in vitro, these pDCs potently suppressed T cell responses to antigens presented by the pDCs themselves and also, in a dominant fashion, suppressed T cell responses to third-party antigens presented by nonsuppressive APCs. Within the population of pDCs, the majority of the functional IDO-mediated suppressor activity segregated with a novel subset of pDCs coexpressing the B-lineage marker CD19. Thus, it was hypothesized that IDO-mediated suppression by pDCs in TDLNs creates a local microenvironment that is potently suppressive of host antitumor T cell responses (Munn, et al., 2004, J. Clin. Invest., 114(2): 280-90).","IDO degrades the indole moiety of tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin, and initiates the production of neuroactive and immunoregulatory metabolites, collectively known as kynurenines. By locally depleting tryptophan and increasing proapoptotic kynurenines, IDO expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) can greatly affect T-cell proliferation and survival. IDO induction in DCs could be a common mechanism of deletional tolerance driven by regulatory T cells. Because such tolerogenic responses can be expected to operate in a variety of physiopathological conditions, tryptophan metabolism and kynurenine production might represent a crucial interface between the immune and nervous systems (Grohmann, et al., 2003, Trends Immunol., 24: 242-8).","Small molecule inhibitors of IDO are being developed to treat or prevent IDO-related diseases such as those described above. For example, PCT Publication WO 99\/29310 reports methods for altering T cell-mediated immunity comprising altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites, using an inhibitor of IDO such as 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, p-(3-benzofuranyl)-DL-alanine, p-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-DL-alanine, and 6-nitro-L-tryptophan) (Munn, 1999). Reported in WO 03\/087347, also published as European Patent 1501918, are methods of making antigen-presenting cells for enhancing or reducing T cell tolerance (Munn, 2003). Compounds having indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004\/094409; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004\/0234623 is directed to methods of treating a subject with a cancer or an infection by the administration of an inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase in combination with other therapeutic modalities.","In light of the experimental data indicating a role for IDO in immunosuppression, tumor resistance and\/or rejection, chronic infections, HIV-infection, AIDS (including its manifestations such as cachexia, dementia and diarrhea), autoimmune diseases or disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero, therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds, compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.","In one aspect, the invention comprises compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them

For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the \u201cPhysicians' Desk Reference\u201d (PDR, e.g., 1996 edition, Medical Economics Company, Montvale, N.J.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.","Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms","The pharmaceutical compositions described herein generally comprise a combination of a compound described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. Such compositions are substantially free of non-pharmaceutically acceptable components, i.e., contain amounts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable components lower than permitted by US regulatory requirements at the time of filing this application. In some embodiments of this aspect, if the compound is dissolved or suspended in water, the composition further optionally comprises an additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein are solid pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., tablet, capsules, etc.).","These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), ocular, oral or parenteral. Methods for ocular delivery can include topical administration (eye drops), subconjunctival, periocular or intravitreal injection or introduction by balloon catheter or ophthalmic inserts surgically placed in the conjunctival sac. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.","Also, pharmaceutical compositions can contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds described herein above in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions described herein, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.","In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.","Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions described herein can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.","The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term \u201cunit dosage forms\u201d refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.","The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.","For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound described herein. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of a compound described herein.","The tablets or pills can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.","The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.","Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.","The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.","The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.","The therapeutic dosage of the compounds can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound described herein in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds described herein can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w\/v of the compound for parenteral adminstration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to about 1 g\/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 100 mg\/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.","The compounds described herein can also be formulated in combination with one or more additional active ingredients which can include any pharmaceutical agent such as anti-viral agents, vaccines, antibodies, immune enhancers, immune suppressants, anti-inflammatory agents and the like.","Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods","Another aspect relates to fluorescent dye, spin label, heavy metal or radio-labeled derivatives of the compounds described herein that would be useful not only in imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the IDO enzyme in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying IDO enzyme ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, further provided are IDO enzyme assays that contain such labeled compounds.","Further provided are isotopically-labeled compounds of the compounds described herein. An \u201cisotopically\u201d or \u201cradio-labeled\u201d compound is a compound described herein where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be include but are not limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, F, S, Cl, Br, Br, Br, Br, I, I, I and I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro IDO enzyme labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate H, C, Br, I, I, S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications C, F, 5I, I, I, I, Br, Br or Br will generally be most useful.","It is understood that a \u201cradio-labeled\u201d or \u201clabeled compound\u201d is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of H, C, I, S and Br.","Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds described herein and are well known in the art.","A radio-labeled compound described herein can be used in a screening assay to identify\/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the radio-labeled compound described herein to the IDO enzyme. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the radio-labeled compound for binding to the IDO enzyme directly correlates to its binding affinity.","Kits","Also included are pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of IDO-associated diseases or disorders, obesity, diabetes and other diseases referred to herein which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and\/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.","The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the disclosure in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The example compounds below were found to be inhibitors of IDO according to one or more of the assays described herein.","All reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources. All commercial reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. The reactions were monitored using analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) with 0.25 mm EM Science silica gel plates (60E-254). The developed TLC plates were visualized by immersion in potassium permanganate solution followed by heating on a hot plate. Flash chromatography was performed with Selecto Scientific silica gel, 32-63 \u03bcm particle sizes. All reactions were performed in flame or oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen atmosphere.

This was carried out by mixing 50 \u03bcL of each fraction with 100 \u03bcL of reaction mix to yield a final concentration of 50 mM KPB buffer, 20 mM ascorbic acid, 200 \u03bcg\/mL catalase, 20 \u03bcM methylene blue and 400 \u03bcM L-tryptophan. Fractions demonstrating IDO activity were loaded onto a Ni-NTA purification column (15 mL). This affinity purification column was washed with 10 volumes of 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole pH 8, and eluted with 10 volumes of buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl and a 50 to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Collected fractions were assayed by IDO enzymatic assay described above and the positive fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against a buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 50% glycerol. This process yields \u02dc8-10 mg of pure protein (>98%) with a specific activity of 170 \u03bcmol\/h\/mg.","The ICvalues for each compound were determined by testing the activity of IDO in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5; 70 nM purified human IDO protein, 200 \u03bcM L-tryptophan, 20 mM ascorbate, 20 \u03bcM methylene blue, 0.1% DMSO. The inhibitors were initially diluted in DMSO at 100 mM and were diluted in potassium phosphate 50 mM, added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations raging from 1 mM to 5 nM and preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25\u00b0 C. The reaction was started by addition of L-tryptophan to 200 \u03bcM and incubated 15 min at 37\u00b0 C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 vol of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated 30 min at 60\u00b0 C. to hydrolyze N-formylkynurenine to kynurenine. The reaction was centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 min to remove precipitated protein and the supernatant was reacted with 2% (w\/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid. The reaction was incubated 10 min at 25\u00b0 C. and read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Control samples with no IDO inhibitor, or with no IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1-methyl-tryptophan (200 \u03bcM) and menadione (1.2 \u03bcM) were used as controls to set the parameters for the non-linear regressions necessary for determination of the ICfor each compound. Nonlinear regressions and determination of the ICvalues were performed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software. Compounds with an ICof less than 500 \u03bcM were considered as active inhibitors in this assay.","293-T-REx\u2122 cells (Invitrogen) constitutively express a tet operator binding repressor protein and are maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1\u00d7 Penicillin+Streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 \u03bcg\/mL blasticidin at 37\u00b0 C. with a 5% COin air atmosphere and typically split prior to confluency. Cells were passed by splitting the culture 1\/10\u2014by removing media by aspiration, washing 1\u00d7 with PBS, incubating with 0.25% trypsin\/EDTA until the cells detach, disbursing the cells in fresh growth media, and plating at 1\/10 dilutions in fresh growth media. For long term cryopreservation, cells are detached from the plate as described above, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in freeze medium (growth medium, 10%DMSO), stored in 1.8 mL cyropreservation vials (\u02dc2-5\u00d7106 cells per vial), in liquid nitrogen vapor storage tanks","IDO1-expressing 293-T-Rex\u2122 cell lines were generated by stable transfection of plasmid pcDNA-tetO-IDO expressing human IDO or murine IDO under the control of the doxycycline-inducible CMV-tet promoter. Transfected cells were selected in DBZ medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1\u00d7 Penicillin+Streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 \u03bcg\/mL blasticidin and 25 \u03bcg\/ml Zeocin) at 37\u00b0 C. with a 5% COin air atmosphere. Individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution cloning from these populations. These clones were assayed for IDO activity and the clones that showed the highest levels of IDO activity inducible by doxycycline were used for subsequent cell based IDO assays.","To setup an IDO cell based activity assay, IDO-293-T-Rex cells were harvested and resuspended in DBZ media at 10cells\/mL, and split into poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates at 100,000 cells per well. 100 \u03bcL of Neutral medium (DBZ medium, 200 \u03bcM L-tryptophan) or Induction media (Neutral medium supplemented with 5 \u03bcM doxycycline) are added to the cells and incubated 28 h at 37\u00b0 C. After the IDO induction period, medium is removed and replaced with Induction or Neutral medium containing different concentrations of each inhibitor (1 mM to 0.5 nM). The cells incubated in Neutral medium serve as negative control of the assay. The cells incubated in Induction medium and without inhibitor serve as the positive control of the assay. The incubation is carried out for 16 h at 37\u00b0 C. in a cell culture incubator. 200 \u03bcL of medium are transferred to U-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates containing 25 \u03bcL of 30% TCA, incubated 30 minutes at 60\u00b0 C. and centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 minutes. 150 \u03bcL of the clear supernatant is transferred to a polystyrene 96-well plate containing 50 \u03bcL of 4% (w\/v) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid, incubated for 10 min. Kynurenine concentration is determined by measuring the absorbance at 480 nm.","To measure the toxicity of each compound after 16 h incubation with cells, cell viability is measured via a WST-1 assay (Roche) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, after the incubation with each compound, medium is aspirated and replaced with 100 mL of WST-1 reagent, and incubated 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. Absorbance at 540 nm is correlated with the number of viable cells. Determination of IC(Kynurenine assay) or LD(WST-1 assay) is performed via non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.","Human monocytes were collected from peripheral mononuclear cells by leukoapheresis and cultured overnight at 10cells\/well in a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Adherent cells were retained and cultured for 7 days with 200 ng\/ml IL-4, 100 ng\/ml GM-CSF. Cells were matured for 2 days with a cytokine cocktail containing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and PGE2 for additional 2 days to induce dendritic cell maturation. At the end of maturation, loosely adherent cells were detached by gentle aspiration and plated in V-bottom 96 well plates, at 5000 cells\/well. These cells are >80% IDO+dendritic cells. Human allogeneic T cells (3\u00d710) from normal donors were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100-200 U\/mL IL-2 and 100 ng\/mL anti-CD3 antibody and added to the wells. Serial dilutions of IDO compounds dissolved in phenol red -free RPMI was added to yield a final concentration of IDOi between 500 and 1 \u03bcM. After incubation for 2-4 days, T cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation assay after an overnight pulse with BrdU labeling mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At the en of the pulse, the cells were fixed and incubated with 100 \u03bcL\/well anti-BrdU-POD antibody following the instructions from the manufacturer. Plates were read in a microplate reader.","Alternatively, testing of IDO inhibitors in an in vitro mouse model of IDO-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation is performed by the following procedure. C57b16 mice are inoculated with 1\u00d710B78H1-GMCSF tumor cells in the right flank. After 10-12 days, tumor draining lymph nodes are collected and cells are stained with anti-CD11c and anti-B220 monoclonal antibodies. Cells are sorted by high-speed fluorescence activated cell sorting and the CD11c+\/B220+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells are collected and seeded at 2000 cells\/well in 96 well V-bottom plates. Splenocytes are collected from BM3 transgenic mice (in CBA background) and collected by nylon wool enrichment. BM3 T cells (10cells\/well) are added to each well in 200 \u03bcL of RPMI, 10% FCS, 50 \u03bcM P-mercaptoetanol. Alternatively, T cells are obtained from spleens of OT-I transgenic mice and added to the culture in combination with OVA peptide. IDO inhibitors are added dissolved in RPMI at final concentrations ranging from 1 mM to 10 nM. After 3 days of stimulation, cells are pulsed by 16 h with BrdU or H-thymidine. Cells are collected, fixed and tested for BrdU incorporation following the instructions from the BrdU labeling kit manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). If H-tymidine is used to measure T cell proliferation, cells are harvested and dpm counts are measured in a scintillation counter following procedures widely known in the art. Control CD11c cells taken from the contralateral lymph node or CD11c\/B220 cells (IDO population) from the TDLN are used as positive control for proliferation.","In vivo anti-tumor efficacy can be tested using modified tumor allograft protocols. For instance, it has been described in the literature that IDO inhibition can syngerize with cytotoxic chemotherapy in immune-competent mice. Due to different susceptibilities of different tumor cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs and to immune mediated rejection, each IDO inhibitor is tested alone and in combination with 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs in 4 different animal tumor models, represented by 4 different mouse tumor cell lines, of different tissue origin (colorectal, bladder, mammary and lung carcinoma), implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic strains of mice. These cell lines have been selected based on their known susceptibility to chemotherapeutic drugs, their partial response to IDO inhibitors as single agents, their presumed pattern of IDO expression according to their tissue of origin, and their ability to elicit an immune reaction.","For every animal tumor model, 2 different chemotherapeutic drugs are tested in separate groups of mice according to the following list: 1] LLC tumor: cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; 2] EMT6 tumor: cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel; 3] CT26 tumor: cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin; and 4] MB49 tumor: cyclophosphamide and gemcitabine.","The following chemotherapeutic drugs are used, at the indicated doses. The maximum tolerated dose for the following chemotherapeutic agents in mice depends on the formulation, concentration, frequency of administration, route of administration and number of doses. The chemotherapeutic drugs administered in conjunction with each IDO inhibitor drug are: 1] Paclitaxel: 20 mg\/kg\/day i.p, every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4) (in Cremophor); 2] Doxorubicin: 5 mg\/kg, once a week for 3 weeks (q7dx3); 3] Cyclophosphamide: 100 mg\/kg, I.P., every 4 days, 4 times (q4dx4); 4] Gemcitabine: 80 mg\/kg every 4 days, 4 times, i.p. (q4dx4).","All animals receive a subcutaneous injection of a tumor forming dose of live tumor cells (\u02dc50000-1000000 cells) suspended in 0.1 mL of PBS or saline on day 1. Subcutaneous injection forms a localized tumor that allows monitoring tumor growth over time.","To mimic the effect of IDO inhibitor drugs as therapeutic compositions, administration of IDO inhibitor drugs begins at day 5-8 after tumor inoculation. Dosing, route of administration, dosing frequency varies depending on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics profile of each drug. Duration of the treatment is 2 weeks. Most preferably, drug is administered continuously via oral gavage or dissolution in the drinking water. Alternatively, subcutaneous slow release pellets containing 100 mg of each drug are implanted under the skin by surgical procedure. IDO inhibitor drug are administered at the maximum tolerated dose or at a concentration corresponding to the LD.","Pharmacological values for compounds tested according to one or more of the preceding examples are reported in the following table, including,","Human IDO IC: this is the concentration of the compound at which we observe 50% of enzymatic activity using recombinant human IDO under the assay conditions described in one of the examples;","ICvalues are reported in ranges: A: 0.5-2.5 mM; B: 0.1-0.5 mM; C: 20-100 \u03bcM; D: <20
