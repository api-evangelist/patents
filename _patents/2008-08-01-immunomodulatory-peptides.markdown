{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 of International Application No. PCT\/US2008\/071960, filed Aug. 1, 2008, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/954,968, filed Aug. 9, 2007, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","IgG plays a critical role in mediating protection against pathogens and in mediating allergic and inflammatory responses that hasten recruitment of immune system components to the tissues, mucosae, and dermal surfaces. Junghans, 16(1):29 (1997). However, IgG also plays a key role in a variety of autoimmune diseases.","The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been submitted in ASCII format via EFS-Web and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on May 23, 2012, is named 89452734.txt and is 131,354 bytes in size.","The serum half-life of IgG is longer than the serum half-lives of other plasma proteins. For example, the serum half-life of IgG is 5 to 7 days in mice and 22 to 23 days in humans. Roopenian et al., 170:3528 (2003); Junghans and Anderson, 93:5512 (1996). That extended serum half-life is at least partly due to the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, which binds to the Fc portion of pinocytosed IgG (in both adults and neonates) to protect it from lysosomal degradation. The pinocytosed IgG is then recycled back to the extracellular compartment. See, e.g., Junghans and Anderson, 93:5512 (1996), Roopenian et al., 170:3528 (2003). Indeed, the serum half-life of IgG is reduced in knockout mouse models that do not express at least part of the genes encoding \u03b2m and FcRn heavy chain. See WO 02\/43658 and Junghans and Anderson, 93:5512 (1996).","When the concentration of IgG reaches a level that exceeds available FcRn, unbound IgG is not protected from degradative mechanisms and consequently has a shorter serum half-life. See, e.g., Brambell et al., 203:1352 (1964). Analogously, IgG serum half-life is reduced when IgG binding to FcRn is inhibited, thereby preventing IgG recycling. Therefore, agents that inhibit or antagonize the binding of IgG to FcRn may be used to regulating, treating or preventing disorders characterized by the presence of inappropriately expressed IgG antibodies (such as, e.g., autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and disorders). For example, antibodies capable of inhibiting the binding of FcRn with IgG have been generated using a FcRn heavy chain knockout mouse line (WO 02\/43658). In another example, peptides have been identified that bind to FcRn complexes. Kolonin et al., 99(20):13055-60 (2002); U.S. Pat. No. 6,212,022. The contents of U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/676,148, filed Feb. 16, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60\/774,853, filed Feb. 17, 2006, and 60\/805,634, filed Jun. 23, 2006, describing further such peptides, their synthesis, and their uses are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. However, at this time additional agents are needed to regulate, treat, or prevent conditions, diseases, and disorders characterized by immune reactions.","Accordingly, peptides which specifically bind to FcRn and inhibit IgG Fc from binding to FcRn, thereby preventing IgG from recycling by preventing FcRn from functioning in its role of protecting IgG from degradation by the lysosomes are disclosed. In exemplary embodiments, the peptides bind to FcRn and inhibit the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 subclasses of IgG from binding to FcRn.","Peptides of the invention may exist as monomers or alternatively, as a multimers, such as, e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers. In some embodiments, the peptides of the invention may be more susceptible to pinocytosis, which enables more rapid binding of the peptide and consequently, less excretion by the kidney.","In some embodiments, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more peptides of the invention.","In other embodiments, the invention provides methods of regulating a disease state comprising contacting a cell with the peptide of a therapeutically effective amount of one or more peptides of the invention. Further embodiments include methods of regulating IgG levels in the serum of a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising one or more peptides of the invention capable of binding to and inhibiting the FcRn from binding to the Fc portion of an IgG molecule. In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention may be employed to reduce the half-life of soluble IgG in the serum of a subject. In some embodiments, the result of administering a composition of the invention is that the half-life of soluble IgG in the serum of the subject is reduced compared to the half-life of IgG in the serum of the subject prior to administration of the peptide.","In other embodiments, the invention provides methods for inhibiting binding of the Fc portion of a human IgG to FcRn to effect a decrease in the serum concentration of IgG as compared to the serum concentration of IgG before treatment. The method of decreasing serum concentration of IgG comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising one or more peptides of the invention that inhibit binding of the Fc portion of an IgG molecule to FcRn. In some embodiments, the decrease in the serum concentration of human IgG is at least 5%, such as a decrease of at least 15%, or a decrease in the serum concentration of human IgG of at least 25%.","Some embodiments of the invention provide methods of treating a subject suffering from a disease characterised by increased or inappropriate expression of IgG, such as, e.g., an an autoimmune disease, an inflammatory disease, or an immune system cancer, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising one or more peptides of the invention capable of preventing the FcRn from binding to the Fc portion of an IgG molecule. In some embodiments, methods of the invention may be used to prevent, treat, or regulate an immune response to a therapeutic protein or a gene therapy vector.","In other embodiments, methods of detecting FcRn are provided, comprising labeling a peptide described herein with at least one detectable label chosen from, e.g., a radioisotope, an enzyme (e.g., an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction producing a detectable, including, e.g., a colored, luminescent, or fluorescent, product), a fluorophore, a chromophore, a chemiluminescent compound, a magnetic particle, a microsphere, a nanosphere, biotin, streptavidin, and digoxin.","Other embodiments of the invention include methods of purifying FcRn, comprising immobilizing a peptide described herein to a solid support, contacting a solution containing FcRn with the immobilized peptide on a solid support; and purifying FcRn by separating the solution from said solid support.","Additional embodiments, objects, and advantages of the invention are set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. These embodiments, objects, and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are only exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","The term \u201camino acid,\u201d as used herein, encompasses encoded and non-encoded amino acids.

Non-encoded amino acids include isomers of the encoded amino acids such as, e.g., stereoisomers (including, e.g., -amino acids and allo-amino acids such as, e.g., allo-threonine and allo-isoleucine) and structural isomers (including, e.g., \u03b2-alanine) of the encoded amino acids. Lower case single-letter codes are used herein to indicate stereoisomers of the encoded amino acids having D-chirality (e.g., a=-alanine, y=-tyrosine). Non-encoded amino acids also include N-methylated amino acids. Conventional 3-letter abbreviations are used herein for certain common non-encoded amino acids (e.g., Aib=aminoisobutyric acid, Apa=5-aminopentanoic acid, Dab=1,3-diaminobutyric acid, Dap=1,2-diaminopropionic acid, Orn=ornithine, Pen=penicillamine, Sar=sarcosine). In general, where no specific configuration is indicated for an \u03b1-amino acid, one skilled in the art would understand that amino acid to be an -amino acid. However, in particular embodiments, non-encoded amino acids may also be in the form of racemic, non-racemic, and diastereomeric mixtures.","Non-encoded amino acids are well known in the peptide art and include, e.g., N-acetylserine, allo-isoleucine, allo-threonine, \u03b2-alanine (3-aminopropionic acid), \u03b1-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminobutanoic acid, 4-aminobutanoic acid, 3-amino-1-carboxymethylvalerolactam, 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 2-aminoheptanedioic acid, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, aminomethylpyrrole carboxylic acid, 8-amino-3,6-dioxa-octanoic acid, aminopiperidinecarboxylic acid, aminoserine, aminotetrahydropyran-4-carboxylic acid, azetidine carboxylic acid, benzothiazolylalanine, butylglycine, carnitine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, citrulline, cyclohexylalanine, cyclohexylstatine, 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, dihydroxyphenylalanine, dimethylthiazolidine carboxylic acid, 4-guanyl-phenylalanine, homoarginine, homocitrulline, homocysteine, homophenylalanine, homoproline, homoserine, 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, isonipecotic acid, methanoproline, norleucine, norvaline, ornithine, p-aminobenzoic acid, penicillamine, phenylglycine, O-phosphoserine, piperidinylalanine, piperidinylglycine, pyrrolidinylalanine, sarcosine, statin, tetrahydropyranglycine, thienylalanine, \u03b5-N,N,N-trimethyllysine.","An \u201canalog\u201d of an amino acid is a molecule that is not an amino acid, but that resembles an amino acid with regard to at least one property such as, e.g., size, charge, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, or rigidity. For example, lactic acid may be an amino acid analog. Similarly, an analog of a dipeptide is a molecule that is not a dipeptide, but that resembles a dipeptide with regard to at least one property such as, e.g., size, charge, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, or rigidity. Further, a peptide analog is a molecule that is not a peptide but that resembles a peptide with regard to at least one property such as, e.g., size, charge, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, or rigidity. In some embodiments, a dipeptide analog or peptide analog may differ from a dipeptide or peptide in that one or more peptide linkages are replaced by a linkage selected from, e.g., \u2014CHNH\u2014, \u2014CHS\u2014, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014, \u2014CH\u2550CH-(cis and trans), \u2014C(O)CH\u2014, \u2014CH(OH)CH\u2014, or \u2014CHSO\u2014, by methods well known in the art. See, e.g., Fauchere, 15:29 (1986); Evans et al., 30:1229 (1987). Dipeptide analogs also include, e.g., \u03b2-turn analogs. See, e.g., Friedinger, 46:5553-5566 (2003), and Hanessian, 53:12789-12854 (1997).","Nonlimiting examples of dipeptide analogs include, e.g., \u03b2-alanine, 4-aminobutanoic acid, 5-aminobutanoic acid, 3-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid, 4-(aminomethylbenzoic acid), 3-(aminophenyl)acetic acid, 4-(aminophenyl)acetic acid, and:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"135.21mm","wi":"38.86mm","file":"US08906844-20141209-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["3(S)-amino-2-oxo-1-piperidine-acetic acid and 3(R)-3-amino-2-oxo-1-piperidine-acetic acid;","3(S)-amino-2-oxo-1-azepine acetic acid and 3(R)-3-amino-2-oxo-1-azepine acetic acid;","3(S)-amino-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetic acid and 3(R)-3-amino-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetic acid; and","3-amino-N-1-carboxymethyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-[1]-benzazepine-2-one."]}},"An amino acid sequence that is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to a given sequence may be, e.g., at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to the given sequence. A substantially identical sequence may vary from the given sequence by truncation, deletion, substitution, addition, or modification of one or more amino acids, including, e.g., replacing one or more amino acids with one or more non-encoded amino acid(s) (such as, e.g., -amino acids or N-methylated amino acids) or amino acid analogs. Alternatively, a substantially identical sequence may differ from a given sequence only by conservative amino acid substitutions.","A conservative substitution is a substitution in which a first amino acid is replaced by a second amino acid that approximates at least one property of the first amino acid, such as, e.g., size, charge, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, or rigidity. Conservative substitutions encompass both encoded and non-encoded amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs.","For example, in some embodiments, alanine may be conservatively substituted by another hydrophobic amino acid such as, e.g., methionine, valine, leucine, or isoleucine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In other embodiments, alanine may be conservatively substituted by an amino acid that is approximately isosteric such as, e.g., \u03b2-alanine, ethylglycine, \u03b1-aminoisobutryic acid, or -alanine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In some embodiments, cysteine may be conservatively substituted by another thiol-containing amino acid such as, e.g., homocysteine, -cysteine, or penicillamine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In other embodiments, cysteine may be conservatively substituted by an approximately isosteric amino acid such as, e.g., serine, threonine, or 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In other embodiments, phenylalanine may be conservatively substituted by, e.g., 3-fluorophenylalanine, 4-methylphenylalanine, phenylglycine, 1-naphthylalanine, and 3,3-diphenylalanine, 4-aminophenylalanine, pentafluorophenylalanine, 2-pyridylalanine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-nitrophenylalanine, 2-pyrrolidinylalanine, 3-piperidylalanine, or 4-piperidylalanine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. As another example, histidine may be conservatively substituted by a basic amino acid such as, e.g., lysine, ornithine, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, arginine, or guanylalanine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In other embodiments, histidine may be conservatively substituted by an aromatic amino acid such as, e.g., thienylalanine; tyrosine, tryptophan, or phenylalanine, or by an analog of the any of the above-mentioned amino acids. In yet other embodiments, histidine may be conservatively substituted by a basic, aromatic amino acid such as, e.g., 1-methylhistidine, 2-pyridylalanine, 3-pyridylalanine, 4-pyridylalanine, 4-aminophenylalanine, 4-guanylphenylalanine, thiazolylalanine, and analogs thereof.","In certain embodiments, a conservative substitution may be a substitution that replaces a first amino acid with a second amino acid having a similar hydropathic index, such as a value that varies by, e.g., \u00b10.5, \u00b11, or \u00b12. In other embodiments, a conservative substitution may be a substitution that replaces a first amino acid with a second amino acid having a similar hydrophilicity value, such as a value that varies by, e.g., \u00b10.5, \u00b11, or \u00b12.","In some embodiments, non-conservative substitutions may be introduced. A non-conservative substitution may be, e.g., a substitution that replaces a charged amino acid with a neutral amino acid; a substitution that replaces a basic amino acid with an acidic amino acid; a substitution that replaces a polar amino acid with a nonpolar amino acid; a substitution that replaces a hydrophilic amino acid with a hydrophobic amino acid; a substitution that replaces a an amino acid with a sterically dissimilar amino acid; or an amino acid with differing hydrogen bonding capabilities. Non-conservative substitutions may be made where appropriate. For example, a skilled artisan may be able to identify one or more amino acids of a peptide that may be non-conservatively substituted without significant alteration of the biological activities (such as, e.g., FcRn binding affinity or reduction of IgG concentration in vivo) or structure of the peptide. See, e.g., Example 7.","In general, the disclosure provides peptides derivatized with a hydrophilic polymer. For example, any of the peptides disclosed in the Examples may be derivatized with a hydrophilic polymer or may be modified (e.g., as described below) so that they can be derivatized with a hydrophilic polymer. The term \u201cderivatized,\u201d as used in connection with the peptides of the invention, refers to amino acids or peptides, or analogs of amino acids or peptides, comprising a hydrophilic polymer.","The hydrophilic polymer may be chosen from, e.g., polyethylene glycol including, e.g., monoalkyl-polyethylene glycol; polypropylene glycol; polysaccharides such as, e.g., dextran and cellulose; methylcellulose; hydroxycellulose; hydroxymethylcellulose; hydroxypropylcellulose; hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose; hydroxyalkyl starch including, e.g., hydroxyethyl starch; polyvinyl alcohol; poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone); and poloxamers. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer may be chosen from, e.g., polyethylene glycol copolymers such as, e.g., polyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol copolymers and polyethylene glycol-poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) copolymers. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer is a non-peptide polymer. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer is readily hydrated. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer has a large hydrodynamic radius when hydrated. In illustrative embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer is polyethylene glycol.","In some embodiments, a peptide of the invention (monomer or multimer) may contain one molecule of hydrophilic polymer per peptide monomer. In other embodiments, a peptide of the invention may contain multiple molecules of hydrophilic polymer per peptide monomer. For example, the anti-FcRn peptides disclosed herein may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 1-4,1-8, 2-3, 2-4, 2-6, 3-6, or 2-6 molecules of hydrophilic polymer per peptide monomer.","In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer may be linear. In other embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer may be branched. A branched hydrophilic polymer may have, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 branches. In some embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer may have an average molecular weight of, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 kDa, or may have an average molecular weight ranging from, e.g., about 10-60, 10-40, 10-30, 20-30, 20-40, 20-50, 30-60, 15-25, 25-35, 35-45, or 45-55 kDa.","In some embodiments, the derivatized peptides described herein exhibit enhanced pharmaceutical properties relative to the corresponding underivatized peptides. For example, the derivatized peptides may have extended serum half-lives in animals. In some embodiments, the derivatized peptides may have serum half-lives that are at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 150, 175, 200, or 300% greater than the corresponding underivatized peptides in any of humans, mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. In other embodiments, the derivatized peptides may have serum half-lives that are at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 5,000, or 10,000-fold greater than the corresponding underivatized peptides in any of humans, mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Serum half-life may be determined by, e.g., LC-MS or an ELISA assay using appropriate antibodies. In certain embodiments, derivatization does not result in a significant reduction in potency. For example, in some embodiments, derivatization does not result in a significant reduction in, e.g., binding affinity. In other embodiments, derivatization does not result in a significant reduction in inhibitory activity towards the IgG-FcRn interaction. For example, in some embodiments, derivatization does not result in a significant reduction in potency, as measured by, e.g., the IgG-peptide competition assay as described in Example 4, Biacore, or KinExA (Kinetic Exclusion Assay), and the derivatized peptides may have at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 98, or 99% of the potency of the corresponding, underivatized peptides.","In some embodiments, monomeric peptides, such as, e.g., Peptide Nos. 227, 235, and 239, may be derivatized or may be modified (e.g., by conservative or non-conservative substitutions) so that they can be derivatized. In other embodiments, multimeric peptides such as, e.g., Peptide Nos. 119, 247, 278, 285, 286, 287, may be derivatized or may be modified so that they can be derivatized.","Derivatized peptides of the invention may be chosen from, e.g., Peptide Nos. 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, and 296. In illustrative embodiments, the derivatized anti-FcRn peptide may be Peptide No. 285, pegylated with linear PEG chains as described in Examples 24, 27-29 and 31 or with branched PEG chains as described in Examples 33-34. In some embodiments, branched PEG chains may provide more favorable in vitro and in vivo characteristics than the linear PEGs. In illustrative embodiments, the branched pegylated peptides may be the product of the reductive alkyation of Peptide No. 285 with a 20 kDa, two-branch PEG or a two-branch, 40 kDa PEG.","The derivatized peptides may be monomeric or multimeric (including e.g., dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric peptides). In the case of multimeric peptides, each of the individual peptide monomers from which the multimer is composed may be the same as or different from any other peptide monomer in the multimer. In some embodiments, peptide multimers may be synthesized by reacting individual peptide monomers with a multivalent linker. See, e.g., Rose, 116:30 (1994). For example, peptide multimers may be synthesized by reacting individual peptide monomers, while on resin, with a multivalent linker. In other embodiments, peptide multimers may be synthesized by incorporating branched linker groups prior to the synthesis of the peptide sequence as in, e.g., Posnett et al., 263:1719 (1988).","Any suitable linker known to one of skill in the art may be used. In general, linkers that do not interfere with binding to FcRn are chosen. For example, the linker may be one of the linkers disclosed in, e.g., the Examples; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,671,958; 4,867,973; 5,691,154; 5,846,728; 6,472,506; 6,541,669; 7,141,676; 7,176,185; and 7,232,805 and in U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 2006\/0228348.","In general, the linker may be of a suitable length such that it avoids steric hindrance between the peptide monomers of the multimer, and does not interfere with the binding of the peptide monomers to FcRn. In some embodiments, the linker may be a covalent bond. In other embodiments, the linker may comprise 1-100, 1-60, 5-60, 5-40, 2-50, 2-20, 5-10, or 5-20 linear atoms, where the linker is attached to a peptide monomer by means of, e.g., an ester, amide, hydrazone, oxime, semicarbazone, ether, thioether, phosphorothioate, phosphonate, thioester, and\/or disulfide linkage. The remaining linear atoms in the linker are preferably selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, any of which atoms optionally may be included in a carbocyclic, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl ring. The linear carbon atoms in the linker optionally can be substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxy, nitro, haloalkyl, alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, amino, acylamino, alkylcarbamoyl, arylcarbamoyl, aminoalkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkanesulfonyl, arenesulfonyl, alkanesulfonamido, arenesulfonamido, aralkylsulfonamido, alkylcarbonyl, acyloxy, cyano, and ureido. A linear nitrogen atom in the linker optionally can be substituted with acyl, sulfonyl, alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxycarbonyl. A linear sulfur atom in the linker optionally can be oxidized. In certain embodiments, the linker may be cleavable, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 2006\/0228348 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,867,973; 7,176,185; 7,232,805.","In some embodiments, the derivatized peptides may comprise further modifications, such as, e.g., glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or lipidation.","The derivatized peptides, in certain embodiments, have some affinity for FcRn. For example, in some embodiments, the Kfor the peptide-FcRn interaction may range from 50 fM to 1 mM.

Synthesis of Unpegylated Peptides","Peptides of the invention may be synthesized following the procedures set forth in the Examples or by other known synthetic methods, such as, e.g., solid phase peptide synthesis. See, e.g., Abelson et al., eds., 289-(1997); Chan and White, eds., Oxford, University Press Inc., New York (2000); Benoiton, , CRC (2005); Bodanszky, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, New York (1993); Stewart and Young, 2nd ed., Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. (1984).","Peptides of the invention that are composed entirely of encoded amino acids may be synthesized recombinantly in cells using techniques well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al., , Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y. (1989).","Alternatively, peptides of the invention may be synthesized using a combination of synthetic and recombinant methods.","b. Pegylation","Pegylation may be performed according to any of the pegylation reactions known in the art. Methods for preparing a pegylated protein product will generally include (a) reacting a polypeptide with a PEG containing a first reactive group (such as, e.g., an active ester, aldehyde, amine, aminooxy, hydrazine, hydrazide, othiol, maleimide, and \u03b1-haloacyl, such as, e.g., iodoacetyl) under conditions whereby the peptide of the invention, which typically contains at least one second reactive group, becomes attached to one or more PEG groups; and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). Reaction conditions may be selected from any of those known in the pegylation art or those subsequently developed. In general, reaction conditions (including, e.g., temperature, solvent, and pH) that will not degrade the anti-FcRn peptides of the invention are chosen.","In embodiments wherein a peptide to be pegylated contains more than one second reactive group that may be pegylated, some or all of those groups may be pegylated by using an appropriate PEG stoichiometry during the pegylation reaction. In the illustrative example of a peptide dimer containing two C-terminal amines, both amines may be pegylated, or only one amine may be pegylated, depending upon the PEG stoichiometry used.","Acylation.","As used herein, acylation is contemplated to include, without limitation, the following types of linkages between a peptide of the invention and a PEG: amide, carbamate, urethane, and the like. See, e.g., Chamow, 5:133-140 (1994).","In a first example, an amine-containing peptide (where the amine group is, e.g., a side chain amine group or an N-terminal amine group) can be selectively reacted with a PEG reagent having an activated ester group (including, e.g., PEG succinimidyl esters and PEG para-nitrophenyl esters; such as, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. Nos. Sunbright MEGC-30TS and Sunbright MENP-30T) to generate an amide bond. Alternatively, the peptide may contain an aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide group.","In a second example, peptide carboxylic acid groups (including, e.g., side chain and C-terminal carboxylic acid groups) can be activated with various reagents (including, e.g., 1-ethyl-3-(3\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide+EDC). The activated peptides can then be coupled to amine-containing PEG reagents (including, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. No. Sunbright MEPA-30T).","Alkylation and Reductive Alkylation.","Peptide-PEG conjugates may be prepared by alkylation by reacting an amine (or aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide) and an aldehyde. In some embodiments, including, e.g., the reaction of an aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide, the alkylation product is not reduced. In other embodiments, Peptide-PEG conjugates may be prepared by reductive alkylation by reacting an amine (or aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide) and an aldehyde in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, or by reacting an amine (or aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide) and an aldehyde followed by reduction with a suitable reducing agent to generate a stable carbon-nitrogen single bond, e.g., as described in Examples 12, 14, 16, 27-29, and 31-34.","In a first example, a peptide containing a side chain or free N-terminal amine group can be coupled with a PEG containing an aldehyde group. PEG aldehydes are commercially available (including, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. No. Sunbright ME-300AL). Another exemplary PEG aldehyde is polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono C-Calkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,714. In general, the PEG containing an aldehyde group may have a single reactive aldehyde group.","In a second example, peptides containing a hydroxylamine, hydrazine, or hydrazide group can be readily reacted with PEG-aldehydes. (Peptides containing an aminooxy, hydrazine, or hydrazide group can be prepared by standard methods known to those skilled in the art such as those described in Example 39.) In some embodiments, the resulting product is reduced. In other embodiments, the resulting product is not reduced.","In a third example, peptide aldehydes are reacted with amine-containing PEG reagents (such as, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. No. MEPA 30T). Peptide aldehydes can be readily generated, for example as described herein in Example 12, or by incorporation of an aldehyde-containing amino acid.","Thioalkylation.","Peptides containing a free thiol functional group (e.g., from a cysteine amino acid residue) can readily react with a PEG functionalized with an electrophile such as, e.g., maleimide (such as, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. No. ME-300MA) or \u03b1-haloacyl, including haloacetyl, including iodoacetyl, to form a thioether bond. Alternatively, peptides containing an electrophilic functional group (including, e.g., a maleimide, which can be prepared by standard methods known to those skilled in the art) can be reacted with thiol-containing PEG groups (such as, e.g., NOF Corp. (Japan) Cat. No. ME-300SH). Suitable electrophilic functional groups are known to those of skill in the art.","Other Conjugation Chemistries.","There are a number of PEG attachment methods available to those skilled in the art and described in, for example, EP 0 401 384; Malik et al., 20:1028-1035 (1992); Francis, 3(2):4-10 (1992); EP 0 154 316; EP 0 401 384; WO 92\/16221; and WO 95\/34326. Other possible methods for PEG-peptide conjugation include, e.g., the use of azide-alkyne chemistry (e.g., as described in 125:3192-3193 (2003)). In certain embodiments, a PEG thioester may be reacted with a peptide bearing an N-terminal cysteine residue, e.g., as described in Dawson and Kent, 69:923 (2000).","(2) Pegylation Sites","Anti-FcRn peptides described herein may be pegylated at any suitable position of the peptide, as described infra. In some embodiments, the anti-FcRn peptides may be pegylated at multiple positions.","N-Terminus.","Peptides having an amine group at the N-terminus may be pegylated at the N-terminus, e.g., by any suitable conjugation method described supra.","Addition of N-Terminal Reactive Groups.","In some embodiments, one or more reactive groups may be added to the N-terminus of an anti-FcRn peptide of the invention. In some embodiments, the reactive groups will be amino acid sidechains. For example, an acetyl-capped lysine residue may be added to the N-terminus, resulting in a side chain amine group that may be pegylated. In other embodiments, multiple pegylation sites may be introduced by adding an amino acid having an amine-containing side chain to the N-terminus. For example, a lysine residue may be added to the free amine of Peptide No. 285 to generate two available amine sites for pegylation (the lysine \u03b1- and \u03b5-amino groups). Reaction of the lysine-containing product with suitably-activated PEGs (such as, e.g., the aldehyde-containing PEGs described infra) can afford a PEG-peptide conjugate having 2 PEG moieties per peptide, as illustrated in .","N-Terminal Linker.","Monomeric peptides may be multimerized with an N-terminal linker containing a reactive group, e.g., as described in Examples 12, 13, and 15. For example, Peptides Nos. 100, 119, 120, 121, 160, 199 and 200 have an N-terminal linker containing a carboxylic acid group that can be pegylated and Peptide Nos. 285 and 286 have N-terminal linker containing an amine group that can be pegylated.","C-Terminus.","Peptides having a carboxylic acid group at the C-terminus may be pegylated at the C-terminus, e.g., by any suitable conjugation method described supra.","In other embodiments, peptides may be synthesized on an amine-containing resin (such as, e.g., 1,2-diaminoethane trityl PS, Novabiochem Cat. No. 01-64-0081) to yield a C-terminal amine group.","Addition of C-Terminal Reactive Groups.","In some embodiments, one or more reactive groups for pegylation may be added to the C-terminus of an anti-FcRn peptide of the invention. In some embodiments, the reactive groups will be amino acid sidechains. For example, a lysine residue having a C-terminal amide group may be added to the C-terminus, resulting in a side chain amine group that may be pegylated. In other embodiments, multiple pegylation sites may be introduced by adding an amino acid having an amine-containing side chain to the C-terminus. For example, a glutamic acid residue may be added to the C-terminus to generate two available carboxylic acid sites for pegylation (the glutamic acid \u03b1- and \u03b3-carboxyl groups). Addition of a reactive group to the C-terminus is not predicted to substantially hinder the activity of the anti-FcRn peptide, based upon the peptide truncation studies described in Example 7.","C-Terminal Linker.","Monomeric peptides may be multimerized with a C-terminal linker containing a reactive group, e.g., as described in Example 12. For example, Peptide No. 278 has a C-terminal linker containing an amine group that can be pegylated.","Side Chain(s).","In some embodiments, the reactive group may be located in, e.g., an amino acid side chain (including, e.g., amino acids containing a side chain amine such as, e.g., 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, and lysine; amino acids containing a side chain carboxylic acid such as, e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and amino acids containing a side chain thiol group such as, e.g., cysteine and penicillamine).","In certain embodiments, the peptide described herein comprises an amino acid side chain that may be pegylated.","In other embodiments, suitable pegylation sites may be obtained by replacement of one or more amino acids of a given sequence with an amino acid containing a desired reactive group. For example, because the peptide alanine scan studies described in Example 7 indicated that the arginine-2, threonine-5, and proline-13 residues of Peptide No. 501 could be substituted for alanine without significant loss in in vitro potency, it is possible that 1, 2, or all of those amino acids could also be replaced by an amino acid containing a desired reactive group without significant loss in in vitro potency. In some embodiments, the arginine-2, threonine-5, and proline-13 residues of Peptide No. 1 may be replaced by, e.g., amino acids containing a side chain amine such as, e.g., 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, and lysine; amino acids containing a side chain carboxylic acid such as, e.g., aspartic acid and glutamic acid; and amino acids containing a side chain thiol group such as, e.g., cysteine). In some embodiments, such a substitution may result in a peptide with no loss in in vitro potency, as compared to the original peptide, or in at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 97, 98, or 99% of the in vitro potency of the original peptide, as measured by, e.g., the IgG-peptide competition assay as described in Example 4, Biacore, or KinExA (Kinetic Exclusion Assay).","(3) Incorporation of Pegylated Building Blocks","In other embodiments, the peptides described herein may be synthesized by incorporation of amino acid building blocks comprising PEG moieties.","In some embodiments, peptides of the invention are provided as conjugates, including, e.g., covalent and non-covalent conjugates, comprising a peptide and a second molecule, which may be, e.g., a protein, a peptide, a small molecule, a polymer, or a nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the second molecule may confer a desired property to a peptide described herein, such as, e.g., extended half-life, stability, and\/or enhanced transport. In some embodiments, the second molecule may enhance the efficacy of a peptide of the invention, as measured by, e.g., the IgG competition ELISA as shown in Example 4. In some embodiments, the second molecule may enhance the efficacy of a peptide of the invention, as measured by, e.g., overall reduction in serum IgG levels in cynomolgus monkeys or by comparison of the frequency of administration of conjugated peptide needed to obtain a particular therapeutic effect, as compared to the unconjugated peptide. In further embodiments, for example, the second molecule may result in targeting of the peptide to a particular cell, tissue, and\/or organ.","In some embodiments, the conjugates may have an increased ability to block the IgG-FcRn. In other embodiments, the conjugates may protect the peptide from degradation and thus enhance the in vivo efficacy of the peptide. In some embodiments, the conjugates may have increased circulation half-lives. In further embodiments, such conjugates may be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than a peptide of the invention. In other embodiments, conjugates may facilitate purification.","In some embodiments, the second molecule of a conjugated peptide of the invention may be an Fc domain of IgG or a fragment thereof. The IgG may be, e.g., human IgG, such as, e.g., human IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4. In some embodiments, the IgG is an altered or mutated IgG, such as, e.g., a Pro331Ser Fcvariant, Leu235Ala Fcvariant, Leu234Val Fcvariant, Leu235Ala Fcvariant, or Pro331Ser Fcvariant. In some embodiments, the second molecule may be an IgG fragment that comprises, e.g., hinge, CH2, and\/or CH3 domains.","In some embodiments, the second molecule of a conjugated peptide of the invention may be albumin, an albumin fragment, or an albumin-binding molecule (such as, e.g., peptides, proteins, and molecules including, e.g., long alkyl chains, that bind non-covalently to albumin). Such conjugates may have longer in vivo half-lives and may thus require a lower peptide doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. See, e.g., Chuang et al., 19:569 (2002); U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,179.","Conjugates of the peptides of the invention with proteins, peptides, small molecules, polymers, or nucleic acids may be prepared according to any of the conjugation chemistries known in the art or described herein. For example, in some embodiments, peptides may be capped by a hydrophobic aromatic capping reagents for non-covalent binding to albumin as in, e.g., Zobel et al., 13:1513 (2003). In other embodiments, peptides modified with thiol-reactive groups can be used for covalent conjugation to free cysteine residues as in, e.g., Kim et al., 52:751 (2003). In further embodiments, a peptide of the invention containing an aldehyde may be reacted with a second molecule by reductive alkylation reaction as in, e.g., Kinstler, 54:477 (2002). Alternatively, where the second molecule is a protein or a peptide having an N-terminal cysteine, a peptide thioester may be reacted with the second molecule to form a covalent conjugate as described in, e.g., Dawson and Kent, 69:923 (2000). Peptide-protein and peptide-peptide conjugates may also, in certain embodiments where all amino acids are encoded amino acids, be prepared by expression in an appropriate host cell.","A conjugate comprising the peptide of any one of embodiments 1 to 75 and a second molecule.","The conjugate of embodiment 76, wherein the second molecule is chosen from albumin, transferrin, and the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin.","The conjugate of embodiment 77, wherein the second molecule is the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin.","The conjugate of embodiment 78, wherein the immunoglobulin is chosen from IgG, IgG, IgG, and IgG.","In some embodiments, the peptides of the invention are not derivatized.

Phage display libraries may be readily generated as described in Smith and Petrenko, 87:391 (1997). Alternatively, phage display libraries may be acquired from a commercial source, such as, e.g., Dyax Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.). Depending on the screening conditions, phage may be identified with a variety of different properties. To identify peptides that bind to FcRn (and thus compete with IgG for FcRn binding), a phage library may be screened for binding to FcRn and by competition with IgG. Optionally, peptides that bind to alternate receptors may be eliminated from the library by incubating the phage library with one or more alternate receptors. Thus, phage that bound the alternate receptor(s) would be depleted from the desired pool of phage. By sequencing the DNA of phage clones capable of binding to FcRn, peptides capable of binding to FcRn and inhibiting IgG-FcRn binding may be identified.","Examples of other methods to identify FcRn-binding peptides include: mRNA display (Roberts and Szostak, 94:12297 (1997), cell-based display (Boder and Wittrup, 15:553 (1997), and synthetic peptide libraries (Lam, 354:82 (1991); Houghten et al., Nature 354:84 (1991)).","A number of methods may be used to assess the ability of a peptide or peptidomimetic to bind FcRn and block the FcRn:IgG interaction. For example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a method well known in the art to evaluate binding events (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Using this method, one of the binding partners (FcRn or IgG) is immobilized on the SPR sensor chip and while the other binding partner is passed over the chip, which is monitored for a resulting signal. In the same experiment, the peptide to be evaluated as a competitor of the interaction between IgG and FcRn is passed over the chip. Any decrease in signal may be interpreted as a measure of the peptide's ability to block the interaction between FcRn and IgG.","Other methods for assaying for possible peptide inhibitors of the IgG:FcRn interaction are also well known in the art. One such method is an IgG competition assay in a 96-well plate format. In this example assay, soluble human FcRn on a 96-well plate is exposed to IgG and a test peptide. Residual bound IgG, as detected by an anti-IgG antibody and standard ELISA visualization reagents, provide a measure of the peptide's ability to block the FcRn-IgG interaction.","The ability of a peptide to block IgG-FcRn binding may also be carried out on cells transfected with DNA encoding a human FcRn to develop a cell line capable of expressing human FcRn on its cell surface. A binding competition assay may be applied where peptide inhibitors of IgG-FcRn binding compete with a fluorescently labeled IgG molecule. The level of residual IgG bound to the cells may be measured using, e.g., a standard fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS).","The peptides of the invention bind FcRn and inhibit the Fc portion of the IgG constant region from binding to FcRn resulting in increased catabolism of IgG in comparison to the catabolism of IgG in the absence of peptides of the invention. In exemplary embodiments, the IgG constant region is from the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 subclasses.","The peptides of the invention may be used in the manufacture of a medicament (pharmaceutical composition) for the treatment of any disease or condition where increased catabolism of IgG may be desired.

Phage Titer","Phage solutions were diluted in 100-fold steps. Typically 2 \u03bcl of phage solution was added to 198 \u03bcL of NZCYM broth in a serial manner to achieve dilutions of up to 10. Diluted phage were added to a culture of XL1 Blue MRF' cells when the XL1 Blue MRF' cells were being grown in log phase and reached an optical density of 0.5 at A600 (UV absorbance at 600 nm). The culture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Afterwards, 0.5 ml of the infected cells were added to 3.5 ml of molten top agar (a 50\/50 mix of LB broth and LB agar) at approximately 55\u00b0 C. and spread onto a standard agar plate and incubated overnight at 37 degrees. The titer was calculated from a plate containing 30 to 300 plaques.

Plates were incubated for 14 to 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Colonies that formed overnight were scraped gently with a spreading bar in the presence of 20 ml of PBS. PBS-containing bacteria and phage were collected in a centrifuge tube. Bacteria remaining on the plate were scraped again in the presence of 10 ml PBS and collected. A final 10 ml PBS rinse was applied to the plate, and pooled together with all scraped material. The bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation (15 minutes at 3500 rpm), and the clear supernatant was decanted into another centrifuge tube, clarified again, and finally decanted again. Then, a 0.15 mL volume of 17% PEG+3M NaCl was added to the supernatant, which was mixed and stored overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The precipitated phage collected by centrifugation (8500\u00d7g for 30 minutes), after which, the supernatant was discarded. The phage pellet was resuspended in a small volume of PBS, clarified with a brief spin, and precipitated again with a 0.15 volume of 17% PEG+3M NaCl.

Biotinylation of shFcRn was accomplished by treating the dialyzed shFcRn with a 2-fold-molar excess of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Afterwards, the shFcRn-Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin reaction mixture was dialyzed twice in 2 L of cold PBS, followed by another absorbance reading to determine the concentration of the remaining protein. The biotinylated shFcRn was stored at 4\u00b0 C. with 0.1% sodium azide until needed.","B. Peptide-IgG Competition ELISA assay","96-well ReactiBind Neutravidin-coated plates blocked with BSA (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) were washed twice with 200 \u03bcl\/well of Buffer A (Buffer A: PBS pH 7.4 (Gibco, 14040), 0.5% BSA IgG-free, 0.05% Tween-20). The wells were coated with 100 \u03bcl\/well of 1 \u03bcg\/ml biotinylated-shFcRn in Buffer A. The plate was sealed and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Afterwards, the plate was washed with 200 \u03bcl\/well of Buffer B (Buffer B: 100 mM MES pH 6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% BSA IgG-free (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.), 0.05% Tween-20). Then, 50 \u03bcl\/well of 6 nM human IgG (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.) in Buffer B as well as 50 \u03bcl\/well of the various peptide competitors (at various concentration) were added, so that the final concentration of IgG in the well was 3 nM. To allow for mixing, the plate was rocked for 2 minutes, sealed and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Following the incubation, the liquid was aspirated from the plate and 100 \u03bcl\/well of a 1:10 000 dilution of Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab\u2032) fragment-specific F(ab\u2032)fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) in Buffer B was added. The plate was covered, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with 200 \u03bcl\/well of ice-cold buffer B. SureBlue TMB substrate solution (100 \u03bcl\/well, KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) was added and the plate was allowed to incubate at room temperature until color developed, which took 5 to 10 minutes. Once color developed, 100 \u03bcl\/well of TMB stop solution (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The data was plotted as absorbance vs. peptide concentration to derive the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC) values.","In addition to using the ELISA approach described in Example 4 to determine whether the peptides of the invention that were derived from the screening of the filamentous phage display libraries were also able to block the binding of IgG to FcRn on cells, the following fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) assay was devised and performed.","A. Labeling of Synagis\u00ae with Alexa-Fluor-488","Humanized IgG1 (Synagis\u00ae, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, Md.) was labeled with the Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes\/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of 1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0 was added to 500 of a 2 mg\/ml solution of IgG in PBS. This protein solution was added to the Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (dry powder) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using the kit component column (Bio-Rad BioGel P-30 Fine size exclusion purification resin). The sample was loaded onto the column and eluted with PBS. The first colored band contained the labeled protein. The degree of labeling was determined by measuring the absorbance of the eluted IgG at 280 nm and 494 nm. The protein molar concentration was determined using the formula: protein concentration (M)=[A\u2212(A\u00d70.11)\u00d7dilution factor]\/203,000. In addition, the formula used to derive the moles of dye per mole of protein was: =A\u00d7dilution factor\/71,000\u00d7protein concentration (M). Typically, 4-7 moles of Alexa-Fluor 488 were incorporated per mole of IgG.","B. IgG-Peptide Competition FACS Assay Using 293 Clone 11 Cells","In preparation for the assay, HEK 293 clone 11 cells (Example 2) in complete DMEM media (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing 5 \u03bcg\/ml Blasticidin and 250 \u03bcg\/ml G418 (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) were spun down and resuspended in Buffer C (Buffer C: Dulbecco's PBS (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing 10 mM EDTA (Gibco)) at a concentration of 3\u00d710cells\/ml. Cells (0.1 ml) were pipetted into each well of a 96-well assay plate and the plates were centrifuged at 2600 RPM for 5 min using a Sorvall RT7 benchtop centrifuge. The supernatants were gently decanted and the plate was blotted on a paper towel. Peptide competitors (90 \u03bcl) solubilized in Buffer C at various concentrations were added to the plate and mixed with a multi-channel pipette. 10 \u03bcl of Alexa 488-labeled Synagis\u00ae was added to each well on the plate, such that the final concentration of Alexa 488-labeled Synagis\u00ae was 100 nM. The plate was wrapped in foil, placed on ice for one hour and subsequently centrifuged at 2600 rpm for 5 minutes in a Sorvall RT7 benchtop centrifuge followed by a single wash with 100 \u03bcl of Buffer C and a second centrifugation step. The cells were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of Buffer C and analyzed on a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer.","The following steps were performed to cross-link soluble human or cynomolgus FcRn to the dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) by an amine coupling reaction involving 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as recommended by Biacore (BIAapplications Handbook, version AB, section 4.2, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The FcRn protein was diluted in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) to a concentration of 10 to 30 \u03bcg\/ml and used to coat one flow cell on the sensor chip. Residual sites on the FcRn flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride pH 8.5 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). A control flow cell was blocked with ethanolamine for reference subtraction. For analysis of the monomeric peptides, FcRn was coated to a final density of 4000-5000 response units (RU). For analysis of the peptide dimers, FcRn was coated to a density of 2000-2500 RU. All SPR measurements were performed using a BIACORE 3000 Instrument (Biacore AB Uppsala, Sweden). For measurements done at either pH 6 or pH 7.4, experiments were performed in 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% surfactant P20 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden).","A. Representative Procedure for the Determination of Binding Constant of Monomeric Peptides","Ten 2-fold dilutions of the peptide were injected over the FcRn-CM5 chip at a rate of 20 \u03bcl\/min for 2 min. The peptide was dissociated from the chip for 2.5 minutes with buffer. Any remaining peptide was removed from the chip with a 30 second injection of HBS-P buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a rate of 30 \u03bcl\/min. Sensorgrams were generated and analyzed using BiaEval software version 3.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The equilibrium RU observed for each injection was plotted against concentration. The equilibrium Kvalues were derived by analysis of the plots using the steady state affinity model included in the BiaEval software.","B. Representative Procedure for Determination of Binding Constant of Dimeric Peptides","Ten, 2-fold dilutions of the peptide were injected over the FcRn-CM5 chip at a rate of 30 \u03bcl\/min for 10 min. Peptides were dissociated from the chip for 10 minutes with buffer. Any remaining peptide was removed from the chip with two, 60 second injections of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-hydrochloride, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% surfactant P20 pH 9.0 at 100 \u03bcl\/min.","Sensorgrams were generated and analyzed using BiaEval software version 3.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The equilibrium RU observed for each injection was plotted against concentration. The equilibrium Kvalues were derived by analysis of the plots using the steady state affinity model included in the BiaEval software.","Synthesis of monomeric peptides was performed using solid-phase peptide synthesis either manually with a flitted round bottom flask or by using an Advanced Chemtech 396-omega synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky.). Standard Fmoc\/tBu protocols were used (W. C. Chan and P. D. White eds., Oxford University Press Inc. New York (2000)), in combination with a Rink amide resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) or PAL-PEG-PS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) to yield C-terminal amides upon cleavage. The coupling reagents were 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.). The base was diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was the solvent (EM Science, Kansas City, Mo.). The typical synthesis cycle involved 2\u00d710 minute deprotection steps with 20% piperidine in DMF, 2\u00d730 minute amino acid couplings with HOBt\/HBTU and a 10 minute capping step with acetic anhydride\/HOBt. Peptides were cleaved from the resin by treatment for 2 hours with 95% trifluoroacetic acid; 2.5% ethanedithiol; 1.5% triisopropylsilane and 1% water and precipitated with ice-cold ether, centrifuged and triturated three times with ether.","Crude cysteine-containing peptides were oxidized to their corresponding disulfides by dissolving the peptides to a concentration of 1 mg\/ml in a 4:1 mixture of acetic acid and water (EM Science, Kansas City, Mo.). Ten molar equivalents of iodine (1M solution in water, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) were added to the solution and the reaction mixture was mixed for one hour at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the progressive addition of 1 M sodium thiosulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) until a clear solution was obtained. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and subsequently purified using a Waters Prep600 reversed phase HPLC system (Millford, Mass.) equipped with a 250 mm\u00d721.2 mm Phenomenex (Torrence Calif.) C18 column. The eluent chosen for the HPLC purification step was a gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% (w\/v) TFA. Appropriate fractions were collected, pooled and lyophilized. Peptide identity and purity was confirmed by reversed phase analytical HPLC in combination with a 250 mm\u00d72 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrence, Calif.) coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (Mariner ES-MS) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.).","Table 2 provides a listing of the original phage peptide sequences derived from the screen of the peptide expression library used to identify peptides with a high affinity for human FcRn and the ability to block the IgG-FcRn interaction.

The purified reduced peptide is dissolved to ca. 0.1 mg\/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 with 20% DMSO and mixed for 3 days at room temperature. This oxidation step permits the formation of the disulfide bonds within one peptide monomer of the dimer, as opposed to between two monomers of a dimer. The reaction mixture is diluted with water to peptide concentration of 0.05 mg\/mL and purified over a C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters Corp., Milford, Mass.) using an increasing gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% TFA. The peptide dimer was lyophilized and subjected to analysis by mass spectroscopy (Mariner ES-MS) following liquid chromatography (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) as described in Example 7. (See .) In the case of Peptide No. 283, the disulfide linkage pattern was confirmed by digesting the peptide with trypsin for 30 minutes, then analyzing the resulting peptides by LCMS. Trypsin is known to cleave after arginine and lysine residues, and cleaves Peptide No. 283 at the arginine-phenylalanine bond, The major product of LCMS of Peptide No. 283 is NH-(Phe Phe-Pen-Thr-Gly-His-Phe-Gly-Sar-NMeLeu-Tyr-Pro-Cys]-CONH(disulfide) (SEQ ID NO:294) (LCMS: M+H=1355.6 Da), which indicates that the disulfide bonds of Peptide No. 283 are formed intramolecularly within each 13 amino acid peptide monomer.","Peptide No. 201 was synthesized as Peptide No: 283 with the exceptions that the peptide sequence was analogous to Peptide No. 32, the diacid linker used was ethylene glycol-bis(succinic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) and that no PyBOP was used for the coupling reaction.","Peptide No. 279 was synthesized as in Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the diacid linker used was Bis-dPEG6-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Quanta Biodesigns Ltd.) and that no PyBOP was used for the coupling reaction.","Peptide No. 281 was synthesized as Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the peptide-resin was treated with a large excess of succinic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.), which results in all peptides on the resin containing a succinate capped N-terminus. This resin was treated with 0.5 equivalents of N,N\u2032-dimethylethyl-enediamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) in the presence of 1 equivalent of PyBOP and 2 equivalents of DIEA. The subsequent cleavage, purification and oxidation steps were performed as with Peptide No. 283.","Peptide No. 282 was synthesized as Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the diacid linker used was N-methyl-iminodiacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.).","Peptide No. 284 was synthesized as Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the diacid linker used was 3,3-dimethylglutaric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.).","Peptide No. 285 was synthesized as Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the diacid linker used was Boc-Asp(OH)\u2014OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.).","Peptide No. 286 was synthesized as Peptide No. 283 with the exception that the diacid linker used was Boc-Glu(OH)\u2014OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.).","C-terminally linked peptide dimers were synthesized as described above in Example 7 for the synthesis of monomeric peptide disulfides with the exception that a bifunctional amine linker is coupled to the resin prior to the peptide synthesis. This results in peptide dimers with their C-termini covalently attached by amide bonds. For example, Peptide No. 280 was synthesized by first coupling Fmoc-Lys(Fmoc)-OH (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) to the resin, followed by the coupling of amino acids to give a sequence analogous to Peptide No. 235. This results in the covalent attachment of two peptide chains as they are being synthesized on the resin. The resulting peptide dimer is cleaved from the resin, purified and oxidized as described above for the N-terminally linked dimers (see ).","Peptide No. 287 was synthesized as Peptide No. 280 with the exception that a glycine residue (Gly) is inserted between the Peptide No. 235 sequence and the branching Lysine linker.","Peptide No. 288 was synthesized as Peptide No. 280 with the exceptions that two glycine residues (Gly-Gly) are inserted between the Peptide No. 235 sequence and the branching lysine linker.","Table 24 provides a listing of dimeric peptides of the invention that contain amide
