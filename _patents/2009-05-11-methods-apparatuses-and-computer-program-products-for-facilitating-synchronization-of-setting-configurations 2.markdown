{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present application claims priority to India Patent Application No. 471\/DEL\/2009, filed on Mar. 9, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.","Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to communication technology and, more particularly, relate to methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for facilitating synchronization of setting configurations.","The modern communications era has brought about a tremendous expansion of wireline and wireless networks. Computer networks, television networks, and telephony networks are experiencing an unprecedented technological expansion, fueled by consumer demand. Wireless and mobile networking technologies have addressed related consumer demands, while providing more flexibility and immediacy of information transfer.","Current and future networking technologies as well as evolved computing devices making use of networking technologies continue to facilitate ease of information transfer and convenience to users. One area in which there is a demand to further improve ease of information transfer is facilitating synchronization of setting configurations across multiple services accessed by a consumer with a computing device and\/or across multiple computing devices used by the consumer.","In this regard, consumers often use their computing device(s) to access a multitude of services, such as over a network. Each of these services may require or may at least provide the ability for a consumer to configure one or more settings for the service, which may control, for example, how the service is provided to the consumer's computing device. Some of these configuration settings, such as email notification settings, may not be unique to a single service, and as such may be applicable across multiple services. Hence, it would be helpful to the consumer if there was a way to synchronize common setting configurations between services so that the consumer would only have to configure a common setting configuration setting once, regardless of how many services the consumer uses.","Some consumers may use multiple computing devices to access a service. In this regard, a consumer may, for example, access a service with a first computer from his office, a second computer from his home, and a mobile terminal when in transit. Although each device may have unique characteristics and capabilities, there may be unique service usage settings or preferences defining how the service is to be provided to the consumer that the consumer would like to be applied to each of the devices used to access the service. Hence, it would be helpful to the consumer if there was a way to synchronize common setting configurations between devices so that the consumer would only have to configure a common setting configuration setting once, even if the consumer uses multiple devices to access the service. Unfortunately, with existing technologies, the consumer may be required to configure the appropriate settings on each device that he uses to access the service.","Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for facilitating synchronization of setting configurations.","A method, apparatus, and computer program product are therefore provided for facilitating synchronization of setting configurations. In this regard, a method, apparatus, and computer program product are provided that may provide several advantages to computing devices, computing device users, and service providers. As such, then, some embodiments of the invention provide several advantages to computing devices, computing device users, and service providers. The synchronization performed by embodiments of the invention streamlines usage of services and\/or access to data by users having multiple user devices used to access services and\/or data. Further, embodiments of the invention enable synchronization of setting configurations between multiple services so that a user only has to configure a setting for one service and the setting is then synchronized to other services. Embodiments of the invention further provide for backup of setting configurations, as setting configurations for a first user device can be synchronized to another user device of the user or back to the first user device, such as if the memory of the first user device is corrupted.","In a first exemplary embodiment, a method is provided, which may include configuring a setting on a first user device. The method may further include generating, with a settings management unit embodied on the first user device, a settings data package comprising the setting configuration. The method may additionally include sending the settings data package to a settings management service for synchronization of the setting configuration to at least one of a service or a second user device. The settings management service may be configured to synchronize the setting configuration by distributing the settings data package to the at least one of a service or a second user device.","In another exemplary embodiment, a method is provided, which may include receiving, at a settings management service, a settings data package generated by a first user device. The settings data package may comprise a setting configuration. The method may additionally include synchronizing the setting configuration to at least one of a service or a second user device by distributing the settings data package to the at least one of a service or a second user device.","In another exemplary embodiment, an apparatus is provided, which may include a processor and a memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor cause the apparatus to configure a setting on the apparatus. The instructions when executed by the processor may further cause the apparatus to generate a settings data package comprising the setting configuration. The instructions when executed by the processor may additionally cause the apparatus to send the settings data package to a settings management service for synchronization of the setting configuration to at least one of a service or a remote user device. The settings management service may be configured to synchronize the setting configuration by distributing the settings data package to the at least one of a service or a remote user device.","In another exemplary embodiment, an apparatus is provided, which may include a processor and a memory storing instructions that when executed by the processor cause the apparatus to receive a settings data package generated by a first user device.

The computer program product includes at least one computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program instructions stored therein. The computer-readable program instructions may include a plurality of program instructions. Although in this summary, the program instructions are ordered, it will be appreciated that this summary is provided merely for purposes of example and the ordering is merely to facilitate summarizing the computer program product.

In some embodiments, the settings control panel unit  may provide a central UI, such as a web UI, through which one or more service UI widgets may be accessed by a user of a user device . Some service providers may provide multiple service UI widgets for a given service, each of which may be tailored for a specific use scenario (e.g., dependent upon a location of a user device , identity of a user using user device  accessing the service UI widget, or other criteria).","Accordingly, for example, a user of a user device  may navigate to and\/or otherwise access a central UI provided by the settings control panel unit , select a service UI widget for a service, and configure one or more settings using the service UI widget. The service provider providing the service UI widget and\/or the settings control panel unit  may be configured to handle any error and validation checks for settings configured via the selected service UI widget. When a service UI widget is not available for a service requested by a user, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to generate a failure or other error message and send the message to the user device  such that it may be presented to the user over the user interface .","In at least some embodiments, service providers integrating their services with the settings management service  so as to enable centralized settings configuration and\/or settings synchronization according to embodiments of the present invention may register with the settings management service  and\/or with an account management provider .  illustrates a diagram of a plurality of services registering with the settings management service  according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention such that the settings management service may implement and\/or provide each service's service UI widget. In this regard, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to provide a service registration client  that facilitates service providers, such as, for example, the media service provider , chat service provider , social networking service provider , data storage service provider , and account management provider  illustrated in  to specify service UI widget information. Service providers may, for example, provide the service registration client  settings names, settings types, a uniform resource locator (URL) for a service provided by the service provider, a name of the service, a description of the service, a service UI widget, a URL for a service UI widget that the settings control panel unit  may access to provide the service UI widget to a user, authentication information for the service (e.g., authorization and\/or login information enabling the service provider to access and specify the settings information and\/or service UI widget(s) that it has registered to the settings management service ), and\/or the like. Once a service provider has registered with the settings management service , the service registration client  may be further configured to provide an interface enabling service providers to update and\/or delete settings information and\/or service UI widgets that the service provider previously specified. Additionally, the service registration client  may be configured to provide an interface enabling service providers to unregister from the settings management service .","Once a service provider has registered a service to the service registration client  and configured a service UI widget, the service UI widget may be accessed by a user of a user device  from the central UI . Referring to the example of , a media service provider , chat service provider , social networking service provider , data storage service provider , and account management provider  have registered with the service registration client  and configured, respectively, the media service UI widget , chat service UI widget , social networking service widget , data storage service widget , and account management provider UI widget . A user of a user device  may access one of these service UI widgets via the central UI  and configure one or more settings for the respective service with which the service UI widget is associated.","The settings control panel unit  and\/or memory  may be configured to implement a settings widget framework  configured to allow a plurality of service UI widgets for various services to be stored collectively, such as in memory . The settings widget framework  may further be configured to provide for implementation of the plurality of service UI widgets such that, for example, a user of a user device  may access a respective service UI widget to configure a setting. In this regard, the settings widget framework  may provide a plug-in architecture facilitating implementation of a plurality of service UI widgets. The settings control panel unit  may additionally be configured to implement a service subscription entity , which may interface with the central UI  to provide the appropriate service UI widget to the central UI  when a particular service UI is to be rendered. In this regard, the service subscription entity  may be configured to manage a plurality of service UI widgets for service providers that have registered with the service registration client  and configured a service UI widget.","Security Policy Enforcement by Some Embodiments of the Invention","In embodiments wherein the system  comprises a portion of a system for providing a plurality of services to users of computing devices and having an account management provider , such as illustrated in , the settings management service  and each service provider may implement a security and\/or sign-on protocol in accordance with a protocol specified by the account management provider . In this regard, the account management provider  may control or otherwise facilitate access to the settings management service  by both user devices  and service providers. Each service provider and\/or user of a user device  may have unique sign-on information so as to access the settings management service , which may comprise, for example, a consumer key and consumer secret (e.g., in accordance with OAuth signing). Thus, a service provider and\/or a user device  may invoke the settings management service  in the role of a consumer of settings.","In some embodiments, consumers of the settings management service may possess an \u201caccess token,\u201d which may comprise a tuple with information. Consumers may further possess a \u201ctoken secret\u201d that is associated with the access token and\/or a \u201cconsumer secret\u201d unique to the consumer. The account management provider  may store or have access to a copy of the access token, token secret, and\/or consumer secret to facilitate sign-on and verification of a consumer. The access token may bind an authenticated user session (e.g., a user session of the account management provider ) to a consumer (e.g., a user of a user device , a user device , service provider, or the like) and a service (e.g., the settings management service ). The consumer may then present the access token to the settings management service  when it invokes the settings management service. The settings control panel unit  may be configured to dereference the access token and send it to the account management provider . The account management provider  may be configured to use the access token to retrieve information about the authenticated user, the associated consumer key, and associated token secret and send this information to the settings management service . This information may then be used for validation of the consumer by the settings management service , as the access token, itself, is not secret and on its own should not be considered sufficient for resource access in embodiments wherein a secure access policy is enforced by an account management provider  or by the settings management service . Accordingly, when the consumer sends any settings management service request message (e.g., to change a configuration setting, set up a service UI widget, and\/or the like) to the settings management service , the consumer may sign the message with the token secret and\/or the consumer secret. The settings control panel unit  may then verify the authenticity of the settings management service request message by using the token secret and consumer secret obtained from the account management provider  to authenticate the settings management service request message (e.g., to ensure that the token secret and consumer secret used to sign the message by the consumer are the same as those provided to the settings management service  by the account management provider  and known to be authentic).","Synchronization of Setting Configurations","In at least some embodiments, a user of a user device  may access a settings configuration user interface, such as a central UI widget and\/or a service UI widget provided by the settings management service  and\/or a service provider. This user interface may be retrieved by the settings management unit  over the network  from the settings management service  or may be locally available in the memory , such as when the user device  is not actively connected to the network . The user may then use the user interface  to provide input to the user device  to configure one or more settings. Once the user has completed configuration of a setting(s), the settings management unit  may be configured to generate a settings data package comprising a setting configuration newly configured or changed by the user such that notice of the setting configuration may be sent to the settings management service .","In some embodiments, the user may additionally explicitly designate one or more services and\/or one or more other user devices  (e.g., other user devices  owned or used by the user) that the user would like the newly configured setting configuration(s) to be synchronized to. Additionally or alternatively, such designation may be based on existing account settings of the user (e.g., an account with the account management provider  and\/or with the settings management service ) and\/or based on a service provider associated with a setting configured by the user. The settings management unit  may accordingly be further configured to generate the settings data package to comprise an indication of user devices  and\/or service providers to which the settings management service  is to synchronize the setting configuration contained in the settings data package.","In an exemplary embodiment, the settings data package comprises an extensible markup language (XML)-based package. This package may comprise a plurality of fields that provide routing information to enable the settings management service  to synchronize a setting configuration contained in the settings data package to another user device  and\/or to a service provider. One such field may comprise a \u201cglobally unique identification\u201d (GUID) field, which may comprise a unique identity to identify a setting corresponding to the setting configuration contained in the settings data package. In this regard, the settings management service  may assign a unique identity to each setting that may be configured through the settings management service. Another field may comprise a \u201cDevice\u201d field, which may comprise a unique identification of a user device  to which a settings data package is to be sent for synchronization by the settings management service. The settings control panel unit  and\/or synchronization server  may utilize the device field for routing purposes. The settings data package may additionally or alternatively comprise an \u201caddress\u201d field, which may comprise a unique identifier identifying a service provider to which a settings data package is to be sent for synchronization by the settings management service. The settings control panel unit  and\/or synchronization server  may accordingly utilize the address field for routing purposes. The settings data package may also comprise a field that facilitates a service provider's handling of a setting configuration included in the settings data package. For example, this field may identify a specific service provided by the service provider (this identity may be unique for each service and may be agreed upon between the settings management service  and service provider providing the service), a version of the service (if applicable), and an identity of a user to which the setting configuration is to be applied as known to the service. The settings data package may further comprise a \u201clast modified\u201d field, which may comprise a time stamp indicating when the setting configuration in the setting data package was configured, which can be used by the settings management service , a user device , and\/or a service provider to aid in synchronization of setting configurations. In this regard, if an entity of the system  has a locally stored setting configuration more recent that that contained in a received settings data package, the locally stored setting configuration should not be replaced with the older setting configuration included in the settings data package.","An example settings data package may be formatted in XML as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"182pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<setting>"]},{"entry":[{},"<guid>435235<\/guid>"]},{"entry":[{},"<device>Nokia N95<\/device>"]},{"entry":[{},"<address>1.0\/Phone-settings\/daniel<\/address>"]},{"entry":[{},"<lastmodified><\/lastmodified>"]},{"entry":[{},"<settingdata>"]},{"entry":[{},"phone-theme=my_theme"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/settingdata>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/setting>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Once the settings management unit  has generated a settings data package, it may be at least temporarily stored in the memory  prior to the settings management unit  sending the settings data package to the settings management service . The settings management unit  may be configured to send the settings data package automatically following generation and\/or in response to a request of a user of the user device . The settings management unit  may additionally or alternatively be configured to send the settings data package to the settings management service  at a scheduled synchronization time, which may comprise a time at which any settings data packages generated by the settings management unit  and stored in the memory  that have not previously been sent to the settings management service  are sent to and\/or retrieved by the settings management service. Additionally or alternatively, the settings management unit  may be configured to receive a request from the settings management service  (e.g., from the settings control panel unit  and\/or synchronization server ) to send any previously unsent settings data packages to the settings management service  for synchronization and to send unsent settings data packages in response to the request. In some embodiments, the settings management unit  may be configured to detect if an active network connection between the user device  and the network  is available and send an unsent settings data packet when a connection is available. An available connection may comprise a communications session between the user device  and a remote network device (e.g., a phone call with another device, text messaging another device, a peer-to-peer data transfer session, instant message session, and\/or the like).","In some embodiments, the settings management unit  may comprise a synchronization client, which may be configured to communicate with the synchronization server  and\/or settings control panel unit  to enable sending settings data packets to and\/or receiving settings data packets from the settings management service . Accordingly, sending a settings data package to the settings management service may comprise a synchronization client sending the settings data package. The synchronization client may be configured to send and receive settings data packages using SyncML, such as in embodiments wherein the synchronization server  utilizes SyncML.","In at least some embodiments, the settings management unit  is configured to receive a settings data package (e.g., a settings data package generated by the settings control panel unit ) from the settings management service . Receipt of a settings data package may be handled by a synchronization client and the settings data package may be received from the synchronization server . The settings data package may be formatted in accordance with the format previously outlined and thus may comprise a setting configuration and\/or an identified service(s) with which the setting configuration is associated. Upon receipt of the settings data package, the settings management unit  may determine the service(s) identified by the settings data package. The settings management unit  may then, if applicable, route the settings data package to an appropriate service handler entity (e.g., a service-specific application, web browser, settings management service widget, and\/or the like) embodied on the user device  that is used to locally access and\/or implement the identified service on the user device . The settings management unit  and\/or the service handler entity may then extract the setting configuration contained in the settings data package and implement the extracted setting configuration on the user device .","The settings management unit  may be further configured to store the extracted setting configuration and\/or the settings data package in the memory  for later referencing and\/or implementation by the settings management unit  and\/or by the appropriate service handler entity. In this regard, the settings data package and\/or setting configuration extracted from therein may be stored in a settings management service settings store (e.g., in memory ) in association with the service identified by the settings data package. The service handler entity used to access the service with which the stored setting configuration is implemented may then access the setting configuration from the settings management service settings store when the user of the user device  accesses the particular service (e.g., to implement the setting configuration).","In some embodiments wherein a settings data package received by the settings management unit  comprises a last modified field with timestamp, the settings management unit  may be configured to compare the timestamp of the settings data package to a timestamp associated with a configuration for the setting identified by the GUID that is currently implemented on the user device  to ensure that the received settings data package comprises a setting configuration more current than any existing configuration for the setting prior to implementing the received setting configuration.","In at least some embodiments, the synchronization server  and\/or the settings control panel unit  is configured to receive and\/or retrieve a settings data package from a user device . Upon receipt of the settings data package, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to extract data from data fields included in the settings data package (e.g., from a device field, address field, and\/or the like) and use the extracted information to synchronize the setting configuration included in the settings data package to a service provider and\/or user device  identified in the settings data package by distributing the settings data package to a service provider and\/or user device  identified in the settings data package. In order to distribute the settings data package for synchronization, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to forward the settings data package to the synchronization server  for distribution. The synchronization server  may then utilize routing information provided by the settings control panel unit  and\/or extract destination data from the settings data package itself prior to distributing the settings data package to a destination user device  and\/or destination service provider. Distributing the settings data package to a service provider may comprise sending the settings data package to a server computing device providing the service.","In some embodiments wherein a settings data package received by the settings control panel unit  comprises a last modified field with timestamp, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to compare the timestamp contained by the settings data package to a timestamp associated with a configuration for the setting identified by the GUID that is currently known and implemented by the settings management service  and\/or the associated service provider to ensure that the received settings data package comprises a setting configuration more current than any existing configuration for the setting prior to synchronizing the received setting configuration by distributing the settings data package. In this regard, the memory  or other memory accessible to the settings control panel unit  may comprise a service settings database containing a settings management service settings store for the configuration of the setting identified by the GUID and the settings control panel may compare the timestamp of the settings data package to the timestamp of the stored configuration for the setting. The stored configuration(s) may each be uniquely associated with a particular user and\/or user device  and thus the settings control panel unit  may be configured to look up the appropriate stored configuration based at least in part upon a user and\/or user device  identified in the settings data package.","In at least some embodiments, the settings control panel unit  is configured to provide a user interface (e.g., a central UI and\/or a service UI widget as described above) to facilitate a user of a user device  to configure one or more settings. Accordingly, the settings control panel unit  may be further configured to receive, via the user interface, an indication of a configuration of a setting made by the user. The configuration of the setting comprises a setting configuration. In response to receipt of the indication of a configuration of a setting, the settings control panel unit  may be configured to generate a settings data package comprising the setting configuration. The settings data package generated by the settings control panel unit  may be in accordance with the settings data package format described above and may comprise any one or more of the described fields. Accordingly, for example, the settings control panel unit  may include an address of a service provider with which the setting is associated, the GUID of the setting, information enabling the service provider to handle the setting configuration (e.g., an identity of the user and\/or user device  that configured the setting using the user interface), a timestamp indicating when the configuration was made and\/or when the settings data package was generated, and\/or an identification of a user device  (e.g., another user device  associated with the user that configured the setting to which the user wants the setting configuration synchronized).
