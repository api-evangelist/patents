title: Two stage catalytic combustor
abstract: A catalytic combustor () includes a first catalytic stage (), a second catalytic stage (), and an oxidation completion stage (). The first catalytic stage receives an oxidizer (e.g., ) and a fuel () and discharges a partially oxidized fuel/oxidizer mixture (). The second catalytic stage receives the partially oxidized fuel/oxidizer mixture and further oxidizes the mixture. The second catalytic stage may include a passageway () for conducting a bypass portion () of the mixture past a catalyst (e.g., ) disposed therein. The second catalytic stage may have an outlet temperature elevated sufficiently to complete oxidation of the mixture without using a separate ignition source. The oxidation completion stage is disposed downstream of the second catalytic stage and may recombine the bypass portion with a catalyst exposed portion () of the mixture and complete oxidation of the mixture. The second catalytic stage may also include a reticulated foam support (), a honeycomb support, a tube support or a plate support.

NAS3-00006 awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).","This invention relates generally to the field of power generation, and more particularly, to catalytic combustors.","Catalytic combustion systems are well known in gas turbine applications to reduce the creation of pollutants, such as NOx, in the combustion process. One catalytic combustion technique known as the rich catalytic, lean burn (RCL\u2122) combustion process includes mixing fuel with a first portion of compressed air to form a rich fuel mixture. The rich fuel mixture is passed over a catalytic surface and partially oxidized, or combusted, by catalytic action. Activation of the catalytic surface is achieved when the temperature of the rich fuel mixture is elevated to a temperature at which the catalytic surface becomes active. Typically, compression raises the temperature of the air mixed with the fuel to form a rich fuel mixture having a temperature sufficiently high to activate the catalytic surface. After passing over the catalytic surface, the resulting partially oxidized rich fuel mixture is then mixed with a second portion of compressed air in a downstream combustion zone to produce a heated lean combustion mixture for completing the combustion process, typically by igniting and stabilizing the lean combustion mixture using a high temperature, NOx producing pilot flame. The heated combustion mixture form the first stage may reduce a size of a pilot flame required to stabilize combustion, but completion of combustion using a catalyst may eliminate the need to use a pilot flame. Catalytic combustion reactions may produce less NOx and other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, than pollutants produced by homogenous combustion, even in the absence of a pilot flame.","In the past, catalysts have been used to partially combust rich fuel mixtures at temperatures up to about 800 degrees Centigrade (C.), but higher combustion temperatures have proven to be destructive to the catalysts and catalyst supports. Catalysts capable of operating at higher combustion temperatures of over 1000 degrees C. have been proposed, but such catalysts may have a catalytic activation temperature much higher than a compressed air temperature achievable by compression alone.","The inventors have developed an innovative two-stage catalytic combustor for partially catalytically combusting a fuel\/air mixture in a first-stage at a relatively lower temperature, and then catalytically completing combustion of the partially oxidized fuel\/air mixture in a second-stage at a relatively higher temperature. Advantageously, the first-stage partial combustion elevates the temperature of the partially oxidized fuel\/air mixture entering the second-stage to a temperature sufficient for activating a catalyst in the second-stage to completely combust the partially oxidized fuel\/air mixture. Accordingly, by providing complete catalytic combustion, pollutant formation may be reduced compared to other conventional catalytic combustion techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","14","10","12","18","20","20","24","22","30","14","24","26","28","14","22","14","26","22","26","14"]},"In the first catalytic stage , the premixed fluid flow  may be partially oxidized, by exposure to a first-stage catalytic structure . After exiting the first-stage , the premixed fluid flow  and the cooling fluid flow  may be mixed in the transition stage  to create a partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture . In an aspect of the invention, the transition stage  may be configured to limit further combustion of the partially oxidized fuel oxidizer mixture . For example, by eliminating recirculation regions and potential flame attachment points in the transition stage , further combustion of the partially oxidized fuel oxidizer mixture  may be restricted. In another aspect, the transition stage  may include a narrowed flow area region  generating a venturi effect for preventing flashback into the transition stage  and protecting the first catalytic stage  from the heat generated by a downstream second catalytic stage  of the catalytic combustor . The narrowed region  may be disposed between an inlet end  receiving the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  and an outlet end  discharging the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture . In yet another aspect, the transition stage  may be relatively short compared to the first and second catalytic stages , .","The partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  flows from the transition stage  into the second catalytic stage  of the catalytic combustor . In the second catalytic stage , the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  may be further combusted by exposure to a second-stage catalytic structure . In an aspect of the invention, the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  may be split into a catalyst-exposed portion  and a bypass portion . The catalyst-exposed portion  may be exposed to the second-stage catalytic structure , while a bypass portion  may be directed around the catalytic structure  via a bypass passageway . The portions ,  may be recombined in a downstream combustion completion stage . Advantageously, an outlet temperature of the catalyst exposed portion  exiting from the second catalytic stage  may be elevated sufficiently to complete oxidization in the downstream combustion completion stage  without using a separate ignition source, such as a pilot, to produce a hot combustion gas . The hot combustion gas  is then delivered to a turbine  where it is expanded to develop shaft power. Typically, the turbine  and compressor  are connected to a common shaft . The aforementioned components of the gas turbine  are fairly typical of those found in the prior art, and other known variations of these components and related components may be used in other embodiments of the present invention.","The first catalytic stage  may include conventional catalysts and catalyst supports such as are typically used in backside-cooled catalytic combustors. For example, the first catalytic stage  may include catalyst-coated honeycomb structures, tubes, rods, or plates disposed within the catalytic combustor  and oriented to allow a fluid to flow unimpeded therethrough. However, because of the elevated temperatures associated with combustion completion of the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture , different catalysts and catalyst support structures capable of withstanding such elevated temperatures need to be used in the second catalytic stage . Although the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  may have a temperature of 500-550 degrees C. when entering the second catalytic stage , the catalyst exposed portion  exiting the second catalytic stage  may be elevated to a temperature of between 1100 to 1400 degrees C. Accordingly, catalyst support structures formed from materials capable of withstanding such elevated temperatures are required in the second catalytic stage . For example, oxide-based ceramic structures composed of alumina, titania, zirconia, and\/or cordierites (marketed, for example, Selee Corporation, Applied Ceramics, Inc. and CeraMem Corporation), or non oxide-based ceramic structures composed of silicon carbide or silicon nitride (marketed, for example, by UltraMet, Inc. and Specific Surface Corporation), may be used for the catalyst support. Oxide-based ceramics may be enhanced with a washcoat containing catalytic materials such as a perovskite, zeolite, hexaaluminate, and the like, or combinations thereof. Non-oxide based ceramics may be initially coated with an oxidation-resistant stabilized alumina coating and then enhanced with a washcoat containing catalyst composition such as perovskite, zeolite, hexaaluminate, and the like, or combinations thereof. In another aspect, the catalyst support may be fabricated from advanced alloys, such as Incoloy\u2122 alloy MA956 and Fecralloy (iron-chromium-aluminum-based alloys), Kanthal series metals (molybdenum disilicide alloys, such as Kanthal Super 1800, 1900 and the like), or intermetallics such as iron aluminide. A catalytic material may be applied to the metallic structure, or a thermal barrier coating (TBC) may be applied to the structure prior to application of catalytic material. Regardless of the type of material used for making the support, the catalyst support may be fabricated in a desired forms such as honeycomb structures, tubes, plates, tower packings, such as Rashig rings, and\/or packed particles, and the like.","In another aspect, the second catalytic stage  may include a reticulated foam catalyst support having a network of pores for allowing passage of a fluid therethrough and capable of withstanding the elevated temperatures associated with combustion completion. For example, a ceramic based reticulated foam catalyst support, such as a silicon carbide reticulated foam catalyst support marketed by Ultramet, Inc., may be used. The reticulated foam catalyst support may be enhanced with a washcoat to increase an effective surface area of the support. A catalyst such as a perovskite, zeolite, and\/or hexaaluminate, and the like may be incorporated in the washcoat, or subsequently applied over the washcoat. The reticulated foam catalyst support may be sized to completely fill a cross-section of the second catalytic stage  of the combustor  so that the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture entering the second-stage passes though the catalyst support. For example, in a cylindrical combustor, the catalyst support may comprise a cylindrical section having an outside diameter substantially equal to an inside diameter of the combustor.","Compared to a conventional plate or tube supported catalyst, such as used for partial catalytic combustion in an RCL\u2122 process, it has been determined that second-stage catalytic combustion may require a relatively higher surface contact area between the catalyst and a fuel\/oxidizer mixture to provide complete combustion of the mixture. Higher surface contact area may require a more flow-restrictive catalyst support (for example, smaller pores in a ceramic reticulated foam support, or smaller cross-sectional area passageways in a honeycomb support) than would typically be used in a comparably sized conventional catalytic combustor.","Unfortunately, catalyst supports having a smaller pore size or smaller cross-sectional area passageways may lead to an increased pressure drop across the support, compared to larger sized pores or passageways. One way of reducing the pressure drop across the catalyst support is to ensure, in the case of a reticulated foam support, that the porosity of the reticulated foam support is sufficiently open (or, in the case of other structures, to ensure that the cross-sectional area of the passageways are sufficiently sized) to minimize a pressure drop across the catalyst support, while retaining sufficient catalytic surface area throughout the structure to achieve a desired level of catalytic combustion. For example, in the case of a reticulated foam support, a pore size grade, or number of pores per lineal inch (ppi), of 3 to 5 ppi may be used for catalytic combustion without inducing a prohibitively large pressure differential across the support.","Innovatively, the inventors have overcome the problem of increased pressure drop associated with an increased catalyst density by providing a passageway for bypassing a portion of the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture past the catalyst support. For example, a foam catalyst support presenting a cross-sectional area less than a cross-sectional area of a pressure boundary of the second catalytic stage  may be used to define a passageway allowing a portion of the fuel\/oxidizer mixture to bypass the foam support.  shows a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a reticulated foam catalyst support  disposed within the second catalytic stage  of the combustor  of . A bypass portion  of the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture may be bypassed through a passageway , such as an annular passageway , around the catalyst support  while a catalyst-exposed portion  of the partially oxidized gas may be directed through pores in the catalyst support  and catalytically combusted. At a downstream end of the catalyst support , the catalyst-exposed portion , directed through the catalyst support  and having an elevated temperature as a result of catalytic combustion, mixes with and ignites the bypass portion  downstream of the catalyst support  in a downstream combustion stage  to produce a completely combusted hot combustion gas . By providing such a passageway for bypassing the bypass portion  around the catalyst support , an overall pressure drop across the catalyst support  may be reduced compared to a catalyst support filling a cross-sectional area of the second catalytic stage . For example, the passageway(s) may be sized to allow 25% to 80% of the partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture  to bypass the catalyst support  in the bypass portion . Advantageously, by providing such passageways, a more flow-restrictive, or higher ppi, reticulated foam catalyst support having a correspondingly increased catalytic surface area (compared to a less flow-restrictive foam catalyst support without passageways) may be used to increase catalytic activity without resulting in an increased overall pressure drop across the catalyst support . For example, a reticulated foam support having about 45 ppi may be used with sufficiently sized passageways so that an overall pressure drop across the catalyst support  does not exceed a predetermined pressure drop.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C"],"b":["54","50","50","54","52","50","51","46","50","50","56","50","51","58","50","58","50","52","46","36","50","50","50","50","50","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["60","62","64","66","68","40","62","64","66","68","64","66","68","62","64","66","62","64","66","68","62","64","66","68"]},"In another embodiment, a catalytic structure disposed in the second catalytic stage  may include a number of separate catalytic elements spaced along a longitudinal axis of the second catalytic stage , wherein each element includes partitioned longitudinal passageways that may be coated with a catalyst. Each catalytic element may be spaced apart along the longitudinal axis with respect to an adjacent catalytic element. The catalytic supports may be different types of supports, such as tubes, plates, or honeycombs, and may have different cross sections.  shows a longitudinal cross-section of exemplary catalytic elements , ,  disposed within the second catalytic stage  and exposed to a fluid , such as a partially oxidized fuel\/oxidizer mixture, flowing through the second catalytic stage . Each element , ,  may include a \u201choneycomb\u201d arrangement of catalyst coated plates partitioning the element into longitudinal passageways. Specific Surface, Inc. and CeraMem Corporation, market such honeycomb-type elements. As shown in , C, and D, each respective element , ,  may be angularly not aligned about a longitudinal axis  with respect to an adjacent catalytic element. Such misalignment, or axial rotation of the elements with respect to each other so that the passageways are not aligned, causes mixing of the fluid  about the longitudinal axis as the flow travels from one element to an adjacent downstream element. In another aspect, the passageways may twisted so that they do not run parallel with axis , thereby directing a flow of fluid through the passageway angularly away from parallel with respect to the axis . Advantageously, mixing of the fluid traveling through the catalytic elements , , , may be promoted to achieve improved catalytic combustion. As a result, an overall length of the catalytic structure may be shorter compared to a catalytic structure having aligned flowpaths extended therethrough. Each catalytic element , ,  may be configured to have a desired characteristic, such as a catalyst composition, a flow path cross-section size, or an axial length different from another element. For example, each element , ,  may include a catalyst selected to promote further oxidation of a fuel\/oxidizer mixture flowing therethrough based on reaction products generated by an adjacent upstream element , . Alternately, a flow mixing element may be disposed between adjacent catalytic elements.","Unlike a backside cooled configuration typically used in a single-stage RCL\u2122 catalytic combustor wherein only some of the flow paths may be coated with a catalyst material, a second-stage catalytic structure as described herein may be provided with a coating of a catalyst on all of the flow path surfaces to foster complete catalytic combustion. For example, the second-stage catalytic structure may include a number of tubes disposed in the second catalytic stage , each of the tubes coated with a catalyst on an outside surface and an inside surface. In an embodiment, the tubes may be hollow cylinders formed from an oxide or non oxide ceramic material (such as the ceramic materials described earlier) and include an enhanced surface area coating, such as a washcoat, applied to an inside diameter and outside diameter. A catalyst such as a perovskite, zeolite, and\/or hexaaluminate, and the like, may be incorporated in the washcoat or subsequently applied over the washcoat. In another embodiment, the tubes may be formed from an advanced metal or inter-metallic. A catalytic material, such as a perovskite, zeolite, hexaaluminate, and the like, may be subsequently applied to the tubes. In another aspect, the tubes may be coated with a TBC for additional thermal protection before applying the catalytic material. In yet another embodiment the catalytic structure may comprise a number of catalyst coated rods or plates longitudinally disposed within the combustor. Such rods or plates may be formed from the materials and coated with the catalytic compositions as described above with respect to the catalytic tubes.","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
