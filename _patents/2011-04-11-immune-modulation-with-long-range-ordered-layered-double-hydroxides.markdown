It may have applications for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes.","Immune responses are of two general types: innate and adaptive. Generally, innate immune responses are fast and rapid, whereas adaptive immune responses are slower to be induced but subsequently provide immunological memory. Innate responses can trigger inflammation, for example because the cells of innate immunity produce hormone-like (\u2018pro-inflammatory\u2019) cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Crucially, innate immune responses are also usually required for the initiation and regulation of adaptive responses.","Innate immune responses can be mediated by cells such as monocytes and macrophages, mast cells, and granulocytes including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils and NK cells. Innate-like immune responses may also be mediated by cells such as NKT cells, including invariant NKT cells, and gamma-delta T cells.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells of immunity that provide an important link between innate and adaptive immune responses. They express a diversity of molecular sensors that enable them to detect and discriminate between different types of \u2018danger\u2019, such as viral or microbial infections, and perhaps cellular damage, whether or not it is caused by an infection. DCs subsequently change their properties in response to the \u2018danger\u2019 (for example they may secrete the cytokine IL-12 and up-regulate expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, in a process often termed \u2018activation\u2019 or \u2018maturation\u2019). This enables them to initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses that are typically mediated by lymphocytes.","Adaptive immune responses include specific antibody responses that may, for example, help to clear infectious agents, and cytotoxic T cell responses that may enable killing of infected cells and tumour cells. Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes (as plasma cells) whereas cytotoxic T cells generally develop from the CD8+ T cell subset (and, perhaps less frequently, from the CD4+ T cell subset).","Immunological interventions can be used, in theory or in practice, to modulate immune responses. Vaccines typically stimulate immune responses against, for example, infectious diseases or cancers. In contrast, other approaches, experimentally or clinically, may suppress aberrant or unwanted immune responses. These include allergies and other immune-related sensitivities (sometimes termed \u2018hypersensitivity diseases\u2019), autoimmune diseases, and transplantation reactions (including transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease). Any agent that acts to modulate an immune response, whether by stimulating or suppressing a response, may be termed an immune modulator.","An immunogenic composition is a composition that can be used to modulate immune responses. Such a composition generally comprises an antigen (a substance against which an adaptive immune response may be directed; this response may involve antibodies or cytotoxic T cells, or both) and an immune modulator.","DNA vaccination is known and therefore an antigen may be a macromolecule, such as a polypeptide chain, an RNA preparation that can be translated into a polypeptide chain, or a DNA preparation that encodes a polypeptide chain and that may be transcribed into an RNA intermediate. The antigen may be a DNA plasmid that has been genetically engineered to produce one or more specific polypeptide against which an adaptive immune response may be directed.","Vaccines are a well known type of immunogenic composition and typically contain an antigen, such as a microbial or tumour component against which a specific adaptive immune response is to be directed, and an adjuvant, which mimics a cause of \u2018danger\u2019 and stimulates an appropriate type of adaptive response to be generated.","A series of compounds known collectively to immunologists as \u2018alums\u2019 is known for use as an immune modulator by acting as an adjuvant, which normally stimulates an immune response. The term \u2018alum\u2019 is used very generically, and seems to refer to either boehmite (AlOOH) or amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate. It should be noted that the \u2018alum\u2019 of immunologists is very different to that of the physical sciences; when chemists speak of \u2018alum\u2019 they refer to a set of compounds with the formula AB(SO).12HO, such as KAl(SO).12HO. Henceforth, the term \u2018alum\u2019 should be taken to mean the alum of immunologists.","Alum may act as an adjuvant, to stimulate a certain type(s) of immune response. In so doing, it may lead to modulation or suppression of other types of immune response. Alum is the most widely used adjuvant in human vaccines, but the exact mechanism of action remains unknown. Alum is known to have a good effect in terms of inducing antibody responses (B cell responses) but it does not appear to induce significant generation of cytotoxic T cells. This limits its efficacy in applications such as anti-viral and anti-tumour treatments. Further, the exact chemical structure of alum is not well characterised; it would be preferable to use a chemical product that had a clear and well defined structure, chemical composition, and purity.","There is therefore a need for an improved immune modulator, which can act either as an adjuvant or, in other circumstances, as an immune suppressant.","Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of compounds that comprise two or more metal cations and have a layered structure. LDHs can be represented by the general formulae (1), or (2) or (3):\n\n[MM(OH)][AHO\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n[MM(OH)][AHO\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n[MM(OH)][AHO\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwherein: M, Mand Mare mono, di- and trivalent metal cations respectively (for example, Mmay be Li, Mmay be Ca, Mg, Ba, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu Zn, or Cd, and Mmay be Al, Fe, Cr V or Co), which cations occupy octahedral positions in hydroxide layers;\n\n","The values of x have been reported to be from 1\/10 to \u00bd. However pure phases only exist for values from \u2155 to \u2153; outside this range compounds with different structures are obtained. It has been proposed that for Mg\u2014Al LDHs with high values of x, Al(OH)is formed concomitantly with the LDH, due to the increased number of aluminum octahedra (Am. Mineral, 1979, 64, 836).","Therefore, as the skilled reader will appreciate, Mto Min ratios of 1:1 (x=\u00bd) would not give rise to a pure LDH product and significant aluminum hydroxide impurities would be present.","A large number of LDHs with a variety of M-Mcation pairs (e.g. Ca\u2014Al) have been reported and studied. Furthermore, it is possible to have LDHs in which there is more than one type of Mand\/or more than one type of Mmetal ion present. Equally, LDHs having the M-Mcation pair Li\u2212Al with different anions in the interlayer space have been reported and studied. A review of LDHs is provided in J. Mater. Chem., 2002, 12, 3191-3198.","It has previously been identified that the surface acidity of LDHs is largely affected by the nature of the interlayer anion (J. Mater. Chem., 1998, 8, 1917-1925). This acidity can be measured using Hammett indicators. The order of acidity of Li\u2014Al and Mg\u2014Al based LDHs has been shown to vary with the nature of the anion, such that carbonate<nitrate<chloride in terms of acidity. The Li\u2014Al and Mg\u2014Al LDHs intercalated with chloride and nitrate exhibited pKa values in the region of 0.1 up to 5.2, whilst those intercalated with carbonate had pKa values above 12.2. Thus anions which are the conjugate bases of weaker acids provide LDHs that are more basic.","Carbonate intercalated LDHs have generally been found to contain basic sites with pKa values in the range of 10.7 to 13.3 and a few sites with a pKa of 16.5 (J. Catal., 1992, 134, 58).","The present invention provides, in a first aspect, a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III), as defined below, for use in modulating an immune response to an antigen.","The modulation may be an increased or a decreased immune response and may be caused in an animal; in particular a human, another mammal, or a bird or a fish. The modulation in immune response may be modulation of any one or more aspect of an innate immune response or an adaptive immune response. The modulation in immune response may, for example, be modulation of any one or more aspect of an immune response selected from: activation of dendritic cells, the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the generation of antibodies, the generation of cytotoxic T-cells, or the generation of a response by other immune cells. The modulation may be modulation of an immune response involving dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, NK cells, NKT cells, including invariant NKT cells, or gamma-delta T cells. The modulation may, for example, comprise increased or decreased stimulation of NK cells or neutrophils, or may comprise enhanced or decreased NO production, reactive O2 production or phagocytic activity.","The modulation in immune response may result from a direct or indirect action of the layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III), as defined below, on any cell of innate or adaptive immunity, including cell types selected from: dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, NK cells, NKT cells, including invariant NKT cells, and gamma-delta T cells.","The invention therefore provides an immune modulator comprising a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III).","The LDH of formula (I), (II) or (III) is therefore provided for use in the treatment or prevention of a medical condition by modulating an immune response to an antigen. The medical condition may be selected from infectious diseases; allergies and other immune-related sensitivities; autoimmune diseases; transplantation reactions; proliferative diseases; and other inflammatory conditions. The medical conditions that may be treated or prevented are discussed in more detail below.","The LDHs used in the invention are of formula (I), formula (II), or formula (III)\n\n[MM(OH)]+[A]\u2003\u2003(I)\n\n[MM(OH)][A]\u2003\u2003(II)\n\n[MM(OH)][A]\u2003\u2003(III)\n\nin which\n","Mis Li,","Mis a divalent metal cation or a mixture of two or more divalent metal cations,","Mis a trivalent metal cation or a mixture of two or more trivalent metal cations, or a mixture of one or more trivalent metal cation with one or more quadravalent metal cation,","x is from \u2155 to \u2153, and","A is an interlayer anion having a charge n,","wherein optionally some or all of the interlayer anion A may be replaced by one or more biologically active agent(s) and\/or one or more antigen(s),","and wherein A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of 1 or higher,","except for in LDHs of formula (II) when Mcomprises Ca and in LDHs of formula (I), wherein A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of \u22124 or higher.","Preferably, Mis selected from: Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu Zn, and Cd, and mixtures thereof; and mixtures of one or more of Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu Zn, and Cd together with one or both of Pd and Pt.","Preferably, Mis selected from: Al, Fe, Cr V Co, Ga, In and Sc and mixtures thereof; and mixtures of one or more of Al, Fe, Cr V Co, Ga, In and Sc together with one or more of Y, Rh, Ir and Zr.","The compounds of formula (I) or formula (II) or formula (III) may optionally be hydrated. The amount of water of hydration may be a stoichiometric amount or a non-stoichiometric amount. In one embodiment, there may be from 0.1 to 5, such as from 0.5 to 4, molecules of water per LDH formula unit.","The compounds of formula (I) or formula (II) or formula (III) may be non-calcined LDHs or may be calcined LDHs.","Surprisingly, it has been found that these layered double hydroxides act to modulate an immune response. The effect has been shown in terms of an effect on dendritic cell activation, an effect on T cell response and an effect on antibody induction. Therefore, surprisingly, the layered double hydroxides of the invention can potentially be used in a variety of applications where immune modulation is required. This range of applications is wider than those for which alum can be used, as the induced response with LDHs is not limited primarily to an antibody response, as it is with alum. Further, LDHs have well defined structure, chemical composition, and purity, making them suitable for medical applications.","New, more efficient adjuvants would permit less material to be used as antigen(s) in the preparation of immunogenic compositions, such as vaccines. This is advantageous because if only small quantities of material are required, a new vaccine for a new threat, e.g. pandemic flu, can be prepared more quickly.","The layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above, for use in modulating an immune response to an antigen, may be administered to a patient together with said antigen. The LDH and antigen may be administered simultaneously, sequentially (in either order) or separately (in either order). When administered separately there may be a time delay between administering the two components of, for example, 15 minutes or more, such as 30 minutes or more. Preferably they are administered simultaneously or sequentially.","The invention provides, in a second aspect, an immune modulator composition comprising (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen. The composition may be an immunogenic composition for use in eliciting an increased or a decreased immune response to an antigen in an animal; in particular a human, another mammal, or a bird or a fish.","The invention provides, in a third aspect, an immune modulator kit comprising (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I) or (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen, to be administered simultaneously, sequentially or separately. The kit may be for use in eliciting an increased or a decreased immune response to an antigen in an animal; in particular a human, another mammal, or a bird or a fish. The kit may include instructions to administer the layered double hydroxide and the antigen, simultaneously, sequentially or separately, to a subject in need of immune modulation. The components may be administered simultaneously, sequentially (in either order) or separately (in either order). When administered separately there may be a time delay between administering the two components of, for example, 15 minutes or more, such as 30 minutes or more. Preferably they are administered simultaneously or sequentially.","The invention provides, in a fourth aspect, the use of a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above in the manufacture of a medicament for modulating an immune response to an antigen. The medicament may be for increasing or decreasing an immune response in an animal; in particular a human, another mammal, or a bird or a fish. The medicament may optionally further comprise an antigen or the medicament may be provided for administration with an antigen, simultaneously, sequentially (in either order) or separately (in either order). When administered separately there may be a time delay between administering the two components of, for example, 15 minutes or more, such as 30 minutes or more. Preferably they are administered simultaneously or sequentially.","The invention therefore provides a method of modulating an immune response in a subject, comprising administering to said subject a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above. The layered double hydroxide may be provided in the form of an immune modulator composition comprising (i) the layered double hydroxide and (ii) an antigen. Alternatively, the layered double hydroxide may be administered to the subject with an antigen, with the administration being simultaneous, sequential or separate.","The invention provides, in a fifth aspect, the use of a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing or treating a medical condition selected from the group comprising: infectious diseases; allergies and other immune-related sensitivities (hypersensitivity diseases); autoimmune diseases; transplantation reactions (including transplant rejection and graft versus host disease); proliferative diseases including cancers; and other inflammatory conditions (including autoinflammatory conditions). The medicament may be for preventing the disease in an animal; in particular a human or another mammal, or a bird or a fish. The medicament may optionally further comprise an antigen or the medicament may be provided for administration with an antigen, simultaneously, sequentially (in either order) or separately (in either order). When administered separately there may be a time delay between administering the two components of, for example, 15 minutes or more, such as 30 minutes or more. Preferably they are administered simultaneously or sequentially.","The invention therefore provides a method of preventing or treating a medical condition selected from the group comprising: infectious diseases; allergies and other immune-related sensitivities (hypersensitivity diseases); autoimmune diseases; transplantation reactions (including transplant rejection and graft versus host disease); proliferative diseases (including cancers); and other inflammatory conditions (including autoinflammatory conditions). The method comprises administering to said subject a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above. The layered double hydroxide may be provided in the form of an immune modulator composition comprising (i) the layered double hydroxide and (ii) an antigen. Alternatively, the layered double hydroxide may be administered to the subject with an antigen, with the administration being simultaneous, sequential or separate.","The invention provides, in a sixth aspect, a method of preparing an immune modulator composition comprising the step of combining (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen.","The invention provides, in a seventh aspect, a method of obtaining a treated dendritic cell product, the method comprising: combining dendritic cells with (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen. The layered double hydroxide and antigen may be provided in the form of an immune modulator composition comprising (i) the layered double hydroxide and (ii) an antigen and this composition may then be combined with the dendritic cells. Alternatively, the layered double hydroxide and the antigen may be provided separately and these separate components may be combined with the dendritic cells in any order. The dendritic cells may have been generated from a subject's blood monocytes or may have been generated from other precursors, for example from dendritic cell progenitors from the subject's bone marrow.","The treated dendritic cells thus obtained can be administered to the subject to prevent or treat a medical condition. The condition may be selected from the group comprising: infectious diseases; allergies and other immune-related sensitivities (hypersensitivity diseases); autoimmune diseases; transplantation reactions (including transplant rejection and graft versus host disease); proliferative diseases including cancers; and other inflammatory conditions (including autoinflammatory conditions). This re-administration can be of the treated dendritic cells together with some or all of the layered double hydroxide and antigen, or the re-administration can be after separating the dendritic cells from the layered double hydroxide and antigen.","As the skilled reader will appreciate, \u201cadoptive cell therapies\u201d are known. These involve combining dendritic cells with antigen and a stimulus and administering the dendritic cells to the subject. The dendritic cells will generally have been generated from the subject's blood monocytes but may be generated from other precursors, for example from dendritic cell progenitors from the subject's bone marrow.","Therefore in accordance with the present invention an immune modulator composition can be created that comprises (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen and (iii) dendritic cells. The dendritic cells may suitably have been generated from the subject, e.g. from the subject's blood monocytes or from dendritic cell progenitors from the subject's bone marrow. The dendritic cells from such a composition can subsequently be administered to the subject to treat or prevent a medical condition. This administration can be together with the layered double hydroxide and antigen or can be after separating the dendritic cells from some or all of the layered double hydroxide and antigen.","The invention provides, in an eighth aspect, a method of obtaining a treated T cell product, the method comprising: combining T cells with dendritic cells that have already been contacted with (i) a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above and (ii) an antigen. The T cells may suitably have been generated from the subject, e.g. from peripheral blood of the subject.","The treated T cells thus obtained can be administered to the subject to prevent or treat a medical condition.

This assessment may, for example, be by measuring the responsiveness of the subject's immune cells to the LDH, or to a composition comprising the LDH. The LDH may therefore be used as an in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo assay to evaluate an immune response. The assay may be used to evaluate the strength of the subject's immune system, or may be used to evaluate whether the subject's immune system is compromised (for example by a disease, or by environmental conditions, or due to a treatment, e.g. a surgical treatment, a drug treatment, or other therapeutic treatment). It may be that the LDH, or a composition comprising the LDH, may be placed on the skin of a subject.","Therefore the invention provides a method for assessing a subject's immune response that comprises the steps of: bringing immune cells of the subject into contact with a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above; and measuring the response of the immune cells. The method may be carried out by adding a layered double hydroxide of formula (I), (II) or (III) as defined above to cells in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo. The method may further involve comparing the response of the immune cells to another response, e.g. a standard or baseline or a previously measured response for the same subject.","All of the following preferred features apply to all of the above aspects of the invention, as appropriate.","A first preferred class of LDH compound that can be used in the invention is of formula (I) wherein Mis Li and Mcomprises Al or a mixture of Al with Feand A is an interlayer anion having a charge n wherein A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of \u22124 or higher. A may, for example, be selected from Cl, SO, NO, CO, HO, HOO, ClO, HCO, or conjugate bases of organic acids.","These compounds are optionally, but preferably, hydrated. The amount of water of hydration may be a stoichiometric amount or a non-stoichiometric amount.","Most preferably, in the LDH of formula (I) Mis Al.","The LDHs of formula (I) may have any surface pKa, such as a surface pKa of 1 or more, 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more or 5 or more. However, it is preferred that for LDHs of formula (I) the surface pKa is greater than 5.2, such as 5.5 or higher, 6 or higher, 7 or higher, 8 or higher, 9 or higher, or 10 or higher.","Without being bound by theory, it is believed that different LDHs with different physicochemical properties may act on cells such as dendritic cells at the cell surface, or in intracellular compartments such as phagosomes or other endosomes, the cytosol or the nucleus. Again, without being bound by theory, LDHs with higher surface pKa values may act as a buffer and arrest maturation. Such LDHs could facilitate cross presentation resulting in a cytotoxic T cell response. As the skilled reader will appreciate, cross presentation is when antigens from the extracellular environment (rather than peptides derived from proteins synthesised by the cell itself) are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecules and stimulate CD8+ T cell immunity. Finally, (again not being bound by theory) higher surface pKa values may stimulate molecular sensors in the cytosol.","LDHs based on [LiAl(OH)] have a surface pKa of about 5 or less when the anion is Cl or NO.","To achieve the preferred surface pKa values of greater than 5.2, A should therefore be the conjugate base of an acid that is weaker than nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, which have pKa values of \u22121 and \u22124 respectively. Accordingly, it can be preferred that A is the conjugate base of an acid that has a pKa value of greater than \u22121.","The surface pKa of an LDH may be measured by a Hammett indicator test. This may involve adding 2 ml of Hammett indicator, dissolved in benzene or dichloromethane, to 0.2 g of a finely powdered sample of the LDH, shaking the sample, and then noting the colour change. pKa values for acids are well known in the art and references in this regard are intended as reference to pKa values for acids at room temperature (25\u00b0 C.).","Preferably, for LDHs of formula (I), A is selected from anions of an acid having a pKa of 2 or higher, more preferably 3 or higher. A may therefore suitably be selected from conjugate bases of weak acids, such as hydroxide anions, peroxide anions, hypochlorite anions, carbonate or bicarbonate anions, or conjugate bases of organic acids. For example, A may be selected from CO, HO, HOO, ClO, HCO, RCOO, R(COO). In one embodiment, A may be carbonate, bicarbonate, formate, acetate, lactate, oxalate or succinate.","In relation to the present invention, wherever reference is made to RCOO or R(COO), the following definitions and preferred definitions apply. R is hydrogen, alkyl having 1-24 carbon atoms (e.g. 1-20 carbon atoms or 1-16 carbon atoms or 1-12 carbon atoms), alkenyl having 2-24 carbon atoms (e.g. 2-20 carbon atoms or 2-16 carbon atoms or 2-12 carbon atoms), cycloalkyl having 3-8 carbon atoms, aryl having 6-14 carbon atoms, or carboxy or carboxyalkyl having 1-24 carbon atoms (e.g. 1-20 carbon atoms or 1-16 carbon atoms or 1-12 carbon atoms), and wherein one or more hydrogen atom in any of the aforesaid groups may optionally be substituted with one or more substituent group, such as a halide (e.g. Cl), nitro, amino, ethyl, phosphate, amide or hydroxy group. Preferred definitions for R are H, alkyl having 1-6 (e.g. 1-4) carbon atoms, aryl having 6 carbon atoms, or carboxy or carboxyalkyl having 1-6 (e.g. 1-4) carbon atoms, and wherein one or more hydrogen atom in any of the aforesaid groups may optionally be substituted with one or more substituent group, such as a halide (e.g. Cl), nitro, amino, ethyl, phosphate, amide or hydroxy group.","A second preferred class of LDH compound that can be used in the invention is of formula (II) wherein Mis a divalent metal cation selected from Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn, Mis a trivalent metal cation selected from Al, Fe, Cr, V Co, Ga, or In, x is from \u2155 to \u2153 and A is an interlayer anion having a charge n, wherein A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of 1 or higher, except for when Mis Ca, when A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of \u22124 or higher.","Such compounds are optionally, but preferably, hydrated. The water of hydration, if present, may be present in a stoichiometric amount or a non-stoichiometric amount.","In the LDHs of formula (II) the selection of A is affected by the nature of M; it has been found that a larger Mcation, such as Ca, permits the use of an anion from a stronger acid. For Ca, A may be selected from conjugate bases of weak acids, such as hydroxide anions, peroxide anions, hypochlorite anions, carbonate or bicarbonate anions, or conjugate bases of organic acids, or may be selected from conjugate bases of strong acids, such as chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate or nitrate anions. For other, smaller, Mcations A may be selected from conjugate bases of weak acids, such as hydroxide anions, peroxide anions, hypochlorite anions, carbonate or bicarbonate anions, or conjugate bases of organic acids.","The LDHs of formula (II) may have any surface pKa, such as a surface pKa of 1 or more, 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more or 5 or more.

Again without being bound by theory, LDHs with higher surface pKa values may act as a buffer and arrest maturation. Alternatively, again not being bound by theory, higher surface pKa values may stimulate molecular sensors in the cytosol.","It is known that the surface pKa of LDHs based on [MgAl(OH)] have a surface pKa of about 5 or less when the anion is Cl or NO.","To achieve the desired higher pKa values in the LDHs of formula (II), when the LDH is based on a smaller Mcation, such as Mg, A should be the conjugate base of an acid that is weaker than nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, which have pKa values of \u22121 and \u22124 respectively. However, when the LDH of formula (II) is based on the larger Ca Mcation, A can be the conjugate base of stronger acids whilst still achieving a desired surface pKa.","In one embodiment, Mis selected from Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn (preferably Mg, Zn Co, Cu and Ni, most preferably Mg, Zn and Ni) and A is selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of 1 or higher, preferably 2 or higher, more preferably 3 or higher. A may therefore suitably be selected from conjugate bases of weak acids, such as hydroxide anions, peroxide anions, hypochlorite anions, carbonate or bicarbonate anions, or conjugate bases of organic acids.

LDHs intercalated with anions of other weak acids would be expected to have similar pKa values.","The LDHs of the present invention may be stoichiometric (i.e. LDHs where the actual ratios of Mto Mor of Mto Min the LDH are integer values) or may be non-stoichiometric.","A long-range ordered (i.e. non-random) arrangement of cations in the LDH occurs in a preferred embodiment of the present invention. When reference is made to ordering in the present invention it relates to \u2018long-range\u2019 ordering as compared to \u2018local\u2019 ordering. The extent to which ordering is seen is dependent on the choice of metal cations and their relative ratios.","Long-range ordered cation layers can be achieved in stoichiometric LDHs (i.e. LDHs where the actual ratios of Mto Mor of Mto Min the LDH are integer values) where the ratio of Mto Mis 2:1 (class (II)) or 1:4 (class (III)) or where the ratio of Mto Mis 1:2 (class (I)). These long-range ordered stoichiometric materials can therefore be written as: MM(OH)][A] or [MM(OH)][A] or [MM(OH)][A].","Long-range ordering may also be seen in non-stoichiometric derivatives of LDH materials where the calculated ratio of M:Mis about 1:4 (such as from 1:3.7 to 1:4.3, e.g. from 1:3.8 to 1:4.2), or the calculated ratio of M:Mis about 1:2 (such as from 1:1.7 to 1:2.3, e.g. from 1:1.8 to 1:2.2). Non-stoichiometric derivatives have ratios in the LDH of M:Mor M:Min that are non-integer, e.g. 0.9:4 or 0.5:2. Examples of non-stoichiometric LDH materials that have long-range ordering include [MM(OH)][A] and [MM(OH)][A] and [MM(OH)][A] and [MM(OH)][A].","Accordingly, the LDHs used in the present invention may, in one embodiment, be LDHs where the ratio of Mto Mis 2:1 or 1:4 or the ratio of Mto Mis 1:2, or may be non-stoichiometric derivatives of LDHs where the M:Mratio is about 1:4, or the M:Mratio is about 1:2.","In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the LDHs are of formula (I) or (III), or formula (II) where x is \u2153.","As the skilled reader will appreciate, some long-range ordered LDHs exhibit a higher degree of ordering than others. In particular, long-range ordered LDHs based on Mg (e.g. a 2:1 Mg\u2014Al LDH of formula (II)) are not highly ordered, whereas long-range ordered LDHs based on Ca and Li (e.g. a 2:1 Ca\u2014Al LDH of formula (II) or a 1:2 Li\u2014Al LDH of formula (I)) are highly ordered. Generally, the more highly ordered LDHs are preferred but it will be appreciated that a good effect can also be seen with all other long-range ordered LDHs.","Further, for those long-range ordered LDHs that exhibit a higher degree of ordering it has been determined that a good effect can be exhibited even when the LDH's surface pKa is lower. In other words, for those long-range ordered LDHs that exhibit a higher degree of ordering a slightly acidic or neutral surface pKa will still give good results. Therefore it is possible to utilise an anion A with these highly long-range ordered LDHs that is the conjugate base of a stronger acid.","Therefore, for example, long-range ordered LDHs based on Ca or Li (e.g. a 2:1 Ca\u2014Al LDH of formula (II) or a 1:2 Li\u2014Al LDH of formula (I)) can give good results when the surface pKa is 5 or less, e.g. from 1 to 5 or from 2 to 5, as well as when the surface pKa is higher, e.g. 5.2 or higher. Therefore in the case of these highly long-range ordered LDHs A may be selected from conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of \u22124 or higher and good results will still be achieved.","The best results for anions A that are conjugate bases of stronger acids (e.g. conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of from \u22124 to 1) are achieved when the LDH is of formula (II) with Mas Ca and a M:Mratio of 2:1. The combination of the high long-range ordering and the larger cation size of the Ca in such products gives excellent results. Of course, excellent results are also achieved for these LDHs when the anion A is selected as a conjugate base of a weaker acid (e.g. conjugate bases of acids having a pKa of 1 or higher).","In one
