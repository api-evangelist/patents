More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for the fabrication of a conductometric sensor array comprising nano-sized wires.","(2) Description of Related Art","A molecular sensor system offers many advantages over conventional sensor systems. In addition to allowing dense packing of individual sensors, the molecular nature of such a system allows for the detection of very low concentrations of analyte. For sensors where analyte contacts the sensor surface (non-spectroscopic methods), a change in a characteristic of the surface, such as conductivity, capacitance, temperature, resonance frequency, or color, signals the presence of analyte. In conductometric sensors, response is measured as change in conductivity. Conductometric sensors have been made with a variety of sensing materials, including metals, metal oxides, inorganic semiconductors, polymer-carbon composites, and conducting polymers (including organic semiconductors). The mechanism of conductivity change is not the same in all materials, but in all cases, contact with an analyte results in a change in the conductivity of the sensing material. The change is measured as a change in resistance, measured in voltage.","In array based sensing systems, also known as electronic noses for vapor sensing, the sensors have overlapping sensitivities and the response is read as a pattern across the array. Each sensor responds to compounds in a different degree (or manner) from other sensors, resulting in a pattern of responses unique to each compound. Compounds are then identified using pattern-recognition software designed for that purpose and based on laboratory training sets. The magnitude of responses may be used to quantify the analyte with well-characterized sensor sets.","A desirable technique for designing a highly sensitive conductometric sensor is to make the sensing material as thin as possible. Chemical compounds contacting the surface will change the conductivity of the surface, but in a thick film, such a change may be too small to result in a measurable response. Measurement of the responses in these nanosensor systems requires a specifically designed system.","Therefore, a need exists in the art for a conductometric sensor array that requires little power to operate, is easy to manufacture, and whose size will provide for applicability in areas where space is limited.","Additionally, the growth of nanowires is a complex and high-cost procedure, providing little control over the process or result. Present applications allow for the fabrication of nanowires without the ability to either control their growth or their direction.","Therefore, a need exists in the art for the ability to fabricate a nanowire using a controlled-growth process to actively select the dimensions, positions, and alignments of nanowires.","The present invention relates to a nanowire sensor.

A sensor array according to the present invention is fabricated such that portions of the sensor array are individually addressable.","(2) Discussion\u2014Nanowire Sensor and Nanowire Sensor Array","Nanowire sensor arrays made according to the present invention are capable, as a non-limiting example, of detecting chemical compounds in air. This description presents a molecular electronic sensor formed of a nanowire array, as well as a method for making the same. The sensor comprises an ordered array of nanowires arranged in subunits. In a specific embodiment, the sensor comprises an ordered array of nanowires arranged in a set of (e.g., nine) distinct and independent (e.g., one micrometer squared (\u03bcm)) subunits. The nanowires support active sensing surfaces and form a connected set of sensors in an ultra-dense system on a substrate (typically silicon). In a specific embodiment, the nanowires are twenty nanometers in diameter spaced 30 nanometers apart, resulting in a density of 10centimeters(cm).","This system of connected nanowires is used to identify and quantify chemical species according to the pattern of response across the array of subunits. Nanowires within a subunit are connected in a series-parallel configuration, to provide both signal amplification and defect tolerance. The active sensing surfaces, or receptors, are conductive materials which form one portion of the series connection for a string of nanowires. Sensor responses are measured as the change in conductivity across the sensing surfaces when analyte molecules contact the surface. Sensor materials are selected to provide sensitivity to the broadest possible suite of analytes; materials are selected based on the target analytes, and, as non-limiting examples, include conducting polymers such as polyanilines, polythiphenes, and polypyrroles, and conducting polymer-metal oxide and polymer-metal composites, such as polyaniline-TiO. All of these materials respond to the presence of chemical compounds at their surface with a change in conductivity, as the potential energy surfaces of the sensor are altered by sorbed molecules. The conductivity change, measured as resistance, may be as little as one ohm in one megaohm (0.0001%) for parts per billion (ppb) concentrations and lower. The magnitude of change is related to the concentration of analyte molecule. Using, for example, nine distinct sensing materials, it is possible to create a library of response patterns for hundreds of compounds. In an example application, pesticides were utilized as target analytes in testing due to their structural similarity to many chemical warfare agents.","Desirably, the entire sensing system is constructed electrochemically; the template in which the nanowires are grown, the nanowires, and the sensing surfaces (receptors) are fabricated electrochemically. The electrochemical fabrication approach allows a high degree of specificity in the location and chemical identity of a deposit, as well as a high degree of control over its thickness. Electrochemical fabrication methods also enable inexpensive scale-up for producing fully functional systems.","Rapid detection and identification of chemical species at low concentration depends both on sensor thickness and on selection of the sensing material. As just mentioned, use of electrochemical deposition allows a high degree of control over the sensor thickness. This provides the ability to fabricate highly sensitive sensors that may be as thin as a monolayer of sensing material. Use of very thin sensor surfaces also yields rapid response and recovery times. Polymer and metal oxide-based sensors have been shown to be very robust, and can be re-used many times.","The selection of active sensing materials is made by modeling the interaction of target molecules with candidate sensing materials and by modeling the response of the array of subunits to target compounds. For unambiguous identification of compounds, is important to select sensing materials with strong responses to target compounds and which create significantly different patterns across the sensing array. To help select these materials modeling is performed both for rational selection of sensing materials and to simulate array response for use in developing appropriate pattern recognition software. Successful development of a model that can simulate the response of an array will also allow characterization of compounds not on the target list.","The present invention demonstrates the practical use of (metallic) nanowires as an ultra-dense, ordered, interconnected system of electrodes to transduce the response of conductometric sensors (receptors). The active sensing surface can, as a non-limiting example, be made from materials which can be electrochemically deposited, such as conducting polymers. Using an electrochemical approach to deposit sensing material makes it possible to construct sensors which are on the order of a monolayer thick and a few nanometers wide. Such sensors are sensitive to the presence of a few molecules\/nm(sensitivities on the order of fractional parts-per-billion). The output of these sensors are electrical signals, in a voltage range which can be adapted to match the connection strategy. With a high-definition series-parallel configuration, the electrical signal from the sensors can be amplified while keeping the system defect-tolerant.","In one aspect, a nanowire sensor array known as an \u201cin-plane\u201d model is disclosed, comprising a nanowire sensor system where metallic nanowires make up electrical contacts to active sensing surfaces made from conducting polymers. As depicted in , an exemplary sensor system  comprises an array of nine distinct subunits , each occupying an area of one micrometer square. The sensor array has a total footprint of 20 square micrometers. Each subunit  is a nanowire-sensor system with a unique sensing material and overlapping sensor responses to various analytes (stimulus). The nine subunits of sensors with overlapping sensitivity allow for the identification of compounds for which response patterns are known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["102","202","102","204","102","202","206","204"]},"Active sensing surfaces can be fabricated from conducting polymers or conducting polymer composites sensitive to a broad array of organic and inorganic compounds. The modeling component utilizes molecular modeling of analyte-sensor interaction to select materials and simulate array responses. This model is also useful for deconvolving the response pattern of an unknown compound for characterization of that compound.","Electrochemistry of In-Plane Model","In one aspect, as a non-limiting example, an array of nanowire sensors consisting of nine distinct sensing subunits is fabricated by integrating electrochemical processes with lithographic techniques. These electrochemical processes including anodizing alumina nanotemplate, electrodeposition of nanoelectrodes, and electrodeposition of sensing materials (polymerization of conducting polymer, electroplating of metals, co-deposition).

After anodization, the resulting nanopores  are visible within the alumina template . Pore dimensions of 10 nanometers to 200 nanometers can be controlled by adjusting anodizing solution composition and applied current density. Aluminum thin films are preferable because they can be made on a silicon substrate, thus they are integrateable with electronic devices.","In one aspect, prior to anodizing, the aluminum thin film is patterned with parylene using lithography to define sensing sub-units and then anodized to form highly ordered ultra high density alumina nanopores.","The next act is the electrochemical deposition of nanowires, as illustrated in . Nanoelectrodes are fabricated by filling the nanopores  with gold, platinum or other conducting material. Nanowires are formed by electrodeposition. Some of the advantages of electrodeposition include room-temperature and ambient-pressure processing, low energy requirements, fast deposition rates, and inexpensive materials. In one aspect gold and platinum are chosen as materials for the nanoelectrodes for electropolymerization, since they have high chemical stability and good conductivity. Nanowires are grown by immersing the alumina nanotemplates with a gold contact layer into a plating bath. Nanowires grow from the gold contact up through the nanopore.  shows electrodeposited gold nanowires  made in commercially available Whatman Anodisc templates.

Thus, the polymer is not deposited on subunits which are held at an appropriate potential (to protect the surfaces) during the electrodeposition processing. Thus, several distinct subunits, each with a different conducting polymer sensing material, can be created without masking the surface of the substrate. One skilled in the art will appreciate that previously deposited surfaces and bare nanoelectrodes require protection during deposition. Approaches to protection include adjusting the electrolyte composition, adjusting the order in which materials are deposited, holding areas to be protected at open circuit or another potential, and selecting an appropriate material for the nanowires.","Once the sensing surface has been deposited, the electric field is released, allowing the newly deposited sensing surface  to fully form a contact with the nanowires, as illustrated in .","On completion of electodeposition of sensor material,  depicts how the substrate is again flipped and the contact side of the nanowire system is re-sputtered with gold .  depicts the use of E-beam lithographic to pattern the contact layer into series-parallel interconnects .  depicts the resulting subunit (flipped again), complete with the sensor surface , the formed nanowire  and contact layer  below.","Electrochemistry of Cross-Plane Model","In another aspect, the present invention provides a \u201ccross-plane\u201d model of the nanowire sensor array, in which conducting polymer sensor layers are grown within the nanopores between two metallic nanowire contacts on the top and bottom.  depicts the nanowire sensor  created as a cross-plane model, where the conducting polymer sensor layer  lies in the middle of the nanopore , with a metallic contact layer  on the top and bottom. The nanowires are contacted on top and bottom by pattern metallization in a series-parallel fashion for signal amplification and fault-tolerance. In the cross-plane model, the substrate is etched away to expose the surface of each individual sensor layer. The cross-plane model thus allows each nanowire to be an independent sensor and exposes more surface area of the sensor layer.","The present invention discloses a method of fabricating the cross-plane model, as illustrated in . The first five steps of the cross-plane approach are similar to those of the in-plane approach. In the first step, as illustrated in a perspective view in  and in a side-view in , a template  with an aluminum substrate  is patterned and masked using e-Beam lithography, resulting in an exposed anodized aluminum  and nanopores , as depicted in  and . Next, as shown in  and , a patterned metallic contact and interconnect layer with a SiNinsulating layer  is deposited between the aluminum layer  and metal contact layer . The metal contact layer is typically formed of platinum or gold. Next, a thick insulating substrate  is vacuum-deposited to support the entire structure, as illustrated in  and .","Next, as depicted in  and , the metal nanowire  is electrochemically deposited in the nanopores  from a solution of liquid electrolyte.","Now, as illustrated in  and , a conducting polymer sensing layer  is deposited on the nanowire  using electropolymerization. As shown in  and , a second nanowire  is electrochemically deposited on the polymer sensing layer , after which the top nanowire layer  is masked and patterned with e-Beam lithography, as depicted in . In the next step, as illustrated by , the top layer of non-anodized aluminum is selectively etched using HgCl. Finally, as shown in , the alumina substrate is partially removed to preserve the structural integrity of the now-complete subunit of the nanowire sensor array.","(3) Discussion\u2014Controllable Growth of Individually Addressable Nanowires","In this version of the fabrication method, one nanowire is formed with conventional semiconductor processes including metal deposition, dielectric deposition, e-beam lithography, and electrochemical deposition. The present nanowires are stable under ambient air and aqueous environments. The diameter of the nanowire is as small as 80 nm, with a total length of the wire fabricated in this non-limiting example of 5 micrometers. This method can be used to fabricate individual functioning nanowires and could, for example, be used for nanoelectronic devices and sensors.","A procedure has been developed that allows for single wire growth, with a controlled diameter, from patterned channels by e-beam lithography. In the non-limiting example presented here, the synthesis of palladium nanowires of 80 nm diameter with a length of 5 micrometers is shown using a direct growth method between electrodes. Additionally, the synthesis of polypyrrole nanowires of 500 nm can also be demonstrated. The nanowires are fabricated between electrodes using a room temperature, ambient pressure electro-deposition technique. This electro-deposition technique allows the nanowires to be directly fabricated between the electrodes in a channel, eliminating the current need for post assembly, and thus reducing the cost. Additionally, wide ranges of sensing materials, such as metals, alloys, metal oxides, semiconductors, and conducting polymers can easily be fabricated by alternating electrolyte compositions and deposition conditions. The disclosed method allows for controllable growth of an individually addressable nanowire sensor array with wires having a controlled diameter and length.","The processes of cleaning, dry etching, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), lithography, dielectric deposition, e-beam lithography, metallization, and electrochemical deposition are standard semiconductor fabrication techniques. The illustrations in  and  depict a version of the process for fabricating the growth of the nanowire into a sensor array. In a non-limiting example, the silicon substrate  is a silicon wafer with (100) orientation and a thickness of 350 micrometers having \u00b110% variation. The silicon wafers were prepared with standard RCA cleaning (RCA cleaning is named after a cleaning procedure developed by Werner Kern at RCA laboratories). Next, an insulator  is deposited on the silicon wafer. In one aspect, the insulator is one micrometer layer of low-stress silicon nitride (SiN), which is deposited using LPCVD or oxide diffusion. Next, a contact layer  is formed. As a non-limiting example, the contact layer  is a titanium-gold (Ti\u2014Au) metal film deposited using a liftoff technique. Optimally, the thickness of the Ti\u2014Au layer is approximately 3000 \u212b, which has been experimentally shown to given an desirable electric readout.","Next, an electrolyte channel  is fabricated. In one aspect, a thermal silicon oxide (SiO) deposition technique is chosen to fabricate the electrolyte channel due to the advantage of the room-temperature process. The SiO  is deposited on top of the contact layer. The silicon wafer is then patterned. Next, the silicon wafer is e-beam patterned to define the channels with a width of one micron between electrodes, and etched using a reactive-ion etch. Electrochemical deposition is performed by adding a drop of electroplating solution onto a micron channel region on the wafer. As illustrated in , nanowires of palladium (Pd) or polypyrrole  are electrodeposited between the electrodes  using an aqueous solution of Pd. The solution is prepared using Pd(NH)(NO)(10 g\/l), and ammonium sulfamate (100 g\/l) adjusted pH 8.0. The electrodeposition based on Pd-salt solution used produces a one-directional and smooth morphology. Directional and smooth morphology provides the ability to produce narrow nanowires.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1002"]},"(4) Discussion\u2014Ion Milling on Steps (IMOS) for Nanowire Fabrication","The disclosed system and method permits the integration of nanowires with multilayer structures. Nanowires have been fabricated with this technique with diameters as small as a few tens of nanometers and lengths as long as millimeters. Ion-milling is used to produce fine lines along with high-aspect-ratio steps of photoresist or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).","Space missions, including human exploration, require the development of biochemical sensors to find evidence of life on Mars, for diagnosis and treatment of astronauts' emerging disease, and for environmental control and safety monitoring in the spacecraft. The question of the existence of life on Mars and elsewhere, and diagnosis and treatment of astronauts' emerging disease during their mission are a central focus of many of the space missions planned by NASA and other space exploration agencies.","Nanowire-based sensors are ideal candidates to sense amino acids and early molecular signatures of astronauts' emerging disease because nanowire-based sensors exhibit a fast response (<<milliseconds) with a substantially higher sensitivity, <10 \u03bcM, lower power, nanowatts, with a smaller volume than existing sensors.","Semiconductor and metal nanowires and carbon nanotubes have been the subject of intense interest as sensors and electronic devices for high density circuits. The techniques used to fabricate these devices have included using an atomic force microscope to manipulate individual carbon nanotubes onto pre-patterned electrodes, random dispersion of suspended carbon nanotubes in solution onto a substrate with pre-patterned electrodes. While these methods have been adequate for demonstrating the operational characteristics of individual devices, the methods have intrinsic drawbacks of low throughput and limited controllability, which make them unattractive for scaling up for circuits. Attempts to improve fabrication controllability have included applying an electric field for post-growth alignment metal nanowire arrays on a selectively eteched superlattice template followed by manual transfer to the desired substrate, and fludic alignment of semiconductor nanowires on a substrate followed by e-beam lithography to form contacts. Additionally, device fabrication with controllability, reproducibility, and yield suitable for large scale circuits remains a significant challenge.","The disclosed system and method enables fabrication of nanowire sensors with controlled dimensions, positions, and alignments. The disclosed system and method involves sputtering and ion milling on the sidewall of photoresist or (PPMA) steps without using e-beam lithography. This disclosed system and method enables fabrication of multi-layer nanowires with the capability of simultaneously detecting multiple chemical species.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":["FIG. 13A-13E","FIG. 13E","FIG. 14"],"b":["1300","1302","1304","1304","1302","1304","1400"]},"Below is a list of references pertaining to this invention.
