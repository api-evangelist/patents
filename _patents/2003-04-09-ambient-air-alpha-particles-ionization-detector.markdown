title: Ambient air alpha particles ionization detector
abstract: An ionized alpha particle detector to directly measure alpha activity in ambient air that counts alpha pulses instead of measuring radon concentration is provided by an open-air ionization chamber, a means for collecting ions, a voltage source, a charging means and a means for recording alpha pulses. The ionized alpha particle detector allows the user to directly measure the alpha particle activity in ambient air and consequently, better assess the radiological public health risk from alpha particles emitted by inhaled air. The ionized alpha particle detector advantageously overcomes the difficulties in measuring alpha particles caused by oxygen ions that quickly attract electrons and form negative ions that compensate positive charged particles and prevent the formation of alpha particle pulses. The open-air ionization chamber of the ionized alpha particle detector prevents and overcomes the problems, shortcomings, drawbacks and limitations caused by oxygen ions by generating alpha pulses that can be readily detected. The present invention also provides an ionized alpha particle detector system and a method for detecting ionized alpha particles to directly measure alpha activity in ambient air.

Monitoring airborne energetic alpha particles would be extremely useful because air containing alpha particles is considered to be unhealthy and a possible cause of lung cancer. While making such measurements is highly desirable and very useful, those skilled in the art realize that this is a difficult task to accomplish because of the properties of oxygen in air. Air contains oxygen, which is an electron positive gas that allows oxygen ions to quickly attract electrons to become negative ions.","Public health officials, the Environmental Protection Agency and related federal and state agencies believe that adverse health effects, including lung cancer, can be induced from the inhaling air containing contamination-emitting alpha particles. Based on this widespread belief, a direct measurement of alpha activity in the ambient air is the best approach of assessing the threat to the general public. Up until now, the general approach for assessing this serious health risk has been to measure the Radon content in air instead of the number of alpha particles in units of disintegrations per minute per liter (dpm) of air. Measuring alpha particles in dpm 1of air is a much more important and meaningful parameter because the potential energy deposited in lung tissue can be determined from this measurement. The current commercial radon measurement technique is to collect radon in a charcoal filter that is sent to a laboratory where the gamma ray emission is counted and correlated with the equivalent number of picoCuries per liter (pCi l) of alpha particles in ambient air. Another procedure is to use a gamma ray counter to measure radon activity directly at the site. Such commercial procedures require placing a charcoal canister within a home or commercial building for a week, then sending the sample to a laboratory for testing and waiting for the test results. This technique suffers from a number of serious drawbacks and is considered inadequate. One significant disadvantage with this approach is that radon concentration is only proportional to potentially harmful alpha emitters in those cases where secular equilibrium of radon with its daughter products exists, or is at least a fixed fraction. In practice, this is never the case, because this equilibrium varies between 10% and 90% depending on location and time. Directly measuring the radon activity on site is a better approach but it still has the same disadvantage. Other shortcomings with the current radon concentration approach are that other natural sources of alpha particle activity such as Thorium and Uranium are not included in the radon measurements and none of the commercial measurements procedures are made in real time.","Thus there has been a long-felt need for a timely, accurate and inexpensive way to monitor energetic alpha particles found in ambient air. This invention provides a device to directly measure the alpha activity in ambient air with an open air ionization chamber that counts alpha pulses, and will fulfill the long-felt need for a timely, accurate and inexpensive way to monitor energetic alpha particles found in ambient air and improve the assessment of the serious public health risk, without suffering from any of the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art devices.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an ambient air alpha particle ionization detector that measures alpha particles in ambient air.","It is another object of the present invention to provide an ambient air ionization chamber that measures alpha particles in ambient air by counting alpha pulses.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide an ambient air ionization chamber that includes an open-air ionization chamber and measures alpha particles in ambient air by counting alpha pulses.","These and other objects and advantages can now attained by this invention's ionized alpha particle detector to directly measure alpha activity in ambient air. Measuring individual, energetic alpha particles in ambient air is a difficult process because air contains oxygen, which is an electron positive gas. That is, oxygen ions quickly attract electrons to become negative ions and these ions compensate positive charged particles that prevent the formation of alpha particle pulses. In order to overcome this problem, the present invention provides an ionized alpha particle detector that counts alpha pulses, comprising an open-air ionization chamber, a means for collecting ions, a voltage source, a charging means and a means for recording alpha pulses. Up until now, those skilled in the art believed that an ionization chamber could not measure individual alpha pulses in ambient air because of the behavior of oxygen ions that prevented forming alpha pulses. However, this invention's ionized alpha particle detector has solved that problem by providing an open-air ionization chamber that allows the user to directly measure the alpha particle activity in ambient air and consequently, better asses the radiological public health risk from alpha particles emitted by inhaled air, without suffering from any of the disadvantages, shortcomings and limitations of prior art measurement devices.","This invention's ionized alpha particle detector invention counts alpha pulses instead of measuring radon concentration. The ambient air alpha particle ionization detector of the present invention, comprises an open-air ionization chamber, a means for collecting ions, a voltage source, a means for charging and a means for recording alpha pulses to advantageously overcome the difficulties in measuring alpha particles caused by oxygen ions that quickly attract electrons to become negative ions compensating positive charged particles and preventing the formation of alpha particle pulses. This invention's ionization chamber prevents and overcomes those problems, shortcomings, drawbacks and limitations by generating alpha pulses that can be readily detected.","Referring now to , which is a cross-sectional view of the ionized alpha particle detector , which comprises an open-air ionization chamber , a means for collecting ions , a voltage source , a charging means  and an alpha pulse recording means, indicated by box . The chamber  is a cylinder further comprising an interior wall , an insulation layer  and an outer RF shield , with the insulation layer  sandwiched between the interior wall  and outer RF shield .

The amount of electrical charges created by the charging means  is directly proportional to the intensity of the alpha particles in the ambient air. The alpha particles in the ambient air, the charging means , the ion collection means  and the alpha pulse recording means  interact so that the charging means  provides an alpha pulse count output  to the alpha pulse recording means , which can be a strip-chart-recorder that records the alpha particle pulses as a function of time to yield the number of alpha particles versus time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"A number of variations of the present invention are possible.

The chamber  can be configured to hold an active volume of 0.5 liters of ambient air.
